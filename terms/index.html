      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forum Owner's Rights and Responsibilities.</strong>
        Forum Owners have additional capabilities and responsibilities in regard
        to the members and Content of a Forum. The Owner of a Forum decides whether
        a Forum is restricted to certain members or accessible to the public
        generally, and the Owner may change the access to the Forum at any time.
        In restricted Forums, the Owner decides who may be a member of the Forum
        and can access and change the membership list in his or her sole discretion.
        A Forum Owner may, at any time, transfer his or her ownership of a forum
        to another sgForums.com user. In regard to Content, a Forum Owner shall
        be responsible for the maintenance and monitoring of the Content in the
        Forum, including deleting any Forum, Content or archived Content at any
        time and in his or her discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forum Owners Must Mark Sexually Explicit Content.</strong>
        If you create a Forum
        containing sexually explicit Content that is not suitable for minors,
        you agree to mark the Forum as such. If your Forum contains Content that
        is sexually explicit and you do not mark the Forum appropriately, Jeyel
        shall have the right to delete your Forum, including all messages Posted
        to that Forum.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jeyel's Rights.</strong>
        You acknowledge that Jeyel does not pre-screen, control,
        edit or endorse Content made available through the Service and has no
        obligation to monitor the Content Posted via the Service. If Jeyel discovers
        Content that does not appear to conform to the Terms of Service, Jeyel may
        investigate and determine in good faith and in its sole discretion whether
        to remove the Content. Jeyel will have no liability or responsibility
        for performance or non-performance of such activities. You acknowledge
        that certain Forums available through the Service are available only
        through the Service and others are available both through the Service
        and other sources, such as Usenet, over which Jeyel has absolutely no
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Content Removal and Archiving.</strong>
        If you are not the Owner of a Forum, you
        may (1) request removal of a message that you have Posted yourself or
        (2) prevent archival of your message. (For more information about preventing
        archival, please see our<a href='/info/faq'>FAQ</a>.
        You agree to resolve directly and exclusively with third parties any
        disputes you may have about messages that they posted or you may contact
        the Forum Owner to request a removal. In this regard, you understand
        that Jeyel does not monitor or control the content of information Posted
        by others, and instead simply provides a service by allowing users to
        access information that has been made available.

        These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with
        the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict
        of laws provisions or your actual state or country of residence. The
        parties agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of
        the courts located in the County of Santa Clara, California. If for any
        reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion
        of the Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect. You shall not assign these
        Terms of Service or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder,
        in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without
        our prior written consent. Any such purported assignment or delegation
        will be null and void and of no force or effect.

      <p>
        Without limiting the foregoing, under no circumstances shall Jeyel be
        held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly
        or indirectly from acts of nature, forces, or causes beyond its reasonable
        control, including, without limitation, Internet failures, computer equipment
        failures, telecommunication equipment failures, other equipment failures,
        electrical power failures, strikes, labor disputes, riots, insurrections,
        civil disturbances, shortages of labor or materials, fires, floods, storms,
        explosions, acts of God, war, governmental actions, orders of domestic
        or foreign courts or tribunals, non-performance of third parties, or
        loss of or fluctuations in heat, light, or air conditioning.

      <p>
        These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Jeyel
        with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and replace
        all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or
        oral, regarding such subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of the
        Terms of Service by a party will be effective only if in writing and signed
        by a party.
