            <div class='col-md body'>Great, Firstly I Must Thank You Guys For Visiting. Firstly Why Im Forming Such An Organisation Is Too Bring Together All Those Aimless Writers Whom Have Great Talent But Would Never Be Heard Of. The Opportunities In Singapore Are Slim, The Most Famous Local Writers Everyone Has Heard Of Is Either Catherine Lim Or Russell Of Angsana Books.<br><br>But What Is Writing Really? Writing Is A Skill, Just Like Any Other Skill It Has To Be Practised And Worked. When You First Start Driving, There Were So Many Things To Keep Track Of! How Could You Keep Your Eyes On The Road And Check The Rear Viewmirror And Switch On The Headlights And Check The Speedometer And Watch For Traffic Coming From The Intersection To Your Right? But Eventually You Learnt How To Drive Didn't You? Suddenly Instead Of Focusing On All The Seperate Detail you Were Able To Make Everything Come Together. You Could Even Relax And Enjoy The Sights Along The Way. What Made The Difference? It Was Just Practise. After Changing Lanes A Few Hundred Times, Or So Many Times, It Seemed So Easy, Even Automatic. Partly, Too, The Difference Is In Your Own Sense Of Mastery. You Eventually Came To Believe You Were A Good Driver.<br><br>You Can Do THe Same With Writing. Even If Sitting Down To Write Feels Like Heading Into A Rainstorm, You Will Often Surprise Yourself by enjoying The Landscape Once You Have Actually Gotten Your Bearings And Have Started On Your Writing Journey.<br><br>We Help You Do That, Not Trying To Teach You How To Write, Although We Would Offer You Advice, The Style You Write And The Way You Portray Is Your Own. We Just Help You Get Thorugh It With Some Help. Just Join Us Today = O)<br><br>Oh Yeah One More Thing, We Have Meetings Too Probably Talk Over A Coffee To Even Christmas Parties And Get Togethers Just Join Us. You Can Add Me On Msn At liexum@hotmail.com Or Just Send An Sms To 91384644... By The Way Im Shawn Its A Pleasure To Meet You All And Rest Assured We Grow Togther.
