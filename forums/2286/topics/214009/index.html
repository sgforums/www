            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong><a href="http://www.digital-karma.org/culture/quotes/famous-peoples-last-words" rel="nofollow">Last words of famous people</a></strong><br><br>Samples:<br><br><strong>Pompadour, Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, Marquise d'Etoiles (1721-1764)</strong><br>"Wait a second."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Madame de Pompadour was a lady of the French court and mistress to Louis XV. She was a major influence on French politics of the mid-18th century. As she died, Madame de Pompadour called on God to "Wait a second." When He did, she quickly applied rouge to her cheeks.</span><br><br><strong>Caesar, Julius Gaius (100-44 B.C.)</strong><br>"You too, Brutus?"<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Although Marcus Junius Brutus was a trusted young friend of Caesar's, he was also one of the conspirators who murdered him on the Ides of March in 44 B.C. When Caesar entered the Senate that day, all of the senators stood to show respect. Some of the conspirators snuck behind Caesar's chair while others moved forward as if to greet him. As one grabbed Caesar's robe to signal the beginning of the attack, another struck a glancing blow to his neck. Each of the attackers then bared their knives and closed around Caesar in a tightening circle. Caesar attempted to fight the assassins until he saw his trusted friend, Brutus, approach dagger in hand. In surprised resignation Caesar uttered his famous last words, fell to the floor, and pulled his robe up over his face. Brutus then stabbed Caesar in the groin and all of the attackers joined in. In the frenzy, Caesar was pushed against a statue of his old enemy, Pompey, which soon became drenched in blood. All told, the attackers stabbed Caesar twenty-three times.<br><br>Most people know that the Latin translation of "You too, Brutus?" is "Et tu, Brute?" and many will recall that in Shakespeare's play, the bard adds a final English sentence to these Latin words, "Then fall, Caesar!" However, some have suggested that the famous phrase was probably spoken--if it was spoken at all--in the Greek that was commonly used by Roman officials. The Greek version of Caesar's last words is "Kai su, teknon?" or "You too, my son?"</span><br><br><strong>Chaplin, Charles (1889-1977)</strong><br>"Why not? After all, it belongs to him."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Charlie Chaplin was a British actor who became a Hollywood star after joining with Max Sennet during a music hall tour of the United States in 1913. He is usually remembered for his silent picture roles as a little man with a mustache wearing a baggy suit and derby. Many consider Chaplin to be cinema's greatest comedian. When the priest, who was attending him on his deathbed, said "May the Lord have mercy on your soul," Chaplin quickly replied, "Why not? After all, it belongs to him."</span></div>
