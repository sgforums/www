            <div class='col-md body'>A 27-year-old man described as one of the world's most prolific spammers was arrested Wednesday, and federal authorities said <strong>computer users across the Web could notice a decrease in the amount of junk e-mail.</strong><br><br>Robert Alan Soloway is accused of using networks of compromised "zombie" computers to send out millions upon millions of spam e-mails.<br><br>"He's one of the top 10 spammers in the world," said Tim Cranton, a Microsoft Corp. lawyer who is senior director of the company's Worldwide Internet Safety Programs. "He's a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day."<br><br>A federal grand jury last week returned a 35-count indictment against Soloway charging him with mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering.<br><br>Soloway pleaded not guilty Wednesday afternoon to all charges after a judge determined that Â— even with four bank accounts seized by the government Â— he was sufficiently well off to pay for his own lawyer.<br><br>He has been living in a ritzy apartment and drives an expensive Mercedes convertible, said prosecutor Kathryn Warma. Prosecutors are seeking to have him forfeit $773,000 they say he made from his business, Newport Internet Marketing Corp.<br><br>A public defender who represented him for Wednesday's hearing declined to comment.<br><br>Prosecutors say Soloway used computers infected with malicious code to send out millions of junk e-mails since 2003. The computers are called "zombies" because owners typically have no idea their machines have been infected.<br><br>He continued his activities even after Microsoft won a $7 million civil judgment against him in 2005 and the operator of a small Internet service provider in Oklahoma won a $10 million judgment, prosecutors said.<br><br>U.S. Attorney Jeff Sullivan said Wednesday that the case is the first in the country in which federal prosecutors have used identity theft statutes to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else's Internet domain name. Soloway could face decades in prison, though prosecutors said they have not calculated what guideline sentencing range he might face.<br><br>The investigation began when the authorities began receiving hundreds of complaints about Soloway, who had been featured on a list of known spammers kept by The Spamhaus Project, an international anti-spam organization.<br><br>The Santa Barbara County, Calif., Department of Social Services said it was spending $1,000 a week to fight the spam it was receiving, and other businesses and individuals complained of having their reputations damaged when it appeared spam was originating from their computers.<br><br>"This is not just a nuisance. This is way beyond a nuisance," Warma said.<br><br>Soloway used the networks of compromised computers to send out unsolicited bulk e-mails urging people to use his Internet marketing company to advertise their products, authorities said.<br><br>People who clicked on a link in the e-mail were directed to his Web site. There, Soloway advertised his ability to send out as many as 20 million e-mail advertisements over 15 days for $495, the indictment said.<br><br>The Spamhaus Project rejoiced at his arrest.<br><br>"Soloway has been a long-term nuisance on the Internet Â— both in terms of the spam he sent, and the people he duped to use his spam service," organizers wrote on Spamhaus.org.<br><br>Soloway remained in federal detention pending a hearing Monday.<br><br><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070531/ap_on_hi_te/spam_arrest" rel="nofollow">Source</a></div>
