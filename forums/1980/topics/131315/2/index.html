            <div class='col-md body'>TIE Raptor<br><br>Exclusive to the forces of Warlord Zsinj, and not truly a SFS design. The most distinctive feature of this fighter is the absence of wing pylons and the direct attachment of radiator panels to the cockpit ball. The total area of panels is also very low; this is probably a low-power fighter. There may be other disadvantages and shortcomings, such as reduced flight range. Perhaps the design reflects Zsinj's ruthlessness, making serious concessions to pilot safety. For example, the compactness may come at the price of exposing pilots to dangerous radioactive emissions.<br><br>The illustrations in Cracken's Threat Dossier are problematic. They only show signs of two of the four laser cannons described in the text. The weapons would more plausibly be mounted on wingtips similar to those of the TIE Phantom or TIE Interceptor.<br><br><img src="http://www.cswu.cz/shiptech/fighters/raptor/raptor.jpg"><br><br>TIE Crawler<br><br>In the wreckage-strewn battlefield of Coruscant in Dark Empire there sits the remains of a TIE-related ground vehicle, called a "TIE crawler" or tank. The vehicle lacks engines for flight and it lacks radiator panels. The wings are replaced by wide surface-traction treads. Only the hull module appears to be related to the TIE spacecraft. Therefore it is outside the scope of this page.<br><br><img src="http://www.starwars.com/databank/vehicle/tiecrawler/img/eu_bg.jpg"><br><br>TIE Tri-fighters<br><br>Pirate forces in I, Jedi use TIE-based fighters with a threefold wing symmetry. They are nicknamed "tri-fighters". or "clutches" for the way in which the wings resemble a hand clutching the cockpit ball. The "tri-fighters" possess minimal shields.<br><br>The novel indicates that they're customised fighters, though it is not clear what the extent of the customisation is. They could be full-blown uglies, but their resemblence to the TIE Phantom and Sentinel may mean that the hull and wings are original, with the modifications being of a minor nature. A fan-created model of a TIE Phantom is labelled a "tri-fighter" in an article in STAR WARS Galaxy Collector, but whether this reflects the official intention or fan speculation is not yet clear.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TIE "uglies"<br><br>Many TIE-based pirate fighters that were definite uglies were seen in the X-Wing: Masquerade and X-Wing: Family Ties comic series. Noteworthy examples include X-TIEs which appear to have TIE Avenger wings. If so, this is the first time any part of a TIE Avenger has been shown in the comics. A more common type of ugly consisting of TIE hull and Y-wing engines is significant because it uses the hull of the TIE with extended tail.<br><br><img src="http://www.cswu.cz/shiptech/fighters/xtie/xtie.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.theforce.net/swtc/Pix/comics/xwing/uglies3.jpg"><br><br>[X-Wing: Alliance vessels]<br><br>The new computer game X-Wing: Alliance is reported to contain several previously unseen TIE models. developed under the supervision of Admiral Zaarin as prototypes in a program involving fighter drones.<br><br>Twin hull spheroids on either side of a single radiator panel, with one pod being the cockpit and the other carrying a turbolaser cannon.<br>Interceptor with large missile launchers mounted on the wing hubs between the forward blades.<br>Ordinary TIE fighter with weapons mounted on the wing hubs.<br>Bent-wing suicide fighter (perhaps a light a ramship?) with a single long hull pod similar to the cockpit pod of a TIE Bomber.<br>TIE Fighter with a booster engine attached.<br><br><img src="http://www.cswu.cz/shiptech/fighters/tiem1/tiem1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.cswu.cz/shiptech/fighters/tiem2/tiem2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.cswu.cz/shiptech/fighters/tiem3/tiem3.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.cswu.cz/shiptech/fighters/tiem4/tiem4.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.cswu.cz/shiptech/fighters/tiem5/tiem5.jpg"><br><br>TIE Striker<br><br>The Sienar Fleet Systems TIE Striker is by far the largest TIE model ever produced. It was originally produced to replace the aging, and inadequate TIE Bomber models which had served with the Imperial Navy for many years. The most significant feature on the TIE Striker is the dual cockpits. The addition of the second navigation/gunner cockpit allowed the pilot to focus on flying the spacecraft. This was due to the large mass of the TIE Striker and its poor handling (similar to TIE Bombers).<br><br>What it lacks in speed, it more than makes up for in firepower. Like most TIE Bombers, it is equipped with two lasers for defensive purposes. The main weapon, however is the quad array of projectile launchers which allow the TIE Striker to carry up to 32 concussion missiles, or 16 torpedos. Capable of firing 4 torpedos at a time, the TIE Striker can inflict damage twice as quickly as the TIE Bomber, which suits its purpose as a frontline hit-and-run bomber. It's quick payload delivery ensures that it can destroy its target and escape with minimal damage.<br><br><img src="http://www.cswu.cz/shiptech/fighters/striker/striker.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sith Infiltrator<br><br>The second trailer for The Phantom Menace shows a vessel that is reminiscent of the SFS TIE series starships. As it flies past camera towards the planet Tatooine, we see a slender blade-like fuselage, with a spherical bulb at the aft end. The bulb has a much greater diameter than the equivalent section of a TIE vessel, as shown when Darth Maul descended the boarding ramp onto the Tatooine sands. Assuming that the portal is two metres high, the bulb diameter is no less than 4.9m. Therefore this is not a merely fighter-sized ship. This is consistent with the length of 26.5m given in Episode I: Incredible Cross Sections and copied in other sources such as the Episode I Insider's Guide, corresponding to a diameter of just over 5m.<br><br>On either side of the sphere there are two bent wings with a TIE-like form mounted on pylons. The wing panels are hinged so that they fold down towards their pylons in landing mode. The most remarkable thing about the wings is that there aren't visibly dark radiator areas, at least on the inner surfaces. However there are raised areas on both the inner and outer wing surfaces that resemble the size and depth of TIE radiators. It is possible that the radiators are covered by a heat-permeable film matching the tone of the rest of the hull. The diagrams in Episode I: Incredible Cross Sections indicate that this is indeed the case. The omission of equivalent radiator covers on later Imperial TIEs may be a sign of a more functional and minimalist design fashion.<br><br>The two ion engine nozzles are in positions corresponding to those of a TIE, but they are broad and cigar-shaped instead of compact and circular. The engine glow is a peculiar yellow-blue, which suggests the presence of small and closely spaced sub-elements alternating in temperature between five thousand degrees celcius and several thousand degrees higher. (Purely green thermal emission is impossible.) The Phantom Menace movie does indeed show a grille inside the engines. The simulated aural sensor signature [refer to Astrophysical Concerns: Sound in Space] is very similar to that of a TIE fighter, which supports the theory that the reactor or parts of the engines are similar in design.<br><br>The published statistics for the Infiltrator's hyperdrive are quite surprising: a class of 3.0. For a ship this slow to travel between the Outer Rim and the Core within just a few days or less, as demonstrated in The Phantom Menace, the baseline speed of hyperspace travel in the absence of obstacles must be considerably faster than the lower limits determined in the Hyperspace commentary. Perhaps an average ship's endurance or the pilot's astrogation skill are the critical attributes that isolate of Rim worlds like Tatooine, rather than ship's hyperdrive acceleration capabilities. Of course Darth Maul was a pilot with very unusual capabilities.<br><br><img src="http://www.theforce.net/swtc/Pix/trailer/maulship1.jpg"></div>
