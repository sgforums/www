Qui-Gon was a rebellious jedi who seldom listened to the council of the Jedi, a group of weathered master jedi who acted a peace keeping unit in the Galactic Republic. The Republic was generally peaceful except where there was a trade dispute on the planet of Naboo. Qui-Gon and Obi-wan were sent to the planet to settle the disagreement between the trade federation and the people of Naboo. But there was to be no negotiations, the Sith Lord instigated the trade federation to attack the Planet. Qui-Gon and Obi-wan's mission was to save the Queen Amidala of Naboo and take her to the Capital Planet of Corusant for safty.<br><br>While rescuing the Queen, the ship they were flying in was damaged badly and needed repair. The ship landed on Tatoonie to get the needed parts. But they lacked the funds necessary to buy the parts. Qui-Gon befriended a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker who exhibited the force in magnitude. Anakin entered a pod race to win the parts for Qui-Gon and won his freedom as well. With the ship fixed, they took the Queen to Corusant, but before they left Naboo, they ran into a sith jedi, Darth Maul, the right hand man for the future emperor.<br><br>The Queen reaches the safty of Corusant and informs the galactic Senate about the attacks on her planet. The Queen returns to her planet with her companions of Qui-Gon, Obi-wan, and young Anakin to try to win her planet back. The planet rises against the trade federation and defeats them. The win is not flawless. Darth Maul finds the Qui-Gon and Obi-wan. They engage in a fierce light saber battle and the only man left standing is Obi-wan. Qui-gin's dying request to his student is to train Anakin, for he is the chosen one. Obi-wan agrees even against the Jedi Council's wishes.<br><br></div>
