The higher the level the quicker the time healing. No one may heal themselves in a day from the Force.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Control Pain </span><br>Control pain lets a jedi / dark jedi continue a task despite great pain<br>Difficulty: Adept for small pains, higher the level the less the pain is reduced and the greater the pain that can be dealt with.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Detoxify Poison</span><br>Allows you to detoxify poison in yourself or someone nearby<br>Difficulty: Adept to start, for very complicated poisons Knights and Masters.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Enhance Attribute</span><br>Enhance attribute increases a basic skill, i.e. jumping, running, acrobatics<br>Difficulty: Knight<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hibernation Trance</span><br>Sends a force user into a hibernation where their body needs less attention.<br>Difficulty: Adept<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Instinctive Astrogation Control </span><br>Allows a force user to "feel" their way through hyperspace, and to plot courses<br>Difficulty: Adept<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Reduce Injury</span><br>Similar to Accelerate healing, except reduces extent of injury, doesn't actually heal<br>Difficulty: Adept for sprains etc., Knight and above for more serious injuries.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Remain Conscious</span><br>Allows you to remain conscious when wounds normally would incapacitate you<br>Difficulty: Knight<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Resist Stun</span><br>Allows you to resist a stun blast<br>Difficulty: Knight<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Short-term Memory Enhancement</span><br>Very useful tool for remembering the exact details of a recent memory<br>Difficulty: Adept<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Shields of the Force</span>:<br>The Ability to raise a defensive Force Shield.<br>Difficulty: Shields can defend against Energy attacks and other physical attacks. It cannot last for very long however. In combat a Force User may raise it as a reflex against Saber attacks. A Knight can block a saber attack but not be able to raise a shield again during combat. Masters would be able to raise their shield again in battle at some point and take another hit from a saber after taking one already, being able to take a total of 2 attacks before they lost their abilities to block saber attacks. Often when this is done, some form of damage is also done to the person raising the shield. A very direct attack with a saber may kill someone regardless of a shield. For instance, a saber attacking a hand or neck or feet will do damage and probably cut the thing in half because the force shield would block the saber but not stop it. An attack aimed at a shoulder would probably be blocked but the shoulder would be cut. Another use of the power, when some other attack is suspected, and a shield is raised to defend against something such as shrapnel etc., a Knight may raise a shield to defend against it. Depending on the type of attack, they will take damage. They cannot raise another shield after this until they rest some way. Another use for a Force Shield is raising a small one to block blaster attacks, a Knight may raise a small force shield the size of a hand to block blaster attacks, A Force User will eventually tire though and cannot defend against blasters for ever.<br><br></div>

For things a bit larger an Adept would have to concentrate. Things like Blasters and Lightsabers come a bit quicker and concentrations isn't required much and tiny rocks etc. move easily. Knights can bring small items like lightsabers etc. quickly without concentration, large rocks and heavy machines like a droid would require moderate concentration, something several hundred pounds would require concentration. Heavy things can be pushed with the Force much easier now as well. Masters can lift people and large rocks and droids fairly easily, while fairly heavy things would require a great deal of concentration. The most powerful Masters can lift people, large rocks and droids very easily and move things under a thousand pounds with a fair amount of concentration. Heavy things such as Star Fighters may be lifted with great concentration. Note: A Force User cannot levitate another Force User of the same strength unless the other Force User allows him too.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Levitation</span>:<br>This power involves using Telekinesis to lift the Force user using the power up above the ground.<br>Difficulty: Varies according to level. Adepts may be able to slightly slow a short fall decreasing injury but not avoiding injury. Knights may be able to slightly increase the effectiveness of a jump or turn a fall backwards into a flip. A Master may be able to levitate himself with much concentration upward but never very far. A powerful Master may be able to levitate himself fairly high with much concentration but small heights very easily. Never can a Force User levitate himself when falling a very great distance.<br><br></div>

This makes the users tangible body go limp, while the life essence of a user moves through the astral plain to view things he cannot see. Unlike mental translocation, in the astral plain, a user can interact with others who use this power. This is a good way to fight duels where one side is notorious for pulling a saber, blaster, or other non force attack. If the corporal body is destroyed, the user is forever trapped on the astral plain...<br><br></div>
