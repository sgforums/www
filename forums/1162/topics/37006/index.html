            <div class='col-md body'>From the very Begining, Gin's family objected strongly on her dating this guy. saying that it has got to do with family background, &amp; that Gin will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him.<br><br>Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrel very often. Tho Gin love the guy deeply, but she always ask him: "How deep is your love for me?"<br><br>As the guy is not good with his words, this often cause Gin to be very upset. With that &amp; the family's pressure, Gin often vent her anger on<br>him. As for him,.... he only endure it in silence.<br><br>After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated &amp; decided to further his studies in overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to Gin: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will you marry me?" she agreed, &amp; with the guy's determination, the family finally gave in &amp; agreed to let them get married. So before he leave, they got engaged.<br><br>Gin went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love thru emails &amp; phone calls. tho it's hard, but both never thot of giving up.<br><br>One day, Gin was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. When she woke up, she saw her parents beside her<br>bed. She realised that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. she' has lost her voice....<br><br>The doctors says that the impact on her brain has caused her to loss her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down. During the stay in hospital, besides silence cry,.. it's still just silence cry that accompanied her.<br><br>Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for the ringing tone of the phone. Which pierced into her heart everytime it rang.<br>She does not wish to let the guy know. &amp; not wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer.<br><br>With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent millions &amp; millions of reply, countless of phone alls,.. all that Gin could do, besides crying, is still crying....<br>The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything &amp; be happy.<br><br>With a new environment, Gin learn sign language &amp; started a new life. Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her fren came &amp; told her that he's back. She asked her fren not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't anymore news of him.<br><br>A year has passed &amp; her fren came with an envelope, containing a invitation card for the guy's wedding.<br><br>Gin was shattered. When she open the letter, she saw her name in it instead. When she was about to ask her fren wat's going on, she saw the guy standing in front of her.<br><br>He used sign language telling her "I've spent a year's time to learn sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that, he slipped the<br>ring back into her finger. Gin finally smiled.<br><br>*Treat every relationship as if it's the last one, then you'll know how to Give<br>**Treat every moment as is it's the last day, then you'll know how to treasure*</div>
