              <p>Welcome to SGPolaroid! Your local community portal for all things that deal with the "original" Polaroid photography!</p>
              <p><strong>A short introduction about the Original Polaroid photography.</strong></p>
              <p>Although idea of instant photography was not new, it was American scientist and entrepreneur Edwin H. Land who first pionneered the perfection of instant photography.</p>
              <p>It all started in the mid-1940s when Edwin Land, who had founded the 
                          Polaroid Corporation in 1937, was on holiday in New Mexico and his 
                          daughter wanted to know why she had to wait to see the photographs he 
                          had just taken. Within an hour Land had sketched out a new camera. By 
                          1947 an instant sepia film and camera were on the market.</p>
              <p>Polaroids
                           have been used for ID cards and passport photos, and by police officers
                           and other investigators to create an unalterable instant photo. They 
                          were also were used by Andy Warhol to make his famous silkscreen 
                          portraits. Polaroid also manufactured a type of instant movie camera, 
                          called Polavision.</p>
              <p>The Polaroid era lasted for approximately 60 years. Instant film cameras
                           were the firm's flagship company's trademark product until 2007 
                          when it stopped making them. And in February 2008 the company announced it 
                          would stop manufacturing its legendary film in favour of digital 
                          photography.</p>
              <p> <strong>Where can I find original Polaroid camera for sale?</strong></p>
              <p>With the exception of the 300 series from the "new" Polaroid Corporation, the older, classic cameras are no longer in production. Your best bet would be in Ebay or local second hand shops here in Singapore. *If anyone has any idea where to find shops stocking up with old polaroid cameras here in singapore please message me so I can update here. Thanks!*</p>
              <p><strong>Where can I find film packs for my classic Polaorid camera?</strong></p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Polaroid too had ceased production for all its integral film packs in 2005. You can still find them at inflated prices around ebay.  However, a group called itself "The Impossible project" started producing new types of integral film packs for these cameras using old polaroid machines that were destined to be scrapped. You can buy film packs from them at their online shop www.the-impossible-project.com</p>

              <p>Sure, digital may be convenient and fast, but instant cameras 
                  where so much more.... Well... They had more heart! A Polaroid 
                  photograph is born into existence the moment it materializes in front of
                   our very eyes. It then is never gone! It always exists and will always 
                  share itself as a memory whether it be at the bottom of a trash can, or 
                  on a corkboard pinned up somewhere.</p>
