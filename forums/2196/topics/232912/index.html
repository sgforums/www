            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Ten-man Fulham claimed a 1-1 draw with Tottenham at Craven Cottage.<br><br>Despite having Heidar Helguson sent off early in the second half, Fulham went ahead through a Vincenzo Montella penalty.<br><br>Spurs, who were way off the pace all day, salvaged a point with just minutes left when Pascal Chimbonda scrambled the ball home.<br><br>A turgid opening to the game did not see a clear opportunity to arrive until just before the half hour mark.<br><br>It came for the recalled Anthony Gardener as Tom Huddlestone swung a cross into the box but from six yards the one-time England international headed over.<br><br>A minute later Fulham themselves could have gone ahead. Franck Queudrue found Carlos Bocanegra at the back post - his pass inside came to Helguson, but his attempted flick could not beat Robinson.<br><br>The game at times threatened to boil over with former Fulham star Steed Malbranque the aggressor and victim on more than one occasion.<br><br>He was booked just before the break, after Helguson had already been carded for a crude challenge on him.<br><br>Fulham were looking the far more likely and finished the half on a high, but they could not find the lead - although they should have, as Spurs had Robinson to thank as he somehow reacted to Brian McBride's close-range effort to keep it all square.<br><br>The beginning of the second half was mirroring the first with neither side able to dominate the midfield, which led to few chances.<br><br>As it had threatened to do in the first half, tempers overflowed and Helguson saw red for a second booking - although television replays suggest he made minimal, if any, contact with Huddlestone, who went to ground dramatically.<br><br>Martin Jol knew something needed to be done and with an extra man, he brought on both Aaron Lennon and Robbie Keane as he chased the game.<br><br>Despite being a man down, Chris Coleman refused to be negative as Montella and debutant Clint Dempsey were introduced for The Cottagers.<br><br>But the extra man began to tell in the final ten minutes with Spurs looking to get Lennon more and more involved - but to no avail, as Fulham took the lead.<br><br>It came from the penalty spot as Montella dispatched with great aplomb after Michael Dawson had nudged McBride's shot wide with his arm.<br><br>Spurs immediately had their own claim for a penalty turned down as Ian Pearce slid in to deny Berbatov.<br><br>Jol's side were left with little option but to throw everything at Fulham and it paid off as Chimbonda struck. A long ball into the box fell for the French full-back, the home side did not react and the ex-Wigan man fired into the corner - although Jan Lastuvka would have been disappointed not to keep it out.<br><br>Both sides had chances in the final minutes, but the draw was a fair result - although Coleman will be able to take much more than Jol from the performance of his side. </span></div>
