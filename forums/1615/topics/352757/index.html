            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">20 tips for permanent weight loss<br></span>Permanent weight loss — These 20 ideas can help you keep the pounds off for good.<br><br></strong><em>From MayoClinic.com</em><br><br>Weight maintenance is much like weight loss. The principles are essentially the same: Eat healthy foods, control your portion sizes and exercise regularly. And to keep the pounds off permanently, you need to incorporate the new, healthy behaviors into your routine so that they become a natural part of your daily life.<br><br>Here are 20 ideas to reinforce your healthy lifestyle and to keep you committed to permanent weight loss.<br><br><strong>1. Exercise 30 to 60 minutes each day.</strong> <br>If time is limited, exercise for several brief periods throughout the day — for example, three 10-minute sessions rather than one 30-minute session.<br><br><strong>2. Eat three healthy meals during the day, including a good breakfast.</strong> <br>Skipping meals causes increased hunger and may lead to excessive snacking.<br><br><strong>3. Focus on fruits and vegetables. </strong><br>Top off your morning cereal with sliced strawberries or bananas. Stir berries or peaches in yogurt or cottage cheese. Liven up your sandwiches with vegetables, such as tomato, lettuce, onion, peppers and cucumber.<br><br><strong>4. Weigh yourself regularly.</strong><br>Monitoring your weight can tell you whether your efforts are working and can help you detect small weight gains before they become even larger.<br><br><strong>5. Don't keep comfort foods in the house.</strong><br>If you tend to eat high-fat, high-calorie foods when you're upset or depressed or bored, don't keep them around. Availability of food is one of the strongest factors in determining how much a person eats.<br><br><strong>6. Plan a family activity.</strong><br>Get the family together to go for a bike ride, play disc golf or kick the ball around in the yard.<br><br><strong>7. Eat healthy foods first.</strong><br>Eat foods that are healthy and low in calories first so that when it comes time to enjoy your favorites — sweets or junk food, for example — you won't be so hungry.<br><br><strong>8. Pay attention to portions.</strong><br>Serve meals already dished onto plates instead of placing serving bowls on the table. Take slightly less than what you think you'll eat. You can always have seconds, if really necessary.<br><br><strong>9. Create opportunities to be active.</strong><br>Wash your car at home instead of going to the car wash. Bike or walk to the store. Participate in your kid's activities at the playground or park.<br><br><strong>10. Sit down together for family meals.</strong><br>Avoid eating in front of the television. TV viewing strongly affects how much and what people eat.<br><br><strong>11. See what you eat.</strong><br>Eating directly from a container gives you no sense of how much you're eating. Seeing food on a plate or in a bowl keeps you aware of how much you're eating.<br><br><strong>12. Vary your activities.</strong><br>Regularly change your activity routine to avoid exercise burnout. Walk a couple of days, swim another and go for a bike ride on the weekend. Seek out new activities — karate, ballroom dancing, cross-country skiing, tennis or Pilates.<br><br><strong>13. De-stress your day.</strong><br>Stress can cause you to eat more. Develop strategies that can help you relax when you find yourself becoming stressed. Exercise, deep breathing, muscle relaxation techniques and even a good laugh can ease stress.<br><br><strong>14. Eat at home.</strong><br>People eat more food in restaurants than at home. Limit how often you eat at restaurants. If you do eat out, decide what and how much you're going to eat before you start and have the rest boxed to go.<br><br><strong>15. Plan healthy snacks.</strong><br>The best snacks include fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products. Fruit smoothies, sliced fresh fruit and yogurt, whole-grain crackers, and carrot and celery sticks with peanut butter are all good choices.<br><br><strong>16. Start your day with a high-fiber breakfast cereal</strong>,<br>such as bran flakes, shredded wheat or oatmeal. Opt for cereals with "bran" or "fiber" in the name. Or add a few tablespoons of unprocessed wheat bran to your favorite cereal.<br><br><strong>17. Walk for 10 minutes over your lunch hour</strong><br>or get up a few minutes earlier in the morning and go for a short walk.<br><br><strong>18. Plan a week's worth of meals at a time.</strong><br>Make a detailed grocery list to eliminate last-minute trips to the grocery store and impulse buys.<br><br><strong>19. Look for a distraction when you're fighting a craving.</strong><br>Call a friend, put on music and dance or exercise, clean the house, pull weeds in your garden, or run an errand. When your mind is occupied with something else, the cravings quickly go away.<br><br><strong>20. Reward yourself.</strong><br>Losing weight and keeping the pounds off is a major accomplishment. Celebrate your success with nonfood rewards, such as new clothes or an outing with friends.</p></div>

              <p><span style="color: #008080;">Some time in the last century, “thin” ceased to be the realm of the mealy-mouthed peasant, and became a sign of well-bred restraint. Early 20th century diet supplements included strong laxatives, purgatives, arsenic and strychnine. <br>  In the 21st century, weight loss is still a hot topic. Self-help sections are hives of neurotic activity, as read-yourself-thins thumb through tomes of contradictory dietary advice: High protein; low carb; low fat; low calorie; high calcium; high fiber; time of meals; vegetarian; all meat; raw food; the list goes on. To remind us just how silly miracle diets are, we celebrate the consistently ridiculous diet advice from around the world and through the last two decades. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Atkins <br>(first published 1972; popular in the late ’80s)</strong><br>Hmm. You smell of ... what is that? Pickled cabbage? Achieve metabolic advantage with this four-phase high-protein diet that eliminates an essential food group. Too good to be true, gourmets and gourmands alike are free to scoff burgers and steaks to their greasy little hearts’ content; secondly, weight-loss is fast and dramatic. You may not know it, but the Atkins diet, also known as the Atkins Nutritional Approach, is a famous low-carb diet created by Dr. Robert Atkins. It is inspired by a diet he read in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>, which he utilized to resolve his own overweight condition after medical school and graduate medical training. He later popularized the Atkins diet in a series of books, starting with <em>Dr. Atkins’ Diet Revolution</em> in 1972.<br><strong>Strange fact:</strong> Chronically low in fruit and vegetables, Atkinsers’ harried livers eventually go into a state known as ketosis, and develop Atkinsmell—the same scent emitted by Diabetics in “red alert” stage. How attractive.<br><strong>Pros: </strong>Drop a size a week for the first month. <br><strong>Cons: </strong>Too many to list. Medics blame the dramatic weight-loss on fluid leaving the body. Other cons include rancid, free radical emitting fat molecules in the bloodstream; constipation; poop-breath; stress on kidneys and bones, and that weird nail polish smell following you around.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Cambridge Food for Life (late ’80s)</strong><br>The Cambridge Diet was the ultimate “miracle cure,” peddled by slick all-round figure-fixer Mark Feather, and his wife and muse, Elain. Its basic premise is that our bodies are unable to properly digest certain food combinations. The solution? To minimize fat absorption by only eating one food group per meal. Never mix the veggies and carbs.<br><strong>Strange fact: </strong>Other Feather inventions included the Mark II Bust enhancing device, with an ad featuring the line, “The very first time I used Mark II I saw my bust line become rounder and fuller and actually grow three full inches right before my eyes!” <br><strong>Pros: </strong>Uh ... hope?<br><strong>Cons:</strong> Labeled outdated and unhealthy by diet pundits. You can end up with vitamin deficiencies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Herbalife (late ’80s)</strong><br>Based on a rainbow of shakes, “cell-activator” pills, and multivitamins, Herbalife was founded in the mid ’80s by then 24 year-old Mark Hughes. The company mushroomed throughout the ‘90s, thanks to get-rich-quick pyramid schemes. By 2003, they had over one million distributors in 59 countries.<br><strong>Strange fact: </strong>By the age of 44, founder Mark Hughes had died of alcohol and antidepressant overdose.<br><strong>Pros: </strong>Eat what you want for dinner. <br><strong>Cons: </strong>Watch your bank account shrink with your waistline—until you resort to selling your products. Then watch your friendship circle shrink too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Beverly Hills (1994)</strong><br>Completely contradicting the Cambridge Diet, the authors state: “It isn’t what you eat or how much you eat that makes you fat, it is when you eat and what you eat together.” So for 10 days, eat only fruit—and nothing else, windy pants. From days 11-19, mix in a few carbs. After day 20, protein is allowed.<br><strong>Strange fact:</strong> Functional food combinations like papaya help to break fat down while watermelon helps to flush fat out of you.<br><strong>Pros:</strong> Rapid initial weight loss. <br><strong>Cons: </strong>Prepare to feel ... weak ... and … remember … extremely rapid weight loss could be hazardous to your health.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>The Zone (1996)</strong><br>The basic principle of this best seller is your daily caloric intake is 40 percent carbohydrate, 30 percent protein, and 30 percent fat, and it’s all in the timing. Breakfast within an hour of waking up, lunch within five, snack in two, dinner within five, and late night snacks before bed. <br><strong>Strange fact:</strong> Jennifer Aniston and Sandra Bullock are high-profile Zone losers.<br><strong>Pros: </strong>Accelerates fat loss. <br><strong>Cons: </strong>The carbohydrate intake is insufficient for athletes, while hip diners may find it hard to stick to in restaurants. Get ready to eat composite side order meals. And anyway, isn’t it a bit of a hassle?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>The Caveman Diet (1999)</strong><br><em>Neanderthin: A Caveman’s Guide to Nutrition</em>—Texan author Ray Audette believes that we are only designed to eat food that has undergone no “technological intervention.” Indeed, when his son was teething, he was fed pork-rinds instead of rusks. He says, “If you don’t eat fat, your hunger never goes away. So eat more fat and lose it.” <br><strong>Strange fact: </strong>“The ... difference between me and the rest of these books is that of all these authors, I’m the only one that’s not a millionaire,” says Rau Audette.<br><strong>Pros: </strong>Eat as much dead flesh and squirrel food as you like.<br><strong>Cons: </strong>Watch your arteries clog you out of existence. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>The South Beach Diet (published 2003)</strong><br>Miami cardiologist, Arthur Agatston founded this diet in 1994. It is based on his dietary recommendations for people suffering from diabetes and heart disease. When he noticed a fortunate side effect was long-term weight-loss, he became a very rich man. The current Hollywood favorite focuses on underlying scientific principles. It works by weaning a fast-food nation off bad carbs and onto wholegrain carbs. Meanwhile, increased fiber in the diet reduces fat, improves blood-health and cholesterol. <br><strong>Strange fact: </strong>Florida’s citrus industry is currently battling against the diet’s restriction of orange juice.<br><strong>Pros: </strong>It’s not like you can’t eat, you just have to eat the right things.<br><strong>Cons: </strong>The increased fiber can play merry hell with your digestion system and there could be many a long moment in the toilet.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>G.I. Diet (2006)</strong><br>The G.I. Diet was developed by Dr. David J. Jenkins, a professor of nutrition at the University of Toronto. A relatively recent kid on the diet block works by restricting you to certain foods based on the ratings these foods have on a Glycemic Index (hence its name). It measures carbs by the instantaneous effects these foods have on your blood glucose level, so you burn those calories and maintain a healthier lifestyle. <br><strong>Strange fact: </strong>The G.I. diet was turned into a successful line of diet books by author and former president of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario, Rick Gallop. According to the publishing company, Virgin Books, <em>The G.I. Diet </em>has since sold over two million copies.<br><strong>Pros: </strong>In a G.I. diet, the food is typically hearty and filling, so you won’t starve. It is also a great and logical compromise between having a healthy diet (with less fat and sugar) and the Atkins diet (which has a “no carbs” rule). It does not limit dieters to, nor exclude them from, any particular food group—which means fewer limitations, and no deprivation of any essential vitamins or proteins. <br><strong>Cons:</strong> Seemingly none (gasp!). The G.I. diet is really a pretty sustainable diet and way of life—with delicious chow that fills you up so you have no excuse (or room) to binge. It also leaves one with loads of options, and can be workable in the long run.</span></p>
