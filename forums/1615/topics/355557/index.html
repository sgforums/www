              <p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Got Hype?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Uber-trendy health foods and the myths behind them debunked. By <strong>Natasha Stokes </strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/436/20-HnF.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Remember when they said blueberries were the messiah of the fruit world? Or when some ex-employee of the soy industry claimed tofu makes boys gay? And let’s not get started on vegans. Read on for some of the most recent hyped-up health foods and what actual research has to say. <br></span><strong><br><span style="color: #3366ff;">Milk </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The hype: </strong>Remember that series of ads with celebrities du jour sporting a sexy milk ‘stache? Milk, they cried, was the wonder tonic for muscle strength, teeth and healthy hair—and could fight cavities, sleep deprivation and bone loss. The high was when ad executives, drunk on power and milk, tried to claim a milky latte was a good source of the miracle mineral, calcium. <br><strong>The rebuttal: </strong>Dairy consumption in the US is one of the highest in the world, yet so are its osteoporosis and fracture rates. One study concluded that there was “no evidence to support the notion that milk is a preferred source of calcium” as dairy contains animal protein and sodium, both of which tend to increase calcium excretion. Other studies have also suggested a diet high in calcium may be a potential risk factor for prostate cancer. <br><strong>Verdict:</strong> Inconclusive. Some dieticians believe strongly that milk’s ill effects are easily mitigated by choosing skim or low-fat, and firmly recommend it as a source of calcium. However, calcium is just one factor in bone health—some foods affect the body’s rate of calcium absorption, and milk is not a wonder tonic that can make up for a smoking habit, bad diet and lack of exercise. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Tofu</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The hype: </strong>It made your skin better, your brain younger and your life longer. The Japanese have been eating the stuff for centuries and look how many baby-faced centenarians they boast. Then the two magic ingredients in soy products were isolated—phytoestrogens, plant hormones that behaved like estrogen in humans and the powerful antioxidants isoflavones—and its status as a Superfood was cemented. The vitamins industry jumped all over it and supplements were soon flying off the shelves. <br><strong>The rebuttal: </strong>Studies that phytoestrogen could replace estrogen for menopausal women (and hence combat aging effects) are inconclusive. A 35 year-long study conducted by the Hawaii Center for Health Research was cited in global media when its authors concluded, “the more tofu eaten, the greater the likelihood of brain aging in later life.” Then there were claims that phytoestrogen overdose (the figure of two cups of soy milk daily was cited) could affect hormonal balance, and alter a woman’s menstrual cycle or delay male puberty. <br><strong>Verdict: </strong>Not overhyped! Tofu is low in calories, cholesterol-free, and a great source of protein and iron. The benefits of phytoestrogens are not proven, but an “overdose” would be impossible from natural food sources. Isoflavones are proven to be good for the skin, cancer-preventative, and a functional food (that has health-promoting, disease-preventing properties beyond the basic purpose of nutrient supply). Even the USFDA concedes “25 grams daily with a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease.”</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Wheatgrass</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The hype: </strong>A single shot of wheatgrass juice is like eating a kilo of vegetables! Its high chlorophyll content helps the body replenish red blood cells! It even helps rid the body of toxins! Proponents and juice bars loudly sang praises about the ability of wheatgrass to treat illnesses from the common cold to cancer at a mere few dollars a pop.<br><strong>The rebuttal: </strong>Leaving aside obvious illogical claims such as which vegetables the “kilo” refers to, there have been almost no clinical studies to support any of the above claims. It’s questionable whether our digestive systems could even break wheatgrass down enough to fully access the powerhouse of nutrients. <br><strong>Verdict: </strong>Overhyped! This is far from scientifically proven. Go eat some actual vegetables instead. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Omega-3 Fatty Acids</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The hype: </strong>You can get anything fortified with omega-3 these days—eggs, milk, bread, juices and more. A polyunsaturated fatty acid essential for normal growth, omega-3 is also said to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve cognition, and keep hair and skin nice. Salmon, an oily fish with purportedly high omega-3 levels, was named “The Fish” in any savvy dieter’s menu.  <br><strong>The rebuttal: </strong>Last April, a team at the University of East Anglia published a review of almost 100 studies on omega-3 fatty acids. They concluded that these fatty acids do not significantly protect against heart disease. Mega-doses of omega-3 supplements can cause excessive blood thinning, dangerously slowing the body’s clot-forming ability. Then there is its corollary, the omega-6 fatty acid, found to sometimes break down into harmful substances once digested. Apparently, this is related not to an over-intake of omega-6, but to an imbalance of omega-6 and omega-3. Research has put the ratio of the two at between 1:1 and 1:4, but some foods touted as being high in omega-3 are actually proportionally too high in omega-6. One example is farmed salmon. <br><strong>Verdict: </strong>Not overhyped! Studies have proven that omega-3 can reduce triglyceride levels in the blood, and the risk of plaque formation in blood vessels, and while farmed salmon has less omega-3, it still has much more than say, beef. Because it can be hard to get enough of this very important nutrient from dietary sources alone, supplements may be necessary. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Green Tea</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The hype: </strong>This beverage has been praised for fighting cancer, liver disease, arteriosclerosis, inflammatory bowel syndrome and diabetes and even helping to “burn” fat. All this was attributed to its extraordinarily high content of polyphenols (particularly catechin)—powerful antioxidants that help neutralize cell-damaging free radicals, byproducts of metabolism. <br><strong>The rebuttal: </strong>No clinical trials on humans have substantiated the above claims. Studies also suggest large quantities of polyphenols (such as might be found in supplements) can cause liver and kidney damage. One cup of it contains about 50mg of caffeine—half of that found in a cup of coffee. <br><strong>Verdict: </strong>Not overhyped! Unless you exploit the goodness of polyphenols by eating in concentrated pill form, green tea is as good as they say. Much research conducted on catechin suggests it reduces the risk of heart attacks, boosts immunity and protects against tooth decay; and some varieties of green tea are higher in polyphenols—so choose less roasted leaves for the most benefits. Brewing it too long, however, releases detrimental substances, so don’t drink tea that has been sitting overnight.<br></span><strong><br><span style="color: #3366ff;">Acai</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The hype: </strong>This Brazilian rainforest palm berry is the latest “It” energy drink ingredient and purveyors of these drinks claim its high levels of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals promote energy, health and even sexual function in men. <br><strong>The rebuttal: </strong>No studies have ever been done on its dietary benefits. However, the following nutrition information has been found for a 100g sample of freeze-dried acai fruit—534 calories, 44g of fiber, 52g carbohydrates, 8g protein and 32g fat. <br><strong>Verdict: </strong>Overhyped! You can get antioxidants elsewhere, and while the fruit looks to be an excellent source of fiber, anything else is just pulp until proven otherwise. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Other Hyped-Up Foods  </strong><br></span><strong><br><span style="color: #3366ff;">Almonds</span></strong><br><span style="color: #333333;">Relatively new studies reveal that almonds in conjunction with an appropriate diet have almost the same effect as anti-cholesterol medicine taken with the same diet. Watch the fat though—almonds are high in the monounsaturated, cholesterol-lowering kind, and one ounce, or 23 of them, is equivalent to three teaspoons of oil. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Chocolate</strong><br>This one has long picked up momentum, what with the proliferation of inexplicable recommendations like “It prevents heart attacks!” but dark chocolate with over 70 percent cocoa content does contain two great antioxidants—avonoids and proanthrocyanin. While there is more research being done on this, and it’s still unclear how much dark chocolate one has to eat; put it this way—pick dark chocolate because it at least might be beneficial, whereas white or milk chocolate is certainly nothing but fat and sugar.</span></p>
