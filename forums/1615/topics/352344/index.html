              <div><strong>Watch Your Feet !</strong><br><br><br><strong>The Chinese believe “cold arises from the feet” and “a person’s aging starts from the feet”. The feet are the source of hidden troubles for premature senility and pathological changes in the human body. They Chinese believe that every meridian point in our feet is a part of our body system; therefore foot reflexology is the ideal treatment for the elderly, the stressed executive, the sportsman, in fact just about anybody. But did you know that just by observing the shape of a person’s feet and legs, you can learn about their characteristics, personality traits and innermost secrets?</strong><br><br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet01.jpg" alt=""><br>When legs are long, lean and smooth, this suggests the person will enjoy a smooth sailing life with few obstacles. You are an active, hardworking and helpful person. You are likely to have a very good life before your thirties. After 30, your life depends on other destiny indicators.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet02.jpg" alt=""><br>When your legs are short relative to your body, this suggests you are smart, attentive and quiet. You prefer jobs which do not require you to deal with too many people. You may face some obstacles before your thirties, but after that your luck improves tremendously for the better.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet03.jpg" alt=""><br>Someone who walks with an inward splay suggests they are low profile, preferring the stable life rather than taking risks.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet04.jpg" alt=""><br>If you walk with a splayed feet, it suggests you are a busybody. You can be more into other people’s business than your own. You love to show off to others and are usually very talkative.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet05.jpg" alt=""><br>When feet are bony, this suggests a poor person. Life has many difficulties and it is a struggle to make life go smoothly. So do try to fatten up your feet. Nothing like good fleshy feet to bring the good life!<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet06.jpg" alt=""><br>When your toes are sharp in shape, it suggests you are the black sheep of the family. You love to spend money but are lazy to work; it indicates a lack of great achievement in life.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet07.jpg" alt=""><br>When your feet are meaty and smooth, it suggests you will become very prosperous and rich. It is also an indication that such a person’s family is very rich, belonging to the privileged class.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet08.jpg" alt=""><br>When your toenails are round in shape and smooth, especially if you are a woman, this suggests you will marry a rich husband.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet09.jpg" alt=""><br>When your toes are tiny, this suggests you are a responsible and honest person. People with tiny toes are said to make good spouse material.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet10.jpg" alt=""><br>When you feet are big, (size 8 and above for men and size 7 and above for women) this indicates you are a “survivor”. You can deal with any kinds of problems, setbacks, obstacles or difficult people. You are decisive and can provide strong leadership.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet11.jpg" alt=""><br>When your middle toe is the longest among your toes, it is not a good indication as it suggests your destiny could turn irksome during middle age. You could suffer from a perpetual shortage of money and face obstacles that block your success.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet12.jpg" alt=""><br>When your second toe is longer than your big toe, this suggests you will have plenty of food on the table and plenty of friends around you. You impress others with your good heart, so many will speak well of you. But you need to work hard to maintain your increasingly extravagant lifestyle.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet13.jpg" alt=""><br>When your feet are small (size 6 and below for men and size 5 and below for women) you should take good care of your nose or breathing system. You are mature and prudent but should learn to overcome your jealous nature and tendencies, as they could bring about your downfall or be a major source of unhappiness.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet14.jpg" alt=""><br>The colour of your toes can not only indicate the condition of your health, it can also indicate your potential for wealth. Toes which are milky white and transparent suggest you will have a stable life. Grey toes suggest you will have a tough life. The best colour however is reddish, which suggests someone rich and successful.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet15.jpg" alt=""><br>When your toes are big, this suggests you are a leader. You can be a very stubborn person, hot tempered and possessive, but you can arouse great passion in others.<br><br><img src="http://www.wofs.com/images/stories/misc/watchfeet16.jpg" alt=""><br>When your toes are meaty and uneven in size, it suggests you have the luck to own property and enjoy good fortune. You have the potential to become a property tycoon.</div>
