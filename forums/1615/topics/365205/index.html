              </p><p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Preventing spread of infectious diseases is everyone's responsibility</span></strong></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #333333;">Wednesday, June 17, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #333333;"><br><br>According to a report published today, 
              we must all share responsibility for preventing the spread of diseases such as 
              swine flu, SARS, avian influenza, diarrhoeal and skin diseases, and even the 
              common cold. <br><br>The swine flu scare has prompted some to say that we are 
              over-reacting but it is important to look at the bigger picture - because the 
              next new pathogens are always just around the corner. The regular emergence of 
              new pathogenic strains, and their unpredictable behaviour, means that sustained 
              investment in effective strategies of mitigation and containment make absolute 
              sense. <br><br>But if infections are to be kept in check, there needs to be a 
              fundamental change in our approach to hygiene, with more emphasis being placed 
              on empowering families to take on this responsibility. <br><br>Professor Sally 
              Bloomfield of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and one of 
              the report's authors, comments: 'Although antibiotics and vaccines have given us 
              unprecedented ability to prevent and treat killer diseases, hygiene is still 
              fundamental to winning the battle against infectious disease in both developed 
              and developing countries – and that's a job for all of us. This is not about 
              shifting responsibility, it's about facing reality'. <br><br>The report, 
              published by an expert group for the International Scientific Forum of Home 
              Hygiene, indicates that a significant proportion of global infectious disease 
              could be prevented through improved hygiene practice coupled with the provision 
              of adequate water and sanitation. One of its key conclusions is that, if the 
              burden of these diseases is to be contained in a manner which is economically 
              sustainable, it must be a responsibility which is shared by all of us. 
              <br><br>Information around hygiene is still too fragmented and confusing, 
              however. For example, advice on preventing spread of colds and flu is very 
              different from that on preventing diarrhoeal diseases. What is needed, argue the 
              authors, is a less agency-centred approach, and one that is more family-centred, 
              empowering parents to better protect themselves and their families against 
              infection. Dr Elizabeth A Scott, also a co-author comments: 'The key to getting 
              people to change their behaviour is to find a way to make hygiene behaviour more 
              appealing and relevant by realigning it with other aspects of healthy living 
              such as diet and exercise. People also need to understand that they can be 
              proactive in protecting themselves and reducing their risk of acquiring an 
              infection in their everyday lives'. <br><br>If we can prevent infections through 
              good hygiene, we can also reduce the amount of antibiotics we need to prescribe, 
              according to co-author Professor Martin Exner . Overprescription of antibiotics 
              is the main cause of antibiotic resistance, which is threatening our ability to 
              treat infections effectively when they occur. <br><br>In developing countries, 
              the huge burden of hygiene and sanitation-related infectious diseases continue 
              to be the most critical public health threat. Says co-author Professor KJ Nath: 
              'Much of the focus in developing countries is on investment in community water 
              supply and sanitation in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals, but if 
              the health benefits are to be realised, programmes of hygiene promotion must be 
              implemented in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation'. 
              <br><br>Last week's report on the state of the NHS called for greater emphasis 
              on 'disease prevention strategies' as a means to reduce pressure on NHS budgets. 
              Infection prevention will be particularly important for the ever-increasing 
              ageing population, for whom infectious diseases can have much more serious 
              consequences which require hospitalisation. <br><br>All of these trends 
              underline the need for greater collective effort in better standards of hygiene. 
              Says Professor Bloomfield: 'In the current climate where infectious disease 
              agents and our immunity to these agents are constantly changing, we need to 
              return to the "not-so-good old days" when our parents and grandparents knew that 
              protecting themselves and their families against infectious diseases was part of 
              their responsibility and an important part of daily life'. <br><br>###
