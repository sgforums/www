              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">From the Feet Up: Top Ten Reasons People Get Reflexology</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Reflexology is more than a fancy foot massage. Although there are great benefits for your feet, the technique actually provides benefits for the entire body including organs. By applying pressure to certain points on the foot, reflexology can enhance the body's circulation, provide the body with relief from stress and assists the body to normalize metabolism naturally.</span></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Still not sure yet about reflexology? Here are the top reasons why patients come in for treatment to alleviate pain and discomfort.</span></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1 Stress Level</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Even if you are experiencing a low level of stress, if you keep going at this pace you will likely affect your immune system and become sick. Being sick and stressed is a terrible combination. Taking the time to take care of yourself is a step in the right direction for your good health, well being and longevity.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2 Standing All Day</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Some jobs require you to be on your feet all day. This can impact your whole body as you will start to feel fatigued and achy. By manipulating the feet you can soothe your feed and loosen up your aching back, shoulders and legs.</span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3 Running is Your Sport</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Although running has many benefits. the pounding on the pavement can be hard on the body. Remember to stretch, wear proper shoes and give yourself rest time. Reflexology can help return your feet back to a balanced state.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4 You Have Diabetes</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Diabetes causes your feet start to lose sensation so it is especially important to look after them. Regular reflexology can help ease your discomfort. It complements all other healing modalities. “In my practice I see many diabetics who are struggling with feet problems,” says Julie Irwing a registered dietician. “A practice of reflexology and other foot care greatly can help the patient manage their disease."</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5 Time to Detox</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The benefits are multiple here. Whether it is a dietary changes or the elimination of toxins from your body and environment, reflexology is a gentle way of balancing the system during this time. It should make the transition from unhealthy to healthy a lot smoother.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6 Baby on the Way</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Reflexology can help ease pains that are caused by organs that are being squished making space for the growing uterus. Comfort is key during this time as is getting relief from the swollen feet and achy back. "During my pregnancy I was having major discomfort in my back,” explains Melanie, new mother. “I would always get massages that only relieve my pain until I got off the table. Once I went for reflexology it was like it was massaging from the inside."</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">7 Digestive Issues Are Slowing You Down</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Remarkable results have resulted from reflexology to make sluggish bowels that start moving even after one session! It is recommended to drink lots of water after a session that can also benefit a slow digestive system. Clients sometimes need to go use the bathroom right after the session.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">8 Cold Feet</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The cause for cold feet is often likely a circulatory issue. Reflexology can offer your body a kick-start, helping the blood flow and warming up your feet!</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">9. Insomnia</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Reflexology is extremely relaxing and many patience fall asleep during sessions. Let your active mind take a break and balance your lifestyle. This is especially good at the end of a long day. Reflexology allows your mind to take a break so that you can heal and not worry about what is coming next.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">10 Nothing Else Seems to Work</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Sometimes you may need your body to reach a state of homeostasis and relaxation in order to heal. Reflexology has been helpful when nothing else has been effective. It can affect the organs and other parts of the body that are not easily accessible with massage or other treatments.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #808080;">Hand me some relief </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>By Cheryl Tan  </strong><em><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">:: The Sunday Times :: http://www.asiaone.com</span></em></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.asiaone.com/A1MEDIA/health/03Mar09/others/20090304.120731_handreflexology-crop.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>It is common to relax with a massage by a foot reflexologist, but another way of feeling good is taking hold.</p>
              <p>It is hand reflexology, which massage spa owners say is 'cleaner' and more convenient than foot reflexology.</p>
              <p>
              
              As well as reducing stress, having your hands stroked and evaluated by a practitioner of this traditional Chinese method can also reveal your state of health.</p>
              <p>Hand reflexology is becoming popular, with more spas and massage places offering the service as part of their packages.</p>
              <p>Come March 29, there will also be a hand reflexology summit at Suntec Convention Hall to promote its use here.</p>
              <p>The event is the first of its kind and is organised by Advanced Health Group (AHG), a company that promotes health awareness.</p>
              <p>Roadshows at junior colleges and community centres have also been organised to raise awareness about the massage technique.</p>
              <p>'Hand reflexology is easy to learn and is convenient enough to do it yourself or for your friends in public,' said company director Dr Chua Ley Shuang, 27, who is also trained in Western medical techniques.</p>
              <p>LifeStyle came across at least four spa operators offering hand reflexology. A typical 40-minute session costs $48, the same amount you would pay for a 40-minute foot reflexology session.</p>
              <p>True Spa, a face and body wellness centre at Cuppage Terrace, started offering hand reflexology services in September last year.</p>
              <p>So far, the centre has seen at least 30 customers asking for such sessions each month, said a True Spa spokesman.</p>
              <p>Each session lasts 30 minutes and costs $88.</p>
              <p>Over at Lynn Aesthetic beauty and spa, which has branches in Bugis Village, Jurong East and Hougang, owner Lynn Wee said hand reflexology is already a hot favourite among her female regulars, especially those prone to numbness in fingers and hands because of poor blood circulation.</p>
              <p>The 47-year-old also said she has seen a 20 per cent jump in the number of requests for hand massages every year since 2004, as customers come to realise the benefits.</p>
              <p>These include relieving stiff joints and muscle ache in the upper body.</p>
              <p>Regular client Fiona Ho goes for hand reflexology once a week as she believes the improved blood circulation which follows helps boost her overall well-being and looks.</p>
              <p>'I sleep better, my immune system is stronger and I look more radiant,' said the sales manager, who is in her 40s.</p>
              <p>She also enjoys face and body massages for a holistic treatment that she says helps to relieve stress.</p>
              <p>According to hand reflexology instructor Lai Kok Heng, blood circulation is improved by massaging and applying pressure on acupuncture points in the palm that link to problem areas.</p>
              <p>So the colour of the palm, along with the shape of the fingers and nails, tell how well your body is functioning, said the 63-year-old, who has been learning traditional Chinese massage techniques since he was 16.</p>
              <p>However, he cautioned against visiting inadequately trained massage therapists who do not know the correct techniques and which points to target.</p>
              <p>'Hand and foot reflexology is not supposed to be painful. It should be a very soothing and relaxing experience,' he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Lai runs a private business, Hand Foot Reflexology Health Institute International, which he set up in 1999.</p>
              <p>His company provides hand and foot reflexology for residents at various Residents' Committee centres and community centres in Boon Lay and Lavender.</p>
              <p>The going rate for a 30- to 45-minute session is $23, but the elderly pay $12.</p>
              <p>He has also conducted classes for those interested in learning massage techniques for body and foot reflexology. His students, some of whom have trained under him for nearly 10 years, also volunteer as massage therapists for the elderly at the community centres.</p>
              <p>He has yet to teach his volunteers hand reflexology, but said that classes will start in August. The course of two-hour lessons over six weeks costs $120.</p>
              <p>For school bus assistant Lee Siew Kian, the hand, arm and foot massages with Mr Lai and his students are a godsend. Their kneading helps relieves numbness in her arms and stiff shoulders.</p>
              <p>The 54-year-old, who visits the King George's Avenue Residents' Committee centre every Tuesday for the massages, said: 'I can move my arms comfortably after a session. It's a relief.'</p>
