              <p><strong><span style="color: #9966cc;">Cancer is the No. 1 killer in Singapore. Here, oncologists take a look at five common cancers – their symptoms, treatments and prevention.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.5cm"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;">lung cancer</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Symptoms:</span></strong> Shortness of breath, coughing up blood, chronic coughing, chest and abdominal pains. Smokers have the highest risk of developing lung cancer.<br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Treatment methods:</span></strong> Surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Varying combinations of these methods are commonly used depending on the cell type, stage of disease and the aim of treatment. Oncologists (doctors specialising in cancer) will be able to advise on the best combinations for treatment.<br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Help prevent it:</span></strong> Active and secondary tobacco smoke exposure should be avoided at all costs. Screening can help to detect lung cancer.</p>
              <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.5cm"><strong><span style="color: #ea4e1a;">To avoid lung cancer, active and secondary tobacco smoke exposure should be avoided at all costs.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.5cm"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;">liver cancer</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;"><br></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Symptoms:</span></strong> There are few, if any, in the early stages. In the later stages, jaundice (yellowing skin and eyes) commonly occurs due to liver tissue damage. Bloating of the abdomen may also occur. Sudden abdominal pains may occur if the tumour ruptures.<br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Treatment methods:</span></strong> Surgery and liver transplantation is the only cure for liver cancer. However, surgery is possible for only 20-25 per cent of patients and not possible if the liver has been damaged by cirrhosis (hardening of the liver) or hepatitis. Other methods, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormonal therapy are largely palliative, which is concerned with improving the quality of life, but is not a cure. <br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Help prevent it:</span></strong> Alcohol abuse can lead to liver cirrhosis and this dramatically increases cancer risk. Also, the risk of an individual with hepatitis B or C getting liver cancer is 100 times more than that of a normal person.<br>     Hepatitis B and C are sexually transmissible, hence safe and responsible habits are, as always, highly advisable.</p>
              <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.5cm"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;">stomach cancer</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;"><br></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Symptoms:</span></strong> Does not show symptoms, or only non-specific symptoms, in its early stages. In its later stages, patients often suffer from abdominal pains, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation, and dramatic weight loss.<br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Treatment methods:</span></strong> Typically, removal of the tumour through surgery, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.<br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Help prevent it:</span></strong> Have a diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, and low salt intake. Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke.</p>
              <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.5cm"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;">prostate cancer<br></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Symptoms:</span></strong> Most early stage prostate cancers do not produce symptoms. They are picked up incidentally during general health screening or during treatment of an associated benign condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Symptoms of BPH are frequent urination, increased urination at night, blood in the urine, difficulty starting and maintaining a steady flow of urine, and painful urination. Painful ejaculation and impotence are not common symptoms of prostate cancer.<br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Treatment methods:</span></strong> If the cancer has not metastasised (spread to other parts of the body), radiotherapy or surgery is preferred. If it has spread, then hormonal therapy or chemotherapy will be done.<br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Help prevent it:</span></strong> In general, early detection is the best preventive measure. Consult a doctor if you have the symptoms cited above. Increasing your intake of lycopene (found in tomatoes), soya proteins and Omega-3 fatty acids (from oily fish) and stopping smoking may also decrease the risk of prostate cancer.</p>
              <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.5cm"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;">nasopharyngeal cancer<br></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Symptoms:</span></strong> A painless lump in the neck, excessive nose discharge or blockage, or bleeding, decreased hearing or ringing in the ears, or unusual pain or numbness over the face, double vision or headache.<br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Treatment methods:</span></strong> In its early stages, radiotherapy is used; in advanced cancer, chemotherapy is added to improve the efficiency of radiotherapy. Surgery is reserved as an option if the cancer recurs in spite of radiotherapy.<br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Help prevent it:</span></strong> Eating plenty of fresh fruit, green vegetables and other sources of vitamin C will lower your cancer risk. Avoid taking excessive amounts of salted fish and other preserved foodstuff.</p>
              <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.5cm"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;">skin cancer</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;"><br></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Symptoms:</span></strong> Discolouring in parts of the skin, sores or changes in the skin that do not heal, skin ulcers, and changes in existing moles.<br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Treatment methods:</span></strong> Minor skin cancers are very treatable by surgery or radiotherapy. However, if the cancer has metastasised, then other techniques such as chemotherapy may be used as well.<br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Help prevent it:</span></strong> Avoid sunburn, especially in the childhood and teenage years. It is also important to minimise exposure to UV radiation. Steer clear of outdoor activities from 10am to 4pm, and use sunblock lotion and protective clothing when you’re outdoors.</p>

              <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.5cm"><strong><span style="color: #0000a0;">lymphoma</span></strong> <br>(cancer involving lymphocytes, a particular type of white blood cell) <br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Symptoms:</span></strong> Painless swellings in the neck, armpits and/or groin. In about a third of the patients, there is unexplained fever, weight loss or night sweats. <br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Treatment methods:</span></strong> There are many different subtypes of lymphoma and treatment differs depending on the subtype. Treatments range from radiotherapy (early stages) to chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant. <br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Help prevent it:</span></strong> There are no specific prevention measures for lymphoma. It has, however, been closely associated with abnormally decreased immune systems, which may be present from birth or caused by viruses such as the HIV virus.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff99cc;">Study finds photographs of UV exposure can impact sunburns in preteens</span></strong></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff99cc;"><img src="http://www.labspaces.net/images/news/49381_sunburnt_nose.jpg" alt=""></span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff99cc;"><em>Thursday, April 23, 2009</em><br><br>Researchers from Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) have found that among preteens, the use of photographs to measure ultraviolet (UV) exposure, could motivate them to improve sun protection practices and limit number of sunburns. These findings appear in the April 2009 issue of the Journal of the Dermatology Nurses' Association. <br><br>Skin cancer is the most common cancer in our society, and overexposure to UV light in childhood is a major risk factor. Individuals with light eyes, pale skin, history of sunburns, freckling tendency, multiple nevi, or family histories of skin cancer are at greatest risk. <br><br>The BUSM researchers collaborated with the Children's Melanoma Prevention Foundation (</span><a href="http://www.melanomaprevention.org/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff99cc;">http://www.melanomaprevention.org/</span></span></a><span style="color: #ff99cc;">) to design an intervention program in the Northeast. They recruited middle-school students (aged 11-13 years) from Quincy, Massachusetts, a community with a melanoma rate higher than expected from 1999-2003. Of the 111 students who completed the study, 83 received the intervention and 28 were in the control group. All students received a sun protection lecture. Those in the intervention group also received a UV photograph of their face, (that shows pigment changes from chronic sun exposure), along with detailed explanations of their findings on the UV photographs at baseline. Follow-up surveys at two and six months were also obtained. Responses from both groups were analyzed with regard to attitudes and behaviors relating to sun protection practices. <br><br>According to the researchers there were fewer (36 percent) reported sunburns in the intervention group at two months follow-up, as compared with the control group (57 percent). This difference was smaller at six months follow-up with 51 percent of intervention group reporting a sunburn compared to 64 percent of the control group. The researchers then examined the relationship between preteens who were "planning to tan" at baseline and reports of sunburn at two and six months follow-up and found sunburn rates were again lower among the students in the intervention group compared to the control group. <br><br>Students generally reported that the UV photograph was a helpful tool in teaching risk factors for skin cancer and the majority had kept them, Those preteens with the highest risk factors for melanoma, such as numerous facial freckles, were greater impacted and were significantly less likely to report sunburn at two months and again in six months. <br><br>"Despite public health recommendations to protect children and preteens from sun damage, studies indicate that we can be quite ineffective in this regard," said lead author Marie-France Demierre, a professor of dermatology and medicine at BUSM. "Studies have reported that children experience at least one annual sunburn, and more than a third have three or more per year. This greatly increases their chances of melanoma. The UV photographs appear to be a helpful tool to allow a child to recognize the risk for skin cancer and potentially reduce their chance of sunburn," added Demierre. <br><br>Demierre added, "The UV photograph represents an immediate ''picture'' of sun damage that can impact impressionable teens. By providing coping information, for example, information on how to protect oneself, sun protection information, one can facilitate positive health behaviors potentially preventing sunburn." <br><br>Demierre also commented on the feasibility of such a study within a public school system. The researchers had a close collaboration with the Quincy school superintendent, teachers and nurses who allowed this important research to take place. "The potential of UV photographs in improving sun protection behavior among children and preteens, especially those most at risk for melanoma, is enormous. Every teen should get an ultraviolet photograph of his/her face in school along with routine vaccinations," she added. <br><br>### <br><br>Boston University</span></p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Friday, June 12, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br><br>University of Florida researchers have 
              come up with a new gene therapy method to disrupt cancer growth by using a 
              synthetic protein to induce blood clotting that cuts off a tumor's blood and 
              nutrient supply. <br><br>In mice implanted with human colorectal cancer cells, 
              tumor volume decreased 53 percent and cancer cell growth slowed by 49 percent in 
              those treated with a gene that encodes for the artificial protein, compared with 
              those that were untreated. <br><br>The research team, led by Dr. Bradley S. 
              Fletcher, an assistant professor of pharmacology and therapeutics in the College 
              of Medicine, created the so-called fusion protein to target another protein 
              called tumor endothelial marker 8, or TEM8, which was recently found to be 
              preferentially expressed in the inner lining of tumor vessels. Such differences 
              in protein expression enable delivery of drug molecules to the cells that harbor 
              these proteins. <br><br>"The protein we created did a very good job of homing to 
              the tumor and binding," said Stephen Fernando, who recently completed his 
              doctoral studies. "By targeting TEM8, we can potentially create a therapy 
              against cancer." <br><br>The Fletcher group is the first to target cancer cells 
              through protein binding to TEM8. The findings, now available online, are 
              featured on the cover of the June 15 edition of Cancer Research. <br><br>"If you 
              can cut off the blood supply, then you can inhibit the tumor from growing -- 
              there have been many attempts," said Brad St. Croix, director of the National 
              Cancer Institute's Tumor Angiogenesis Section, whose group first identified the 
              TEM genes that over-express in tumor endothelial cells. "The concept of 
              targeting tumor blood vessels has been around for many years, but it's good that 
              we're finally getting around to the stage where we can see the vessels being 
              targeted therapeutically -- it's pretty exciting, I think." <br><br>St. Croix 
              was not part of the current research team, but donated some experimental 
              materials. <br><br>The UF group created a "fusion protein" -- part of which 
              binds to TEM8, and the other which promotes thrombosis, or blood clotting -- and 
              delivered genes that encode for it to the lungs of mice. The delivery vehicle 
              was a transposon called Sleeping Beauty, a piece of DNA that can insert new 
              genes stably and efficiently into a cell's genome. <br><br>The lungs then 
              functioned as a factory to produce the protein that later found its way to the 
              target cells in the tumor vessels. <br><br>"We felt that TEM8 was an ideal 
              target because it was inside the vessel, preferentially expressed there and 
              unique," Fletcher said. <br><br>In addition to promoting blood clots, the 
              strategy also resulted in reduced tumor vessel density, possibly by interfering 
              with TEM8 function. <br><br>Fletcher's group previously applied the Sleeping 
              Beauty transposon gene delivery method to the treatment of hemophilia and 
              pulmonary hypertension and the prevention of lung transplant rejection in animal 
              studies. After developing those three successful models, they looked for disease 
              applications in which poor outcomes would be worth the risk associated with gene 
              therapy. <br><br>"We felt that cancer was potentially a target," Fletcher said. 
              "Gene therapy has a lot of risk associated with it, so you don't want to do it 
              for diseases that are not life-threatening." <br><br>The group plans to come up 
              with a method to increase the amounts of the thrombosis-inducing protein 
              produced in the body, and test whether higher dosing leads to unintended blood 
              clots. <br><br>They are also looking into ways to deliver the protein directly 
              to the sites of interest, rather than through genes that later produce the 
              protein, and apply the method in other areas such as prostate cancer. Other work 
              will include the use of coated nanoparticles to detect tumors and deliver drugs 
              or radiate heat to destroy cancer cells when bombarded by radio waves.
