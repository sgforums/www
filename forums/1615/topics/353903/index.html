              <p>By : <span style="color: #800080;">Christine Harrell</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Goals are vital to sticking with an exercise program and preventing your favorite home fitness videos from collecting dust. They keep you motivated, indicate a need for change, allow you to track your progress, and even make for good bragging material. Unfortunately, many people do not attain their goals because they are unrealistic, immeasurable or they are simply not tracking them effectively. Are you making any of these mistakes? <br><br>Setting Unachievable Goals <br><br>If you are a six foot male with a large frame, setting a goal of losing a hundred pounds with your home fitness videos is not only difficult to achieve, but dangerous to boot. Take time to determine what the ideal goal is for you. You also need to set yourself up to succeed. Make sure you give yourself enough time to achieve your goal. Otherwise, you will realize you aren't going to make your goal and give up. Also, don't be afraid to adjust your goal if you find that it isn't working. <br><br>Failing To Make Tangible Goals <br><br>Many people make goals when they purchase their home fitness videos. The problem is that they don't make them measurable. Regardless of how big or small, when setting a goal you must make sure it includes a number. For example, a goal could include reaching a certain pant size, losing a specific number of pounds, reaching a particular weight, waist size, or even time. <br><br>Not Making Milestones <br><br>Simply setting your final goal isn't enough; these seem too far away -- and there's nothing to help gauge your progress. Break down the primary goal into several small milestones that you can reach relatively frequently. Each time you reach one, you will actually be able to feel yourself progressing and moving forward, which will encourage you to keep going. <br><br>Tracking <br><br>Once you have exercise program milestones you can track, make sure to do it! Use a measuring tape, scale, or even a series of pants in different sizes to help keep track of where you are on your journey. Be sure to find out where you are before you start. Then, be sure to check where you are on a regular basis and write it down. If you find you need a little more motivation to continue with your home fitness videos, keep the page you use to record your progress on the bathroom mirror, fridge or somewhere where you'll see it often. <br><br>Not Emotionally Supporting Yourself <br><br>Even when you achieve the smallest milestone in your exercise program it IS a big deal! Many people fight themselves by thinking they should have achieved it faster or better. Even worse can be the common practice of comparing yourself to someone else. Each time you meet your mark, reward yourself and use it as the perfect opportunity to psych yourself up for the next leg of the journey. It can also help to get others involved in keeping you motivated. <br><br>These mistakes may seem simple, but with an exercise program, it's the little things that will get you. Keep these mistakes in mind when you start with your 10 minute trainer workouts, and you will find they are easier to stick with and more enjoyable. </span></p>
