              <p><em>Tuesday, June 16, 2009</em><br><br>Children born without thymus glands have 
              given Duke University Medical Center researchers a rare opportunity to watch as 
              a new immune system develops its population of infection-fighting T-cells. 
              <br><br>Researchers led by Thomas Kepler, Ph.D., Division Chief of Computational 
              Biology, tracked three young patients after thymus tissue transplantation to 
              measure the growth of a T cell population – with all of its diversity. Duke 
              University pioneered thymus transplantation for children born with DiGeorge 
              Syndrome, lacking a thymus, under the direction of Louise Markert, M.D., Ph.D. 
              <br><br>As transplanted thymus tissue took hold in the children, the team 
              studied signals related to specific T-cell receptors and more general resources 
              like cytokine signals or space availability. They assessed T cell receptor 
              diversity to determine overall T cell levels and to count T cells of certain 
              kinds. <br><br>"What we haven't understood until now is how maintaining the 
              diversity of T cells with different receptors works while a body also maintains 
              appropriate T cell numbers overall," said Kepler, who is senior author of a 
              paper published in PloS Computational Biology. "Our paper is the first to use 
              information about changes in T cell receptor diversity to infer properties of 
              the T cell regulatory mechanisms." <br><br>The immune system needs a variety of 
              different T cells to fight all kinds of pathogens. "The fastest way to grow the 
              total T cell population is to impede diversity and grow just a few kinds of T 
              cells," Kepler said. "We set out to understand more about the regulation of this 
              fine balance." <br><br>Kepler and lead author Stanca Ciupe, Ph.D., a 
              postdoctoral fellow in computational immunology, created mathematical formulas 
              to model the contribution of resources on the regulation of T cell population 
              growth and diversity. They found that factors that are blind to T cell receptors 
              and treat all T cells alike are a thousand times more common than the factors 
              that regulate receptor-specific development of T cells. <br><br>"The findings 
              open up the possibility of studying the development of T cells in children with 
              DiGeorge syndrome in a rigorous and quantifiable way, because we can determine 
              which factors are most important," said Markert, a Duke Associate Professor of 
              Pediatrics in the Division of Allergy and Immunology. <br><br>For example, one 
              of the transplants appeared not to be functioning, based on a biopsy. Using the 
              computations devised for this research, however, the team was able to track the 
              rise in certain types of T cells – the transplant took longer to develop T cells 
              than most other cases. In the end, the child's immune system matured, T cells 
              developed, and the child avoided undergoing a second transplantation. 
              <br><br>"What is novel is our ability to take the results from assays and 
              quantify them to get a numerical measure of diversity, to get a picture of what 
              really happens when T cells mature," Ciupe said. "Secondly, we were able to 
              develop a mathematical model to feed the data into." <br><br>"It will require a 
              significant mathematical effort to see the full promise of human systems biology 
              come to fruition," Kepler said. "So much scientific work is done in model 
              organisms, but we can't manipulate humans in those ways. This paper shows that 
              with more sophisticated mathematical tools, you can get the information you need 
              to learn about human biology without enormous amounts of manipulation of 
              people." <br><br>Ciupe said that using applying mathematics to biological 
              systems and biological engineering will continue to develop new applications for 
              humans. Mathematics might help to deliberately design human vaccines, for 
              instance. "Physics and mathematics have a symbiotic relationship and resulted in 
              the laws of physics," she said. "Combining biology and math is an iterative 
              process, and someday we may have laws of biology in the same way." <br><br>###
