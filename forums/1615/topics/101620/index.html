How long has this fresh bleeding been going on? Stool not black rite? Any wt loss or loss of appetite? Any family History?<br><br>From your symptoms, 2 possibilities:<br>1) Constipation - explains abdominal pain and passage of hard stools causing<br>abrasion (hence fresh bleeding)<br>2) Haemorrhoids (unlikely)<br>Just eat more veggies and fruits and drink lotsa water. Symptoms should clear in the next few daes.<br><br>cheer up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if the blood is 'fresh', meaning bright red, its MORE LIKELY to be hemrrhoids than CR cancer. if its dark red, its MORE LIKELY to be CR cancer. if you feel pain when you pass motion then its MORE LIKELY hemrrhoids, if its painless, its MORE LIKELY CR cancer. my friend's father died of CR cancer....my friend said dat his dad told him he tot is piles when he see blood on the stools etc and he didn't bother to see doctor cos he felt no pain at all.<br><br>for the next 1 month, go 50% vegetarian and stay away from meat. if u still experience the same thing....its MOST LIKELY CR cancer...<br><br>last time i also got blood, but little bit and i must 'force' alot to pass motion. now i everyday eat 1-2 wedges of papaya, so far so good, pass motion smooth and quick.<br><br>eat more papaya and banana. DO NOT EAT GUAVA....it will 'seal' your a$$....and i mean it....eat it and u will find your stools are rockhard.</div>
