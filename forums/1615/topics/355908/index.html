              <p><span style="color: #003300;">Unearthing the great debate: To be or not to be (organic, that is). By <strong>Belinda Wan </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/366/winner-Feature1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;">   Mention the word “organic” and images of pesticide-free fruits and vegetables, healthier processed food and even skincare come to mind. <br>   With organic food becoming increasingly readily available (just check out your nearest supermarket), and organic establishments mushrooming up everywhere, it seems like a foregone conclusion that everyone should jump on the organic bandwagon already, as the trend shows no sign of weakening. Nevertheless, there is still much debate between the two camps of organic food versus conventionally produced food—with both sides having their fair share of detractors. Some say the health benefits of organic food have been greatly exaggerated—while others claim that going organic is the best way to better health. So what is the reality for us, the confused consumer? <br>   Organic produce refers to food that is harvested and packaged according to certain production standards. This means crops that are grown with the minimal involvement (if any) of artificial fertilizers, conventional pesticides, chemicals (including chemical engineering), human waste, as well as sludge from the sewage. <br>   It also means that in the rearing of animals, no antibiotics, growth hormones and genetic modification can be used. There is also a heavy emphasis on using natural methods of pest and disease control, such as animal grazing, crop rotation programs and effective placement of repellant plants—in short, produce in its most natural, untampered state. In most countries (including Singapore), organic food must obtain organic certification in order to be labeled “organic.” <br>   There are two main types of organic food—fresh and processed. “Fresh” refers to perishable items like fruits and vegetables, organic eggs and dairy products, while processed food can be found in a supermarket alongside conventionally processed food and includes organic beer, pasta, baby food, pet food, and loads more. <br>   <br><strong>THE PROs</strong><br>While there are many perspectives and interpretations about the whole organic movement, these are the most widely cited reasons that proponents of the organic movement use to defend their stance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>No Residue From Synthetic Pesticides </strong><br>   One of the biggest reasons behind why many consumers have ditched conventionally produced foods and rushed to get organic produce is because non-organic, conventionally-grown food, especially fruits and vegetables, contain pesticides and herbicide residue. Mindy Chua, the manager of Four Seasons Market says, “Organic produce is pesticide-free. It is also free from antibiotics, food additives, any form of added hormones, genetically engineered organisms, irradiation, mycotoxins and pathogens. Best of all, organic methods produce nutritionally superior produce.” It’s a statement that pretty much puts everything into perspective. <br>     The alarming thing is that not only is it difficult to quantify exactly how much pesticides and chemicals farmers are using during crop growth, but remnants of less-than-healthy pesticides can remain on fruits and vegetables even after washing. The harmful effects of these synthetic pesticides are not imagined—the herbicide atrazine, at concentrations as low as 0.1 part per billion, can cause male frogs to produce eggs in their gonads, turning them into hermaphrodites, cites the 2003 study, Environmental Health Perspectives. In humans, it’s thought that allergies, cancer and illnesses can develop as a result of these types of substances. <br>   Organic produce does not use synthetic pesticides, but plant-based, natural pesticides instead. While it’s not conclusive that this is healthier than using synthetics, another Environmental Health Perspectives study conducted in 2006 showed that the level of organophosphorus pesticide exposure dropped significantly in 23 children after they had switched to an organic diet. So while it is difficult to determine the exact degree to which pesticides really cause diseases, why take chances?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Good For You, Great For The Environment</strong><br>Organic systems of farming are also environmentally friendly. Synthetic pesticides and fertilizers have enough chemicals in them to devastate wildlife and the natural environment. A large, uncontrolled amount of these substances released into the environment can seriously kill plants and animals and throw food chains out of balance. <br>   Organic methods of farming will maintain delicate ecosystems far more effectively than conventional farming can. Statistics and calculations have also shown that organic farms use less energy, are more energy-efficient, and produce less waste. For instance, a conventional farm generates a lot more waste in the form of the packaging material used for chemicals.<br>   Just think about it—farming methods that are comparatively more beneficial for the environment can only be a good thing—as all our food comes from the environment anyway. You don’t want mutated fish and deformed tomatoes now, do you?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Less Health Hazards For Farmers And Producers</strong><br>Farmers working in organic farms run far less risk of suffering adverse health effects that come from prolonged exposure to pesticides and chemicals. When used, pesticides stay in the air, and the skin and bodies of producers for a long time. Studies indicate that organophosphorus pesticides are associated with ailments like dizziness, abdominal pains, nausea, headaches, vomiting, and skin and eye problems. Other more severe side effects of prolonged pesticide exposure include memory malfunction, respiratory difficulties, skin problems, depression, cancer, neurological disorders, and more. <br>   Of this, Chua says, “For the last three decades, the study of contaminants in food focused on cancer-causing chemicals and additives...Ailments like breast cancer, prostate cancer, immune system dysfunctions, low sperm counts and brain irregularities may result.” Enough said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Better Taste And Higher Nutritional Value</strong><br>As the old adage says, you get what you pay for. Organic produce is definitely more expensive than produce grown in the conventional way. <br>   Many advocates swear, however, that it’s worth every extra cent you pay, because of the better flavor. A 2001 study undertaken by Washington State University researchers concluded that organic apples taste sweeter. In fact, Iris Teo, marketing communications executive of Aramsa Spas and The Green Room Cafe says, “Without the presence and use of synthetic herbicides, pesticides and chemicals used on the fruits and vegetables, consumers do not ingest any of these and thus run no risk of pesticide toxicity. Some studies have also shown that organic produce has a higher content of vitamins and important trace minerals.” <br>   <br><strong>THE CONs</strong><br>The pros of going organic cannot be refuted easily—but to get a more holistic picture, you should know the other side of the story too. <br>   <br><strong>The Question Of Safety </strong><br>Organic agriculture does use pesticides—plant-based ones and not synthetic and chemical-based ones. Also, pesticides used in conventional farming undergo loads of tests before they are finally approved, but the pesticides used in organic agriculture do not need to be tested. It has been proven that organically grown food contain about one third as much residue as conventionally grown food—which is a big consolation. But some say that it is also difficult to determine if less pesticide residue necessarily has a positive effect on health. In fact, many scientists argue that even natural chemicals have the potential to be “toxic”—a line of argument that casts much ambiguity over the debate.<br>   Some even maintain that the focus should be ensuring that one eats at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day—regardless of whether there are pesticide residue on these fruits and vegetables or not—because, even if they exist, it’s probably only in minimal and non-life-threatening quantities anyway.  <br>   <br><strong>Sustainability </strong><br>Organic farming has widely been lauded to improve soil quality, which is presumed to be just one example of how the organic movement is good for the environment. Yet studies have shown that improved soil quality is due primarily to crop rotation—not a strictly organic strategy. <br>   Organic food producers also lose a large portion of their crops to natural causes like pests and mould—so they need to use significantly more land in order to produce the same amount of products. A study done in February this year by UK’s <em>The Independent </em>shows that a crop of organic tomatoes used a staggering 642 percent more land than conventional crop-growing methods. <br>   <br><strong>Too Pricey </strong><br>The biggest stumbling block that the organic movement faces is price. Although organic produce is a lot more readily available these days, prices for organic produce are typically (though not strictly) 10 to 40 percent higher than conventionally grown and produced food. <br>   This is because most organic establishments are small—and don’t have economies of scale to help lower prices. The probability of crop failure is also higher on an organic farm, so, depending on the season, prices can skyrocket. Unethical organic farms or producers can also capitalize on consumer ignorance and jack up their prices. <br>   But there is more to organic food than just price griping. Teo adds, “It’s all about educating people. Organic products may be costlier, but prices are higher because organic produce is produced on a smaller scale. Without the use of pesticides or other chemicals, it is also more labor intensive and the yield is generally smaller. Singapore’s standard of living has risen greatly over the past years and this slight difference in price for the long term benefit of health is a small price to pay.”<br>   <br>There is much that is probably not known about the specifics of the organic movement, and some studies and tests are far from conclusive. Nevertheless, the benefits of going organic are still solid enough to show that switching to an organic diet may be the answer to a more wholesome lifestyle.</span></p>
