              <strong>Dosage</strong><br><br>The recommended daily dose of flaxseed oil is 1000 mg. It is always advisable to include flaxseed in the daily diet like breads, yogurt, juices and salads. It can even be sprinkled on cooked vegetables to give it a nuttier flavor. As a matter of fact, research has confirmed that up to 30 grams of flaxseed can be consumed on a daily basis with no side effect. Ensure that grounded seeds are used as whole flaxseeds simply pass through the body. Also, there is no nutritional difference between brown and yellow flaxseeds. The human body requires some time to absorb the flaxseed. It may take anywhere between a few days to six weeks before you will be able to observe the benefits of the flaxseed oil. <br>If including flaxseed in your diet is not a feasible option, then you can even buy the flaxseed oil capsules or flaxseed oil. However, it is important to buy flaxseed oil of good quality. Flaxseed oil capsules or oil stored in brown bottles can be bought from stores. Flaxseed oil is prone to rancidity and hence should be stored in a cool dark place or in the refrigerator. Discard the oil if it has developed an odor. Do make a note that some varieties of flaxseed oil are also sold for painting, planting and other purpose and should not be consumed. <br><br>Some people develop gastrointestinal symptoms like flatulence and bloating when flaxseed is made a regular part of the daily diet. Hence, it is suggested that small quantities, like one teaspoon is used initially and the quantity can be increased gradually as the body adjusts to the flaxseeds. <br><br>However, if you unsure or require further information about the flaxseed oil, do consult your doctor. Also, pregnant women must consult their doctors about the content of flaxseed that they can take in their diet as animal studies have shown that a high intake of flaxseeds may be harmful to the baby. It is always better to be safe than sorry later. </div>
