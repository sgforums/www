              <p>You knowledge in this is at the basic level dude.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally I saw a post that is in my field.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In order to maximize the use of Human Genome Project to benefit humans, we need Structural Biologist.</p>
              <p>Indeed, this project gives us an idea of our whole genome. Remember that each an everyone of us is unique, we have different genes but 99.9% of us have the same genes. It is the very little difference in us that made us unique. Our characteristic, physical and psysiological features are all different from one another.</p>
              <p>Cancers (in general), are arise not based on the work of a single gene. It is a combination of factors that lead to the development of tumours. There may be multiple number of genes controlling the growth and development of tumour. When people say "breast cancer" gene, they do not literally refer to a gene that cause breast cancer. The vague term is only referring to a combination of genetic factors that contributes to the development of cancer.</p>
              <p>If you are in the study of Biology, you should understand your Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, which first and foremost states that Genes product (protein) undergo various splicing and modification process. We only have a hand full of genes, but we are able to come up with tens of thousands of proteins.</p>
              <p>It is no doubt that the root cause of cancer is highly due to mutation of genes, which results in a total/partial loss of gene function (i.e. proteins structure modification). By understanding our genome, it gives us the ability to read genes and be able to tell which type of mutation occured in the gene. Based on today's accuracy in Full Genome Sequencing, we are still far from the "Medicine of Tomorrow" or "personalize drugs".</p>
              <p>In the treatment of cancer, you may use morder cancer treatment method which includes but not limited to chemotherapy. There are alternative methods which were reported effective against certain types of cancer. I wish to highlight to you that chemotherapy is outdated in today's morden medicine, but remained as a popular choice in cancer treatment.</p>
              <p>Although I am not specifically into Genome Biotechnology, but I can tell that the outlined method seems to vague and without depth. As I am in the field of studies of Biomedical Science (specialization in Structural Biology, Genomics, Proteomics, and Cell Cycle and Oncology), I can tell you that there is much more going on than "shrinking the cancer grow".</p>
              <p>Cancer is cause by the uncontrollable cell division that is without any regulations. There is no way that you can "shrink a cancer grow" because the cell division is not regulated. However, you can remove the cancerous cells by the means of surgical or medicine.</p>
              <p>With regards to how Human Genome Project can benefit the treatment of Cancer, below are my views:</p>
              <p>1) HGP can help to identify genetic mutations in the genome of human by comparing with a database of a population (which we do not have).</p>
              <p>2) HGP can lead to the development of "personalize drugs" which is very specific and unique to yourself only. [Do read up on haplotypes] This can help to develop drugs that can treat the root problem of the cause of your cancer.</p>
              <p>3) A team consisting of Structural Biologist, Molecular Biologist, Oncology Pharmacist, Geneticist can work together to create a brand-new drug that is able to cure cancers by focucing on the molecular root problem.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>We are still a long way to go.</p>
              <p>The debate on the risks developing pharmaceutical drugs to alter the genome  versus the risks of not doing so. Is all great that we mapped our genome, but when does understanding stop and the alteration begins ?</p>
              <p>While I may not be a biologist or a doctor, I dont see much alternative treatments being focused on, but primarily mostly focused on diferrent types of medication for chemo. And I often wonder, being a giant pharmaceutical body and all, are the medications themselves subject to scrutiny for better treatment of humans both destructive and non-destructive or are they just profit driven, like most.. no wait... all companies.</p>
              <p>Like rat poisons as heart attack medications. lol</p>
              <p>Anyways , hopefully, eventually... your option 3 becomes a reality. For personalised drugs, there was a debate on it, but I missed out on attending it. It was regarting ethical and political ramifications of drugs like that. But thats another story altogether.</p>

              <p>Most likely the drugs on the market doctor prescribe had already been in research for the past 10 yrs and was approved for human treatment by regulators. That is to say the approach of illness and treatment was at least 10 yrs ago......see the lapse in time between "knowledge vs treatment" </p>
              <p>The drugs that is currently doing research now would not be available till another 10 yrs or so depending on the trial phase.  U got to consider the financial resources  invest in these research to have wait for outcome.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Genetics mutation will happen as you grow old as Darkness mention it is a series of code that mutate.</p>
              <p>I think as for how far Genome research is going i would say pretty far reaching that most likely would piss off political social group that are idealogy base and religious leaders.</p>

              <p>I do not doubt knowledge vs treatment. Given that we cannot do a full observation for a century to determine whether it is safe as opposed to steam rolling the medication out now, it is exactly that steam rolling that I am more skeptical then anything else.</p>
