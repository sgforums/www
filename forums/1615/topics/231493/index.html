            <div class='col-md body'>Teachings, Disciplines and Concepts Regarding Better<br>Health and Living Â– Addiction<br><br>We come to, learn about, embrace and bring onto our<br>lives the teachings and disciplines of Yoga and<br>Buddhism for different reasons.<br><br>These may include wanting to learn something new, or<br>to get more focused, or to deal with some physical,<br>behavioral or mental condition that we have.<br><br>Such an endeavor may also be the result of some<br>current dissatisfaction or long - term condition that<br>we have with our life that makes us feel<br>uncomfortable.<br><br>In coming to and learning about Yoga and Buddhism, we<br>also begin to relate to what they have to share with<br>us and what they are in different ways. Are they<br>philosophies or a spiritual discipline? Are they<br>religions?<br><br>However we relate to them and for whatever reason we<br>come to them, they do have as their objective the<br>assisting of us in achieving both better health and<br>better living.<br><br>Through their teachings and disciplines and the<br>concepts that relate to them they seek to increase our<br>mindfulness about all aspects of our life, internally,<br>among and with others, and the world at large.<br><br>In teaching us about the defilements or poisons of our<br>mind and consciousness, we start to have a better idea<br>of why we have done and do things the way that we do.<br><br>In teaching us about those obstacles to practice and<br>progress in both life and Yoga/Buddhism, we are more<br>mindful about tendencies in ourselves that we never<br>saw before.<br><br>In making us mindful about actions such as non Â–<br>violence, honesty, right understanding, and right<br>effort, among others, they show and tell us that we<br>can live in such a way that brings about a positive<br>evolvement of our whole being and a positive<br>evolvement regarding our interactions with others.<br><br>One of the things that they awaken our mindfulness<br>about is the tendency that we have to addiction. This<br>writer reflects on this during his charity and<br>volunteer work in Cambodia where each morning at 6<br>a.m. he teaches Yoga and Buddhism to a class of about<br>100 men who have been drug and substance abusers and<br>are currently under the supervision of the provincial<br>police.<br><br>Though drug addiction seems to be the thing that we<br>usually associate addiction with, we can also be<br>addicted to alcohol and beer, the nicotine that we<br>find in cigarettes, or the caffeine that we find in<br>coffee and soft drinks.<br><br>Yoga and Buddhist teachings and disciplines make us<br>more mindful about those other addictions that we may<br>have.<br><br>We may be addicted to comfort in such a way that we<br>become lazy or unhealthy.<br><br>We may be addicted to watching television in such a<br>way that our mental and physical health is compromised<br>or made confused.<br><br>We may be addicted to mental, verbal, physical and<br>behavioral actions that create disharmony both within<br>and with others.<br><br>From this, we can see that the concept and phenomenon<br>of addiction is one that can manifest itself in<br>various ways.<br><br>Yoga and Buddhism make us mindful about addiction in<br>its various forms and how they can all hurt us. They<br>also teach us those ways that we can let go of those<br>addictions and in doing such a thing, free our mind<br>from the various things that keep it in a bondage that<br>is unhealthy, unwholesome and unskillful.<br><br>In doing such a thing, we evolve to a person who not<br>only has better health, but also has a stronger focus<br>and greater energy in their mind and being.<br></div>
