              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tuesday, June 16, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br><br>Scientists have long thought that 
              processes occurring during sleep were responsible for cementing the salient 
              experiences of the day into long-term memories. Now, however, a study of 
              scampering rats suggests that the mechanisms at work during sleep are also 
              active while the animals are awake -- and that they encode events more 
              accurately. <br><br>The finding has significant implications for understanding 
              the way the brain learns and remembers, the researchers say. Among other things, 
              it could offer insights into, and possible strategies for combating, post 
              traumatic stress disorder. <br><br>The study is reported in the June 14 online 
              edition of the July 2009 issue of "Nature Neuroscience." <br><br>As people – and 
              rats – go about their daily lives, they receive a ceaseless stream of sensory 
              stimuli that is taken up by neurons, or nerve cells, in the eyes, ears, nose, 
              taste buds and skin. This information is encoded in the neurons and transmitted 
              along neural pathways into various processing centers in the brain that assess 
              the information and decide what to do with it. <br><br>The current study focused 
              on the neural activity in a region of the brain known as the hippocampus, a 
              horseshoe-shaped structure responsible for encoding all spatial and event 
              memories of daily life. It is thought that the hippocampus rapidly encodes all 
              experiences in highly plastic, or flexible, neural circuits within it and then, 
              later, reactivates those neural representations of the experience that are 
              deemed significant, allowing their patterns to be engrained in less-plastic 
              hippocampal-neocortical circuits where they are stored as long-term memory. 
              <br><br>"The accepted dogma has been that one learns something while awake – the 
              process of rapid encoding -- and that later, while asleep, one replays the 
              memory over and over again until it is cemented, or consolidated, in circuits 
              throughout the brain," says the senior author of the study, Loren M. Frank, PhD, 
              assistant professor of physiology and member of the W.M. Keck Center for 
              Integrative Neuroscience at UCSF. <br><br>But this theory has not explained what 
              happens if one does not sleep right after an experience, Frank notes. "We've 
              known the memory doesn't necessarily go away but we haven't known what supported 
              memory formation in such cases." <br><br>Scientists have known that rats, during 
              brief pauses in movement as they scurry about their day, replay their immediate 
              experience. This allows them to learn the experience in the short term and to 
              integrate knowledge about it with past experiences in order to make decisions 
              about next steps. The process may even prompt changes in synaptic connections 
              between neurons that begin the process of laying down long-term memories. 
              <br><br>However, until now, scientists have thought that awake replay of events 
              was limited to the immediate past. <br><br>In the current study, Frank and first 
              author Mattias P. Karlsson, PhD, a graduate student in Frank's lab, studied 
              rats' neural replay in several settings – while they sniffed and explored two 
              different places, one familiar, one novel -- and while they dozed in a rest box. 
              In each case, the scientists recorded the activity of individual neurons in the 
              hippocampus as they fired, one after the other, as the hippocampus "reflected" 
              back on their experience in each place. <br><br>The first surprise was that in 
              both awake settings there was a near constant replay of events that had taken 
              place in the past – some 20 to 30 minutes earlier. These replay events were seen 
              in peppered bursts of activity present during the brief pauses the animals made 
              repeatedly during their exploration. <br><br>"These past experiences were 
              popping up over and over again – every couple of seconds," says Frank. 
              <br><br>More surprisingly, the awake replay often involved events that had 
              occurred in a different setting than the ones the animals were in during replay. 
              In fact, 40 to 50 percent of the replays of past experience the animals had as 
              they moved through the familiar place involved events they had experienced in 
              the novel place. <br><br>"These findings suggest that elements of past 
              experience are constantly being reactivated as we go about our daily lives, 
              independent of incoming sensory information," says Frank. <br><br>Provocatively, 
              the neural replay of past experiences detected in the animals while they 
              slumbered was significantly less accurate than when they were awake. One 
              possible explanation, says Frank, is that the replay during a sleep-like state 
              may not be intended to be a perfect reenactment of what occurred. Evidence 
              suggests that sleep is a time for making connections. "Maybe during sleep the 
              brain is sort of relaxing, saying 'I'm not going to be completely true to the 
              experience I just had. I'm going to wander around and explore and make new 
              connections.'" <br><br>The team's next step is to determine if awake replay of 
              past experiences is essential for learning, a question they plan to explore by 
              electrically interrupting, or "turning off," discrete segments of the replay 
              process as the animals scurry about their day. The question we will ask, says 
              Frank, is "can we stop the learning?" <br><br>More broadly, the team wants to 
              see if the awake replay of past experiences seen in the hippocampus is driving 
              memory processes across the brain. "We should be able to see neural signatures 
              of past experience come up in the prefrontal cortex -- another region of memory 
              storage -- when these signatures come up in the hippocampus," he says. 
              <br><br>Ultimately, says Frank, "We'd like to explore whether we can control 
              these replay processes in a subtle way. Can we, for example, pick out certain 
              kinds of neural patterns that we allow to happen and not others. Could we 
              prevent or enhance the creation of some memories and not of others?" 
              <br><br>This possibility poses the question of whether it would be possible to 
              prevent the traumatic memories associated with post traumatic stress syndrome or 
              to stop them. "The question for me has always been-- why do these experiences 
              have such a lasting impact? This is the first time I've found something that 
              might make sense of all of that," Frank adds. <br><br>### <br><br>University of
