            <div class='col-md body'>Practicing Yoga Everyday Â– Thirty Minutes That Can<br>Change Your Life<br><br>Over the last fifteen years Yoga has become a very<br>popular throughout the world.<br><br>This is most gratifying to those who know about the<br>wonderful benefits that Yoga can bring a person and<br>could for mankind as a whole, as it is easy to see on<br>a day to day basis that we have as many problems and<br>challenges to meet, many of them brought about by our<br>own ignorance and greed in these modern times, as we<br>have had at any time in our life.<br><br>But still, some people are unknowledgeable, skeptical<br>or suspicious about Yoga, especially those who may<br>live an isolated life or in a community or area where<br>Yoga has not made any inroads as yet.<br><br>The practice of Yoga does not take a lot of time on<br>oneÂ’s part but it does take a great deal of effort and<br>discipline to make it part of oneÂ’s life. Most<br>teachers know that a thirty - minute practice of<br>various postures that bend and twist the spine and<br>bring flexibility to the joints and muscles of the<br>body is enough.<br><br>But how can such a short period of time really change<br>oneÂ’s life, and do I need such a change?<br><br>Yoga works on the mind and body through its postures<br>and techniques in ways different then other physical<br>activities as it has an affect on all systems of the<br>body, bringing them to a point and state where they<br>function with a higher degree of efficiency.<br><br>The change that many of us need is not something that<br>we are always mindful about.<br><br>We may have everything that we need and wish for in<br>life, but still have a difficult time having a sound<br>nightÂ’s sleep, or have other problems with our health<br>such as high blood pressure or chronic constipation.<br><br>We may also find ourselves to be people who run out of<br>energy, feel bored or depressed at times, or be people<br>who easily become impatient or angry.<br><br>The practice of Yoga, with itÂ’s emphasis on breathing,<br>stillness, movement, healthy diet, sleep and leisure<br>activities, and a more gentler and wiser approach to<br>both ourselves and others focuses the mind, making it<br>an instrument that we can use to achieve various<br>worthwhile and wholesome goals, instead of a mass of<br>energy that can lead us astray and even victimize us.<br><br>Cultivating a thirty-minute commitment to learning and<br>practicing it each day is worth your effort and time.<br><br>Â©2007 John C. Kimbrough<br><br></div>
