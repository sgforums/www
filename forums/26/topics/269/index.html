I grad in '97.<br>Hmm... I didn't know the choir is so happening in CJ, when i was there I didn't even know there's a choir. Ha ha!<br>CJ is a nice place, with friends and all that. A very happy place, but sadly it's not condusive place to study. Anyway I flunk my A's there. If you want to do well in your studies, don't go CJ.<br>anyway that's my opinion to my times then, maybe now it's a different story altogether.<br>anyway, good luck to all the CJCians out there!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To keratinize:<br><br>Well...i'm pretty sure you've neva heard of a choir in CJ... cos we onli started like in 1999 or 2000... yah smthing like that.<br><br>Well...I don't think that Cj isn't a condusive enviroment. I most of it depends on your own motivation to study. I believe that no matter where you go... as in which JC you would end up in, you will still be distracted in your studies in some way or another.<br><br>So basically... it all boils down to yourself. I'm really sorry you din do well. Dun think many ppl from 1999/2000 batch did VERY well oso lar...<br>I mean...basically ppl who end up in CJ have already "given up" on themselves juz because on the reputation of their school.<br><br>Letz hope that my batch change all that.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi everyone... i was from the 98/99 batch...from the time i came in to cjc..everyone seems to complain abt SML...SML this SML tt......for one thing...our school doesn't even have it's own running track...the school canteen food suxz big time until the student council had no choice but to start a protest....and the renovation of the school went on for so many years...remembered tt Glenn Ong made fun of the school abt how long the construction has been going on when one of our students called in to make a dedication...... I also heard rumors abt the school not having enuff funds to keep the renovation going on.....the school carnival not raising enuff funds for the school, but the worst had gotta be the pregnacy rate being the highest.... Wif all these stuff going around, whose parents would wanna send their children here...The thing abt the pregnacy rate dates back to the time b4 SML was the principal....but even then, the school didn't do so bad after all....i gotta hand it to SML for doing all the "Wonderful" things for the school...<br>I fully agree wif wat Blossom7 said...we can onli depend on ourselves if we wanna make it....the sci fac teachers mostly cannot make it one....as for eca....i think AVA is the most happening eca of all time,everytime use AvA as excuse to chao morning assembly...somemore if u join AVA ...u confirm can get important posts one...like our Balvinder Singh...president of AVA....i was the head of broadcast...wahahahahahaha</div>

Sadly, I doubt you have that character to even learn how to.<br><br>Furthermore can you justify that all your post is with any reference to the topic?<br>A pot calling the kettle black.<br><br>With reference to the topic now, I suppose people like YTAT are the kind who truely "downgrade" the image of CJ.<br><br>CJ is still being confined to the Junior College with the highest birthrate image to me and most of my friends if we ever talk about CJ. The image is still there.<br><br>With regards to the topic starter, may I question, what do you mean by people? Adults or students from other schools?<br><br>If it is adult, like Koolburn said, would any parents really want their child to be a school with such a image? If I am one, I would object my child from entering such a JC.<br><br>As for my very personal view of CJ.<br>I just take CJ to be any other JCs with the exception that it creates a imagery of a JC with the highest birthrate in Singapore.<br><br>[This message has been edited by tango (edited 20 March 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i came here to share my exprience in cjc wif others...not to trade insults at others.The stuff tt i tok abt were gathered from the students of my cohort. I dun see any reason to start scolding pple here. All i wanna do is chit-chat and have fun, tt's all.<br><br>YTAT, i think you are juz a 17 or 18 yr old prick who juz wanna seek attention. By posting those replies, u are juz trying to make yourself look good while trying to make me a fool....well, who gives a damn abt u?? You like to keep doing personal attack rite? if you're, u're merely condescending yourself. Can see tt no one actually bothers abt wat u say.<br><br>Anyway, i was reading your posting on another topic...seems tt u like to give spastic reply when others are asking who is the chioest in CJC, u think it's very farnie izzit? On top of tt, u can't even do proper hanyu pinyin...<strong>now i see y we produce students tt fail badly for Chinese every year...can't even get the basics right, not bad...must have learnt it from your sec school one...and which one is tt ah? </strong> Sounds familiar??? U like to play it nasty? I can play along wif u as much as u like..since u like the limelight so much.<br><br>Knoe who u're trifling wif b4 u try anything farnie.</div>
