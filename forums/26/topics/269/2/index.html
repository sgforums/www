I'm sorrie for tt.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>You also noe very well that there is no such thing as "CJ high abotion rate"...so dun write such crap in MY topic!!! Or am i wrong...because you yourself played your part in the abortion rate!!</strong></blockquote><br><br>What i wrote was not crap but the truth....even the teachers themselves knoe abt it. It existed b4 SML became the principal...y dun u ask your teachers?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>You also know very well that YOU most probably also contributed to the bad ranking of CJ... most probably because of the fact that you dun even like the school...At least the ppl in our batch now are proud of who we are and where we are from!!

Of course there are things tt i'm proud of, but certainly not SML or the canteen.... I once saw this website which was sorta like a guide for students who wanna go jcs...CJC got the lowest rating for canteen food, for crying out loud. They had a list of complains abt all the food in the canteen. Dunno whether they updated the info. Anyone care to fill me in wif the URL of tt site?<br>If tt's how u define mature...i got nothing to say.<br><br>[quote]<strong><br>Yes... i may have placed a complain in this forum about another teacher...but that is because i have a personal grudge with her...Do you have anything personal with SML?<br>Not that i enjoy being around her...but everything she do is for the good of the school...AND ONLY MATURE PPL WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT!!<br>Point proven!!<br></strong></div></blockquote><strong>Not building a track juz to cut down on costs when all other schools have it, spending so much $$$ on tt fountain when they could have use it on something else.......all for the good of the school???!!

I absolutely loved it there cos I found great friends and much fulfilment from my ECA, Ad CAmp. (Doesn't hurt to have found my first and last bf there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>I would say one pitfall of CJC is SML. She really made life distasteful for us. (doesn't help that she was also my secondary school principal!)<br><br>CJC (or any other school for that matter) can be a wonderful place to gain an education if one deems it to be. So for all those out there who feel that CJ is a lousy place, think again.<br><br>Take Care ya all!<br></div>

These students are usually those tt don't  study &amp; do well in "o" . Worst of all they continue to behave the same @CJ for "A" hence we will always be @ the bottom.<br>Stop this Connection shit all will be fine. When I went to CJC in 98/99 it was still quite good in ranking ,at least our commerce still rank among the top if not somewhere near . My fellow classmates are all quite hardworking &amp; many have did well now. And, my own grp of friends are mostly getting  first class or 2nd upp class honors in NTU/NUS . For me no honors but still a Master from NTU.<br>So don't despaire current students - it is you that make the difference " Damn the Stupid Ranking shit"<br><br>Ex-CJC commerce student</div>
