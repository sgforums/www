            <div class='col-md body'>Social Phobia<br>Imagine going through your whole life constantly fearing others opinions of you, saying things just seek the approval of your peers and being scared to go out in public for fear people are scrutinising your every move.<br><br>"I thought that was life. It was for me for years, but luckily now I know better," says Sarah who suffers from social phobia.<br><br>Do you worry about making a fool of yourself in front of other people, feel anxious before going into any social situation and avoid parties like the plague? If so then you may well be suffering from social phobia.<br><br>The World Psychiatric Association estimates as little as three but possibly up to 15% of the population suffers from whatÂ’s known as social phobia or social anxiety disorder. Of those who suffer only 25% seek help.<br><br>Social phobia is the inability to face social situations due to extreme fear of being watched, scrutinised or judged by others. Both men and women are as equally susceptible and the disorder is not discriminated by culture. The disorder is believed to develop during adolescence with approximately 40% of social phobias occurring before the age of ten and 95% before the age of 20.<br><br>Social phobias can be inherited or learned. Clinical psychologist and social phobia specialist, Catherine Madigan says, "Hereditary or genetic influenced can account for 30% of the chance of developing social phobia with environmental factors accounting for the remaining 70%". Environmental factors can include "traumatic experiences of humiliation, upbringing by parents, observing and learning from the social behaviour of parents, class mates, etc", says Catherine.<br><br>People who suffer from social phobia encounter difficulties when speaking in public, eating and drinking in public, writing in front of others, meeting new people, being the centre of attention, being watched doing something, using the telephone or even when having to speak to authority figures.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Many of you at this moment can probably empathise with several of these scenarios, however be careful not to confuse social phobia with shyness. To differentiate the two, Catherine says, "People with social phobia experience impairment in their social or occupational functioning. Shyness tends to be generalised whereas social phobia tends to be fears of specific activities such as far of public speaking, talking on the phone or dating".</strong><br><br>Social phobias go way beyond a personÂ’s inability to talk in public or ask someone on a date, when someone experiences a threatening situation they may experience physiological symptoms such as a rapid heartbeat, sweating, blushing or a feeling of panic. Sufferers usually realise their fears are irrational, excessive or unreasonable yet are unable to control their feelings.1<br><br>Many sufferers are afraid to admit they have the disorder. For fear theyÂ’ve failed. If you can identify with any of the above mentioned scenarios then you may well be suffering from social phobia. Further if you are a family member of friend who knows someone with social phobia then you must attempt to help this person.<br><br>To identify if someone close to you have a social phobia, Catherine says, " Firstly you need to ask them questions- the person may be depressed and/or have panic disorder rather than social anxiety. You would ask someone whether they feared e.g.: being introduced, dealing with authority figures, speaking on the phone, being watched doing something, eating in front of people, writing in front of others or public speaking.<br><br>You would then ask the person if they experienced physical symptoms of anxiety such as blushing, sweating, tense muscles or headaches when exposed to feared social situations." However, note that not al individuals report the above symptoms but might simply feel very self conscious, fearful and apprehensive.<br><br>Given people with social phobia fear being negatively judged, if you were to raise the issue with them it is highly probably that they would become distressed. Hence the importance of ensuring the issue is raised in a tactful and empathetic way. Catherine suggests," it may be helpful to disclose some of your own social fears or uncomfortable social experiences, so the sufferer will feel less threatened. If perhaps you think your partner is refusing to go to a party because of social phobia say, " Sometimes I feel like the odd one out at parties. Do you ever feel that that?" This way you are making the person feel comfortable in that they are not alone in how they feel."<br><br>Another alternative Catherine suggests is to steer the conversation around to someone famous who has divulged they have social anxiety using celebrities such as Susie OÂ’Neill (swimmer) or Gary Mc Donald( actor) as starting points. The person says to the suspected sufferer have you ever felt like Gary or Susie?" Again this helps the person to identify with someone else and not feel so isolated in their feelings.<br><br>If you suspect an individual may be suffering from the disorder but they deny it and refuse to seek help Catherine says, "You can still help them by providing them with literature, books and newspaper articles. You can give them to the person directly or be more subtle by leaving them on the coffee tableÂ’."<br><br>Social phobia is treatable but not curable and there are various methods by which social phobia can be managed. Once the disorder is under control, if the learned practices are not continually implemented the problem can resurface with just as much vengeance.<br><br>The most common and readily accepted method of treating social phobia is via psychological treatment (One of )the methods psychologists use is called cognitive behaviour therapy(CBT). This therapy is not solely use for people suffering from social phobia but can also be used to treat many other conditions. Administration of CBT encompasses both relaxation training and exposure therapy.<br><br>"In CBT the psychologist asks the sufferer questions to determine which social situations are feared and how the sufferer acts and thinks in these social situations. The psychologist helps the sufferer identify the problematic behaviours and thoughts and helps them develop more effective coping strategies," says Catherine. CBT can be performed in a group or individual setting. It has been shown with effective implementation of CBT people have been able to remarkably improve the severity of the condition in as little as 12 sessions.<br><br>Exercise also has a place in treating social phobia because it is an effective means of releasing tension, stress and anxiety. Exercise also triggers feelings of calmness and happiness. Further, regular exercise boosts physical fitness and helps control weight, which in turn positively effects self esteem.2<br><br>Using natural products and methods such as those used by naturopaths is an alternative method to controlling social phobia. Natural methods include administering mixtures of aromatic herbs and flower essences to help calm down the bodyÂ’s nervous system. The most popular remedy at present is called Bach Flower Rescue Remedy. This particular remedy involves combining cherry, plum, clematis, impatiens, rock rose and Star of Bethlehem. This remedy has been used to alleviate the physiological symptoms of social phobia, by alleviating the anxiety experienced by sufferers. The Bach flower rescue remedy, can help deal with any emergency or stressful event, such as taking a driving test, exam nerves or speaking in public.<br><br>Medication can also be prescribed by doctors and psychiatrists to deal with the disorder, but again tend to deal only with alleviating the physiological aspects of the problem rather than eliminating the cause. Medications such as beta blockers which aim to lower the heart rate may be administered. Anti-depressants can help to stop the anxiety and panics, although they take a few weeks to kick in and can have some undesirable side effects. Tranquillisers such as Valium were used in the past to treat all sorts of anxiety but are addictive and not as effective in the long run3.<br><br>If social phobia is left untreated Catherine says," The sufferer may end up single, less educated, financially dependent or less well off. They may also go on to develop additional psychiatric disorders such as alcoholism, drug abuse and be socially isolated. The very worst case scenario is they may commit suicide".<br><br>The good news though is help is readily available. If you suspect you re suffering or someone close to you is suffering from social phobia, do yourself and/or them a favour and seek help. There are a number of psychologists, psychiatrists ,general practitioners, support groups, workshops, courses and community groups who are available to help so there is no need to feel segregated and alone.<br><br>Catherine Madigan is a psychologist who specialises in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. She offers both individual and group therapy<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Emerging From Social Anxiety </strong><br><br>For those who suffer from a social phobia there's always a dark cloud overhead about to rain on their parade, writes the War Cry.<br><br>We have all, at one time or another, suffered from a bad (and ill timed) case of nerves before a social or professional event.<br><br>Maybe it accompanied our first foray into public speaking or our first big birthday party, however, most of us find that after a while we get used to the situation, and are able to control our nerves. Yet for some people within our community the thought of having to place themselves in social situations can make them physically ill. Unsurprisingly, such people suffer from something known as " social phobia".<br><br>Research has shown that people most likely to suffer from a social phobia tend to display emotional personality traits and, as such as more likely to become depressed, anxious and have panic attacks. Social phobias can also develop through a combination of negative experiences, poor nurturing and genetic inheritance.<br><br>Growing up, we are each presented with situations which test our resolve and maturity, and in everyone's childhood there will be experiences that have affected us negatively. For some, these experiences carry more than just a resonance into their adult lives.<br><br>For example, standing in front of a class giving your first talk and being presented with a roomful of disinterested, maybe even hostile, faces would be a distasteful memory for most of us. But for those more sensitive to their external environment, the situation could spark and endless cycle of social problems.<br><br>People suffering from social phobia experience a variety of symptoms when faced with a feared social situation. The most common symptom is known as anticipatory anxiety. Catherine Madigan, a Melbourne based clinical psychologist who treats social phobias, explains why sufferers experience such as reaction.<br><br>"People with a social phobia have a fear of being negatively evaluated or judged by others. They worry that when they get into a social situation they will do something to embarrass or humiliate themselves".<br><br>When sufferers find themselves in this situation, the anxiety that occurs gets even worse. Some people experience panic attacks, sweating, heart pounding, nausea, shaking, blushing and a variety of other symptoms. These symptoms usually cause sufferers to avoid social situations, which, depending on the phobia, can cause them to lead isolated, perhaps even unfulfilled lives.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Luckily for social phobia sufferers there is help available. In Melbourne, Madigan, runs a treatment program, which, she claims, is 80% effective. The program, designed by a group of American psychologists, is also geared towards showing sufferers how to finally enjoy life in a friendly group situationÂ….. Madigan explains"because sufferers have a fear of being negatively evaluated by others it is more realistic to be in a group".<br><br>The treatment is based on a 3 point premise-graded, repeated and prolonged exposure to the feared situation. Grading the treatment means you expose the sufferer to their least feared situation, then when they can cope with that they move onto the next hurdle, until they reach the hardest possible scenario for them.<br><br>By repeating the exposure to the situation the sufferer gets used to feelings of anxiety, and becomes more able to deal with them. More importantly, the exposure to the situation has to be prolonged. The person is not allowed to leave just because they feel uncomfortable." By prolonging the time in the situation, sufferers learn that after a while, their anxiety levels come down and they can tolerate being there", says Madigan. "Furthermore, they learn that the next time they find themselves in the situation they feel more positive and relaxed".<br><br>The success of the program depends upon the amount of work people are willing to put into their own treatment, she says.<br><br>"Social phobias are something you need to keep working on, the treatment helps you to improve a lot but unless you keep up your social contacts, social phobias can start creeping back."<br><br>Receiving group therapy for the treatment of phobias can be a fun and effective way to come to terms with the problem. It not only helps people to deal with life hindering problems, but gives group support. By introducing sufferers to a social environment, everyone can help each other get the best possible treatment for their problem.<br><br>Article written by Danielle Johanesen.

            <div class='col-md body'>Tim BurtonÂ’s Edward Scissorhands as a Psychological Allegory<br>by Cory Sampson<br><br>Edward Scissorhands was the first film directed by Tim Burton where he was also the story-writer. For the story of Edward Scissorhands, he worked with Caroline Thompson; this was their first film together, though the pair collaborated on several other projects after Edward Scissorhands. Tim BurtonÂ’s reputation as a film-maker has achieved something of a cult status; the dark and sometimes disturbing imagery employed in many of his films can either alienate or elevate a person, depending on their preference; Edward Scissorhands is also something of a cult film. His unique and recognizable visual art and tendency to sympathize with the outsider has led some to see Burton as an auteur. The singularity of his movies may have less to do with Burton as auteur, and more to do with the people commonly involved in his films; musician Danny Elfman, costume designer Colleen Atwood, and actress Winona Ryder are a few examples of some Burton collaborators involved with Burton projects aside from Edward Scissorhands. Nevertheless, this film seems to aptly support the notion of Burton as an auteur, as the allegorical structure of the film is supported by its cinematography, and its message is in keeping with the common theme of disability and the well-meaning outsider often explored by Burton in both films and books; here, it seems as though Burton has, either accidentally or intentionally, constructed a near-perfect allegory of a man afflicted with the autistic spectrum disorder known as AspergerÂ’s Syndrome.<br><br>AspergerÂ’s Syndrome has recently been the center of much attention; the disorder was reported in 1944 by physician Hans Asperger, at around the same time autism was being discovered. It was not until 1994 however, that AspergerÂ’s Syndrome was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), in its fourth edition. Before then, many individuals with the syndrome went undiagnosed, or were misdiagnosed with either Attention Deficit Disorder, or other similar disorders (Kirby). The disorder is characterized by severe impairment in social faculties, particularly in recognition of social or emotional cues (empathy), and in social or emotional reciprocity. Often, individuals with AspergerÂ’s Syndrome desire social interaction, but are unable to perform socially due to this deficit in interpreting subtle and unwritten social rules. Often individuals with AspergerÂ’s Syndrome will excel in one particular intellectual subject, which they pursue with abnormal intensity and focus. In adults with the disorder, a lifetime of social retardation can lead to withdrawal from social situations, focussing on their work.<br><br>The character of Edward Scissorhands seems to fit the profile of an individual with the disorder. At the beginning of the film, he is isolated and withdrawn in a highly ornate mansion overlooking a bright pastel-coloured suburban neighbourhood. He works intensely on his lawn sculptures, which are fashioned down to intricate detail. He is taken into the neighbourhood by Peg Boggs, his real social awakening. The transition is confusing, and he has trouble adjusting, yet he desires to be loved and to socialize (his first words to Peg are Â“donÂ’t go,Â” suggesting a desire for social contact in lieu of isolation). He is admired for his talent as gardener and hairdresser (which his scissor hands make exceptionally easy), and yet his manner is disaffected or sometimes inappropriate (as in the scene where Joyce Monroe unsuccessfully tries to seduce him). He is eventually coerced into breaking into a house, under the suggestion of Kim Boggs. When he is arrested, he is examined by a psychiatrist who says that he will be alright out in the world. After the community turns against him, and he again runs afoul of the law, he returns to the mansion again to live in isolation from the world.<br><br>These details, when symbolism is applied with a psychoanalytical approach to the character of Edward Scissorhands, reveals the allegorical nature of this film. The most obvious symbol is the set of scissors Edward has for hands. These represent his social faculties, and the difficulties they present to him. Throughout the film, Edward is shown to be greatly impaired when it comes to everyday activities, such as dressing, using eating utensils, or turning a doorknob. While this could be taken simply as allegory for physical disability, there are a few other instances which suggest social impairment as it occurs with AspergerÂ’s Syndrome. Edward is constantly cutting and scarring his own face accidentally; this scarring could represent the emotional scarring of failed social attempts caused by inability to subtly manipulate social situations.<br>While driving home with Peg, he reaches across with his hand to point at something, causing Peg to yell with distress. He is embarrassed afterward with his behaviour, once it is apparent he has done something wrong. His scissors actively impair him from becoming close to a person romantically; Kim Boggs asks Edward to hold him, to which he replies, Â“I canÂ’t.Â” This is also a desire but an inability to reciprocate emotionally. This is perhaps mitigated by the editing, where in the next scene, we cut back in time to a memory of EdwardÂ’s inventor dying before being able to give him the hands he needs to manipulate (or, in this allegorical reading, function socially). The ice sculptures are perhaps an attempt to show affection in an indirect and demonstrative way; he makes a statue of Kim as an angel, and she dances about in the Â“snowÂ” that flies from it as he sculpts. Though he cannot connect with an individual on a reciprocative and empathetic level, he can still make affection known through an outward display of it. Though he cannot touch Kim directly without hurting her, he can Â“touchÂ” her through the snow that falls upon her. Here, the scissors represent an AS individualÂ’s attempt to compensate for social deficit with other more advanced mental faculties.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While the scissors represent his awkward social faculties, they also represent the facility many AS individuals have with a certain specialized topic area. The most obvious is the lawn sculptures and ice statues. These might represent a kind of social surrogate, fantastic constructs to replace actual people with a more predictable model. This seems to be supported by the fact that ice sculptures of finer detail supplement the lawn sculptures after Edward has been socially awakened. Also important to note is that before descending to the neighbourhood, he did not sculpt figures of people, and that the first sculpture of a human that he did was of the Boggs family, his first real social contact. At least one of the sculptures in the mansion courtyard represents a desire: the hand sculpture, on a literal level, represents his desire for functional hands. On the allegorical level, it represents his desire for the tools necessary for social interaction, a common desire among AS individuals. This is exacerbated by the placement of the hand sculpture both centrally in the set, and centrally in the frame on many occasions when it is shown. When working with his scissors, either sculpting, cutting hair or chopping vegetables, he takes on a facial expression of intensity and drive, which is at the same time blank, shutting out the world outside of his work.<br><br>This is similar to the focus certain AS individuals experience when concentrating on a project that piques their interest. Edward also feels an odd compulsion to cut or groom things, sometimes to distraction, as in the scene where he stops to snip at a hedge while on his way to break into JimÂ’s fatherÂ’s house. Many AS individuals, during conversation, tend to perseverate, or continue to return to a certain discussion topic of interest to them, despite changes in the flow of conversation (Bauer). Sometimes, due to difficulty interpreting a personÂ’s intentions, someone with AspergerÂ’s Syndrome can be exploited for various purposes; Edward experiences something similar on two occasions: when he first unlocks the door for Jim and Kim, and when Kim asks him to break into JimÂ’s fatherÂ’s house, at JimÂ’s request. His particular talent for picking locks with his scissor hands is exploited. He also seems unable to tell the difference between who is really a friend and who is exploiting him; the scene following the initial unlocking is of him on a talk show. His response to the first question of what he most enjoys about living in the neighbourhood is Â“the friends IÂ’ve made.Â” When he breaks into JimÂ’s fatherÂ’s house, he tells Kim that he did it simply because she asked him to.<br><br>On several occasions, he hurts others or destroys by accident, or a misunderstanding about his scissors leads to trouble. The first such occasion is when Peg first sees Edward, and is terrified by his scissors. The scarring of his face IÂ’ve already mentioned. He nearly ends up shot by the police when they ask him to Â“drop [his] weaponÂ” as he is leaving JimÂ’s fatherÂ’s house. He accidentally cuts KimÂ’s hand as he is finishing the ice sculpture, and he cuts Kevin BoggsÂ’ face while attempting to console him after almost being run over by Jim. When his Â“fatherÂ”, the inventor, dies before giving Edward his hands, Edward attempts to caress the inventorÂ’s face, and in doing so, cuts it. These accidents could represent the damage an AS individual may inadvertently cause through ignorance of social cues; often AS individuals can say or do things which may be considered rude or insensitive simply because they were unaware of how hurtful they were. When Edward cuts the drapes, towels and wallpaper in anger and despair after being betrayed by Jim, it might represent the anger and acting out at certain developmental stages, due to difficulty coping socially (Bauer).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>It is important to note that the character of Edward Scissorhands is probably not intended to have AspergerÂ’s Syndrome; merely the allegorical construct is representative of the difficulties facing an individual with AspergerÂ’s Syndrome. Nevertheless, Edward does have some personality traits that are in common with AS individuals which stand independent of the allegory of the scissor hands. His facial expression is blank and uncommunicative. Many AS individuals, due to perceptual difficulty, do not learn to interpret or communicate non-verbally through facial expression, except in basic ways. Individuals with AspergerÂ’s Syndrome also tend to have a neutral tone of voice, with odd or inappropriate inflection; throughout the film, Edward speaks in a monotone. He has trouble interpreting figurative language or subtlety. When the bank manager speaks to him condescendingly about his handicap, Edward smiles as though the bank manager has made a friendly gesture. When Bill Boggs uses the idiom Â“soupÂ’s on!Â” Edward does not understand, and replies through a full mouth, Â“I thought these were shish-kebab.Â” Bill responds by telling Edward not to take things so literally. Some AS individuals have difficulty interpreting figurative language, sarcasm or idiom until learned. It is telling cinematographically that this scene is immediately followed by the scene in which the inventor is attempting to teach Edward about etiquette. Toward the end of this scene, the inventor decides that this is too Â“boringÂ”, and reads a humorous limerick. Edward must be told where it is appropriate to laugh. During one scene, before Edward must meet the neighbours at the barbecue, Peg tells Edward not to worry, and that all he needs to do is be himself. This seems reminiscent of an anecdote told by an AS individual about the difficulty of fitting in socially. Â“I decided to follow the advice people had been giving me for a very long time. I decided to BE MYSELF (sic) Â… I'm not completely sure what kind of an impact this had on other people but during my second year, they would sometimes tell me I was too genuine and that I needed to put on a bit of a mask. I simply couldn't win either way.Â” (Segar chapter 7).<br><br>Cinematographically, the audience is given hints of EdwardÂ’s peculiarity, and is meant to sympathize. Due to their lack of context for social niceties, AS individuals often perceive the world of human interaction as absurd and superficial. Through visual and narrative cues, the neighbourhood is portrayed as exceptionally absurd. The odd pastel coloured houses are one such cue; as is their constant gossiping behaviour, which is taken to excess. They are so eager for information that they manage to fill PegÂ’s entire answering machine tape. This allusion to the absurdity of the neighbourhoodÂ’s social behaviour might give the audience some context for understanding the AS individualÂ’s perception of the world.<br><br>Ultimately, and most supportive of the theory of Burton as an auteur, is the defeatist point that a person with a disability cannot function in society, and must be isolated for their own good and the good of their loved ones. Peg remarks, toward the end of the film that she didnÂ’t think things through when she brought Edward into the neighbourhood, and it might be best if he went Â“back up thereÂ”, meaning the mansion (or allegorically, into social withdrawal). This is supported in at least one other work by Tim Burton: the pseudo-childrenÂ’s book The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories. In the headline story, a boy who is half-oyster seems to be the cause of his fatherÂ’s impotence. Since oysters are an aphrodisiac, the doctor suggests that the man should eat his son. The implication here is that disability can cause severe emotional problems to those who must care for or deal with the disabled; and that while cruel, the disenfranchisement or isolation of the disabled is a dismal solution to these problems. The book itself is filled with several tales on similar lines; one of a boy who is born a robot (again, a suggestive symbol for someone on the autistic spectrum) is among these stories.<br><br>The most puzzling question this allegorical reading raises is this: why would Tim Burton, who seems to have had no knowledge of autism or AspergerÂ’s syndrome have written such a precise allegory for the disorder? I would guess that the only way Tim Burton could have written this story, with all its implications, both subtle and overt, is if he himself is an individual with a disorder on the autistic spectrum, or was very close to a person similarly afflicted. Burton himself is described as an Â“introverted, unassuming personÂ” (Jackson, McDermott). In his own biography, Burton on Burton, he says, about his childhood, that he was often alone, and had trouble retaining friendships. Â“I get the feeling people just got this urge to want to leave me alone for some reason, I donÂ’t know exactly why. It was as if I was exuding some kind of aura that said Â‘Leave Me The Fuck Alone (sic)Â’Â” (Burton 2) Of course, with no psychoanalysis of the man, there is no real way to say for certain that he falls on the autistic spectrum; yet Edward Scissorhands suggests a certain sympathy for the symptoms and circumstances of individuals who do.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SOCIAL PHOBIA: COMMON BUT UNDERRECOGNIZED</strong><br><br>It's the third most prevalent psychiatric disorder, and yet many people have never heard of it.  This is Dr. Steven Andrew Davis, Speaking of Health.  According to the National Co-morbidity Survey, the most common psychiatric disorder is substance abuse and second is depression.  In third place is what psychiatrists call social anxiety disorder or simply social phobia.<br>Now this is not the same as agoraphobia or claustrophobia, and it's not just nervousness or shyness.  The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders lays down diagnostic criteria for social phobia.  Someone who suffers form social phobia fears "that he or she will act in a way (or show anxiety symptoms) that will be humiliating or embarrassing.  In social phobia "exposure to a feared social situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which amy take the form of...panic attack."<br><br>Now the patient who has social phobia knows that his or her fear is "excessive or unreasonable' and deals with these situations, either by avoiding them altogether or else going through with them, but now without enduring "intense anxiety or distress".<br><br>Most people feel anxious or nervous from time to time, but in social phobia the avoidance or distress "interferes significantly with the person's normal routine", at their work or school social activities or relationships.<br><br>It may be confusing to some people to think that what they consider nervousness may be a part of a psychiatric disorder.  On the other hand, knowing that social phobia exists may prod individuals and families to seek professional help; to find out whether they fit the diagnostic criteria, and to access drug and non-drug interventions can help.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Diagnostic Criteria for Social Phobia:</strong><br><br>A.  A marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others.  The individual fears that he or she will act in a way (or show anxiety symptoms) that will be humiliating or embarrassing.  NOTE:  In children, there must be evidence of the capacity for age-appropriate social relationships with familiar people and the anxiety must occur in peer settings, not just in interactions with adults.<br><br>B.  Exposure to the feared social situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally predisposed panic attack.  NOTE:  In children, the anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing or shrinking from social situations with unfamiliar people.<br><br>C.  The person recognized that the fear is excessive or unreasonable.  NOTE:  In children, this feature may be absent.<br><br>D.  The feared social or performance situations are avoided or else are endured with intense anxiety or distress.<br><br>E.  The avoidance,, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared social or performance situations(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational (academic) functioning or social activities or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the phobia.<br><br>F.  In individuals under 18 years of age, the duration is at least six months.<br><br>G.  The fear or avoidance is not due to the direct physiologic effects of a substance (e.g., a drug abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition and is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, separation anxiety disorder body dysmorphic disorder a pervasive developmental disorder or schizoid personality disorder).<br><br>H.  If a general medical condition or another mental disorder is present, the fear in Criterion A is unrelated to it; (e.g., the fear is not of stuttering, trembling in Parkinson's disease or exhibiting abnormal eating behavior in anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.)<br><br></div>
