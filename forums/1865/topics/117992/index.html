            <div class='col-md body'>What is Trichotillomania?<br>It is officially classified as an impulse control disorder, along the lines of pyromania, kleptomania, and pathologic gambling.<br><br>What are the Symptoms of Trichotillomania?<br>Recurrent pulling out of oneÂ’s hair resulting in noticeable hair loss.<br>An increasing sense of tension immediately before pulling out the hair or when resisting the behavior.<br>Pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair.<br>The disturbance is not accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition (i.e., dermatological condition).<br>The disturbance causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.<br><br>How and When Does it Start?<br>People often start compulsive hair-pulling around the ages of 12-13; although it is not uncommon for it to start at a much younger or older age. Frequently, a stressful event can be associated with the onset, such as: change of schools, abuse, family conflict, or the death of a parent. The symptoms also may be triggered by pubertal hormonal changes.<br><br>Does Trichotillomania Lead To Other Problems?<br>During adolescence, which is an especially crucial time for developing self-esteem, body image, comfort with sexuality, and relationships with peers of both sexes, teens may endure ridicule from family, friends, or classmates, in addition to feeling shame over their inability to control the habit. Therefore, even a small bald patch can cause devastating problems with development that can last life-long. Although many people with trichotillomania get married and carry on with their lives in a normal fashion; there are those who have avoided intimate relationships for fear of having their shameful secret exposed.<br><br>What Is the Cause?<br>There is no certain cause of trichotillomania, but the current way of looking at trichotillomania is as a medical illness. One theory on a biological level is that there is some disruption in the system involving one of the chemical messengers between the nerve cells in parts of the brain. There may be also a combination of factors such as a genetic predisposition and an aggravating stress or circumstance; as with many other illnesses. Further, trichotillomania could be a symptom caused by different factors in different individuals just as a cough can be produced by a multitude of different medical problems. Finding the cause(s) will take more research.<br><br>What Is The Relation To Other Illnesses?<br>For many people with trichotillomania, there are symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) such as compulsive counting, checking, or washing as well. There are so many similarities between hair pulling and other compulsive symptoms that some consider it a subtype or variant of OCD. This idea is supported by the tendency for the two problems to run in the same families and the fact that OCD medications can be helpful in treating trichotillomania.<br><br>Depression also frequently occurs in individuals with this illness. There may be a direct neuro-biochemical relationship and/or be secondary to the chronic demoralization and low self esteem hair-pulling can bring.<br><br>Other associated behaviors may include nail biting, thumb sucking, head banging, or compulsive scratching. Frequently, hair pullers also find they compulsively pick at their skin, which may also cause physical and emotional scarring.<br><br>What Treatments Are Available?<br>The two methods of treatment that have been scientifically researched and found to be effective are behavioral therapy and medications.<br><br>Therapy:<br>In behavioral therapy, people learn a structured method of keeping track of the symptoms and associated behaviors, increasing awareness of pulling, substituting incompatible behaviors and several other techniques aimed at reversing the Â“habitÂ” of pulling.<br><br>Medications:<br>Although medications clearly help some people temporarily, symptoms are likely to return when the medication is stopped unless behavioral therapy is incorporated into treatment. Medications may help to reduce the depression and any obsessive-compulsive symptoms the person may be experiencing.<br><br>Commonly used medications are:<br><br>fluoxetine (Prozac)<br>fluvoxamine (Luvox)<br>sertraline (Zoloft)<br>paroxetine (Paxil)<br>clomipramine (Anafranil)<br>valproate (Depakote)<br>lithium carbonate (Lithobid, Eskalith)<br><br><a href="http://www.nmha.org/infoctr/factsheets/92.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nmha.org/infoctr/factsheets/92.cfm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A hairball is a collection of hair or fur formed in the stomach of animals that is occasionally vomited up when it becomes too big. Cats are especially prone to hairball formation since they groom themselves by licking their fur leading to hair going into the stomach.<br><br>Cows are also known for accumulating hairballs, but, as they do not vomit, these are found usually after death and can grow quite large.<br><br>Although uncommon in humans, some hairballs have been reported, often in young girls as a result of trichotillomania and pica. In 2003, a 3-year old girl in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada had a grapefruit-sized hairball surgically removed from her stomach. Hairballs can be quite hazardous in humans, since hair cannot be digested or passed by the human gastrointestinal system, and (assuming it's identified) even vomiting may be ineffective at removing the hair mass. This can result in the general impairment of the digestive system.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hairball in stomach kills teenager<br><br>A British teenager who had a habit of chewing her hair died after a hairball, 12 inches long and 10 inches wide, developed in her stomach. The teenager died after several days of illness. It is thought that the hairball had irritated the lining of her stomach and hours after the operation she suffered massive bleeding.<br><br>It was only after she was admitted to hospital that it was discovered that the hairball had developed in her stomach. The medical diagnosis for the condition is called trichobezoar. Trichobezoars develop over a number of years as hair, which is indigestible, is swallowed and then becomes matted, slowly growing into a ball.<br><br>Dr Nera Patel, a pathologist, said the teenager's stomach wall had become irritated by the hairball and she had bled from a number of places. He said: "I had never encountered one before. No one in our medical team, of some 30 years' experience, had seen anything like it before. It is very rare." John Lyttle, a consultant surgeon, said that surgery was inherently "dangerous" and there was a 20 per cent death rate with stomach operations.<br><br></div>
