            <div class='col-md body'>"Sometimes they would make me answer phones when they went to lunch. I have a fear of the phone. I only make a few calls a year, and can't answer a call. So this scared me. I couldn't even sit at the desk, I would pace the office. I would turn the answering machine on and take the messages that way. It's like I can barely speak, like I cant breath. Chest pains, weakness, cold sweats.<br><br>A few years ago I went out on several job interviews. My fear was overwhelming and I messed up all of them. I got panic attacks, I would get cramps and diarheaa. I would pace back and forth for hours and couldn't sleep the day before. After one interview, I ate a whole chocolate cake. I gave that up.<br><br>Got laid off 2 yrs ago and haven't worked since. I tried to go to interviews or open houses. <strong>But I would just walk by, never having the courage to go in. Even if the interviewer called back, I'd be afraid to answer the phone or not return the message.</strong><br><br>The world passed me by. I see my neighbors growing up, making lives for themselves. And it makes me mad. I wish I was normal. I exchange a physical illness for SA in a second. It's like I always hated being around people. I have certain places I go, but an afraid to go somewhere new. It's like I'm in an imaginery prison. "<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>" think I've always been scared of girls around my own age.It's usually worse if they are single for some reason.I think I've missed so much as a result.<br><br>I think we are scared that we will be rejected or not liked by available people of the opposite sex.Rejection is real hard for us sa'r to take,as we will dwell on it for ages and then go over it again when a simmilar situation arrises,where as other just get over it quickly and get on with things.<br><br>I think it starts with shyness and developes from there.I'm at the stage now where I can't make eye contact with a girl or speak more than a few words and appear uninterested and aloof,a big turn off for any girl.<br><br>I would like to develope better social skills,but ain't sure of the best way to go about this.Before it didn't bother me too much,as I was happy being single,but as I grow older I would like to have a girlfriend,but as I have been avoiding this for so long I'm emotionally imature around girls,not sure what to talk about or even act"<br><br>another quote..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another quote..<br><br>"Im having so many problems and im not sure where to go from here. I was diagnosed with a mental illness a long time ago, it left some pretty bad scars with regards to social aspects, such as my inability to work. I just cant do it. something is pushing me away all the time and i just cant go in when all is said and done.<br><br>I run a small home business which isnt massivly successful. it earns a small amount, the problem is without money to advertise im not going to get anywhere, so thats why i need to work.<br><br>I just cant get into a job, i tried again this morning and everytime i feel so bad, problem is this time many people knew about this job today outside my family and its very embarassing,<br><br>i just want to hide away.<br><br>I cant figure out what to do, the home business was supposed to help me get some self respect back etc..but people just laugh and say im lazy. they dont understand. I need help. i have a girlfriend who is so anxious to marry now, we booked a wedding on the assumption i will work, now i see us having to cancel as i cant support myself or anyone, i cant see any way out of this anymore.
