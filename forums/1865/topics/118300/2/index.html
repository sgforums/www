However, stopping can be quite difficult. People can get addicted to self-mutilating much like they can get addicted to drugs or alcohol or cigarettes. At times you may feel very uncomfortable, agitated, and afraid. However, many people have overcome self-mutilation. It may take time and you must be brave. There are several things you can do to stop self-abusing yourself. The technique that most people try is to do ANYTHING but self-injure. There are different emotions you experience when you feel triggered to self-injure, therefore there many different activities you can do:<br><br>If you're feeling mad, frustrated, or restless - try and activity that is physical and violent, but not towards yourself and others:<br>* Slash old clothes, a plastic bottle, or paper<br>* Hit a punching bag or pillow<br>* Hit a pillow against the wall<br>* Rip up a newspaper or old phone book<br>* Cut or smash play-doh or clay models<br>* Throw ice against a brick wall<br>* Break sticks<br>* Go jogging<br><br>If you feel melancholy or depressed - try an activity that is soothing and pamper yourself:<br>* Take bath with scented bubbles or bath salts<br>* Yoga<br>* Vent to a friend<br>* Rent a movie, curl up on the couch, and eat chocolate<br>* Light candles or incense and listen to calm music like Enya or Yanni<br><br>If you feel unreal or having a craving sensation - try an activity that wakes up your senses or causes a quick physical reaction:<br>* Put a finger into frozen food for a minute (like ice cream or yogurt)<br>* Bite into a jalapeno<br>* Snap a rubber band against your wrist<br>* Take a cold bath<br>* Stomp on the ground<br><br>If you want to focus - try an activity that requires concentration:<br>* Play a computer game like Tetris, Solitaire, or Minesweeper<br>* Crochet<br>* Pick an object and write a detailed description about - include size, weight, texture color, possible uses, how it feels<br>* Pick a subject and research it on the web<br>* Choose a random object and try to come up with 30 different uses for it (i.e. - a toothpick, a jar, a pencil)<br><br>If you want to see blood - try an activity that mimics blood:<br>* Paint yourself with red tempera paint<br>* Make red colored ice with food coloring (about 6 or 7 drops per cube) and waters and mark on yourself with the ice<br>* Take a small bottle of liquid red coloring and press the tip against place you want to cut (you can warm it by putting in cup of hot water for a few minutes)<br>If you want to see scars or pick at scabs - try an activity that mimics scars or scabs:<br>* Get a henna tattoo kit - you can put it on as a paste and pick it off like a scab and it leaves an orange colored mark for a few weeks<br><br>If these do not work, you can also try the "15-Minute Game". Tell yourself that if you still want to self-injure yourself in 15 minutes, you can. When the time is up, try for another 15 minutes and so on. You can also try therapy or support groups. There are several organizations created to help people stop self-mutilating.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Major Self Mutilation:<br><br>Major self-mutilation refers to acts that severely damage a significant amount of body tissue. These are usually injuries that can only be inflicted once, such as eye enucleation, facial skinning, amputation of the limbs, breasts or genitals. Major self-mutilation is usually inflicted upon the self while in a hallucinatory or "zombie-like" state. This can be caused by mental retardation, schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, or the influence of drugs or alcohol.<br><br>Sometimes major self-mutilators are unable to explain their injuries. In a case reported by Goodhart and Savitsky in 1933, the subject was a 16 year-old girl who had suffered from chronic encephalitis for eight years prior to the described incident. She was found by her nurse holding her right eye in her hand and claimed that it had fallen out while she slept. Two hours later, her left eye also "fell out". She appeared to experience no pain and appeared unconcerned by her eye enucleation. Later, she would confess that she had felt "hypnotized" and gouged her eyes because of an "irresistible urge."<br><br>When patients can give explanations, they frequently deal with sexual themes including transsexualism, control of hypersexuality and homosexuality. In a 1931 article, Lewis describes a 28-year-old man who was hospitalized after a castration attempt resulted in significant loss of blood. Severely depressed and terrified of homosexuality, he had attempted castration several times in the past. Of one of his attempts he said, "I thought I was a terrible person....it seemed that it might prevent me from indulging in sodomy."<br><br>Another frequent motivation cited for major self-mutilation is religious guilt . Such reasons can include, commands from God or the devil, identification with Christ and punishing oneself for sin. In such cases, a bible verse shows up surprisingly frequently: Matthew 6:22-23: "What I say to you is: anyone who looks lustfully at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his thoughts. If your right eye is your trouble, gouge it out and throw it away! Better to lose part of your body than to have it all cast into Gehenna."<br><br>Interestingly, eye enucleation as described here has been found to "occur only in Christian cultural areas." Favazza searched for, but was unable to find, a single case of self-enucleation in China, Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Japan, or in the aborigines of Australia or natives of Papua New Guinea.<br><br><a href="http://wso.williams.edu/~atimofey/self_mutilation/Definition/What_is/major.html" rel="nofollow">http://wso.williams.edu/~atimofey/self_mutilation/Definition/What_is/major.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE school girls are adopting the bizarre craze of self-mutilation, slashing their hands and arms in what psychiatrists say is a cry for help because they cannot manage their emotions.<br>With no one to talk to, teenaged girls are using penknives and other sharp objects to cut themselves as an escape from school, family and relationship problems.<br><br>"By concentrating on the pain in my arm, I forget about my emotional pain," one 15-year-old told the New Paper.<br><br>Incidents of self-mutilation had been detected at five girls schools, the newspaper reported September 30.<br><br>Child psychiatrist Brian Yeo said many cases went undetected because the girls did not seek treatment and the scars were not obvious.<br><br>"Some also wear thick watches or friendship bands to hide their scars," he said.<br><br>Doctor Linda Semlitz of the Adam road Hospital said girls suffering from personality disorders cut themselves to seek attention.<br><br>"They're overwhelmed so they hurt themselves to get help," she said.<br><br>"Many of them report substantial relief after cutting themselves."<br><br>One 15-year-old, identified only as Mary, said she had repeatedly cut herself over the past two years after failed relationships with other girls and because she could not cope with exam stress.<br><br>"I can't control my feelings. Sometimes, I regret it and tell myself not to do it again. But cutting my hand is the fastest way to relieve pain," she said.<br><br>Another girl said she started cutting herself because her parents gave all their attention to her younger sister.<br><br>"It was painful, but it was nothing compared to the pain in my heart," she said.<br><br>Last week after a quarrel with her boyfriend she carved his initials on her left hand with a knife.<br><br>Pyschiatrist Yeo said self-mutilation was mainly a refuge for girls.

            <div class='col-md body'>honestly it's so common these days.<br><br>as long as it's not over done and the cuts are not too deep . i see nothing wrong.<br><br>for some it's just a phase anyway. Giving advice to other means of venting anger and stress, i feel doesnt really help. Cuz the release is nothing like cutting.</div>
