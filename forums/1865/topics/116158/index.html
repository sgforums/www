            <div class='col-md body'>Suicide has stolen lives around the world and across the centuries. In Singapore, suicide is the main cause of death apart from diseases. National statistics show that on average, 1 person takes his/her own life in Singapore every day. Out of every 100,000 people in Singapore, 11 will kill themselves each year. The most common means of suicide are jumping from high-rise building followed by poisoning and over-dosing.<br><br>All national statistics for suicide in this website are extracted from "Report on Registration of Births and Deaths", compiled by the Registry of Births and Deaths, Singapore.<br><br><a href="http://www.samaritans.org.sg/stats_1.asp?menu=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.samaritans.org.sg/stats_1.asp?menu=4</a></div>
