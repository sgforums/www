            <div class='col-md body'>People with obsessive-compulsive disorder are constantly plagued with anxious and unwelcome thoughts, or have an uncontrollable need to follow rituals.<br><br>Common obsessive or compulsive behaviour of OCD sufferers include obsession with germs or dirt and the need to wash hands over and over again; preoccupation with order or symmetry; constant feelings of doubt and needing to check things repeatedly; spending long periods of time touching or counting things; persistent thoughts of repulsive sexual acts; constant thoughts of violence and fear of unintentionally harming friends and loved ones.<br><br>Symptoms<br>For obsessions:<br><br>Â• Persistent thoughts that seem to have no basis and cause anxiety or distress. For example an overwhelming fear of germs and dirt or worrying about a past event.<br>Â• Always consciously trying to suppress such thoughts.<br>Â• In adults, knowing that such thoughts come from one's own imagination, not from outside factors. However this is not the case for children.<br><br>For compulsions:<br><br>Â• Ritualistic or compulsive behaviours such as washing hands over and over again; checking and rechecking locks several times over, repeatedly tidying up things that have already been tidied; repeating words over and over again.<br>Â• Recognising that the repetitive behaviour is excessive or unreasonable (not the case for children).<br>Â• Becoming depressed or distressed when attempts to control the compulsions fail.<br>Â• Feeling agitated and depressed, refusing to talk.<br>Â• Becoming withdrawn and delusional.<br>Â• Mood swings between feelings of anxiety to despair.<br>Â• Decline in grades due to lack of concentration at school.<br><br>Treatment<br>The mainstay of treatment is to reduce symptoms such as anxiety. It can also help to resolve inner conflicts, and help the patient to deal with anxiety. Drugs such as , antidepressants combined with behavior therapy seem to bring about the best results.<br><br>Conventional Medicine<br>To date, it seems that the tricyclic antidepressant is the most effective anti-obsessional drug.<br><br>Studies have shown that those classes of drugs, which increases serotonin levels in the brain, shows a 30 percent to 60 percent reduction in symptoms in adults and a 70 percent to 80 percent reduction in children. Other antidepressants that have demonstrated good results are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline.<br><br>Behavior therapy will help the patient cope with trying to change a specific behaviour -- by stopping what has been triggering it or by replacing it with a more desirable response.<br><br>Some studies have shown that 60 to 70 % of OCD patients improve with behaviour therapy.<br><br></div>
