            <div class='col-md body'>Huh? No ghosts in Singapore meh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Never see ghosts before but..........................................There was this ODAC nite hike a few years back when I was in AJ first 3 mths. I think it was 1993. We gathered very late at night at Macritchie reservoir. We hike along the cross country path n before long we came to the cemetry opposite it. There will be group walk n solo walk. It was during the group hike that something happened.<br>We were walking in an indian file when I saw people(or .....) walking towards us. If I remembered correctly, there were four of them, each supporting a wooden stilt on their shoulders, walking in unison n in rythmic foot steps(imagine chinese vampires bouncing together, get the picture?). My group passed them n while going pass, no one turn their heads. They didn't notice us too. It was a while after that then I initiate the Qns: "Did u see what I saw?" Then the person behind me n a few other who overheard chorus "U saw the coffin too......n the coffin bearers?".<br>That happened along time ago but my frenz n I still discuss about that particular,creepy nite. Coffins sighted at nite? Burying the dead at this unearthly hour(It was 2/3am)? Who are those (people?)? When u walked the ground at nite, u will hear sounds of twigs breaking underneath ur feet, leaves ruses. But I didn't hear any noise from them.........<br><br>------------------<br>Everyday is a special day, do something special b4 u end this day!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie Here's another ghost story. For those guys who had serve BMT in Nee Soon Camp, ur shd know abt the White House. During BMT one of my friend was a messboy at the Officer Mess. So he had to sleep at the eerie old colonial building with another guy at the end of the day. During one nite, both of them had the same dream of spirits wandering around the White House. One of them was so damn unfortunate as to attract a "lady in white". The lady will only come out during sunset and he happen to take a good look at her face, which is faceless!. Instead of eyes, he saw only deep dark hollows. He starts to haf a mental breakdown and was sent to Woodbridge for psychiatric treatment. Naybe u fella think this story is incredible but I was convinced because another incident happened at the White House. Another pair of Messboys was working and they locked up their bunk b4 going on errants. They switch off all the lights and the TV b4 they left. Imagine their surprise when they came back and saw the TV and lights on with the door still locked! Since the windows are not sound proof the noise of the TV set shd haf alerted them when they approached their bunk. But the sound onli reached them when they are in front of the door. Hmm seems dat ghosts sometimes do haf a sense of humour.</div>

Then they were told not to leave the group but these to guys wanted to go explore by themselves. Then when they came back they were so frightened they when they asked what happened the guys said they saw this lady with long hair and a white dress. Then when they were walking past a door someone said they saw a shadow peering the door and waving!!! So they were freaked and wanted to get out but halfway down the stair this girl suddenly said she cannot move. The rest said her dun play ler cause they thought she was joking. Then she said SERIOUSLY!! I CANNOT MOVE!! so my dance teacher's friend had to carry the poor girl out of the hospital.<br><br>sorry if my story telling sucks..<br><br>------------------<br>Love starts with a smile<br>Grows with a kiss<br>And ends with a tear<br>*~!*~!*~!*~!*~!*~!*~<br>Life is short<br>and so am I</div>
