              <div class="story_text" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 120%;">TORONTO- CANADA'S largest airline is trying to figure out which obese and disabled passengers will be eligible for additional seats at no charge after the country's Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the airlines.
              <p>The Canadian Transportation Agency issued an order last January requiring Air Canada and other domestic airlines to make additional seats free to disabled or obese passengers who need extra room.</p>
              <p>The airlines' appeal was rejected twice - first by the Federal Court of Appeal in May, and then by the country's highest court on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said on Monday they are developing detailed eligibility rules for free seats. The ruling on Thursday applies only to domestic flights and will be implemented on Jan 9, 2009.</p>
              <p>'It's been basically left to the airlines to determine how they are going to comply,' Mr Fitzpatrick said. 'We're working on it now.'</p>
              <p>Under the ruling, airlines cannot charge extra for an obese person who needs an additional seat or a disabled person who needs space for a wheelchair or stretcher or who must be accompanied by an attendant.</p>
              <p>Mr David Baker, the Toronto lawyer who fought the case on behalf of disabled passengers, said the ruling will allow more disabled people to travel.</p>
              <p>Ms Joanne Neubauer of Victoria, one of two people whose complaints sparked the case, said the news made her feel like 'an equal citizen in this country'. Ms Neubauer suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and uses a motorised wheelchair.</p>
              <p>Air Canada and WestJet, Canada's second largest carrier, said they will comply with the transportation agency's order. WestJet spokesman Richard Bartem said his company may consider extending the policy to international flights.</p>
              <p>Bus, train and ferry companies have long made arrangements for free extra seats, but the airline industry had argued it would lose too much money by doing the same.</p>
              <p>The transportation agency rejected claims that providing extra seats would impose an 'undue hardship' on airlines, saying they can afford the financial burden.</p>
              <p>The agency estimated the cost to Air Canada at about C$7 million (S$8.5 million) a year and to WestJet at about C$1.5 million a year. The agency said that amounts to about 77 Canadian cents a ticket for Air Canada and 44 Canadian cents Canadian for WestJet.</p>
              <p>To put it another way, the agency said the cost would be 0.09 per cent of Air Canada's annual passenger revenue and 0.16 per cent of WestJet's revenue. -- AP</p>

              <p>Obesity is a choice, it is not a disease,nor is it a handicap. Even the physically  disabled people only get one seat on planes. What makes it special for obese people to have two seats at the price of one. There is no reason why airline companies, no matter how cash-strapped they are, should carry greater costs just because a small handful of people decide to adopt an unhealthly lifestyle.</p>
              <p>However, i do want to note that only in extreme cases such as Mr. Uribe, the heaviest man in the world, should people ever give in on their conditions. But even so, we can see that Mr. Uribe has made an effort to tackle his obesity. By going on a steamed fish, rice and vegetables diet, he has shed 180kg from his initial 550kg frame. This shows his efforts</p>
              <p>So instead of asserting that airlines should give special priviledges to the obese, the court should have ruled that obese people be given not extra seats, but extra physical training on the track and gym and more importantly dietary courses.</p>

              <p>ok maybe i should clarify.</p>
              <p>for people who are obese because of a disease, maybe it isn't a choice for them but neither should they get extra space, maybe better service, but definitely not space.</p>
              <p>the 80% of obese people can do something about their diet. it is not about eating less and purging and scrimping, it is about eating the <strong>right </strong>sort of food.If one has the determination and gyms and lives on oats, rice, boiled chicken and vegetables and fruits, there's no way he's needing two spaces, unless of course, a disease.  i know this deviates from the main subject but just to pen what i think</p>
