              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #993300;">Pope says will honour Holocaust dead in Israel</span></span><span style="color: #993300;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">By Philip Pullella</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Pope Benedict used his first speech in Israel on Monday 
              to remember the six million Jews killed by the Nazis and try to heal fresh 
              wounds over his reinstatement of a bishop who denied the Holocaust.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"Tragically, the Jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of 
              ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person," he said at 
              Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport, going on to challenge Israel's right-leaning 
              government by calling for a Palestinian homeland.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"I will have the opportunity to honour the memory of the six million Jewish 
              victims of the Shoah," the German-born pope said, using the Hebrew term for the 
              Holocaust, "and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such 
              magnitude."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">He later flew by Israeli military helicopter to Jerusalem.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">In the 45 years since the Second Vatican Council repudiated the concept of 
              collective Jewish guilt for Christ's death, Catholic-Jewish relations have been 
              haunted by the Holocaust and the question of what the church did, or failed to 
              do, about it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">They went through one of their worst periods after the pope in January lifted 
              the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops, including one who denied six 
              million Jews were killed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">The Vatican says it had not known enough about that British bishop's past and 
              the church and Jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively 
              closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, 
              Israel's memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Pope Benedict, who flew into Israel from Jordan, lashed out at anti-Semitism, 
              which he said "continues to rear its ugly head" in many parts of the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"This is totally unacceptable," he said in his speech at Ben-Gurion airport. 
              "Every effort must be made to combat anti-Semitism wherever it is found, and to 
              promote respect and esteem for the members of every people, tribe, language and 
              nation across the globe."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Pope Benedict, born Joseph Ratzinger in Bavaria in 1927, was a member of the 
              Hitler Youth and later served in the German army before deserting at the end of 
              World War Two.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">In his welcoming remarks at the airport, Israeli President Shimon Peres said: 
              "We see in your visit here to the Holy Land as an important spiritual mission of 
              the highest order, a mission of peace, a mission of planting seeds for tolerance 
              and uprooting of the weeds of fanaticism."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">HOMELAND</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Reiterating Vatican policy, the pope called for "just resolution" of the 
              Israeli-Palestinian conflict "so that both peoples may live in peace in a 
              homeland of their own, within secure and internationally recognised 
              borders."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Since being sworn in as Israel's prime minister on March 31, Benjamin 
              Netanyahu has not specifically discussed establishing a Palestinian state in the 
              West Bank and the Gaza Strip, a U.S. and Arab priority.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">The pope's remarks on the subject will echo around the region, particularly 
              when he visits a Palestinian refugee camp in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank 
              on Wednesday. In Bethlehem, the traditional birthplace of Jesus, he will meet 
              Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">At a brief ceremony in Jerusalem, its Israeli mayor welcomed the pope to "the 
              capital of Israel," a status that has not won world recognition. The mayor, Nir 
              Barkat, used the term in the Hebrew portion of his speech, but not in his 
              remarks in English.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">During the pope's visit to Jordan, he stressed his desire for warm relations 
              between Christians and Muslims and tried to wipe away residual bitterness over a 
              2006 lecture he made which Muslims saw as offensive.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Jordan's King Abdullah was quoted on Monday by London's Times newspaper as 
              saying the United States was promoting a peace plan for the Middle East 
              involving a "57-state solution" in which the entire Muslim world would recognise 
              Israel.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">During his five-day stay in Israel and the Palestinian territories, the pope 
              is expected to repeat his offer for the Catholic Church to do all it can to help 
              the stalled peace process.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"I come, like so many others before me, to pray at the holy places, to pray 
              especially for peace -- peace here in the Holy Land, and peace throughout the 
              world," the pontiff said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Between visits to sacred sites connected to the life of Jesus he will also 
              hold talks with Israeli officials, Palestinian leaders and Jewish and Islamic 
              religious leaders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Israeli police said they would be carrying out their largest security 
              operation in nearly a decade, since the visit by Pope John Paul II in 2000.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Some 30,000 police will be on duty. Everywhere he travels, the pope will have 
              police helicopters tracking him from above.</span></p>
