              <div class="articleTxt smallText">LOS ANGELES (Jan.
              28) - In one upstairs bedroom, the bodies of twin 2-year-old boys were
              found beside their dead mother. In another bedroom,5-year-old twin
              girls and their 8-year-old sister lay next to their lifeless father.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt2" class="articleTxt smallText">Officers discovered
              the horrific scene after rushing to a home in Wilmington, prompted by
              the father's distraught letter faxed to a TV station describing a
              "tragic story" and a call to authorities.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText">
              <div id="articleTxt3" class="articleTxt smallText">Police believe Ervin
              Lupoe, 40, killed his five children and his wife before turning the gun
              on himself. Both adults were recently fired from their hospital jobs.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt4" class="articleTxt smallText">"Why leave our
              children in someone else's hands?" Lupoe wrote in his letter faxed to
              KABC-TV. The station posted the letter on its Web site with some parts
              redacted.</div>
              <div id="articleTxt5" class="articleTxt smallText">The station called
              police after receiving the fax, and a police dispatch center also
              received a phone call from a man who stated, "I just returned home and
              my whole family's been shot." Police are unsure who the male caller
              was, but they suspect it was the father.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt6" class="articleTxt smallText">Officers rushed to
              the home in Wilmington, a small community between the ports of Los
              Angeles and Long Beach, about 8:30 a.m. Tuesday and found the bodies.</div>
              <div id="articleTxt7" class="articleTxt smallText">All the victims were
              shot in the head, some multiple times, coroner's Assistant Chief Ed
              Winter said. The killings may have occurred between Monday evening and
              early Tuesday, based on neighbors' accounts of firecracker sounds, he
              said.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt8" class="articleTxt smallText">Although the fax —
              addressed to "whom it may concern" and explaining "why we are dead" —
              asserted that the wife, Ana Lupoe, planned the killings of the whole
              family, police Lt. John Romero said Ervin Lupoe was the suspect. A
              revolver was found next to his body.</div>
              <div id="articleTxt9" class="articleTxt smallText">It was the fifth
              mass death of a Southern California family by murder or suicide in a
              year. Police urged those facing tough economic times to get help rather
              than resort to violence.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt10" class="articleTxt smallText">"Today our worst
              fear was realized," said Deputy Chief Kenneth Garner. "It's just not a
              solution. There's just so many ways you find alternatives to doing
              something so horrific and drastic as this."</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt11" class="articleTxt smallText">Ervin Lupoe removed
              three of the children from school about a week and a half ago, saying
              the family was moving to Kansas, the principal told KCAL-TV. Crescent
              Heights Elementary School Principal Cherise Pounders-Caver said nothing
              seemed to be troubling Ervin Lupoe, and she did not ask why the family
              was moving.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt12" class="articleTxt smallText">Kaiser Permanente
              Medical Center West Los Angeles released a statement confirming Lupoe
              and his wife were fired as medical technicians more than a week ago.
              The hospital said the firings followed an internal investigation but
              would not specify why they lost their jobs.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt13" class="articleTxt smallText">The letter
              indicated that Lupoe and his wife — both 40 — had been investigated for
              misrepresenting their employment to an outside agency to obtain
              childcare. He claimed that an administrator told the couple on Dec. 23:
              "You should not even had bothered to come to work today you should have
              blown your brains out."</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt14" class="articleTxt smallText">Lupoe's letter said
              the couple complained to the human resources department and eventually
              were offered an apology but two days later they were fired.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt15" class="articleTxt smallText">"They did nothing
              to the manager who stated such and did not attempt to assist us in the
              matter, knowing we have no job and five children under 8 years with no
              place to go. So here we are," the note said.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt16" class="articleTxt smallText">At the bottom of
              the letter, Lupoe wrote, "Oh lord, my God, is there no hope for a
              widow's son?" The phrase is frequently found in Internet discussions
              about the novel "The Da Vinci Code," Freemasons and Mormonism.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt17" class="articleTxt smallText">Kaiser Permanente
              said staff was "saddened by the despair" in Lupoe's letter "but we are
              confident that no one told him to take his own life or the lives of his
              family."</div>
              <div id="articleTxt18" class="articleTxt smallText">Lupoe's fax
              identified his children as Brittney, 8; 5-year-old twins Jaszmin and
              Jassely; and twins Benjamin and Christian, ages 2 years and 4 months.
              Winter confirmed the identities of the girls, but the boys' names were
              pending.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt19" class="articleTxt smallText">Lupoe got a state
              license to work as a security guard in 1989 and a permit to carry a gun
              as a security guard in 1993 but both expired in 2007, said Russ
              Heimerich, a spokesman for the state Bureau of Security and
              Investigative Services.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt20" class="articleTxt smallText">Bob Pierce, a Long
              Beach attorney who represented the Lupoes in an auto accident, said the
              case did not involve any serious injuries and the family was expected
              to receive "well below $10,000," he said.</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt21" class="articleTxt smallText">Lupoe called Monday
              to find out when the money might be coming, Pierce said. Pierce told
              him that it might be another week or two "and he said 'no problem.'"</div>
              <div class="articleTxt smallText"><br></div>
              <div id="articleTxt22" class="articleTxt smallText">To Amanda Garcia,
              everything seemed normal in the Lupoe house next door. Her neighbors
              always had a friendly wave and their five young children would play
              outside.</div>
              <div id="articleTxt23" class="articleTxt smallText">"They were happy,
              they had birthday parties," the 22-year-old Garcia said as she choked
              back tears near her home. "The kids were always outside on bikes,
              riding on their wagon."</div>
