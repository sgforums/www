            <div class='col-md body'>German scholars unveil "politically correct" Bible<br><br>Nov. 09 (CNA/CWNews.com) - A group of 52 biblical Â“specialistsÂ” have released a new version of the Bible in which inclusive language and Â“political correctnessÂ” have replaced some Â“divisiveÂ” teachings of Christianity in order to present a Â“more just languageÂ” for groups such as feminists and homosexuals.<br><br>According to the AFP news agency, the new version of the Sacred Scriptures was presented at a book fair in Frankfurt. Entitled, The Bible in a More Just Language, the translation has Jesus no longer referring to God as Â“Father,Â” but as Â“our Mother and Father who are in heaven.Â” Likewise, Jesus is no longer referred to as the Â“SonÂ” but rather as the Â“childÂ” of God. The title Â“LordÂ” is replaced with Â“GodÂ” or Â“the Eternal One.Â” The devil, however, is still referred to with masculine pronouns. Â“One of the great ideas of the Bible is justice. We have made a translation that does justice to women, Jews, and those who are disregarded,Â” said Pastor Hanne Koehler, who led the team of translators.<br><br>Last December, Matin Dreyer, pastor and founder of the sect Â“Jesus Freaks,Â” published the Volksbibel (The PeopleÂ’s Bible), in a supposed attempt to make the message of Christianity more Â“accessible.Â” Jesus Â“returnsÂ” instead of resurrects, and multiplies Â“hamburgersÂ” instead of the fish and loaves. In the parable of the prodigal son, the younger son squanders his inheritance at dance clubs and ends up Â“cleaning bathrooms at McDonaldÂ’s.Â”</div>
