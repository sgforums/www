            <div class='col-md body'>YES i was proved right. he writes for pakistani daily "dawn" which is of course only the preserve of anglicized pakistanis, who are so thoroughly anglicized in their customs, creed, culture, cuisine etc etc etc it leaves you bewildered (unless of course you're not a thourhgouly anglicized singaporean yourself).<br><br>here's a piece from one of his other articles<br><br><blockquote><br>Effectively, English has become the language of power in Pakistan. If you want a good job, fluency (if not accuracy) in English is essential. Young graduates may not be able to write grammatically, but if they can manage a nasal twang, they will have placed one foot on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder.<br><br>Even to sell products and services, the use of English appears necessary. A jingle on TV currently promoting a cell phone company proves my point: Â‘Hamari sub ki voice hai! Yeh hi smart choice hai! Talk-shawk! Talk-Shawk!Â’<br><br>So in a brief, lively jingle, we have four English words. Other ads are similarly replete with foreign words, even if the products are being sold to people who barely speak the language.At the other end of the spectrum, there are kids who have been born and brought up in Pakistan, and who only speak English. They need to use Urdu only when ordering their servants to do something for them. They are taught at school in English; they watch English DVDs; listen to American pop music; and talk to their friends and parents in English. The compulsory Urdu classes at school are never taken seriously, with the teacher often being the least respected member of the faculty.<br><br>After high school, they go off to university in the United States where they promptly forget whatever little Urdu they knew. On their return, they either join DaddyÂ’s business, or get a job with a multinational. In both cases, they have minimal contact with local issues and problems, beyond complaining about the power cuts and the dirt.<br><br>Even in the middle class, there is a growing awareness of the importance of English as an essential means of social advancement. I have seen mothers with a very poor grasp of English struggling to speak in the language to their children. Parents make sacrifices to send their kids to Â‘English-mediumÂ’ schools. In reality, most of these institutions do not have teachers trained to teach in any language, but anxious parents settle for them because of their claim to teach in English.</blockquote>it shows decisively what a bootlicker he is. not many pakistanis trust this person themselves.<br><br></div>
