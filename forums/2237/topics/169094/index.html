Kelly Dennison of the Winnipeg Police Service told the CBC, "Anybody looking for the Winnipeg police service would think we're endorsing the NDP." "Obviously, that's not the case," he said. A spokesman for the Regina police said an enquiry is likely but police did not specify if Bedford's anti-Christian campaign would be investigated under the hate crimes statutes.<br><br>Bedford's single-page site warns, "If you vote for Stephen Harper and the Conservatives you would be voting for religious extremists with a hidden agenda."<br><br>NDP spokesman Ian Capstick at first told the CBC that Bedford was an NDP supporter who was trying to help the party's chances in the federal election. Capstick told the CBC that the party did not have the power to make Bedford stop, but had not asked him to halt, either.<br><br>Bedford's anti-Harper site includes a link to Atheists.net where he includes his own agenda of "dereligionization" of the world. That page links to another of Bedford's sites called, UndoJesus.org that includes a point-form list of goals including "opposing Christian influence and control within social context."<br><br>After communicating with police, the NDP is now distancing itself from Bedford's anti-Christian campaign.  Capstick told LifeSiteNews.com that although the party has no power to stop his campaign, they have asked him not to link to the NDP website.<br><br>"Mr. Bedford is not officially associated with the NDP in any way shape or form. He directed his website to ours. He was asked two days ago, due to the tone and content of some of the police comments that he re-direct those sites," Capstick said.<br><br>When pressed, Capstick said that he himself had asked Bedford to re-direct the sites. "We asked him to point his website to either elections.ca or a charity of his choice," he told LifeSiteNews.com.<br><br>See Bedford's anti-Harper website:<br>http://www.domainbaron.com/Stephen_Harper_warning....<br><br><a href="http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2005/dec/05121303.html" rel="nofollow">Jesus returns</a><br><br>"The sky is falling!
