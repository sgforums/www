              <p>SEATTLE - APPLE Inc Chief Executive Steve Jobs was paid his customary US$1 (S$1.40) annual salary in 2009, but Apple's strength through a rough economic climate returned the value of his personal holdings in the company to pre-meltdown levels.</p>
              <p>Mr Jobs does not get a bonus or reimbursement for perks many other CEOs accept, such as personal security, according to a regulatory filing made Wednesday. Apple said it reimbursed Mr Jobs US$4,000 for company travel on his US$90 million Gulfstream V jet, which he received as a bonus in 1999.</p>
              <p>That's far less than the US$871,000 Apple reimbursed Mr Jobs in 2008. The CEO took nearly six months off in 2009 for medical leave, during which time he received a liver transplant. He returned to work at the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters part-time at the end of June.</p>
              <p>Mr Jobs, 54, holds 5.5 million shares of Apple's stock. He has not sold any shares since he rejoined the company in 1997, nor has he been awarded any new equity since 2003. In 2008, the value of Mr Jobs' stake in the company he founded was cut in half as investors worried Apple's pricey gadgets might not fare well through the US recession. But shares of the maker of iPods, iPhones and Mac computers gained about 42 percent during the 2009 fiscal year that ended in September, and at the close of trading Wednesday, when Apple's stock reached US$202.10, Mr Jobs' holdings were worth about US$1.1 billion.</p>
              <p>Mr Jobs is also the largest individual shareholder of The Walt Disney Co. His 7.4 percent stake is currently worth about US$4.5 billion. At an annual meeting scheduled for Feb. 25, Apple shareholders will for the first time have a chance to cast an advisory vote on the company's executive compensation plans.</p>
              <p>Shareholders have submitted two other proposals to be voted on at the meeting. One calls for a detailed environmental sustainability report, and the other for a board committee devoted to that issue, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday. -- AP</p>

              <p>Knew it since I know who is he. He does do quite a well job in returning Apple back to its pre-bankruptcy stage yet keep a low profile. Go out and ask people who created the iPod or iPhone &amp; they will say don't know...He is a classic example of to be a great leader you don't need alot of money (though I do know that his stock's $ is alot) but rather the passion to lead what you do.</p>
              <p>The current gen PAP fails at this point, they don't have the passion to lead but rather the passion to suck more $ from people...the 1st gen is at least much more better.</p>
