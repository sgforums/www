              <p>This clearly tell the world, dun mess with china, tho economically there are open, but internally, they are still very much communist minded, and now especially with a record of billions of dollars invested by the west and asia into China, if China decided to close it gates again,...boomZzzzz...all can die liao.</p>

              <p> <strong>The Google Culture</strong></p>
              <p>Though Google has grown a lot since it opened in 1998, we still maintain a small company feel. At lunchtime, almost everyone eats in the office café, sitting at whatever table has an opening and enjoying conversations with Googlers from different teams. Our commitment to innovation depends on everyone being comfortable sharing ideas and opinions. Every employee is a hands-on contributor, and everyone wears several hats. Because we believe that each Googler is an equally important part of our success, no one hesitates to pose questions directly to Larry or Sergey in our weekly all-hands ("TGIF") meetings – or spike a volleyball across the net at a corporate officer.</p>
              <p>We are aggressively inclusive in our hiring, and we favor ability over experience. We have offices around the world and dozens of languages are spoken by Google staffers, from Turkish to Telugu. The result is a team that reflects the global audience Google serves. When not at work, Googlers pursue interests from cross-country cycling to wine tasting, from flying to frisbee.</p>
              <p>Our corporate headquarters, fondly nicknamed the Googleplex, is located in Mountain View, California. Today it's one of our <a href="address.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000cc;">many offices</span></span></a> around the globe. While our offices are not identical, they tend to share some essential elements. Here are a few things you might see in a Google workspace:</p>
              <ul class="spaced">
              <li>Local expressions of each location, from a mural in Buenos Aires to ski gondolas in Zurich, showcasing each office's region and personality.</li>
              <li>Bicycles or scooters for efficient travel between meetings; dogs; lava lamps; massage chairs; large inflatable balls.</li>
              <li>Googlers sharing cubes, yurts and huddle rooms – and very few solo offices.</li>
              <li>Laptops everywhere – standard issue for mobile coding, email on the go and note-taking.</li>
              <li>Foosball, pool tables, volleyball courts, assorted video games, pianos, ping pong tables, and gyms that offer yoga and dance classes.</li>
              <li>Grassroots employee groups for all interests, like meditation, film, wine tasting and salsa dancing.</li>
              <li>Healthy lunches and dinners for all staff at a variety of cafés.</li>
              <li>Break rooms packed with a variety of snacks and drinks to keep Googlers going.</li>

              <p> </p>
              <p>the pt ppl here is trying to say is we salute google for not bowing into unreasonable demand from china govt. it would have been more easy for google to say yes to china than not. they believe in internet freedom and i salute them for defending internet freedom more than the financial gains.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>whenever i travel to china and vietnam, i wonder why they block facebook. if they are clean, they can always come out to defend their own policy against rumours and accusation aiming at them.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>hi angel,  of coz without google china will not die, they have baidu which is more than happy to take over google market share.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the pt ppl here is trying to say is we salute google for not bowing into unreasonable demand from china govt. it would have been more easy for google to say yes to china than not. they believe in internet freedom and i salute them for defending internet freedom more than the financial gains.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>whenever i travel to china and vietnam, i wonder why they block facebook. if they are clean, they can always come out to defend their own policy against rumours and accusation aiming at them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anway, taht is why they are call communist right.</p>

              <p>As i said again, you go into a country to do business, you have to respect their rules and regulations, same as investor coming to singapore to do business, they have to obey the rules within the Media Authority of Singapore. Just like a visitor coming to your house and mess up the show, do you still keep him/her.</p>
              <p>Since enter china, google already know and adapted to the censorship, but why, in this particular years, it start to demand against the policy?? As i said before, there are uterior motive for google to put out, not just because of censorship issue?? American know china very well, they are still having a communist govt ruling a democratic capitalised economy. In political situation, this is called as sanction. American simply do not want China to have googles and using the base of censorship as the mean of pulling out and also to blind the public.</p>
              <p>The American do not want Chinese to be like american, as simple as that, if China is Americanized, that is the end of America. And google provided that channel for Chinese to learn English and to learn the way the west behave and do their business. On the contrary, it can also be a plan to weaken China economy progress which is growing at double digit per years, whereas the west are at negative.</p>
              <p>Without a google, many investor will think twice of investing there, and especially so, for American investors...Obama wants levis, timberland, and many americans firm to come back to states, do the real thing like Pepsei and coke does ya. It's the real thing</p>

              <p>Simple, because the local subsidary is not the international company. If China takes a potshot at the international company by hacking its networks, what value does the international company have after that? No one can trust Google internationally. In fact, China already has Baidu, so it can afford to antagonize Google.</p>
