But they carry the risk of oversedation -- especially dangerous to children, he said in a telephone interview.<br><br>The older-generation antihistamines that work against cough include chlorpheniramine, he said. Newer, brand-name antihistamines such as Claritin and Zyrtec do not help coughs, Dicpinigaitis said.<br><br>RESOLVING ON ITS OWN<br><br>Under new guidelines, adults with acute cough or upper airway cough syndrome, commonly known as postnasal drip, should use an older variety of antihistamine with a decongestant.<br><br>And while coughs in children are worrisome and annoying, cough syrup is not the answer, Irwin said.<br><br>"Cough is very common in children. However, cough and cold medicines are not useful in children and can actually be harmful," he said. "In most cases, a cough that is unrelated to chronic lung conditions, environmental influences, or other specific factors, will resolve on its own."<br><br>The guidelines follow several studies that have suggested that nonprescription cough remedies do little more than offer comfort to desperate patients.<br><br>Researchers reported in July of 2004 that neither dextromethorphan, often listed on labels as DM, or diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, offered any more relief to children suffering from cough than sugar water.<br><br>The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, showed that children usually recovered quickly whatever the treatment.<br><br>Francis Sullivan, a spokesman for Wyeth Consumer Healthcare, which makes the popular cough treatment Robitussin, said he did not expect the guidelines to affect sales.<br><br>"The FDA (U.S.     Food and Drug Administration) has concluded that these drugs are safe and they work," Sullivan said in a telephone interview.<br><br>In general, analysts say, drug makers make more profit off their prescription products than on over-the-counter medications.<br><br>In 2000 the FDA warned against the use of common over-the- counter cold remedies and diet pills containing phenylpropanolamine or PPA after researchers found it raised the risk of stroke in women.<br><br></div>
