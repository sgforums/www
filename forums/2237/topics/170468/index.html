Since 2002 the Science and Technology Ministry alone had given him some US$40 million.<br><br>But Hwang's reputation began to crumble domestically when a key co-author of the paper, Roh Sung-Il, said last week that pictures accompanying the article and purporting to show 11 patient-specific stem cell lines had been faked.<br><br>Roh said the patient-specific stem cell colonies had never existed.<br><br>At a press conference last week, Hwang withdrew the paper, saying that there were "mistakes" in the study including the photos.<br><br>But he insisted that the fundamental scientific aspects of his paper were correct and that <span style="color: red;">he had cloned 11 human embryos and cultivated patient-specific stem cell lines from them</span>. - AFP/de<br><br>******<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br></div>
