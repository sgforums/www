Â“You wonÂ’t find a gayer city in America.  Say what you will about San Francisco, but they just marry them, we elect them here in New York.  So start spreading the news!Â”<br><br>Quinn, 39, a Democrat, was elected by a vote of 50 to 0, with one member abstaining in protest of what he said is an openly gay process of electing the speaker. Other council members had sought the job, but Quinn became a virtual lock because she was gay and fit the perfect image for New York City.<br><br>Quinn is reportedly one of 350 openly gay politicians serving in all levels of government nationwide, according to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, an organization that advocates for gay candidates.<br><br>Â“That number of gays in public office was just 41 in 1991,Â” group spokesman Dave DeCicco said.  Â“Before that, all politicians remained in the closet.  YouÂ’ve got to hand it to New York.  Only this city could step up and set the standard in diversity.  ThatÂ’s the reason everyone loves New York!Â”<br><br>The post is powerful mostly because of its influence over budget matters. Term limits and heterosexual behavior forced out her predecessor, Gifford Miller, whose run for mayor fell flat last year.<br><br>Historically, the City Council speaker seat has been used as a place to publicly slam Republican mayors. Long before Miller prepared to run against Mayor Michael Bloomberg last spring, he clashed with the Republican billionaire over just being Republican.<br><br>Reportedly among them was BloombergÂ’s quest to build a new football stadium on ManhattanÂ’s West Side, a venture that Quinn also opposed. But when asked this week how she would get along with the mayor, Quinn noted only that they have also worked together on various projects, for instance, to ban smoking in bars and restaurants.<br><br>Â“Getting rid of smokers is a top priority,Â” stated Quinn.  Â“In New York, weÂ’re saying no to smokers and yes to gays and lesbians.  WeÂ’re truly the top of the heap when it comes to the welfare of New Yorkers.Â”<br><br>Even though she wasnÂ’t specific, Ms. Quinn pledged to promote an aggressive leftist agenda, including efforts to extend term limits for council members from 8 to 12 yearsÂ—especially since she is now electedÂ—to also develop a waste disposal plan, and to create new housing for gays and lesbians, desperate for places to stay under the Bloomberg regime.<br><br>Ms. Quinn noted that she envisioned her role as that of superior and elite to Mr. Bloomberg, adding that their relationship was headed for the rocks.  During her speech on Wednesday, Quinn went a step further, saying that too often the City Council hasnÂ’t taken enough steps to rid themselves of conservative social policies.<br><br>Â“Even though Bloomberg isnÂ’t what you would call a social conservative, heÂ’s still got the Republican behind his name,Â” crowed Quinn.  Â“WeÂ’re going to do something about that with this City Council.Â”<br><br>Councilman James S. Oddo of Staten Island, the liberal Republican minority leader, said he has watched with admiration as Ms. Quinn has evolved into a skilled leader with a laserlike concentration since they both started out as Council aides in the early 1990Â’s.<br><br>Â“SheÂ’s tough,Â” stated Oddo.  Â“Remember, sheÂ’s a lesbian woman and sheÂ’s going to be in Mr. BloombergÂ’s face!Â”<br><br>Â“I just think this is wonderful,Â” shouted Rep. Barney Frank, D-MA.  Â“My only wish is that she wouldÂ’ve done something special with her hair.  It looked terrible.Â”<br><br>Â“This is so good to hear that New York has decided to come out of the 19th century,Â” said Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women.  Â“Electing a woman is a step in the right direction.  Women have been victims in America too long.  And best of all sheÂ’s a lesbian.  Now thatÂ’s a gift that just keeps on giving.Â”<br><br>Â“IÂ’m so excited,Â” said James Hanger, a tear-soaked, 46-year old openly gay Bronx resident and petroleum jelly salesman.  Â“This means more to me than you could possibly imagine.  I just donÂ’t have the words to describe how I truly feel.  I just love New York!Â”<br><br>In electing, Christine Quinn, New York has climbed the pinnacle of the diversity ladder, proclaiming their status as the first gay city and setting an example for other city councils to climb out of the 19th century.  The move demonstrates in the end that New York is still king of the diversity hill after all.<br><br>Copyright by Chris Davis<br><br>*********<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Any comments?</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NY the 1st? No way. Not when London's had openly gay MPs since gawd knows when. the 1700s? or the 1800s maybe. Soho Sq beats anything they have flat, and when we get bored with getting pi<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ss-drunk in the london gay pride, we'll all up and go on down to brighton's pride parade to get more pi<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ss-drunk. Everyone goes to gay pride, straight, gay, bi, les, trans. everyone. its like a holiday only better. Some of the most famous gay n bi personalities have either come from or lived in London long b4 NY was even remotely gay, including Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde.<br><br>NY the 1st? not by a looooooong shot!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
