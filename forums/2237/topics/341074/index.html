              <p>MEXICO CITY – A U.S. anti-kidnapping expert was abducted by gunmen in
              northern Mexico last week, a sign of just how bold this nation's
              kidnapping gangs have become.<br> <br> U.S. security consultant Felix Batista was in Saltillo in Coahuila
              state to offer advice on how to confront abductions for ransom when he
              was snatched by unknown assailants on Dec. 10, said Charlie LeBlanc,
              the president of the Houston, Texas-based security firm ASI Global
              LLC., where Batista is a consultant.<br> <br> "We have notified the FBI and Mexican authorities, and they are
              working on the case," LeBlanc said Monday. "What we are doing is we're
              offering our support to the family and hoping for the best."<br> <br> The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said it would not comment on the
              case, and LeBlanc declined to say whether a ransom demand had been
              received.<br> LeBlanc said Batista had his own security business and that "he was in
              Mexico for business that wasn't associated with our company."<br> <br> Batista's work involved crisis management consulting, LeBlanc
              said. "Part of that could be or may involve negotiations with
              kidnappers."<br> <br> ASI Global's Web site advertises "kidnap and ransom response" and
              says the company has worked for major insurance companies.<br> <br> Kidnapping has become a rising problem in Mexico, but attacks on
              U.S. anti-crime consultants have largely been the stuff of movies. The
              seizure seems to echo the plot of a 2004 movie, "Man on Fire," in which
              Denzel Washington played a U.S. security consultant who takes on
              Mexican kidnappers and is abducted himself.<br> <br> A series of high-profile kidnappings in which the victims were
              later found dead has sparked outrage in Mexico. In the past year, the
              bodies of daughter of the country's former sports commissioner and the
              son of a prominent businessman have been found.<br> <br> Coahuila's governor set off a nationwide controversy by proposing
              to reinstate the death penalty for kidnappers who kill their victims.
              Mexico outlawed the death penalty in 2005 and abandoned it in practice
              decades ago.<br> <br> Coahuila state law enforcement officials who were not authorized
              to be quoted by name said Batista had been giving talks to local police
              officials and businessmen on how to prevent or avoid kidnappings.<br> <br> They said he apparently was snatched from a street outside a restaurant.<br> A profile of Batista posted — and later removed — from the ASI Global
              Web site described him as "the primary case officer for all cases
              throughout the Latin American region."<br> <br> The site said Batista was a former U.S. Army major who is "known
              for conducting in-depth threat assessments, the successful resolution
              of nearly 100 kidnap and ransom cases (many on behalf of major
              insurance carriers) and investigations."<br> <br> The company denied local media reports that Batista was a former
              FBI agent, and warned those reports could put his life at risk.<br> <br> "We at ASI are very concerned for Felix's safety and would like to
              take this opportunity of stating categorically that Felix has never
              been an agent in the FBI," the company said in a statement.</p>
