              <p><br>morality means different things in different culture. but the sanctity of marriage in agrarian societies has always been to procreate, accrue legal status and rights (because in an agrarian society, the men were the bread winners of the household).</p>
              <p>if gay marriages are considered norm and not stigmatised then i guess it would have widespread historical records of such marriages in every country.</p>
              <p>historically the thing with such liasions is that it is mostly clandestine, therefore imbued with a sense of illegality.</p>
              <p>i don't have any problems with gay wanting to be with their partners, but to solemnise and legalise it is beyond me.</p>
              <p>what makes you think what they are doing is not hurting anybody psychologically? common folks could have extreme disgust over such marriages and psychological trauma.</p>

              <p>in a later post you said, "Morals are self defined, you are the immoral one for denying the existence of love in a relationship.", so the person who brandish morality is contradicting himself/herself, by saying that the relationship between humans and animals is wrong.</p>

              <p><em>primeval:</em></p>
              <p><em>of or pertaining to the first age or ages, esp. of the world: <span class="ital-inline">primeval forms of life. </span></em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><span class="ital-inline">According to you marriage is "a <strong>sacred union</strong> between 2 loving people", look here simpleton, there is nothing SACRED about a union between a man &amp; man, women &amp; women. Your understanding of the world and words are limited. Sacred connotes religious linkages. In which orthodox religion do you find the priest marrying persons of the same gender? Or any orthodox religion(s) that encourages homosexual behaviour amongst it's followers?</span></p>
              <p><span class="ital-inline">sacred:</span></p>

              <p>your physical comparisons with aviaries are futile attempt to blur the lines again.</p>
              <p>hasn't there been cases of folks marrying their pets? are you the person with the holier than thou attitude now trying to dislodge the love relationship between humans and their pets now? Maybe you can tell me what's wrong with the relationship here?</p>
              <p>in a later post you said, "Morals are self defined, you are the immoral one for denying the existence of love in a relationship.", so the person who brandish morality is contradicting himself/herself, by saying that the relationship between humans and animals is wrong.</p>
              <p>my perspective is that of the modern world, that whatever pleases the person, it's left to his prerogative to pursue the interest in that direction.</p>
              <p>what is morality in the modern world?</p>

              <p> Its their bloody business, but I take issue with "them" for hijacking the establlished institutions, and not inventing their own. They are trying to be "normal".</p>
              <p>Its not too difficult to plan their own nupital format.</p>
              <p>The starting point should be legislation.  "The Pairrage Act"? (not The Marriage Act pls, but its ok to plaigarise, with amendments from it)</p>
              <p>And "they" should not expect red carpets.</p>

              <p><br>I was referring to morality in general, not human + animal relationship per se. So are you indirectly saying that you agree to bestiality? Since you did not disagree to this form of arrangement.</p>
              <p>If you would like to, maybe you can make a stance as to your views on incestuous relationships and pedophilia? Perhaps it would enligthen us to your worldly views and concepts.</p>
              <p>morality:</p>
              <p>1) conformity to the rules of right conduct; moral or virtuous conduct.</p>
              <p>2) moral quality or character.</p>
              <p>3) virtue in sexual matters; chastity.</p>
              <p>4) a doctrine or system of morals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rules of conduct, if your conduct towards marriage is only between man and women, obviously it is the norm, then all else you would have to reject, be it man to man, women to women or men to dogs.</p>
              <p>Do you have double standards?</p>

              <p>Gay marriages are futile attempts by the abnormals at normalcy.</p>
              <p>I have no problems with gay relationships, afterall they have a right to live their life as they deem fit.</p>
              <p>But the problem with legalising gay marriages is that, it gives it a sense of legality and normality, which if far from the truth. It would give youths the impression that since it is legal and normal, it's alright to be gay.</p>
