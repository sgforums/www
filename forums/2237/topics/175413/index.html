"They are under pressure from their own ministry.<br><br>"The Turkish people will never allow Mehmet Ali Agca to die in jail," he said.<br><br>"The Vatican has proclaimed my brother the messiah. My brother is the messiah, he is the mahdi (the Muslim messiah).<br><br>"Believe it or not, he has dedicated his life and his ideal to his country and to his nation," Adnan Agca said, adding that his brother's attorney would take legal action against the Appeals Court decision.<br><br>Lawyer Mustafa Demirbag told the NTV news channel that he would also file a formal complaint against Justice Minister Cemil Cicek, who ordered the review.<br><br>The Supreme Court's decision to return Agca to prison shows the country's legal system works and is able to correct its errors, Cicek said yesterday.<br><br>"My brother was very happy to have been set free," Adnan Agca said. "He was not expecting this decision. He was writing a new Bible."<br><br>Some angry, some jubilant, Turkish newspapers agreed that Agca's return to jail was a good thing.<br><br>"Back where he belongs," headlined the liberal Milliyet, whose emblematic editor Abdi Ipekci was murdered by Agca in 1979, two years before he shot and wounded John Paul II in Rome's St Peter's Square.<br><br>"Scandal in spades", bannered the popular Aksam.<br><br>The miscalculation of sentence reductions made Turkey "the laughing stock of the world", Aksam wrote, "and to boot, we gave the killer centrestage." "Eight days of vacation, eight more years in jail," headlined the popular Vatan; "Forward, march - back to the hole," was the banner in the mass selling Hurriyet, while the liberal Radikal wrote: "Killer fails to flee."<br><br>Agca, who fled a Turkish prison while awaiting trial for the Ipekci murder and resurfaced, gun in hand, outside the Vatican on May 13, 1981, was pardoned by Italy in 2000 and extradited to Turkey.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
