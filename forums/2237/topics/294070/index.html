            <div class='col-md body'>SYDNEY: Two pigs' heads were found at the site of a proposed Islamic school on Sydney's outskirts Wednesday, the school's backers said.<br><br>An Australian flag was draped between the two heads, said Jeremy Bingham, spokesman for the Quranic Society.<br><br>"Someone has put a couple of stakes in the ground with a pig's head on the top of each stake and an Australian flag inside," Bingham told AFP.<br><br>"The police are treating it as a crime scene and making investigations."<br><br>Earlier this month about 1,000 people attended a meeting to protest against the proposed school in Camden, in Sydney's far southwest, while a cross was previously found on the grounds.<br><br>Members of the Quranic Society were "a bit upset by it, a bit offended by it", Bingham said.<br><br>"Obviously you have got a sick individual (behind the act)," he said.<br><br>But he said it would make no difference to a planning proposal going through the local council, which the backers expect to be approved early next year.<br><br>The state government's Community Relations Commission condemned the latest protest as "a mindless act".<br><br>"This insult and display of hatred is not something any fair-minded Australian would approve of," said commission head Stepan Kerkyasharian in a statement.<br><br>Parts of southwestern Sydney are now heavily populated by Middle Eastern migrants, many of them Iraqi Muslims.<br><br>The backers of the school, which would cater to about 1,200 pupils, hope it will open in 2009.<br><br>The Quranic Society denies it has any links to militant Islamic groups and says it is simply trying to provide a school where the children of group members can get a good education and religious instruction. - AFP/ac<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My stand is that putting pigs heads on the proposed site for Islamic school is rather insulting and unrespectful.<br><br>However, I dun really understand how come Muslims always want their children to be sent to Islamic schools. They are now in Australia and they should learn to integrate into the Aussie society.<br><br>By building an Islamic school, these new immigrants will tend to stay within their own groups and significantly reduced interactions with the local Aussie. This is when xenophobia will come into play.<br><br>Oh ya Muslims in non-Muslim nations must really learn how to adapt to their new environment. It is ok to have mosque for prayers and gathering. But then the Islamic school can be done without.<br><br>We dun see the Buddhists, Hindi etc (Christain not included) demand for religious schools so frequently.</div>

The main issue is that these young children should be sent to the local Aussie schools for their main eduaction and not Islamic schools.<br>The local schools can make some adjustments on the foods and prayer timing for these Muslim children.<br><br>The Aussie town council has shown religious sensitiveness and harmony to approve the building of an Islamic school. It shows that they are sensitive to the need of these new Muslim immigrants.<br><br>Unless some nations like Malaysia whose town councils always take any chance to demolish Taoist temples or Hindi temples. Reasons included the town council refused to give new permits for usage of land and hence temples have to be demolished. Rarely (in fact zero) do they demolish any structurally dangerous or unused mosques. Totally no respect for the Chinese and Indians citizens. No wonder the Indians went on a march in KL last week.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with Australian immigrants is that they never integrate themselves into Australian society, instead they form their own colonies and stick with members of their own race. That's why there are many 'muslim districts' and 'asian districts'. It's where all the ethnic gang violence occurs.<br><br>Btw, Gazelle you really need a hobby or girlfriend or something to keep you occupied because you seem to be spending all your free time searching for negative news articles about Australia.</div>
