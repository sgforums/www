              <p><span style="color: #333333;">By Sebastian Smith Sebastian Smith <br><br>NEW YORK (AFP) â€“ Woody Allen and American Apparel, a clothing company known for ads featuring scantily clad models, are fighting dirty ahead of a court showdown next month.</span></p>
              <img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090421/woodyallen77.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><em><span style="color: #999999;">Photo: AFP/File/Pierre Verdy</span></em>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">Allen is suing American Apparel for putting his image from the 1977 movie "Annie Hall," where he appeared as a Hasidic Jew, on billboards without his consent. <br><br>The film maker calls American Apparel, whose eccentric founder strips to his underwear in the office and has reportedly masturbated in front of a journalist, "sleazy." <br><br>Allen seeks 10 million dollars compensation -- the amount he says he'd charge if he had agreed to an endorsement -- in the trial scheduled to start May 18. <br><br>The California company, whose tight-fitting lingerie and casual wear enjoy a cult following, says Allen's colorful personal life leaves him without much of an image to defend. <br><br>American Apparel lawyers contend that the "sex scandal" of Allen's marriage to adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, after a bitter divorce from actress Mia Farrow, will be fair game. <br><br>Lawyers say in court documents they intend to show "the highly publicized sex scandal and custody battle" impacted on Allen's career and the value of his image. <br><br>The dispute began two years ago when American Apparel used the Allen picture, in which he wears a thick Hasidic-style beard, on billboards in New York and Los Angeles. <br><br>Although Allen is believed to have appeared in advertisements early in his career, he has long avoided making endorsements. <br><br>In a deposition last December, Allen said he would not touch American Apparel, or its notorious ads, with a barge pole. <br><br>"The ones that I saw were -- were, you know, sexually gross in a witless and infantile way," he said, adding that American Apparel had a "sleazy image." <br><br>Allen, whose films are known for neurotic comedy and quick-fire dialogue, said that if he ever did do a commercial, it would have to be for "a large amount of money." <br><br>He said he'd consent to doing advertising only if it was "a very clever, kind of witty or intellectual-style commercial." <br><br>Allen's nemesis is Don Charney, the Canadian founder and CEO of American Apparel, which unlike many manufacturers hires all-American staff, rather than cheap foreign labor. <br><br>Charney's own image has been tarnished by sexual harassment law suits and reports of bizarre behavior, including exposing himself in work-related settings. <br><br>Charney appears to revel in the notoriety, admitting in 2006: "I frequently drop my pants to show people my new product." <br><br>A reporter for Jane magazine spent time with Charney in 2004 to research a profile and said that the CEO masturbated in front of her. <br><br>One of the women filing sexual harassment suits against him complained her boss turned up to a business meeting at his home wearing a special sock on his penis -- apparently a potential new product. <br><br>American Apparel's lawyer, Stuart Slotnick, told the New York Post tabloid that Allen was the one who would have to prove his worth in court. <br><br>"We believe that Mr Allen's popularity has decreased significantly, especially in light of the scandals he's been associated with. We believe that he greatly overvalues the worth of his endorsement -- if he can get one," Slotnick said earlier this month. <br><br>Last week, Allen's lawyers shot back, accusing American Apparel of mounting a "campaign to tarnish Mr Allen's reputation a second time."</span></p>
