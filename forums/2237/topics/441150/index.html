Kurds in Northern Kurdistan, the territory that still remains under Turkish control and is recognized as South - East Turkey, for many years have been facing enormous persecutions and horrible oppressions simply because they are Kurds.<br><br>The entire Kurdish population of that territory, estimated to be         </span></span></td>

              <td colspan="2" valign="top"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><span lang="en-us">about 20 million people, has been subjected to assimilation and Turkification . The number of actions have been taken by Turkish state to annihilate Kurdish identity and eliminate any attempt of expressing Kurdish origin, culture, customs...<br><br>As a result of that policy toward Kurdish minority, the organization known as PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) emerged in the end of 70s. Since the beginning of its existence,</span><span style="letter-spacing: -4pt;">www.ekurd.net</span><span lang="en-us"> the members of PKK dedicated their lives to the idea of defending Kurdish nation and preserving its culture and identity. Labeled as "terrorist organization" by Turkish state - PKK members and its supporters encounter a great difficulty and persecutions in their every day life from the Turkish authority, such as arrests, imprisonments and even murders.<br><br>Considering the fact that any attempt of gaining basic human rights by Kurdish people in a peaceful way was blocked by Turkish state and resulted in more persecutions toward Kurds - the members of PKK had no other choice but to undertake the armed struggle for the rights of Kurdish people. This struggle was directed toward Turkish police and military forces. The war between PKK and Turkish state has been lasted for many years and like in any war caused a number of casualties from both sides. That is a price of every war. But even in a war - if it is carried out by civilized humans, there are some rules and these rules are regulated by the law.<br><br>Unfortunately Turkish state appears to act out of these rules and against the law.<br><br>As it is widely known, chemical weapon is illegal and its use is an act of crime. <br><br>On 22nd October 2011 Turkish state broke the international law and killed Kurdish freedom fighters, the guerillas of PKK, with the<strong><a href="http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2011/11/turkey3532.htm">chemical weapon</a></strong> and napalm bombs. This criminal act should not only be condemned, but also taken to a justice as something which is absolutely unacceptable in XXI century in a civilized world.<br><br>Even if Turkish state insists to label Kurdish freedom fighters of PKK as "terrorists" and their activity as "acts of terrorism", as a crime - the PKK members still have an unalienable human right to be taken to court, have a fair trial and defend themselves. Instead of that, in most cases, PKK freedom fighters who were captured by Turkish forces, used to be murdered straight away and their death bodies very often were subjected to inhuman mutilation.<br><br>Turkey as a member of NATO is supposed to act according to rules and international law. The use of illegal chemical weapon by the member of NATO is equal with the fact that NATO broke the law and committed the crime against humanity. Something like that should not and cannot be accepted any longer by the international community - even if Turkey is considered to be Western countries "alley". <br><br>The members of NATO should stand for the safety of the world. This safety is at serious risk and is affected by illegal, criminal acts committed by Turkish state.<br><br>That's why Turkey must be stopped right now! Otherwise the world may face the day, when a state considered as "alley" will turn into deadly danger for anyone, whom Turkey will decide to label as "terrorists". We cannot feel safe if any area can be attacked at any time by Turkish state, claiming "the war with terrorism", as they doing with Kurdish people and what in fact is nothing, but a genocide under the banner of "fighting terrorism". It must be stopped now. International community and Western World cannot be silent any longer, when human rights and law is being broken and the values of humanity disrespected.<br><br>Please, stop Turkey right now!<br><br>With respect and with deep hope that justice still exists in this world,<br><br>Kulka Iwona Bugno</span></span></td>
