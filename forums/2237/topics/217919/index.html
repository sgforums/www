The glass-encased chips were planted in the recipients' upper right arms and 'read' by a device similar to a credit card reader.<br><br>In their Report on the Surveillance Society, the authors now warn: "The call for everyone to be implanted is now being seriously debated."<br><br>The authors also highlight the Government's huge enthusiasm for CCTV, pointing out that during the 1990s the Home Office spent 78 per cent of its crime prevention budget - a total of Â£500 million - on installing the cameras.<br><br>There are now 4.2 million CCTV cameras in Britain and the average Briton is caught on camera an astonishing 300 times every day.<br><br>This huge enthusiasm comes despite official Home Office statistics showing that CCTV cameras have 'little effect on crime levels'.<br><br>They write: "The surveillance society has come about us without us realising", adding: "Some of it is essential for providing the services we need: health, benefits, education. Some of it is more questionable. Some of it may be unjustified, intrusive and oppressive."<br><br>Yesterday Information Commissioner Richard Thomas, whose office is investigating the Post Office, HSBC, NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland over claims they dumped sensitive customer details in the street, said: "Many of these schemes are public sector driven, and the individual has no choice over whether or not to take part."<br><br>"People are being scrutinised and having their lives tracked, and are not even aware of it."<br><br>He has also voiced his concern about the consequences of companies, or Government agencies, building up too much personal information about someone.<br><br>He said: "It can stigmatise people. I have worries about technology being used to identify classes of people who present some kind of risk to society. And I think there are real anxieties about that."<br><br>Yesterday a spokesman for civil liberties campaigners Liberty said: "We have got nothing about these surveillance technologies in themselves, but it is their potential uses about which there are legitimate fears. Unless their uses are regulated properly, people really could find themselves living in a surveillance society.<br><br>"There is a rather scary underlying feeling that people may worry that these microchips are less about being a human being than becoming a barcoded product."</div>
