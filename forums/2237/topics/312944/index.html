              <h1>Researchers Play Tune Recorded Before Edison</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="byline">By JODY ROSEN</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For more than a century, since he captured the spoken words “Mary had a little lamb” on a sheet of tinfoil, <a title="More articles about Thomas A. Edison." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/thomas_a_edison/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Thomas Edison</a> has been considered the father of recorded sound. But researchers say
              they have unearthed a recording of the human voice, made by a
              little-known Frenchman, that predates Edison’s invention of the
              phonograph by nearly two decades.</p>
              <p>The 10-second recording of a singer crooning the folk song “Au Clair
              de la Lune” was discovered earlier this month in an archive in Paris by
              a group of American audio historians. It was made, the researchers say,
              on April 9, 1860, on a phonautograph, a machine designed to record
              sounds visually, not to play them back. But the phonautograph
              recording, or phonautogram, was made playable — converted from
              squiggles on paper to sound — by scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley
              National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif.</p>
              <p>“This is a historic find, the earliest known recording of sound,”
              said Samuel Brylawski, the former head of the recorded-sound division
              of the <a title="More articles about Library of Congress" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/l/library_of_congress/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Library of Congress</a>,
              who is not affiliated with the research group but who was familiar with
              its findings. The audio excavation could give a new primacy to the
              phonautograph, once considered a curio, and its inventor, Édouard-Léon
              Scott de Martinville, a Parisian typesetter and tinkerer who went to
              his grave convinced that credit for his breakthroughs had been
              improperly bestowed on Edison.</p>
              <p>Scott’s device had a barrel-shaped horn attached to a stylus, which
              etched sound waves onto sheets of paper blackened by smoke from an oil
              lamp. The recordings were not intended for listening; the idea of audio
              playback had not been conceived. Rather, Scott sought to create a paper
              record of human speech that could later be deciphered.</p>
              <p>But the Lawrence Berkeley scientists used optical imaging and a
              “virtual stylus” on high-resolution scans of the phonautogram,
              deploying modern technology to extract sound from patterns inscribed on
              the soot-blackened paper almost a century and a half ago. The
              scientists belong to an informal collaborative called First Sounds that
              also includes audio historians and sound engineers.</p>
              <p>David Giovannoni, an American audio historian who led the research
              effort, will present the findings and play the recording in public on
              Friday at the annual conference of the Association for Recorded Sound
              Collections at <a title="More articles about Stanford University" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/stanford_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Stanford University</a> in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
              <p>Scott’s 1860 phonautogram was made 17 years before Edison received a
              patent for the phonograph and 28 years before an Edison associate
              captured a snippet of a Handel oratorio on a wax cylinder, a recording
              that until now was widely regarded by experts as the oldest that could
              be played back.</p>
              <p>Mr. Giovannoni’s presentation on Friday will showcase additional
              Scott phonautograms discovered in Paris, including recordings made in
              1853 and 1854. Those first experiments included attempts to capture the
              sounds of a human voice and a guitar, but Scott’s machine was at that
              time imperfectly calibrated.</p>
              <p>“We got the early phonautograms to squawk, that’s about it,” Mr. Giovannoni said.</p>
              <p>But the April 1860 phonautogram is more than a squawk. On a digital
              copy of the recording provided to The New York Times, the anonymous
              vocalist, probably female, can be heard against a hissing, crackling
              background din. The voice, muffled but audible, sings, “Au clair de la
              lune, Pierrot répondit” in a lilting 11-note melody — a ghostly tune,
              drifting out of the sonic murk.</p>
              <p>The hunt for this audio holy grail was begun in the fall by Mr.
              Giovannoni and three associates: Patrick Feaster, an expert in the
              history of the phonograph who teaches at <a title="More articles about Indiana University" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/indiana_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Indiana University</a>,
              and Richard Martin and Meagan Hennessey, owners of Archeophone Records,
              a label specializing in early sound recordings. They had collaborated
              on the Archeophone album “Actionable Offenses,” a collection of obscene
              19th-century records that received two Grammy nominations. When Mr.
              Giovannoni raised the possibility of compiling an anthology of the
              world’s oldest recorded sounds, Mr. Feaster suggested they go digging
              for Scott’s phonautograms.</p>
              <p>Historians have long been aware of Scott’s work. But the American
              researchers believe they are the first to make a concerted search for
              Scott’s phonautograms or attempt to play them back.</p>
              <p>In December Mr. Giovannoni and a research assistant traveled to a
              patent office in Paris, the Institut National de la Propriété
              Industrielle. There he found recordings from 1857 and 1859 that were
              included by Scott in his phonautograph patent application. Mr.
              Giovannoni said that he worked with the archive staff there to make
              high-resolution, preservation-grade digital scans of these recordings.</p>
              <p>A trail of clues, including a cryptic reference in Scott’s writings
              to phonautogram deposits made at “the Academy,” led the researchers to
              another Paris institution, the French Academy of Sciences, where
              several more of Scott’s recordings were stored. Mr. Giovannoni said
              that his eureka moment came when he laid eyes on the April 1860
              phonautogram, an immaculately preserved sheet of rag paper 9 inches by
              25 inches.</p>
              <p>“It was pristine,” Mr. Giovannoni said. “The sound waves were remarkably clear and clean.”</p>
              <p>His scans were sent to the Lawrence Berkeley lab, where they were
              converted into sound by the scientists Carl Haber and Earl Cornell.
              They used a technology developed several years ago in collaboration
              with the Library of Congress, in which high-resolution “maps” of
              grooved records are played on a computer using a digital stylus. The
              1860 phonautogram was separated into 16 tracks, which Mr. Giovannoni,
              Mr. Feaster and Mr. Martin meticulously stitched back together, making
              adjustments for variations in the speed of Scott’s hand-cranked
              recording.</p>
              <p>Listeners are now left to ponder the oddity of hearing a recording made before the idea of audio playback was even imagined.</p>
              <p>“There is a yawning epistemic gap between us and Léon Scott, because
              he thought that the way one gets to the truth of sound is by looking at
              it,” said Jonathan Sterne, a professor at <a title="More articles about McGill University" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/mcgill_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org">McGill University</a> in Montreal and the author of “The Audible Past: Cultural Origins of Sound Reproduction.”</p>
              <p>Scott is in many ways an unlikely hero of recorded sound. Born in
              Paris in 1817, he was a man of letters, not a scientist, who worked in
              the printing trade and as a librarian. He published a book on the
              history of shorthand, and evidently viewed sound recording as an
              extension of stenography. In a self-published memoir in 1878, he railed
              against Edison for “appropriating” his methods and misconstruing the
              purpose of recording technology. The goal, Scott argued, was not sound
              reproduction, but “writing speech, which is what the word phonograph
              means.”</p>
              <p>In fact, Edison arrived at his advances on his own. There is no
              evidence that Edison drew on knowledge of Scott’s work to create his
              phonograph, and he retains the distinction of being the first to
              reproduce sound.</p>
              <p>“Edison is not diminished whatsoever by this discovery,” Mr. Giovannoni said.</p>
              <p>Paul Israel, director of the Thomas A. Edison Papers at <a title="More articles about Rutgers" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/rutgers_the_state_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Rutgers University</a> in Piscataway, N.J., praised the discovery as a “tremendous
              achievement,” but called Edison’s phonograph a more significant
              technological feat.</p>
              <p>“What made Edison different from Scott was that he was trying to reproduce sound and he succeeded,” Mr. Israel said.</p>
              <p>But history is finally catching up with Scott.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sterne, the McGill professor, said: “We are in a period that is
              more similar to the 1860s than the 1880s. With computers, there is an
              unprecedented visualization of sound.”</p>
              <p>The acclaim Scott sought may turn out to have been assured by the
              very sonic reproduction he disdained. And it took a group of American
              researchers to rescue Scott’s work from the musty vaults of his home
              city. In his memoir, Scott scorned his American rival Edison and made
              brazen appeals to French nationalism. “What are the rights of the
              discoverer versus the improver?” he wrote less than a year before his
              death in 1879. “Come, Parisians, don’t let them take our prize.”</p>
