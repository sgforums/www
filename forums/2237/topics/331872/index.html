              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">   </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">Virginia
              Gov. Timothy Kaine is being called on the carpet by a national
              religious freedom advocacy organization after his administration
              implemented a new state policy forbidding state police chaplains from
              using "Jesus Christ" in public prayers, and half a dozen chaplains
              resigned in protest.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">"This edict is unacceptable and unconstitutional and must be reversed immediately," said Bishop Council Nedd, chief of <a href="http://www.ingodwetrustusa.org/">the group called In God We Trust USA.</a> "Governor Kaine must immediately rescind this decision and beg the
              state police chaplains who have resigned in protest to return to duty."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">Gordon Klingenschmitt, a former Navy chaplain who's been through a similar situation, also condemned the action.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">"It's
              happening all over again! I cannot believe we live in a society where
              government officials literally dictate the content of a chaplain's
              prayers and dare to punish or exclude chaplains who pray 'in Jesus
              name,'" said <a href="http://www.prayinjesusname.org/"> Klingenschmitt,</a> who was fired from the military last year for praying "in Jesus name."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">He later won a victory in Congress providing that right to other military chaplains and has a case pending to be reinstated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;"><em>(Story continues below)</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">"<a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/AboutTheGovernor/contactGovernor.cfm">Kaine</a> should be held responsible, since he campaigned as a Christian to get
              our votes. Now let's see him govern like a Christian," Klingenschmitt
              said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">According
              to Nedd, the ban was issued by state police Col. W. Steven Flaherty to
              chaplains just weeks ago. The dispute became public through the work of
              Charles W. Carrico Sr., a member of Virginia's House of Delegates who
              is a former trooper and will head up a Virginia effort to oppose the
              policy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">"In
              God We Trust will assist Delegate Carrico and oppose this policy with
              every means at our disposal," said Nedd. "Our supporters in Virginia
              are absolutely furious that the Commonwealth's government would rather
              its state troopers go without chaplains than risk someone being
              offended by a Christian chaplain invoking the name of Jesus Christ,"
              Nedd said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">The
              group's report said there had been no complaints about any of the
              prayers by chaplains; it was simply a ban adopted "to prevent any
              possible future lawsuits."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">The
              action, however, violates their First Amendment rights and prevents the
              chaplains "from serving effectively," said House Majority Leader H.
              Morgan Griffith. "These men had little choice but to resign."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">Flaherty
              reported he was acting on an appeals court ruling dealing with prayers
              at the Fredericksburg city council, and his rule allowed only
              "nondenominational" prayers at public events.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">He said those who object could opt out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">"This
              is not a forced situation," a spokeswoman for the state law enforcement
              agency said. "We wouldn't put them in that position."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=52749">Klingenschmitt battled the military over the same dispute.</a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">He called those who resigned heroes, "because they refused to deny Jesus when ordered to by the Kaine administration."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=70427">The
              appeals court opinion the state cited was decided in a written ruling
              from former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who said
              discriminating against anyone who prays "in Jesus name" among officials
              rotating responsibilities to open city meetings is fair and reasonable. </a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">Her reasoning left Klingenschmitt wondering how that conclusion had been reached.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=70427">That
              dispute focused on Rev. Hashmel Turner, a resident of Fredericksburg,
              Va., and a member of the town council, who was a part of a rotation of
              council members who prayed at the council meetings. He ended his
              prayers "in Jesus name."</a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">That
              phrase, however, offended a listener, who prompted the involvement of
              several activist groups that threatened a lawsuit if the elected
              Christian council member continued to be allowed to pray "in Jesus
              name."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">The city then adopted a non-sectarian prayer requirement, imposing a ban on any reference to "Jesus."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">O'Connor
              wrote: "The restriction that prayers be nonsectarian in nature is
              designed to make the prayers accessible to people who come from a
              variety of backgrounds, not to exclude or disparage a particular faith."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">"Ironically,
              she admitted Turner was excluded from participating solely because of
              the Christian content of his prayer," Klingenschmitt noted.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: palatino,times new roman,georgia,times; font-size: small;">"The
              Fredericksburg government violated everybody's rights by establishing a
              nonsectarian religion, and requiring all prayers conform, or face
              punishment of exclusion," he said.</span></p>
