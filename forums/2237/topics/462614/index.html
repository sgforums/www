              </p><p class="first" style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">Two Australian radio presenters who made a hoax call to the hospital treating Prince William's pregnant wife Catherine were taken off the air on Saturday after the nurse who took the call was found dead in a suspected suicide.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">Jacintha Saldanha answered the phone when presenters from Sydney's 2Day FM called pretending to be Queen Elizabeth II and William's father Prince Charles, before passing it onto a colleague who divulged details of Kate's condition.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">Saldanha was found dead on Friday, with police saying her death was not being treated as suspicious. Her employers, London's private King Edward VII hospital, refused to comment on media reports that she had taken her own life.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">News of the death prompted a furious outpouring against the radio station and the two presenters involved, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, who are said to be "deeply shocked" by the turn of events.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">"It's fair to say they are completely shattered," Rhys Holleran, chief executive of Southern Cross Austereo which owns 2Day FM, said of the pair who had only been presenting together for a couple of weeks.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">Holleran said the station and the hosts had decided that their show will not return "until further notice out of respect of what can only be described as a tragedy".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">The radio station's Facebook page has been bombarded with thousands of comments on the death, many attacking the presenters and calling for them to be sacked while at least one major company has withdrawn its advertising.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">"Not so darn funny now is it? A British nurse is DEAD for the sake of a couple of cheap laughs. Shame on you!" wrote Kim Wilson.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">Police said they had been called to an address close to the hospital on Friday morning following reports that a woman was unconscious, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">"The death is being treated as unexplained," a statement said, while a spokesman said results of a post-mortem were due this weekend.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">The family of the nurse, who reportedly had two children, appealed for privacy while they came to terms with her death.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">"We as a family are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved Jacintha," they said in a statement.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">More than 13,650 comments had hit the 2Day FM page by Saturday afternoon, some saying Greig and Christian had blood on their hands and calling angrily for them to be dismissed.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">For some the incident had echoes of Prince William's mother Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">"One would think... the death of Princess Diana would have taught the media a lesson about invasion of privacy of the royal family, but I guess not," said one commentator posting as Lora LB.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">Prince William and Kate have said they were "deeply saddened" by Saldanha's death, while Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard said it was a "terrible tragedy".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">The hoax caused a global media storm, coming barely a day after the palace revealed the 30-year-old royal was pregnant following her admission to hospital on Monday with severe morning sickness where she stayed three nights.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">Greig and Christian apologised after an uproar in Britain but the station initially milked the publicity as the "biggest royal prank ever".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">In the phone call, in which Greig impersonated Queen Elizabeth II, Saldanha is heard saying, "Oh yes, just hold on, Ma'am", before putting her through to another nurse who revealed that Kate "hasn't had any retching with me since I've been on duty and she has been sleeping on and off".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">The royals did not complain about the incident but it sparked intense media coverage and the chief executive of the hospital, John Lofthouse, said staff had been trying to help Saldanha "through this very difficult time".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">The Australian presenters had insisted their hoax was lighthearted and even Prince Charles joked about the incident, saying to reporters asking him about Kate's condition on Thursday: "How do you know I'm not a radio station?"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">But the joke divided the public in Australia, with some seeing it as "a bit of harmless fun" and others saying a line had been crossed and everyone had a right to privacy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.450000762939453px;">The widespread shock at the nurse's death is a sharp contrast with the excitement that greeted the announcement of a new royal heir this week. William and Kate's first child will be third in line to the British throne.</p>

              <p>I've been reading the reports on this the whole morning. The nurse who was found dead, merely put the call through to another nurse. Barely had any conversation with the prank callers.</p>
              <p>So there is no link between her death and the prank callers. Other than the fact, it was pure coincidence. You see how people react when they try to link 2 separate events into one, because the reports word it that way?</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Jacintha Saldanha answered the phone when presenters from Sydney's 2Day FM called pretending to be Queen Elizabeth II and William's father Prince Charles, before passing it onto a colleague who divulged details of Kate's condition.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Saldanha was found dead on Friday, with police saying her death was not being treated as suspicious. Her employers, London's private King Edward VII hospital, refused to comment on media reports that she had taken her own life.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">News of the death prompted a furious outpouring against the radio station and the two presenters involved, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, who are said to be "deeply shocked" by the turn of events.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">"It's fair to say they are completely shattered," Rhys Holleran, chief executive of Southern Cross Austereo which owns 2Day FM, said of the pair who had only been presenting together for a couple of weeks.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Holleran said the station and the hosts had decided that their show will not return "until further notice out of respect of what can only be described as a tragedy".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The radio station's Facebook page has been bombarded with thousands of comments on the death, many attacking the presenters and calling for them to be sacked while at least one major company has withdrawn its advertising.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">"Not so darn funny now is it? A British nurse is DEAD for the sake of a couple of cheap laughs. Shame on you!" wrote Kim Wilson.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Police said they had been called to an address close to the hospital on Friday morning following reports that a woman was unconscious, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">"The death is being treated as unexplained," a statement said, while a spokesman said results of a post-mortem were due this weekend.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">"We as a family are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved Jacintha," they said in a statement.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">More than 13,650 comments had hit the 2Day FM page by Saturday afternoon, some saying Greig and Christian had blood on their hands and calling angrily for them to be dismissed.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">For some the incident had echoes of Prince William's mother Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">"One would think... the death of Princess Diana would have taught the media a lesson about invasion of privacy of the royal family, but I guess not," said one commentator posting as Lora LB.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Prince William and Kate have said they were "deeply saddened" by Saldanha's death, while Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard said it was a "terrible tragedy".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The hoax caused a global media storm, coming barely a day after the palace revealed the 30-year-old royal was pregnant following her admission to hospital on Monday with severe morning sickness where she stayed three nights.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Greig and Christian apologised after an uproar in Britain but the station initially milked the publicity as the "biggest royal prank ever".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">In the phone call, in which Greig impersonated Queen Elizabeth II, Saldanha is heard saying, "Oh yes, just hold on, Ma'am", before putting her through to another nurse who revealed that Kate "hasn't had any retching with me since I've been on duty and she has been sleeping on and off".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The royals did not complain about the incident but it sparked intense media coverage and the chief executive of the hospital, John Lofthouse, said staff had been trying to help Saldanha "through this very difficult time".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The Australian presenters had insisted their hoax was lighthearted and even Prince Charles joked about the incident, saying to reporters asking him about Kate's condition on Thursday: "How do you know I'm not a radio station?"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">But the joke divided the public in Australia, with some seeing it as "a bit of harmless fun" and others saying a line had been crossed and everyone had a right to privacy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The widespread shock at the nurse's death is a sharp contrast with the excitement that greeted the announcement of a new royal heir this week. William and Kate's first child will be third in line to the British throne.</p>

              <p>You don't get the question do you? The victim picked up the call, and handed it over to her colleague, who conversed with the pranksters.</p>

              <p>The question here is how. When the victim merely transfered the call over to her colleague. How is her death linked to her transfering the prank call to her colleague? It was her colleague doing all the talking and getting pranked.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup in the UK  and Europe  people are suffering  from unemployment ...many can't pay their bills and some even go tot he supermarket  to buy only promotions and budget buys after 5pm in the evening. So those ang mohs who are working here  and living it up like lords and ladies are damn lucky! Young people in Uk don't always live with their parents  .  At 18 you are expected to look after yourself. So to lose your job is serious.</div>
