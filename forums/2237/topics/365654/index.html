              <p class="standfirst"><strong style="display: block;"><strong><span style="color: red;">EXCLUSIVE:</span></strong> A MAGISTRATE is under fire for letting a teenage rapist go free and declaring the boy's crime <span style="color: #ff0000;">"an adolescent error".</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Experienced
              judge Ro</span>wan McIndoe found the 16-year-old had sex with a girl without
              her consent, but labelled it <span style="color: #ff0000;">"a technical rape</span>".</p>
              <p>Victims' groups said the decision was offensive, and warned it sent a confusing message to young men.</p>
              <p>A Supreme Court judge who reviewed the ruling on appeal last week
              said the magistrate's words were "at the very least unfortunate".</p>
              <p>"There is no such thing as a technical rape. Rape is a serious criminal offence," Justice Beach said.</p>
              <p>He dismissed an appeal by the boy's lawyers and ruled a rape conviction should stand.</p>
              <p>The sex assault occurred in 2007 when the girl - then 17 - visited the boy, whom she once went out with for about two months.</p>
              <p>After watching TV, she got into bed with him and they kissed and
              performed other consensual acts until he forced himself on her.</p>
              <p>She gave evidence she told him to stop and get off and said "he kept having sex with me after I'd said I didn't want to".</p>
              <p>In a police interview tendered to the magistrate, the boy admitted
              hearing the girl object. "She said - she did say, 'No', but like very
              quietly," he told police.</p>
              <p>Later in the interview, he added: "But like, she didn't push me off or anything."</p>
              <p>He changed his evidence in court, but Magistrate McIndoe said the
              victim was "a most persuasive witness" and accepted her account of
              events.</p>
              <p>"And I think there is no doubt the evidence . . . by the prosecution
              establishes as fact that there was absence of consent," he said.</p>
              <p>Having found the charge proved in March last year, Mr McIndoe
              discharged the matter the following day. The court register records the
              order as: "Defendant discharged. Other reasons: A technical rape more
              an adolescent error . . ."</p>
              <p>The order would likely have stayed hidden behind secrecy laws
              shielding Children's Court cases if not for last week's Supreme Court
              appeal judgment.</p>
              <p>Victorian Centres Against Sexual Assault convener Karen Hogan said the magistrate's comments were disappointing.</p>
              <p>"If someone says no, it means no. Rape is rape," she said. "(The
              boy) has committed an offence and the judge has said, 'yes, you have,
              but we'll ignore it'. What does that say to the victim?"</p>
              <p>National Association of Services Against Sexual Violence chair Karen Willis said there was no such thing as "a technical rape".</p>
              <p>"I think the average 16-year-old understands no. It's not an error," she said.</p>
              <p>"If he got drunk and drove his car into people, would that be a mistake too?"</p>
              <p>Mr McIndoe was appointed a magistrate in the 1980s.</p>
