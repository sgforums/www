The girl is a personal friend," the 60-year-old Chua said in a statement released at a news conference in his home state of Johor bordering Singapore.<br><br>His admission came hours after the local Star newspaper said two DVDs, showing a man resembling a senior politician and a woman engaging in various sexual acts, were being widely distributed in the state.<br><br>Chua, who is married, said he did not make the DVDs, which the Star said were closed-circuit recordings in a hotel room. One DVD lasted 56 minutes and the other 44 minutes.<br><br>"I would like to emphasize I did not make the tape myself," he said. "Who have done this is not important. What is most important is that my family, wife and children have accepted my apology."<br><br>Chua, a leader of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), part of the ruling coalition, said he had met the prime minister over the incident.<br><br>"I have seen Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Deputy PM Najib (Razak) and MCA president Ong Ka Ting and I have personally apologized to them."<br><br>"I appeal to the press to give me and my family some space during this difficult time."<br><br>Abdullah's four-year-old administration has been saddled with major political problems lately, a sign he may be forced to delay elections beyond March, when many had expected them to take place.<br><br>In late November, more than 10,000 ethnic Indians took to the streets in an unprecedented protest to complain of racial discrimination.<br><br>(Reporting by Jalil Hamid)</blockquote></div>
