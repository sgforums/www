That is not possible with passive tags because the energy from the reader is blocked by the metal."<br><br>Public acceptance<br><br>While active tags do offer the benefit of being read over greater distances, there are health concerns arising from questions about transmission frequency.<br><br>"With a passive tag, the transmissions are limited as the only signal comes from a transmitter/receiver and tend to be spasmodic," said Roger Lewis, editor of RFID Today.<br><br>"The public perception for passive tags is bad enough but with an active tag, it would most likely be felt that the transmission could be potentially more continual. Plus with a power source close to the person, opinion could be against the tags.<br><br>"Most of these perceptions are erroneous but they are real public perceptions that can undermine a product.<br><br>"As an example, the Department of Trade and Industry was asked by a man in Devon that if he bought products from Tesco, if Tesco could know in which room of his house he used them? Of course this is totally wrong and few tags are used to product level, but these are just the sort of problems facing RFID.<br><br>"Active tags could be more appropriate when affixed to permanent fixtures, like shipping containers, taxis, etc; that are read frequently."<br><br>Distant track<br><br>Mr Roberti added: "There are many other potential applications, such as tracking assets over a longer read range.<br><br>"With a battery, a credit-card-sized tag might be read from 300ft. Without a battery, a tag might be read from 15ft.<br><br>"So, you could use these inexpensive battery powered labels to track wheel chairs in hospitals or tools in factories or many other assets that need to be read from farther than 15ft away."<br><br>NEC has not talked about costs at this point, but says they will continue to work on the stability and the expansion of battery life towards possible commercialisation in the future.</div>
