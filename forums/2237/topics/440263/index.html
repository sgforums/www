              <p><a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=066570:KS">LG Electronics Inc. (066570)</a>’s new Optimus
              phone sports a display sharper than the one on <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=AAPL:US">Apple Inc. (AAPL)</a>’s
              iPhone and its chip puts it on par with Samsung Electronics
              Co.’s newest Galaxy. Gwon Soo Seok, 23, still isn’t won over.</p>
              <p>“LG’s image is that of a laggard,” said Gwon, a student
              in Seoul who is leaning toward an iPhone or a Galaxy. “LG seems
              to have good technology, but Apple and Samsung are the cool
              ones,” said Gwon, who stopped using devices made by Seoul-based
              LG, the world’s No. 3 phonemaker, three years ago.</p>
              <p>The failure to woo consumers like Gwon leaves LG at a
              disadvantage to Apple and Samsung in smartphones, the fastest-
              growing segment of the $207 billion mobile-phone industry. LG
              had 718 billion won ($625 million) in operating losses at the
              handset division in the year to June, compared with a 5.7
              trillion-won profit in the same period at Samsung.</p>
              <p>“LG was slow to embrace the smartphone market, and they
              are still having a hard time correcting the mistake,” said Lim
              Han Eui, a telecommunications consultant at ROA Consulting in
              Seoul. “There has been nothing particularly special about their
              phones. They need to develop their own color and identity.”</p>
              <p>LG, whose panel unit supplies the “<a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/retina-display.html">Retina</a>” displays used
              in the iPhone, introduced its first smartphone globally last
              year, more than three years after the debut of the Apple device.</p>
              <p>Apple, based in Cupertino, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/california/">California</a>, accounted for 18.5
              percent of global smartphone shipments in the second quarter,
              compared with 13.5 percent a year earlier, research company
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/strategy-analytics/">Strategy Analytics</a> said in July. <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=NOK1V:FH">Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)</a>, based in Espoo,
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/finland/">Finland</a>, dropped to third place, falling behind Samsung after
              its market share shrank to 15.2 percent from 38.1 percent.</p>
              <h2>‘Behind the Curve’</h2>
              <p>Including basic phones, Nokia remained the world’s biggest
              handset maker with a 24.5 percent share, followed by Samsung at
              20.5 percent and LG at 6.9 percent, according to the researcher.</p>
              <p>“They’ve been behind the curve and are constantly playing
              catch-up,” Annalisa Di Chiara, a Hong Kong-based senior analyst
              at Moody’s, said of LG. “The question, really, is whether they
              will ever catch up on the mobile side.”</p>
              <p>LG shares have slumped 36 percent this year, compared with
              a 3.4 percent drop for Samsung, a 22 percent jump for Apple and
              a 39 percent tumble for Nokia.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, Moody’s cut the outlook for LG’s Baa2
              issuer and senior unsecured debt rating to “negative” from
              “stable,” citing weakness in the handset market. <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/standard-%26-poor%27s/">Standard &amp;
              Poor’s</a> lowered the long-term corporate credit and senior
              unsecured debt ratings to BBB- from BBB on Oct. 14.</p>
              <h2>Hard Sell</h2>
              <p>The company is aiming to stem losses and convince investors
              a turnaround is possible. Koo Bon Joon, the younger brother of
              LG Group’s chairman, took over last year after his predecessor
              Nam Yong quit, taking responsibility for failing to come up with
              a model to counter the iPhone.</p>
              <p>The maker of Chocolate and Prada handsets is cutting back
              on less-profitable models, Park Jong Seok, head of the mobile
              business, said in July. More than 12 new models have been
              unveiled this year, under the Optimus brand.</p>
              <p>LG showcased the <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/newsroom/contents/61566">Optimus LTE</a> in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/seoul/">Seoul</a> on Oct. 10, touting
              its 329 pixels-per-inch screen compared with the iPhone <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html">4S’s 326</a>.
              The chip has a 1.5 gigahertz processor, the same as Samsung’s
              latest Galaxy model.</p>
              <p>LG has the strength in technology for next-generation
              mobile devices such as the long-term evolution model, said Ken Hong, a Seoul-based spokesman. The latest phone is capable of
              running on faster networks using the so-called LTE technology.</p>
              <h2>‘Ripe Time’</h2>
              <p>“Time is ripe for us to put that into action,” he said.
              “The Year 2012 is going to be a significantly different scene
              from now.”</p>
              <p>The company is also betting on 3-D technology in mobile
              phones, a feature Samsung and Apple don’t offer. It introduced a
              3-D phone this year and plans are in place for more, said Jeong
              Ok Hyun, head of LG’s research center.</p>
              <p>Full-year net loss at the mobile-phone division may narrow
              to 270 billion won in 2011 compared with the 654 billion won
              loss a year earlier, according to the average of four analysts’
              estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. LG is scheduled to report
              third-quarter earnings this week.</p>
              <p>“LG’s strategy seems to be to make anything they can come
              up with, with the hope that something will become a hit,” said
              Woo Chang Hee, a Seoul-based analyst at LIG Investment &amp;
              Securities Co. “They may be taking the right steps, but the
              pace isn’t fast enough.”</p>
              <p>Until that happens, student Gwon says he will stay away.</p>
              <p>“I want to see more people around me using LG phones first
              before I buy,” he said.</p>
