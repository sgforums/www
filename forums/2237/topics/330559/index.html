              </span></p><p>A TEEN sex beast attacked four women in an
                          imitation of violent computer game Grand Theft Auto, a court heard
                          yesterday, reported by The Sun.
                          Ryan Chinnery, 19, prowled streets in his car targeting females he
                          thought were prostitutes after becoming obsessed with the video nasty.</p>
              <p>The details are as below:</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
              <p>He assaulted his victims, none of them hookers, by night in a two-month period.</p>
              <p>And the court was told he may have been influenced by the virtual
                          reality game, in which a character drives around on "missions" -
                          including approaching prostitutes who can be beaten up.</p>
              <p><strong>Dragged </strong></p>
              <p>A copy of Grand Theft Auto was found at his home by police.
                          Yesterday Chinnery was told he faces a long prison sentence after he
                          admitted two sex attacks. Two similar offences were left on file.</p>
              <p>The pervert was 17 when he began hunting women in June last year
                          close to Ashford, Kent, where he lived with his girlfriend, Maidstone
                          Crown Court was told.</p>
              <p>He attacked his first victim under a railway bridge, pulling down
                          her trousers and touching her breasts. A month later he dragged another
                          woman along a path before they fell down an embankment into a river.</p>
              <p>He fled, apologising, after three lads hauled them out. The third
                          victim was attacked as she walked home from work. Chinnery grabbed her
                          arms and only let go as a man approached.</p>
              <p>He struck the woman on the ear before running off.</p>
              <p>Chinnery's most serious attack came when he seized a 42-year-old
                          woman round the throat. She broke an arm as they toppled down a bank,
                          but he made her remove her clothing, sexually assaulted her, and
                          performed a sex act on himself.</p>
