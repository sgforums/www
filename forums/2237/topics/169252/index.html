The symposium marked the anniversary of November 29, 1947, the day the<br>U.N. General Assembly passed the Partition Plan which is marked annually in<br>the Arab world with the ceremonies of solidarity with Palestinians.<br>Al-Manar's symposium was devoted to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and<br>participants included Shafiq Al-Hut, a former PLO representative in Lebanon,<br>and Palestinian, Lebanese and Syrian students.<br><br>It should be noted that Universite Libanaise(1) is Lebanon's only<br>government-run university, and the country's largest.(2)<br><br>TO VIEW THIS CLIP, VISIT: http://www.memritv.org/search.asp?ACT=S9&amp;P1=962 .<br><br>Mediator: "The Arab regimes have all accepted the establishing of a<br>Palestinian state on the territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In<br>other words, the 1967 borders only. They believe that the reality and the<br>balance of power do not allow more than that at this stage. Do you support<br>this 'realism,' or do you adhere to what has come to be known as the<br>historical, original Palestine? Let us... Let us... Go ahead."<br><br>Student 1: "My name is Hisham Sham'as, and I study political science. I just<br>want to say everyone is talking about..."<br><br>Mediator: "Please address the question."<br><br>Hisham Sham'as: "The state shouldn't be only within the 1976 borders... Or<br>rather, 1967... Israel must be wiped out."<br><br>Mediator: "You mean, reviving the motto of erasing Israel from the map."<br><br>Hisham Sham'as: "Israel should be completely wiped out, so the Palestinians<br>will have a country to return to."<br><br>Mediator: "If someone tells you this motto is unrealistic, how would you<br>respond?"<br><br>Hisham Sham'as: "There is no such thing as unrealistic. Just as Israel...<br>Just like Hitler fought the Jews - We are a great Islamic nation of Jihad,<br>and we too should fight the Jews and burn them."<br><br>[...]<br><br>Student 2: "Avian flu hit the entire world, and they are trying to find a<br>cure for it now. As for Israel - the only cure for it is to wipe it off the<br>map."<br><br>[...]<br><br>Mediator: "What's your name?"<br><br>Student 3: "Mahmoud Fakhri. I hope what I have to say is not too inciting."<br><br>Mediator: "Go ahead and incite. This is what we're looking for. We want some<br>action."<br><br>Mahmoud Fakhri: "In all honesty, the Arab people should overturn the<br>disappointing regimes."<br><br>Mediator: "Now you are really inciting..."<br><br>Fakhri: "In all honesty, any disappointing government that wants to<br>normalize relations with the Zionist enemy and to sell out the Arab cause,<br>and especially Jerusalem - the people must topple this regime and have its<br>say."<br><br>Endnotes:<br>(1)The University was created in 1953 by the Lebanese State.
