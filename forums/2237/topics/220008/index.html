What's the agenda of the conference? We don't know. I leave this matter to the future," he told reporters.<br><br>The Israeli army, which says Wednesday's shelling was aimed at preventing rocket attacks on Israel, said the deaths were caused by a technical malfunction.<br><br>Israel launched a major offensive in Gaza in June after Palestinian gunmen captured an Israeli soldier and killed two others in a cross-border raid. The military assault has killed more than 370 Palestinians, around half of them civilians. Three Israeli soldiers have been killed.<br><br>FINANCIAL SANCTIONS<br><br>The ministers said that they would refuse to abide by crippling sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe after Hamas ousted Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah party in elections in January.<br><br>"There will be no compliance with any restriction imposed. ... The Arab banks have to transfer money (to the Palestinians)," Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa told a news conference.<br><br>The decision came as Hamas and Fatah opened talks on allocating cabinet seats in a unity government that Palestinians hope will lead to the easing of Western sanctions that have deepened hardship in the occupied West Bank and in Gaza.<br><br>The Arab ministers said they would agree on mechanisms to bypass the embargo. One Arab diplomat said that after difficulties earlier this year, the League was able to successfully transfer $100 million to the Palestinian Authority, although he did not give details of how the transfer was made.<br><br>The diplomat said the problem was not finding a bank willing to do it, but persuading donor states to produce the money.<br><br>The decision to ignore sanctions coincided with a Palestinian call for aid, particularly to help rebuild the town Beit Hanoun, the site of Wednesday's deadly shelling.<br><br>"Beit Hanoun is a disaster area that needs $50 million to rebuild what the latest incursion has destroyed and to rescue the families of the martyrs and wounded immediately and urgently," Zahar said.<br><br>"Our people are looking to you to provide the highest degree of support and assistance and to help lift the unjust embargo," he told the ministers<br><br>Moussa said Kuwait had announced during the meeting a pledge of $30 million to the Palestinian Authority via the Arab League.<br></div>
