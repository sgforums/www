"We have recreated the voices of a lot of famous people that were very close to the real thing and have been used in film dubbing."<br><br>The chart of any individual's voice, known as a voice print, is unique to that person and Suzuki says he believes he has achieved 90 percent accuracy in recreating the quality of the enigmatic woman's speaking tone.<br><br>"I am the Mona Lisa. My true identity is shrouded in mystery," the portrait proclaims on a Web site at http://promotion.msn.co.jp/davinci/voice.htm<br><br>"In Mona Lisa's case, the lower part of her face is quite wide and her chin is pointed," Suzuki explained. "The extra volume means a relatively low voice, while the pointed chin adds mid-pitch tones," he added.<br><br>The scientists brought in an Italian woman to add the necessary intonation to the voice.<br><br>"We then had to think about what to have her say," Suzuki said. "We tried having her speak Japanese, but it didn't suit her image."<br><br>Experts disagree over who was represented in the portrait, with some saying the smiling woman is Leonardo himself, or his mother.<br><br>The team also attempted to recreate Leonardo's own voice in a project timed to coincide with the release of the film "The Da Vinci Code." Suzuki said he was less confident about its accuracy because he had to work from self-portraits where the artist wore a beard, concealing the shape of his face.<br><br>Suzuki's work has made contributions to criminal investigations -- in one case after he successfully aged a person's voice by a decade. A recording of the voice was broadcast on television, leading to the apprehension of a suspect.</div>
