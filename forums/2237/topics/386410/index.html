              <p>SAN FRANCISCO – Last month, marine scientists counted more than
              1,500 sea lions on fabled Pier 39, a record number that delighted
              tourists and baffled experts. Why so many? Why were they sticking
              around? But now, almost all of the sea lions are gone, leaving the
              experts guessing where they went — and why.</p>
              <p>"Most likely, they left chasing a food source," said Jeff Boehm, executive director of the <span id="lw_1262142135_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Marine Mammal Center</span> in Sausalito, which runs an information center and gift shop at Pier
              39. "It's probably what kept them here in the first place."</p>
              <p>On
              Tuesday, 10 sea lions lounged and swam and dove from the docks,
              spreading themselves out where the animals were stacked three and four
              deep just a month ago. The bulk of the herd probably followed their
              favorite foods, sardines and anchovies, <span id="lw_1262142135_1" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Boehm</span> said.</p>
              <p>The
              animals began leaving in droves the day after Thanksgiving, almost as
              if someone had issued an order. But Boehm said the fact that so many
              sea lions stayed for so long is even stranger than their disappearance.</p>
              <p>"They do move off," Boehm said, adding that in the fall, older <span id="lw_1262142135_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">sea lions head</span> to breeding colonies in the <span id="lw_1262142135_3" class="yshortcuts">Channel Islands</span>, off the coast of <span id="lw_1262142135_4" class="yshortcuts">Southern California</span> along the <span id="lw_1262142135_5" class="yshortcuts">Santa Barbara Channel</span>. Younger sea lions, he said, "don't mind those rules and tend to travel far and wide."</p>
              <p>The younger ones still sticking around <span id="lw_1262142135_6" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Pier 39</span> were enough to satisfy hordes of visitors huddled against the wind to
              watch them. The sea lions huddled together, dove off the docks, and
              honked and barked,</p>
              <p>"We're happy with what we
              see," said Carmen Fernandez of Miami Beach, Fla., who was watching the
              sea lions with her husband Carlos.</p>
              <p>Despite the
              sea lions' abrupt disappearance, Boehm said the Marine Mammal Center is
              not concerned that they have left for good. While more then the usual
              number have left — usually about 40 remain — it is very unlikely, Boehm
              said, that they won't come back. He said the herd will probably come
              back, as usual, by the spring.</p>

              <p><cite class="vcard">By JEFF BARNARD, AP Environmental Writer        <span class="fn org">Jeff Barnard </span> </cite> –
                  <abbr class="recenttimedate" title="2010-01-08T17:07:25-0800">46 mins ago</abbr></p>

              <p>GRANTS PASS, Ore. – Hundreds of sea lions that abruptly blew out of
              San Francisco Bay's Pier 39 last Thanksgiving have apparently found a
              new home at another tourist attraction — 500 miles north on the Oregon
              coast. Thousands of California sea lions started showing up in December
              at <span id="lw_1262999258_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Sea Lion Caves</span>, a popular tourist draw because of the Stellar sea lions living in the caves.</p>
              <p>The
              California sea lions appear to have made the trip because of an
              abundance of anchovies at the Oregon site, 11 miles north of the town
              of Florence.</p>
              <p>Scientists say there is no way to say how many of the newcomers came from <span id="lw_1262999258_1" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Pier 39</span>,
              where the numbers fell from a peak of 1,701 in October to just 20 by
              the end of November. But it is likely some did, since they easily swim
              100 miles a day searching for food between Mexico and Alaska.</p>
              <p>Some of the California newcomers came into the cave, but most seem to prefer a nearby rocky beach.</p>
              <p>Kim Raum-Suryan, a biologist at the <span id="lw_1262999258_2" class="yshortcuts">Hatfield Marine Science Center</span> in Newport, noticed the number of California sea lions at <span id="lw_1262999258_3" class="yshortcuts">Heceta Head</span> had doubled to some 5,000 in December and, like other scientists, figures the simple answer is food.</p>
              <p>"My gut feeling is it has something to do with the (ocean warming) <span id="lw_1262999258_4" class="yshortcuts">El Nino conditions</span> off <span id="lw_1262999258_5" class="yshortcuts">California</span>, which is driving prey and sea lions up north," she said.</p>
              <p>There are fewer herrings in San Francisco Bay, and a general decline in <span id="lw_1262999258_6" class="yshortcuts">sea lion food</span> off California last summer triggered a die-off of young sea lions making the transition from mother's milk to fish.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, anchovies have been plentiful in Oregon waters — so plentiful that <span id="lw_1262999258_7" class="yshortcuts">brown pelicans</span> that normally winter in California are also hanging around, said Bob
              Emmett, a fisheries biologist for NOAA Fisheries Service in Newport.</p>
              <p>Picking out which of the newcomer sea lions at <span id="lw_1262999258_8" class="yshortcuts">Oregon Sea Caves</span> are visitors from Pier 39 would be difficult.</p>
              <p>Many
              sea lions are branded, and Raum-Suryan has been recording the brands
              she sees on sea lions at Heceta Head. But she hasn't found anyone who
              did the same at Pier 39.</p>
              <p>Back at Pier 39, a
              marketplace and arcade with a view of Alcatraz, public relations
              director Sue Muzzin was happy to hear a couple dozen sea lions barking
              Thursday, and hopes any that are in Oregon left their hearts in <span id="lw_1262999258_9" class="yshortcuts">San Francisco</span>.</p>
              <p>"People
              are taking photos of the dock because it is so atypical," she said.
              "You don't realize how much you miss them 'til they're gone."</p>
