              <p class="abstract"><strong>PETALING JAYA: A couple is screaming for justice after a foreign maid who sexually abused their 6-year-old son was deported without having to face any criminal charge.</strong></p>
              <p class="abstract">The maid had allegedly performed oral sex on the boy, forced him to watch pornography, locked him in a room for hours on end and deprived him of food.<br><br>She also allegedly made him eat faeces, drink urine and fed him a cocktail of Dettol, cement and detergent.<br><br>These alleged incidents occurred in December. The boy's mother, who identified herself only as Kin, said the maid admitted to the atrocities and was handed over to the police.<br><br>In January, Kin received a letter from the police stating that the maid had been deported to Indonesia after the deputy public prosecutor (DPP) decided not to press charges.</p>
              <p>Kin immediately wrote a letter of appeal to the Attorney-General's Chambers but to date, there has been no reply.<br><br>"Why is this? She admitted to everything," Kin said.<br><br>"How can the authorities simply send her back. She may return under another name and work for another family.<br><br>"And what if she does the same thing? Who is going to be held responsible?"<br><br>Kin said the maid allegedly took revenge after she was reprimanded for bringing strangers into her employer's home.<br><br>The maid had been employed by Kin for almost three years.<br><br>The abuse began in the middle of last year, after she was told off for stealing food from the house and giving it to her contractor boyfriend whom she brought home when the employer was away.<br><br>"Sometime in June, my son complained about being forced to eat his 3-year-old sister's excrement. I thought he was talking nonsense," said Kin.<br><br>"It was my sister who dug further into the matter and found out the truth. The maid admitted abusing my son."<br><br>The boy was sent to the Kuala Lumpur Hospital and psychiatrists confirmed that he was suffering emotional stress, in constant fear, withdrawn and often had terrible nightmares.<br><br>"After all this, the culprit was allowed to go back," added Kin.<br><br>Petaling Jaya district police chief Assistant Commissioner Arjunaidi Mohamed said the case had hit a dead end due to lack of evidence. "It's not to say we don't want to proceed. <br><br>"We cannot proceed," he said, adding that the main reason the case had stalled was because the family had not co-operated with the police. <br><br>He said the maid's admission did not mean anything. <br><br>"An admission, even in a murder case, does not mean anything if we don't have evidence to back it up," said Arjunaidi.</p>
