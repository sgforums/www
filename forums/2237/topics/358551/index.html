              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Facts</em></span></strong></p>
              <p><em>''THE Family Court has allowed a 17-year-old girl to have her breasts removed 
                      so she can be more like a boy.</em></p>
              <p><em>The teenager, code-named "Alex", was on court-ordered hormone medication from 
                      the age o<span style="color: #ff0000;">f 13 to </span>prevent menstruation and breast development. She returned to 
                      the court in December 2007 asking for a double mastectomy to make it easier for 
                      her to pass as a boy.</em></p>
              <p><em>The Chief Justice of the Family Court, Diana Bryant, decided it was in the 
                      teenager's best interests to have the surgery immediately rather than wait until 
                      turning 18.''</em></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">critisms</span></strong></p>
              <p><em>''But ethicist Nick Tonti-Filippini said mainstream medicine did not recognise 
                      hormone treatments and surgery as treatment for gender dysphoria. He said it was 
                      a psychiatric disorder qualifying under American guidelines as a psychosis 
                      because "it's a belief out of accordance with reality".</em></p>
              <p><em>"What you are trying to do is make a biological reality correspond to that 
                      false belief."''</em></p>
              <p><em>''Mr Tonti-Filippini said he was also concerned that in previous Family Court 
                      cases involving gender dysphoria, the medical experts had been confined to a 
                      small group of Melbourne doctors who work with sex changes.<br> </em></p>
              <p><em>Mr Tonti-Filippini said a Melbourne man who had had sex-change surgery at 22 
                      was now suing his doctors because he regretted the decision and felt they had 
                      not explored his doubts at the time.''</em></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My thoughts</span></strong></p>
              <p>This is a psychiatric disorder and shall not be treated by sexual physical change<em>.</em></p>
              <p>Also,the court is  too early to order</p>
              <p><em>''hormone medication from 
                      the age o<span style="color: #ff0000;">f 13 to </span>prevent menstruation and breast development''.</em></p>
              <p>Have they tried psychiatric and psychlogical treatment to</p>
              <p>the girl before the ordered medication?</p>
              <p>2.This is too early to remove breats at the age of 17.What The judge said</p>
              <p>is totally non--sense.</p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">''The decision was not irrevocable: "You can have prostheses and things. So if 
                      he changed his mind later on, it's reversible."''</span></em></strong></p>
              <p>If Alex ,after the breats removed,decisde go back to live as a girl<em> </em>few years later,</p>
              <p><em>w</em>ill any guy accept the ill fated Alex come with prostheses?</p>
              <p>3.Professional advices are sometimes not professional.</p>
              <p>The court just listened to small group of doctors doing sexual change.</p>
              <p>Sure,There is conflict of interest .Has the court listened to other doctors</p>
              <p>evidences?</p>
              <p>4.OMG!!</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Facts</em></span></strong></p>
              <p><em>''THE Family Court has allowed a 17-year-old girl to have
              her breasts removed so she can be more like a boy.</em></p>
              <p><em>The teenager, code-named "Alex", was on court-ordered
              hormone medication from the age o<span style="color: #ff0000;">f 13
              to</span> prevent menstruation and breast development. She returned
              to the court in December 2007 asking for a double mastectomy to
              make it easier for her to pass as a boy.</em></p>
              <p><em>The Chief Justice of the Family Court, Diana Bryant, decided
              it was in the teenager's best interests to have the surgery
              immediately rather than wait until turning 18.''</em></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">critisms</span></strong></p>
              <p><em>''But ethicist Nick Tonti-Filippini said mainstream medicine
              did not recognise hormone treatments and surgery as treatment for
              gender dysphoria. He said it was a psychiatric disorder qualifying
              under American guidelines as a psychosis because "it's a belief out
              of accordance with reality".</em></p>
              <p><em>"What you are trying to do is make a biological reality
              correspond to that false belief."''</em></p>
              <p><em>''Mr Tonti-Filippini said he was also concerned that in
              previous Family Court cases involving gender dysphoria, the medical
              experts had been confined to a small group of Melbourne doctors who
              work with sex changes.<br>  </em></p>
              <p><em>Mr Tonti-Filippini said a Melbourne man who had had
              sex-change surgery at 22 was now suing his doctors because he
              regretted the decision and felt they had not explored his doubts at
              the time.''</em></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My
              thoughts</span></strong></p>
              <p>This is a psychiatric disorder and shall not be treated by
              sexual physical change<em>.</em></p>
              <p>Also,the court is  too early to order</p>
              <p><em>''hormone medication from the age o<span style="color: #ff0000;">f 13 to</span> prevent menstruation and breast
              development''.</em></p>
              <p>Have they tried psychiatric and psychlogical treatment to</p>
              <p>the girl before the ordered medication?</p>
              <p>2.This is too early to remove breats at the age of 17.What The
              judge said</p>
              <p>is totally non--sense.</p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">''The decision was not
              irrevocable: "You can have prostheses and things. So if he changed
              his mind later on, it's reversible."''</span></em></strong></p>
              <p>If Alex ,after the breats removed,decisde go back to live as a
              girl few years later,</p>
              <p><em>w</em>ill any guy accept the ill fated Alex come with
              prostheses?</p>
              <p>3.Professional advices are sometimes not professional.</p>
              <p>The court just listened to small group of doctors doing sexual
              change.</p>
              <p>Sure,There is conflict of interest .Has the court listened to
              other doctors</p>
              <p>evidences?</p>
              <p>4.OMG!!</p>

              <p>Maybe not completely stop the growth but to make it smaller? If i remember correctly, its to prevent their daughter from being raped as the sex appeal will not be that strong for a smaller breast.</p>

              <p>Thats exactly what i heard too. Incest too! The tudong breaks their feminine shape hence reduced the desires.</p>

              <p>But nowadays those 3gp clips which can easily found online, has girls with tudongs offering themselves to their bfs! Lol...</p>
