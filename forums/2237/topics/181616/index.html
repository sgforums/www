She received enough water to last her family a few days, but with none to be found anywhere else, she will be back at the roadside soon.<br><br>After the worst drought in 20 years, 11 million people across East Africa face starvation and a daily battle to find water. Throughout a wide swathe of Somalia, Ethiopia, northern Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, the failure of rains for two years has turned watering holes and wells into dry hollows. Up to 80 per cent of cattle herds have been wiped out and even hardy goats and camels are dropping dead too.<br><br>There are reports of people dying of thirst and those who are still alive have been driven to desperate measures such as drinking their own urine. Aid agencies warn that without immediate help, widespread famine is just around the corner.<br><br>In Somalia, the problem is made even worse by the dire security situation. With no central government for 14 years, the country has degenerated into lawlessness, making it all but impossible for aid agencies to deliver the relief that at least 1.4 million people need.<br><br>The Geddo region is among the wildest. Roadblocks manned by young militiamen, who demand a "tax" to pass, are a daily and deadly hazard for locals and the few charities willing to risk working here. Charitable status means nothing - the only way to get past is to talk the language of money. Last week, a trader who refused to pay at a checkpoint was shot dead.<br><br>Many people face a stark choice between selling their last few animals or starving. Sahra Moalin Ahmed, a mother of four from Bakal village, said: "My cattle died months ago and I have three goats left. If I sell my goats I can buy food to last another 15 days. After that I will have nothing. I will only be able to pray to God to help me."<br><br>At Garbaharre hospital, all 50 patients, mainly children and the elderly, are suffering from malnutrition. "Those that are here are the ones who could walk. Most people are too weak to make such a journey," said the hospital manager, Dr Shaffi Ugas. "One patient is a 22-year-old man but he looks like a 12-year-old because he has not eaten in so long."<br><br>Christian Aid is working through Norwegian Church Aid (NCA), one of only two international agencies operating in the area. To protect aid workers, most operations are carried out by Somalis. But nothing can be done without the consent of warlords who can guarantee the safe passage of aid, usually for a fee. Or they can block it.<br><br>NCA is distributing food on behalf of the World Food Programme and providing clean water for 30,000 people. It is also building and repairing bore wells and helping farmers.<br><br>Christian Aid has given NCA Â£40,000 and is spending a further Â£200,000 across the region, but the money will soon run out. That is why this weekend it is launching an appeal for its emergency response in East Africa.<br><br>Arfi Abdi D'Ar, a cattle farmer from Bakal, spells it out. "If help doesn't come it will be very dangerous. If it doesn't come we expect to die."<br><br>Â• Dominic Nutt is an emergencies specialist with Christian Aid.
