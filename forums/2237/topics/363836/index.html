              <p>By Parisa Hafezi and Zahra Hosseinian</p>
              <p>TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iranians streamed to polling stations Friday in a hotly 
              contested election and allies of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his 
              main moderate challenger issued rival victory claims.</p>
              <p>Sadegh Kharazi, a senior backer of former Prime Minister Mirhossein Mousavi, 
              said surveys made by reformers showed that Mousavi was getting about 58-60 
              percent of the votes.</p>
              <p>But Ahmadinejad's representative at a supervisory body, Ali Asghar Zarei, 
              said the incumbent was ahead with about the same level of support, the 
              semi-official Mehr News Agency reported.</p>
              <p>A victory for Mousavi might help ease tensions with the West, which is 
              concerned about Tehran's nuclear ambitions, and improve chances of engagement 
              with U.S. President Barack Obama who has talked about a new start in ties with 
              Tehran.</p>
              <p>In Washington, Obama said his administration was excited about the debate 
              taking place in Iran and he hoped it would help the two countries to engage "in 
              new ways."</p>
              <p>Due to heavy turnout, voting was extended by three hours to 9 p.m. (5:30 p.m. 
              British time) to allow more people to cast ballots, the Interior Ministry 
              said.</p>
              <p>Long queues had formed at voting centres and officials said they expected a 
              turnout of about 70 percent or more, approaching the record of nearly 80 percent 
              when reformist Mohammad Khatami swept the 1997 presidential election.</p>
              <p>Some people said they had waited for more than two hours to cast ballots, 
              both in northern, affluent areas of Tehran where Mousavi draws support and in 
              southern, poorer neighbourhoods seen as Ahmadinejad strongholds.</p>
              <p>High turnout could indicate voting by many pro-reformers who stayed away when 
              Ahmadinejad won four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 
              Islamic revolution. Political analysts have said they expect a close race.</p>
              <p>The vote has generated interest around the world with policymakers looking 
              for signs of a change of approach by Tehran, whose ties with the West worsened 
              under Ahmadinejad.</p>
              <p>For Iranians it is a chance to pass judgement on his management of the 
              Islamic Republic's oil exporting economy.</p>
              <p>Although Ahmadinejad, 52, says his government has revived economic growth and 
              curbed price rises, inflation and high unemployment were the main campaign 
              issues. Official inflation is around 15 percent.</p>
              <p>"MIRACLE"</p>
              <p>Social issues, such as strict dress codes for women, as well as Iran's ties 
              with the outside world, also featured in the campaign but the outcome of the 
              vote will not bring a major shift in Iran's foreign policy, which is determined 
              by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
              <p>The United States has had no ties with Iran since shortly after the 
              revolution but Obama has offered a new relationship if Tehran "unclenches its 
              fist"</p>
              <p>Mousavi, 67, rejects Western demands that Iran halt uranium enrichment but 
              analysts say he would bring a different approach to Iran-U.S. ties and talks on 
              Tehran's nuclear program, which the West fears is a cover to build bombs. Iran 
              denies this.</p>
              <p>"People's strong, revolutionary and clear decision will bring about a bright 
              future for the nation," Ahmadinejad, a self-styled champion of the poor with 
              strong support in rural areas, said while voting in a working class part of 
              Tehran.</p>
              <p>The three-week election campaign was marked by mudslinging, with Ahmadinejad 
              accusing his rivals of corruption. They said he was lying about the state of the 
              economy.</p>
              <p>Ahmadinejad's election rivals, who also include liberal cleric Mehdi Karoubi 
              and former Revolutionary Guard leader Mohsen Rezaie, have urged the Interior 
              Ministry and Khamenei to ensure there is no vote rigging.</p>
              <p>A Karoubi adviser told Reuters Ahmadinejad's three opponents had been in 
              contact over concern about a lack of ballot papers, the closure of seven 
              reformist websites and the shutting down of text messages, which they had used 
              in their campaigns.</p>
              <p>"(They) have worries about these issues, and Karoubi is contacting relevant 
              organizations," Mohammad Ali Abtahi said.</p>
              <p>Ahmadinejad has ruled out any possibility of fraud.</p>
              <p>Preliminary results are expected early Saturday. If none of the candidates 
              win 50 percent of the votes, a run-off will be held on June 19 between the two 
              front-runners.</p>
              <p>Mousavi's wife Zahra Rahnavard broke new ground in the conservative Islamic 
              state by actively campaigning for her husband, a move hailed by women's rights 
              activists.</p>
              <p>"I thank all the people for their green presence which created a miracle," 
              Mousavi said, referring to the colours worn by his backers who thronged Tehran 
              streets during the campaign, as he voted in Tehran with his wife at his 
              side.</p>
              <p>Businessman Ahmad Vakili, 45, said he voted for the first time to deny 
              Ahmadinejad a second term:</p>
              <p>"It is essential for Iran to have a moderate president not a hardliner. The 
              economy is failing, foreign diplomacy is not working," he said.</p>
              <p>Student Mohammad Ravanbakhsh voted for the incumbent: "Only some rich people 
              vote for moderates. Ahmadinejad understands poor people. He understands ordinary 
              Iranians. He is one of us."</p>
