              <p>remember that incident and there was a talk about how "brain dead" is dead for patients? well, this "brain dead" patient recovered..</p>
              <p>http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/zachs-back-from-the-dead/2008/03/25/1206207051448.html</p>
              <p>Four months after he was declared brain dead and doctors were
              about to remove his organs for transplant, Zach Dunlap says he
              feels "pretty good".</p>
              <p>Mr Dunlap was pronounced dead on November 19 last year at United
              Regional Healthcare System in Wichita Falls, Texas, in the United
              States, after he was injured in an all-terrain vehicle accident.
              His family agreed to having his organs harvested.</p>
              <p>As family members were paying their last respects, he moved his
              foot and hand. He reacted to a pocketknife scraped across his foot
              and to pressure applied under a fingernail.</p>
              <p>After 48 days in hospital, he was allowed to return home, where
              he continues to work on his recovery.</p>
              <p>On Monday, he and his family were in New York, appearing on
              NBC's <em>Today Show</em>.</p>
              <p>"I feel pretty good. but it's just hard ... just ain't got the
              patience," he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Dunlap, 21, of Frederick, said he had no recollection of the
              crash.</p>
              <p>"I remember a little bit that was about an hour before the
              accident happened. But then about six hours before that, I
              remember," he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Dunlap said one thing he did remember was hearing the
              doctors pronounce him dead.</p>
              <p>"I'm glad I couldn't get up and do what I wanted to do," he
              said.</p>
              <p>Asked if he would have wanted to get up and shake them and say
              he was alive, he responded: "Probably would have been a broken
              window that went out."</p>
              <p>His father, Doug, said he saw the results of the brain scan.</p>
              <p>"There was no activity at all, no blood flow at all," he
              said.</p>
              <p>His mother, Pam, said that when she discovered he was still
              alive, "That was the most miraculous feeling.</p>
              <p>"We had gone, like I said, from the lowest possible emotion that
              a parent could feel to the top of the mountains again," she
              said.</p>
              <p>She said her son was doing "amazingly well", but still had
              problems with his memory as his brain heals from the traumatic
              injury.</p>
              <p>"It may take a year or more ... before he completely recovers,"
              she said. "But that's OK. It doesn't matter how long it takes.
              We're just all so thankful and blessed that we have him here."</p>
              <p>Mr Dunlap now has the pocketknife that was scraped across his
              foot, causing the first reaction.</p>
              <p>"Just makes me thankful, makes me thankful that they didn't give
              up," he said. "Only the good die young, so I didn't go."</p>
