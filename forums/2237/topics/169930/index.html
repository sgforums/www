Hitler, he wrote, was not against the<br>Jews, and had even permitted Jews to emigrate to Palestine during his first<br>years in power. (1)<br><br>The following are excerpts:<br><br>"The Execution Chambers Were No More Than Rooms for Disinfecting Clothing"<br><br>"The world is truly discriminative and oppressing. Israel spreads whatever<br>lies it wants, and the so-called 'cultural' world congratulates it and views<br>these lies as absolute indisputable facts. Israel refers to Palestine as a<br>land without a people, which was inhabited by a people without a land, who<br>established its country there. Sometimes it refers to Palestine as the land<br>of the Jewish people who returned to it after long years of exile and<br>diaspora.<br><br>"Even the 1948 war, which led to the declaration of the establishment of<br>[the State of] Israel [is called], in the language of falsification and<br>terror, the 'War of Independence,' in which the Jewish people participated.<br><br>"Sometimes Israel reminds the 1948 Arabs [i.e., the Israeli Arabs] that it<br>did them a favor by letting them continue [to live] within its borders,<br>which have not yet been settled. Israel claims that the land of Israel<br>belongs historically to the Jewish people alone!<br><br>"We've had enough of the lies and the falsification of the facts with which<br>the [Israeli] textbooks are replete. The most serious lie is the Jews'<br>Holocaust, which they have exploited in order to extort global solidarity.<br><br>"When Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad refutes this lie, the entire<br>world is up in arms, and the Iranian president is inundated with accusations<br>of madness, fanaticism, and falsification. [Ahmadinejad] was inundated with<br>these accusations even though he did nothing more than state the truth,<br>which a number of honest researchers have [also] reached.<br><br>"What this truth means is that these massacres, which Israel alleges that<br>the Nazis perpetrated against the Jews, never happened. The famous execution<br>chambers [i.e., the gas chambers] were no more than rooms for disinfecting<br>clothing."<br><br>"It has Also Been Proven That Hitler was Not Against the Jews, as<br>Disseminated by the Zionist Historians"<br><br>"According to what we know, [the most recent of these researchers] is the<br>courageous British historian David Irving, who paid a heavy price for his<br>courage. Some other historians have proven that some of the massacres<br>alleged to have been perpetrated against the Jews in World War II were<br>carried out in coordination with the Jewish leadership, in an effort to push<br>[the Jews] to emigrate to Palestine.<br><br>"It has also been proven that Hitler was not against the Jews, as<br>disseminated by the Zionist historians, but that on the contrary, he<br>permitted 120,000 Jews to emigrate to occupied Palestine in his first years<br>in power, in order to appease the Jews.<br><br>"The onslaught against the Iranian president has intensified merely because<br>he posed a logical and proper question to the Western countries, which<br>planted Israel in the heart of the Islamic world, and which protected and<br>continue to protect it. If you feel sorry for the poor Jews, why don't you<br>establish their country on your lands?!"<br><br>Endnote:<br>(1) Al-Masaa (Egypt), December 12, 2005.

Of course, their agenda was very different from current Holocaust deniers, for they wanted to be absolved of whatever charges which may be levelled against them.<br><br>Here's something you might want to read:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial</a><br><br>Read the section on 'History of Holocaust denial'.</div>
