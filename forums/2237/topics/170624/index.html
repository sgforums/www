It is also possible that there will be a landslide from the volcano into the waters of Cook Inlet, causing a tsunami, they said.<br><br>Such an event occurred in 1883, when a wave believed to be 20 feet high hit the Native Alutiiq village of Nanwalek, 50 miles east of Augustine.<br><br>"Any time you have a volcano on the water that's erupting, common sense says you could have a flank collapse and a wave," said Paul Whitmore, director of the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center.<br><br>Anchorage is too far away to be at risk from an Augustine-related tsunami, Whitmore added.<br><br>But preparations for the possibility are well under way in Nanwalek, said Sergie Active, rector of the local Russian Orthodox church in the village of 200 people.<br><br>"We would have to go to higher ground, basically. The first thing is to have things packed away, just in case," Active said in a telephone interview from the local tribal council office.<br><br>"We have asked all the households to have sleeping bags, clothes, food, first-aid kits -- all the things that would be needed."<br><br>Augustine is one of Alaska's most active volcanoes, with five eruptive periods since the late 1800s, scientists said. Those events have generally started with major ash explosions that last a few days, followed by months of less powerful eruptions that produce oozing lava at the summit, they said.<br></div>

It was built by a series of 22 eruptions between 1980 and 1986.<br><br>Even as the volcano pours about a dump truck load of red-hot lava onto its growing new dome every six seconds, scientists still don't know what's causing the eruption, Sherrod said.<br><br>If the lava was originating as molten rock inside the volcano, scientists would expect to see changes in the shape of Mount St. Helens, with the sides compressing in like a squeezed toothpaste tube. But that hasn't been happening.<br><br>If the molten rock was climbing up into the volcano from deep underground or near the earth's crust, scientists would expect to measure very deep seismic activity. But they can't detect that either.<br><br>By monitoring and measuring the dome, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of why Mount St. Helens is erupting and what will happen next, but their studies will be going slow until the weather improves.<br><br>"In the dead of winter we lose some of our ability to monitor the volcano the way we might like --- with visual observations and field work," Sherrod said. "It all depends on the weather, and we're anxious to get another look."<br><br>Scientists believe that lava dome eruptions allow volcanoes to rebuild their peaks, and that could eventually happen at Mount St. Helens if the current eruption continues.<br><br>As the solid chunky rocks of lava pour out of an opening inside the volcano, the dome has grown tall spines and then collapsed into a ashy gray mound a number of times since the current eruption began in October 2004. As it grows, collapses and grows, the dome is gradually getting taller.<br><br>At its current growth rate, the new lava dome could be tall enough to see over the rim of the crater by spring or summer, Sherrod said.</div>
