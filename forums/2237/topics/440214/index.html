              <p>Luzhou Evening News <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2011-10-22/005823343862.shtml">brings us a report</a> from October 20 that in Luding
                                      County, Sichuan Province, Luzhou City, a truck knocked down a
                                      five-year-old child returning home from school, causing the child
                                      to die on the spot. Luzhou citizens have claimed the accident was
                                      actually cold-blooded murder.</p>
              <p>The victim, five year old Xiong Maoke, was still in
                                      kindergarten. His mother recounted the horror of what happened,
                                      eyes red with tears. After school, 11 am, Xiong Maoke and several
                                      children left to go home whereupon they were involved in what
                                      appeared to be a simple accident.</p>
              <p>Zhang Shifen witnessed the accident. "I saw the truck coming,
                                      the children were walking by the side of the road, not in the
                                      street." Zhang Shifen recalls the truck didn't hit Xiong Maoke
                                      directly, but rather cuffed his ear. "He fell, but after being
                                      knocked over, immediately stood up again and bent over to pick up
                                      his umbrella. "</p>
              <p>The next scene left Zhang speechless, "I saw the truck move back
                                      a little and then move forward again, Xiong Maoke became wrapped up
                                      in the wheel, and then the truck continued forward another 10
                                      meters." Zhang Shifen said she was standing behind the truck, and
                                      clearly saw a child under the wheels had been badly mutilated. She
                                      shouted at the driver, "What are you doing? Will you stop!" The
                                      driver stopped, got out, swore, and turned away.</p>
              <p>He then asked, "How much should I pay?"</p>
              <p>The driver, Ao Yong, 35, denies he stopped the truck the first
                                      time Xiong Maoke was hit. He refuses to talk about his behavior
                                      after the accident, but maintains, "I will compensate them (the
                                      family members) however much they want."</p>
              <p>Police are investigating the incident and are working with the
                                      driver and villagers to ascertain what transpired and whether or
                                      not it was an accident or something more sinister.</p>
              <p>For witnesses and friends of Xiong Maoke's family, this
                                      "accident" was a deliberate child murder as brutal and heartless as
                                      the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://shanghaiist.com/tags/yueyue">death of Yueyue</a> that gripped the nation and the
                                      world earlier this week.</p>
              <p>In the Yueyue case, the driver who ran her over was <a rel="nofollow" href="http://shanghaiist.com/2011/10/17/foshan_toddler_yueyue_still_under_i.php">infamously quoted</a> as saying "If she is dead, I
                                      may pay only about 20,000 yuan ($3,125). But if she is injured, it
                                      may cost me hundreds of thousands yuan."</p>

              <p><span>Hi
               there, Speaking of death prediction, I find it really odd that one of 
              the on-line death prediction services showed me the same death date that
               I was foretold in my dream about a year ago. <a href="http://yourdeathdate.info/1/index.html">http://yourdeathdate.info/1/index.html</a> - I can’t explain this coincidence in any other way except that there must be some kind of magic involved here.</span></p>
