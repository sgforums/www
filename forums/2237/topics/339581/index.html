              <h1>Children are born believers in God, academic claims</h1>
              <h2>Children
              are "born believers" in God and do not simply acquire religious beliefs
              through indoctrination, according to an academic.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By Martin Beckford, Religious Affairs Correspondent <br> Last Updated: 11:36PM GMT 24 Nov 2008</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dr Justin Barrett, a senior researcher at the University of Oxford's Centre 
                for Anthropology and Mind, claims that young people have a predisposition to 
                believe in a supreme being because they assume that everything in the world 
                was created with a purpose.</p>
              <p>He says that young children have faith even when they have not been taught 
                about it by family or at school, and argues that even those raised alone on 
                a desert island would come to believe in God.</p>
              <p>"The preponderance of scientific evidence for the past 10 years or so has 
                shown that a lot more seems to be built into the natural development of 
                children's minds than we once thought, including a predisposition to see the 
                natural world as designed and purposeful and that some kind of intelligent 
                being is behind that purpose," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p>
              <p>"If we threw a handful on an island and they raised themselves I think 
                they would believe in God."</p>
              <p>In a lecture to be given at the University of Cambridge's Faraday Institute on 
                Tuesday, Dr Barrett will cite psychological experiments carried out on 
                children that he says show they instinctively believe that almost everything 
                has been designed with a specific purpose.</p>
              <p>In one study, six and seven-year-olds who were asked why the first bird 
                existed replied "to make nice music" and "because it makes 
                the world look nice".</p>
              <p>Another experiment on 12-month-old babies suggested that they were surprised 
                by a film in which a rolling ball apparently created a neat stack of blocks 
                from a disordered heap.</p>
              <p>Dr Barrett said there is evidence that even by the age of four, children 
                understand that although some objects are made by humans, the natural world 
                is different.</p>
              <p>He added that this means children are more likely to believe in creationism 
                rather than evolution, despite what they may be told by parents or teachers.</p>
              <p>Dr Barrett claimed anthropologists have found that in some cultures children 
                believe in God even when religious teachings are withheld from them.</p>
              <p>"Children's normally and naturally developing minds make them prone to 
                believe in divine creation and intelligent design. In contrast, evolution is 
                unnatural for human minds; relatively difficult to believe."</p>
