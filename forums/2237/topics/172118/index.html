It's a very small country within our range. Our (defense) preparedness is a deterrence," he said.<br><br>He also said a Russian proposal that the two nations enrich uranium in Russian territory could not ignore Iran's right to carry out enrichment at home.<br><br>"It's not logical for a country to put the fate of its nation at the disposal of another country even if it's a friend. You can meet part of your fuel needs from abroad. But is there a guarantee that nuclear fuel producers won't play with you over price or other things? History and experience show that if you don't have technology, you will damage your independence," he said.<br><br>Larijani's remarks coincided with Tehran's announcement that it had produced equipment for separating uranium from its ore, a fresh development in Tehran's drive to control the whole nuclear fuel cycle - from mining uranium to enriching it for use in atomic reactors.<br><br>European media have indicated in recent days that the U.S. was preparing its allies for a strike against Iran's nuclear and military facilities with the aim of curtailing Iran's nuclear program.<br><br>Reports of a strike escalated after comments by Iran's ultraconservative President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who called Israel a "disgraceful blot" that should be "wiped off the map" and his call to relocated Israel to Europe or North America.<br><br>Recent visits to Turkey by CIA Director Porter Goss, the head of the FBI, NATO General Secretary Jaap De Hoop Scheffer and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have increased speculations about a possible military strike against Iran. NATO member Turkey is Iran's northwestern neighbor.<br><br>The U.S. President George W. Bush has said his administration would not exclude the possibility of using military force against Iran over its nuclear program, which the United States believes is aimed at producing weapons.<br><br>Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Seymour Hersh reported in The New Yorker magazine in Janurary last year that the Bush administration had been "conducting secret reconnaissance missions inside Iran" to gather intelligence and targeting information. Defense Department officials said the article was filled with mistakes but did not deny its basic point.<br><br>Israel fears that Iran is reaching a point of no return in nuclear technology.<br><br>Iran has openly said it has already achieved proficiency in cycle of nuclear fuel, a technology that can be used to produce fuel for reactors to generate electricity or materials for a bomb.<br><br>The U.S. and Europeans have backed a Russian proposal to move Iran's uranium enrichment program to Russian territory. The proposal aims to ensure Iran cannot use uranium enrichment to build nuclear weapons. Enrichment is a key process that can produce either fuel for a nuclear reactor or the material for a warhead.<br><br>Larijani said Iran needed talks with Moscow to clarify what he described as "ambiguities" but said the proposal can't deny Iran of uranium enrichment at home.<br><br>"The proposal is too general. If it talks about denying Iran of its rights, no. We have no right to do it," he said.<br><br>"But we have to study it and see if Iran's interests can be met. It can be a complimentary. There is no reason to reject it before discussions and accurate study," he said.<br><br>Larijani is secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's top security decision-making body that handles Iran's nuclear talks with the international community.<br><br>He said the Russian proposal will have nothing to do with ongoing nuclear talks between Iran and Britain, France and Germany. The talks last month made little progress, and are to continue later this month.<br><br>Ahmadinejad: Europe created Israel to complete Holocaust<br>Ahmadinejad, who once said that the attempt to eradicate Jews in the Holocaust was "myth," has now charged that European countries sought to complete the genocide by establishing Israel, a Jewish state in the midst of Muslim countries.<br><br>The latest in a series of anti-Semitic comments by the Iranian leader in the past few months comes on the heels of Iran's announcement it has developed equipment to separate uranium from its ore - a piece of equipment other countries were reluctant to sell to Iran because the machinery can be used in the process of making nuclear weapons.<br><br>"Don't you think that continuation of genocide by expelling Jews from Europe was one of [the Europeans'] aims in creating a regime of occupiers of [Jerusalem]?" the official Islamic Republic News agency quoted Ahmadinejad as saying.<br><br>"Isn't that an important question?"<br><br>Ahmadinejad said Europeans had decided to create a "Jewish camp" as the best means for ridding the continent of Jews and said the camp, Israel, now enjoyed support from the United States and Europe in what he termed the slaughter of Muslims.<br><br>Last month, Ahmadinejad said the Holocaust, in which Nazi Germany killed six million Jews, was a myth. After global outrage over the comments, he said that Europeans, if they persisted in reality of the slaughter, should cede some of their territory for a Jewish state.<br><br>In October, Ahmadinejad called for Israel to be "wiped off the map."<br><br>The fiery Iranian president said anti-Semitic sentiment was a strong and long-term European tradition while Jews had lived peacefully among Muslim for centuries.<br><br>Iran develops uranium separation machinery<br>Iran said it has produced equipment for separating uranium from its ore, a fresh development in Tehran's drive to control the nuclear-fuel cycled from mining uranium to enriching it for use in atomic reactors, state television reported Sunday.<br><br>The broadcast claimed the "settler-mixer" was a device capable of separating uranium from its ore, and said it was "greatly effective for producing uranium," quoting Amir Hossein Farhadi, a researcher for Iran's Atomic Energy Organization.<br><br>"Foreign countries were not ready to sell [the equipment] to Iran since it could be applicable in the [nuclear-fuel producing] cycle," Farhadi was quoted as saying.<br><br>The nuclear program is a source of national pride in Iran, which seeks self-sufficiency, despite international pressure for it do give up its nuclear ambitions, which Washington claims are designed to produce atomic weapons. Iran claims the program is solely for generating electricity.<br><br>The United States has pushed for Iran to be taken before the United Nations Security Council, where it could face economic sanctions over the dispute.</div>

They miss the good days of the Likud, the real activists who work wholeheartedly because of their faith and views and not for money or bonuses," he said.<br><br>'Likud will win elections'<br><br>"You, the active members, are the proof that Likud exists, Likud is growing, Likud will grow and Likud will win the elections," Katz added.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Likud Central Committee is expected to convene Sunday in order to discuss a change to the party's constitution.<br><br>The issue at the top of the agenda will be an initiative proposed by Likud Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu that would see individuals with criminal records barred from the Likud's Knesset list.<br><br>The members are expected to approve the change to the party's charter, thus enabling Netanyahu to score his first internal victory.</div>

The United States is preparing for a strike on IranÂ’s nuclear facilities and has informed NATO member states to make similar preparations, the German daily Der Spiegel reported Saturday.<br><br>Intelligence officials familiar with the Iran file, told Der Spiegel that NATO members are considering a number of options to prevent<br>Iran from acquiring nuclear technology that would allow it manufacture nuclear bombs, adding that military action was in the cards.<br><br>The newspaper said during his latest visit to Turkey, CIA head Porter GossÂ’s asked Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan that Turkey allows the United States uses military bases in the country for an air strike on Iran planned for 2006.<br><br>Â“WhatÂ’s new about these reports is that the United States seems to be sending top envoys to ally countries in preparation for an attack. It is no longer a matter of hints we heard over 2005,Â” the report said.<br><br>According to the German News Agency DDP, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Oman and Pakistan are also being updated with the plan, with American officials saying a military operation is Â“a possible optionÂ”, yet giving no time limit.<br><br>The newspaper said it is difficult to estimate whether the United States is in fact embracing for a military strike on Iran but quoted a New York Times report earlier this year that U.S. commando units have already infiltrated Iran to mark nuclear facilities for a possible strike.</div>
