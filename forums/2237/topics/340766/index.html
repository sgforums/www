              <h3>Outgoing VP says Guantanamo prison should stay open until end of terror war, but has no idea when that might be.</h3>
              <p>Monday, outgoing Vice President Dick Cheney made a startling statement on a nation-wide, televised broadcast.<br><br>When asked by ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl whether he approved of interrogation tactics used against a so-called "high value prisoner" at the controversial Guantanamo Bay prison, Mr. Cheney, in a break from his history of being press-shy, admitted to giving <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Story?id=6464697&amp;page=1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">official sanctioning of torture</span></a>. <br><br>"I supported it," he said regarding the practice known as "water-boarding," a form of simulated drowning. After World War II, Japanese soldiers were <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/02/AR2007110201170.html"><span style="color: #0066cc;">tried and convicted</span></a> of war crimes in US courts for water-boarding, a practice which the outgoing Bush administration attempted to enshrine in policy.<br><br>"I was aware of the program, certainly, and involved in helping get the process cleared, as the agency in effect came in and wanted to know what they could and couldn't do," Cheney said. "And they talked to me, as well as others, to explain what they wanted to do. And I supported it."<br><br>He added: "It's been a remarkably successful effort, and I think the results speak for themselves."<br><br>ABC asked him if in hindsight he thought the tactics went too far. "I don't," he said.<br><br>The prisoner in question, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who the Bush administration alleges to have planned the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, is one of Guantanamo's "high value targets" thus far <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/10024-khalid-shaikh-mohammed"><span style="color: #0066cc;">charged with war crimes</span></a>.<br><br>Former military interrogator Travis Hall disagrees with Cheney's position.<br><br>"Proponents of Guantanamo underestimate what a powerful a propaganda tool Guantanamo has become for terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, despite several Department of Defense studies documenting the propaganda value of detention centers," he said in a column for <em><a href="http://foxforum.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/12/14/opposingviews_guantanamo/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Opposing Views</span></a>. <br><br>"For example, West Point’s Combating Terrorism Center has monitored numerous Al Qaeda references to Guantanamo in its recruitment propaganda materials," continued Hall. "Improvements to Guantanamo’s administration of judicial mechanisms will not make its way into Al Qaeda propaganda. Nothing short of closing Guantanamo will remove this arrow from its quiver."<br><br>President-elect Barack Obama has <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Obama_promises_U.S._will_exit_Iraq_1116.html"><span style="color: #0066cc;">promised to close the prison</span></a> and pull US forces out of Iraq. Cheney, however, has a different timeline for when Guantanamo Bay prison may be "responsibly" retired. <br><br>"Well, I think that that would come with the end of the war on terror," he told ABC.<br><br>Problematic to his assertion: Mr. Bush's "war on terror" is undefinable and unending by it's very nature, and Cheney seems to recognize this as fact. <br><br>Asked when his administration's terror war will end, he jostled, "Well, nobody knows. Nobody can specify that."<br></em></p>

              <p>Well.. its called torture right ? to break his spirit n just give in. It will be so easy.. if he wouldve just told them what they wanted to know n it will be all over. The pain will go away. All he gotta do is just tell them the truth, thats all they ask from him. I am sure they were reasonable , its when the person being interrogated decided not to co-operate, n decides to do things the hard way.</p>
              <p>Anyways la, this kind of philosophical debate is tough depends on where u stand in this entire notion of torture being a just method n where does it begin n where does it end. Torture the dude to save 500 of ur men , or 1500 of ur men dead with lack of information.</p>

              <p>Look, whats your point? I posted this article to point out how politicians can commit war crimes and get away. I wasnt even trying to justify the actions of "terrorists". If anyone wants to condemn Arab terrorists, then they should look at how barbaric the US can be and vice versa. The point is not to be one-sided.</p>

              <p>lol.. electrocuting someone by the balls. Anyways , put it this way. If i was apprehended by you, i would say.. lucky me. But if u were apprehended by me.. too bad for you.</p>
              <p>We both have different objectives. Its just how we go about achieving it is the issue. What we are willing to do to get things done. Thats why u are not suited for the job.</p>

              <p>So you guys support the Japanese torturing the chinese last time? Heard they even try plucking out the hair one by one until you die, the other tactic is to immerse your hand into dry ice and then dip in warm water and remove your skin directly after that. also about the needles poke into your eye slowly so you can feel the pain. If you all go through it, maybe you will understand better the whole notion.</p>
              <p>Secondly, an eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind. Self destruction is common in humans. Is this intelligence?</p>
