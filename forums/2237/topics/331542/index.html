              <div id="adSpotIsland">"THE TEN Commandments, one of the most negative documents ever
              written." With that provocative claim posted high over two city
              streets, controversial cleric Francis Macnab yesterday launched "a new
              faith for the 21st century", a faith beyond orthodox Christianity.</div>
              <p><strong>- Jesus 'just a Jewish peasant'<br> - Cleric launches new faith<br> - Ten Commandments 'too negative'</strong></p>
              <p>Dr Macnab says Abraham is probably a concoction, Moses was a mass
              murderer and Jesus Christ just a Jewish peasant who certainly was not
              God. In fact, there is no God, in the usual sense of an interventionist
              deity - what we strive for is a presence both within and beyond us.</p>
              <p>Dr Macnab, a noted psychotherapist and executive minister at <a href="http://www.stmichaels.org.au/">St Michael's Uniting Church</a> in the city, said the new faith was necessary because the old faith no longer worked.</p>
              <p>"The old faith is in large sections unbelievable. We want to make
              the new faith more believable, realistic and helpful in terms of the
              way people live," he said.</p>
              <p>St Michael's is promoting the new faith with a $120,000 campaign
              over several months, involving newspaper and radio advertising, the
              internet, banners and billboards. Dr Macnab is being advised by Barry
              Whalen, who was the media guru for Cardinal George Pell when he was
              Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne.</p>
              <p>According to Dr Macnab, the new faith transcends denominations and
              religions. It is about searching, not dogma. It seeks the good, the
              tender and the beautiful, and finds it in Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism,
              Christianity and Judaism.</p>
              <p>"At the Jesus Seminar (a scholarly but sceptical international
              enterprise examining the statements attributed to Jesus, of which Dr
              Macnab is a member), we are inclined to think there was a real Jesus
              but we don't know much about him. The record has been embellished a
              great deal along the way. He gives glimpses of something beyond him,
              and that's the most powerful aspect of what he was doing."</p>
              <p>Dr Macnab said the Ten Commandments were full of what people could
              not do, and were given by a patriarchal figure, Moses, who was a mass
              murderer. The Bible records that Moses killed 3000 Israelites who
              worshipped the Golden Calf.</p>
              <p>"Allegedly he went up the mountain and came down and said "you shall
              not kill', so how come he was such a genocidal man?" Dr Macnab said.</p>
              <p>Until 1900, people believed in heaven above, earth, and hell below.
              "We have given up that idea. He's no longer the God up there, an
              interventionist God. We can all feel a presence beyond ourselves and
              are trying to get in touch with the presence better than ourselves.
              It's trying to bring a more humanitarian understanding."</p>
              <p>Dr Macnab has been at St Michael's, where he is minister for life,
              since 1971. He did not seek wider approval for the campaign, and said
              some in the Uniting Church would resent it, but some would agree.</p>
