The researchers then added carbon dioxide gas to the mix to see if conditions that were probably present on early Earth would produce a similar haze.<br><br>"It turns out that organic haze can form over a wide range of methane and carbon dioxide concentrations," said Prof Tolbert. "This means that hazy conditions could have been present for many millions or even a billion years on Earth while life was evolving."<br><br>The researcher calculate that Earth could have produced more than100 million tons of aerosols each year, and thus these organic chemicals in the haze could have served as the primary ingredients for primitive life.<br><br>According to co-author Melissa Trainer "As these particles settled out of the skies, they would have provided a global source of food for living organisms. We found that you can make a lot of organic material virtually out of thin air."<br><br>In addition to serving as a source of organic material, a haze layer over Earth could have shielded living organisms from harmful UV rays and helped to regulate EarthÂ’s early climate, according to the study.<br><br>The haze may have contributed to the geological record on Earth by depositing organic carbon into some of the planetÂ’s most ancient rocks, said Alexander Pavlov, a co-author of the report at the University of Arizona.<br><br>"Our paper is the first but necessary step which suggests that the total mass of organics derived photochemically could have been comparable to the total mass of organics in ancient sediments," he said.</div>
