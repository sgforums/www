We will doubtless find more when we look at more complicated, less obvious forms," Nusbaum said.<br><br>He added in an interview the phenomenon probably existed across all languages, although it may be shaped in the same way that different languages help determine physical gestures.<br><br>It would be difficult to determine if such verbal gestures played a role in evolution, he said, although one speculative piece of research has concluded gestures preceded language.<br><br>In one experiment, people looked at video screens with animated dots and described whether they saw them going up or going down. Separately, they read the sentences "It is going up" or "It is going down" without any visuals.<br><br>In watching the dots go up, their pitch rose as they followed the action, and lowered when the dots went down. The same thing also happened when they read the sentences.<br><br>"The results demonstrate that speakers naturally use analog acoustic expression when talking, even when there is no intent to dramatize a description," the study said.<br><br>In another pair of experiments, people describing the movement of a dot from left to right spoke faster as it moved faster. When recordings of what they said were played, listeners were able to determine which speaker was describing a fast-moving dot and which a slow-moving one.</div>
