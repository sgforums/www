              <p>Austin Hemmings' wife and children stood before a packed church and
              spoke of their love for a man who told them he loved them every day.</p>
              <p>It wasn't easy, but it was the right thing for them to do.</p>
              <p>The
              courage they showed speaking at Mr Hemmings' funeral yesterday was
              testament to their strength of character and faith - traits instilled
              in them by Mr Hemmings, who died a week ago doing what was right and
              helping a woman in need.</p>
              <p>The 44-year-old was fatally stabbed while assisting the woman, who was calling for help in Mills Lane, central Auckland.</p>
              <p>The theme running through the service yesterday was of strong family values, Christian faith and "doing the right thing".</p>
              <p>About
              1000 people attended the funeral at Holy Trinity Church in Devonport.
              The church was packed, and the overflow crowd spilled into a separate
              hall to watch the service on a video link.</p>
              <p>There were tears and
              laughter as friends and family remembered a loving and proud father and
              husband and as colleagues remembered an inspirational "leader, not a
              manager".</p>
              <div class="advert"></div>
              <p>His younger daughter Jessica, 17, spoke of his giving nature.</p>
              <p>"He
              gave love, hugs, friendship, money, and in the end he gave his life.
              Through him giving his life, he'll see that more life comes from it. I
              love you, Dad."</p>
              <p>Mr Hemmings' widow, Jenny, expressed thanks for "25 wonderful, wonderful years" with him.</p>
              <p>She also thanked New Zealanders for their heartfelt messages and sympathy.</p>
              <p>"People have been asking me what they can do for us," she said. "They said 'anything' ... so here it goes.</p>
              <p>"Austin
              prayed every morning for his family, for his friends and for the people
              of New Zealand. I could never have imagined that his wish of reaching
              the nation with a message of God's love would be fulfilled.</p>
              <p>"So
              for me, what you can do for me, because you've said 'anything', is to
              please write to me and tell me please how Austin's death has changed
              you."</p>
              <p>As the family walked from the altar, elder daughter
              Meghann, 19, whispered the phrase her father used frequently: "Missing
              you already, Dad."</p>
              <p>At the end of the service, 44 doves were released from behind 44 white roses - one for each year of Mr Hemmings' life.</p>
              <p>The
              police investigation into his killing continues. Officers were last
              night still seeking a taxi driver believed to have taken the main
              suspect to Mangere or the Mangere Bridge area after the stabbing.</p>
              <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Gerry Whitley said staff would today take
              their mobile police station to the place in Mills Lane where Mr
              Hemmings died, hoping to talk to more witnesses.</p>
              <p>A 45-year-old
              sickness beneficiary, whose name is suppressed, has been arrested on an
              assault charge in relation to the case. Police will lay more serious
              charges when he next appears in court.</p>
              <p>* Mrs Hemmings says anyone
              wishing to write to her can send the letter to her care of: Holy
              Trinity Church, 20 Church St, Devonport, North Shore City, 0624.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Often times , doing the right thing means sacrificing ones own life. True testament to thier faith and character that shows that humanity still has hope when it comes to doing the right thing.</p>
