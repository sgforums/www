              <p><strong>New owner Glenn Blissett in his bullet-riddled lounge room.</strong></p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A TUMBI Umbi house was riddled with<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 50 rounds of high-powered rifle fire</span> in a bizarre early morning attack.</p>
              <p>Two men are believed to have "shot up" the empty house at 1am on Wednesday using semi-automatic rifles.</p>
              <p>They apparently stood at the bottom of the driveway of 17 Holland Place and took 40 seconds to fire 50 rounds into the home.</p>
              <p>Its new owners had made final settlement on the house only hours earlier on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>They were preparing to move into their four-bedroom dream home set on more than 9000sq m on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Glenn
              and Michell Blissett signed on the dotted line at 4.30pm and the former
              owners moved out at 5pm. What happened in the next few hours is the
              subject of a major police investigation.</p>
              <p>Mr and Mrs Blissett are trying to come to terms with the damage, which is not covered by insurance.</p>
              <p>Bullets
              struck with such force <span style="color: #ff0000;">they went through the garage doors, brick walls
              and the walls of three rooms in the house, including the kitchen,
              lounge room and a child's bedroom.</span></p>
              <p>Windows and light fittings were smashed.</p>
              <p>"Devastated is an understatement," Mr Blissett said.</p>
              <p>"Everyone
              has washed their hands of it including my insurance company NRMA who I
              have been with for more than 20 years without a claim."</p>
              <p>They were taking out building and content insurance first thing on Wednesday but the company said it was too late.</p>
              <p>"The
              neighbours have been fantastic and everyone has offered to help," he
              said. "This kind of thing doesn't happen here, even the police said
              that.</p>
              <p>"But we have to get on with it."</p>
