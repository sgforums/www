Image: Jim Loring/Tearfund Climate change threatens supplies of water for millions of people in poorer countries, warns a new report from the Christian development agency Tearfund.<br><br>Recent research suggests that by 2050, five times as much land is likely to be under "extreme" drought as now.<br><br>Tearfund wants richer states to look at helping poorer ones adjust to drought at next month's UN climate summit.<br><br>This week the UK's climate minister said he was confident of reaching an deal on adaptation funds at the talks.<br><br>There was an "urgent need" for such measures, Ian Pearson told a parliamentary committee.<br><br>"It's the extremes of water which are going to provide the biggest threat to the developing world from climate change"<br>Sir John Houghton<br><br>The Tearfund report, Feeling the Heat, urges donors to ramp up assistance quickly. Other charities are likely to make similar pleas in the run-up to the Nairobi summit, which begins on 6 November.<br><br>Citing research by the Oxford academic Norman Myers, Tearfund suggests there will be as many as 200 million climate refugees by 2050.<br><br>Areas where people are already on the move to avoid climate excesses include, the report says:<br><br>* Brazil, where one in five people born in the arid northeast region relocates to avoid drought<br>* China, where three provinces are seeing the spread of the Gobi desert<br>* Nigeria, where about 2,000 sq km is becoming desert each year<br><br>Attributing the movement of people to climate impacts is, however, a difficult issue, with many other factors including economic opportunity behind decisions to relocate.<br><br>Level of rhetoric<br><br>One of Britain's leading climate scientists, Sir John Houghton, said the severity of climate change was getting through to world leaders "at a level of rhetoric", but not yet at a level of action.<br><br>"There were promises made at the G8 summit and at the last UN meeting in Montreal about money for adaptation," he told the BBC News website, "but I understand that very little of that has come through."<br><br>Sir John, who contributed a foreword to the Tearfund report, said water shortages would be the biggest climate threat to developing countries.<br><br>"It's the extremes of water which are going to provide the biggest threat to the developing world from climate change," he said.<br><br>"Without being able to be too specific about exactly where, droughts will tend to be longer, and that's very bad news. Extreme droughts currently cover about 2% of the world's land area, and that is going to spread to about 10% by 2050."<br><br>Overall, he said, climate models show a drying out of sub-Saharan Africa, while some other areas of the world will see more severe flooding.<br><br>Sir John is a former head of the UK Meteorological Office, former chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, and co-chaired one of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) working groups.<br><br>He is now chairman of the John Ray Initiative, whose mission is to "connect environment, science and Christianity".<br><br>The positive side of the Tearfund report is that simple measures to "climate-proof" water problems, both drought and flood, have proven to be very effective in some areas.<br><br>In Niger, the charity says that building low, stone dykes across contours has helped prevent runoff and get more water into the soil; while in Bihar, northern India, embankments have been built to connect villages during floods, with culverts allowing drainage.</div>
