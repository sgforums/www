After hearing the latest information, al-Zahar, who graduated from medical school in Cairo and is trained in general surgery, said, "As a doctor I can tell you if Sharon suffered a stroke, no matter how severe, there at least will be some sort of temporary paralysis or symptoms that will impair his ability to rule."<br><br>Al-Zahar said if Sharon dies "it will be a good thing for all the crimes he committs against the Palestinian people and all of humanity."<br><br>In Gaza City, there were reports of celebratory gunfire after the news of Sharon's hospitalization was announced.<br><br>One terror leader told WND he is praying for Sharon's demise.<br><br>"Thanks to God for answering our prayers," said Abu Abir, spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees, an umbrella group of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists responsible for firing hundreds of Qassam rockets and mortars at Jewish towns.<br><br>"Our rockets were meant to hit Sharon, but instead they caused him enough stress that now he is having a stroke over them. ... I am handing out candy and praying for his death."<br><br>Initial media reports here put Sharon in critical condition, but about an hour after he was admitted, a hospital spokesman said Sharon is alert and in stable condition.<br><br>Dr. Yuval Weiss, deputy manager of Hadassah Hospital, said, "Ariel Sharon was brought here about 8 p.m. He has full consciousness and he's undergoing medical examinations. His condition is stable."<br><br>Israel's state-run Channel 2 television earlier reported Sharon was in a confused state and was taken straight to the trauma room.<br><br>The Prime Minister's Office said that the decision to hospitalize Sharon was taken after he said he did not feel well while working in his office.<br><br>Sources close to Sharon told WND the prime minister passed out once in his office and again during the ambulance ride to the hospital.<br><br>The area around the hospital has been closed off to the general public, and Sharon's room is being tightly guarded.<br><br>After hearing the updated reports claiming Sharon is in stable condition, Abu Abir said he is "disappointed. I am waiting for better news."<br><br>*******<br><br><span style="color: blue;">What is this man.... </span></div>
