              <p><span>KUALA LUMPUR - A Malaysian city has banned Muslim women from
              wearing brightly coloured lipstick and noisy high-heeled shoes to work,
              the national news agency Bernama reported.
              <br> <br>City officials in Kota Bharu, the capital of conservative northern
              Kelantan state, which is run by Islamic party PAS, distributed a
              circular to local firms last month to outline the dress code, Bernama
              said late Monday.
              <br> <br>The report said the circular stated that the directive, which
              targeted Muslim women working in food outlets and other business
              premises, was aimed at preventing incidents like rape and illicit sex.
              <br> <br>It ordered women not to wear thick make-up including bright
              lipstick, or high-heeled shoes "that gave a tapping sound," although
              rubber-soled heels were permitted.
              <br> <br>The directive said that the headscarf worn by many Muslim women in
              Malaysia should also cover the chest and not be made of transparent
              material, and that those who flouted the rules faced a fine of 500
              ringgit (150 US dollars).
              <br> <br> Muslim Malays make up the majority of Kelantan's population, alongside large ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities.
              <br> <br>The state's rulers have in the past made headlines with laws that
              require separate queues for men and women in shops, and for imposing
              fines on skimpy clothing.
              <br> <br>However, in recent years the party has begun introducing reforms
              designed to tone down its hardline reputation and woo young voters.
              <br> <br>An official from the city's law enforcement department said there
              had been an "awareness campaign" encouraging Muslim women to conform
              with Islamic dress codes "with less make-up and more modesty, including
              wearing headscarves."
              <br> <br>She told AFP that she had not seen the circular reported both by
              Bernama and a television network, adding there were no laws forbidding
              women from wearing heavy make-up or noisy footwear.
              <br> <br> "It is a ridiculous piece of news," said the official, who declined to be identified.

              <p>First of all, i am Malay.</p>
              <p>Like most sane, rational person, i was shocked and a bit amused at the decision by PAS to pass this kind of law. It borders on barbaric and childish.</p>
              <p>However,  is this news real or made up? If it's true, then we have to question the thinking of the politicians. Bear in mind that it is the people of Kelantan that voted them in.</p>
              <p>The real reason why i decide to reply to this topic is that i am disgusted by some people here who can claim "this proved how stupid some malays are..." and "malaysians are gays...". I know you mentioned "some" but  how do you justify that you have to say some of us are stupid just because a group of people pass these laws (if it was passed in the 1st place)</p>
              <p>I have a question to these type of people...."You feel clever by making these remarks?" coz i find that you have stooped to a level similar to the people who decide to pass these laws</p>
              <p>My apologies if i have offended some but i felt i have to stand up for what's right.</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>
