              <td class="marginbottom8 padlrt10">CINCINNATI - WHEN Ohio's Kent State University offered custodial staff
              the option of working four days a week instead of five to cut commuting
              costs, most jumped at the chance, part of a United States trend aimed
              at combating soaring gasoline prices.
              <p>'We offered it to 94 employees and 78 have taken us up on it,' said university spokesman Scott Rainone.</p>
              <p>The
              reason is simple: rising gas prices and a desire to retain good
              workers. And while so far only the university's custodians are
              eligible, Mr Rainone hopes the option will be offered to all
              departments - including his own.</p>
              <p>'In our office, we have people
              who travel anywhere from five or six miles to a couple who are on the
              road 45 to 50 minutes,' Mr Rainone said. 'As the price of gas rises,
              the level of grumbling rises.'</p>
              <p>Regular gasoline averages US$3.94
              (S$5.39) a gallon in the United States, up 33 cents in the past month
              and 88 cents since the beginning of the year, the Energy Information
              Administration said this week.</p>
              <p>The federal government has
              offered four-day workweeks to eligible employees for years as part of a
              flexible work programme that also includes telecommuting.</p>
              <p>But
              the surge in gasoline prices is pushing more private employers as well
              as local governments to offer a four-day week as a perk that eliminates
              two commutes a week.</p>
              <p>Staff at Neighbourhood Development
              Services in rural north-eastern Ohio were talking about quitting to
              find work closer to their homes when executive director Dave Vaughan
              stepped in with offers to compress their work week.</p>
              <p>'I didn't
              want to lose people,' Mr Vaughan said of the programme, which more than
              half of his 19 employees began last week. 'In rural areas like we are,
              gas price increases are more challenging because we don't have the mass
              transit alternative - we can't jump on a bus or take a train.'</p>
              <p>Eventually, Mr Vaughan hopes to close the office one day a week, further reducing energy costs.</p>
              <p>In
              America's struggling automaking heartland, the shorter workweek offers
              employers a way of rewarding employees when the budget does not allow a
              salary increase, said Oakland County, Michigan, executive L. Brooks
              Patterson.</p>
              <p>'By allowing employees to work four 10-hour days it
              will save them 20 per cent on their commute costs and ease the
              financial pinch of filling up their cars,' said Mr Patterson, who last
              week proposed the compressed week for county workers.</p>
              <p>Gasoline prices have begun altering United States commutes in many ways, a survey released on Thursday showed.</p>
              <p><strong>Changing habits </strong><br> Some 44 per cent of respondents said they have changed the way they
              commute - doing things such as sharing a ride or driving a more
              fuel-efficient car - or are working from home or looking for a closer
              job in order to reduce gasoline costs, according to staffing services
              company Robert Half International. That's up from 34 per cent two years
              ago.</p>
              <p>On New York's Long Island, Suffolk County legislator Wayne
              Horsley also has proposed employees have the option of working four
              10-hour shifts, rather than five eight-hour shifts, saying it would
              save 461 barrels of oil in a 120-day pilot project.</p>
              <p>'This is a gasoline-driven proposition and we're looking to change people's long term philosophies of life,' Mr Horsley said.</p>
              <p>The
              programme, termed Operation Sunshine, will cut gasoline costs for
              workers who drive an average round trip of 32 miles to work. It also
              aims to cut the county's energy bill by having fewer employees in the
              office at a time, Mr Horsley said.</p>
              <p>In Oklahoma, a resolution is
              pending before the state legislature encouraging state agencies to
              implement flexible work schedules that would allow the four-day
              workweek.</p>
              <p>'State employees are on fixed budgets and they are
              not usually the most highly paid in our society,' said State Senator
              Earl Garrison, a Democrat, who sponsored the measure.</p>
              <p>Some
              schools, including community colleges in rural areas where commutes are
              long and public transportation is scarce, already have plans to drop a
              day of classes, usually Fridays.</p>
              <p>The school district in
              Marietta, Georgia, a city north of Atlanta, institutes a four-day week
              during June and July when schools are out and it is mostly
              administrative staff who are working, saving on air conditioning and
              water in addition to commuting costs for employees, said Mr Thomas
              Algarin, director of communications at Marietta City Schools.</p>
              <p>But
              a four-day workweek brings problems too. The state government in Ohio
              is bucking the national trend and cancelling an 8-year-old policy that
              allowed a compressed workweek.</p>
              <p>'There were just too many vacant
              seats on Friday,' said Mr Ron Sylvester, a spokesman for the Ohio
              Department of Administrative Services. -- REUTERS</p>
