Announcing the launch of a "pilot stage" for GMES, the commission stressed its "user-friendly" application in guiding relief work after disasters or providing real time images of forest fires or oil spills.<br><br>But a commission memo also acknowledged that GMES would play a key role in the "implementation, review and monitoring of EU policies", including watching for agriculture and fisheries fraud and boosting "internal security".<br><br>In addition, officials hope GMES will support the EU's first steps towards becoming a military power. It will "provide authorities with necessary elements for a European Security and Defence Policy", the commission memo said.<br><br>The commission in Brussels will identify and develop possible uses for GMES. The management of the satellites will fall to the European Space Agency (ESA), which pools the space resources of 15 EU member states, including Britain, plus Norway and Switzerland.<br><br>US politicians are already suspicious of the ESA's "Galileo" project, a 30-satellite global navigation system designed to improve on the Pentagon-controlled GPS system. The EU's invitation to China to become a major investor only increased US concern.<br><br>Gregor Kreuzhuber, the commission's spokesman for industry policy, yesterday described GMES as "a little brother for Galileo, a sort of satellite system where you can better monitor what is happening on our planet".<br><br>GMES is intended to exploit existing assets belonging to individual EU nations. National governments would retain control over their satellites, Mr Kreuzhuber pledged.<br><br>Harmonising the use of national assets in space should mean Europe does not need to launch a full set of new satellites though some EU spacecraft are expected to be needed.<br><br>With the ESA, the commission has already spent Â£154 million on preparatory work, and expects the whole project to cost Â£1.54 billion between 2006 and 2013. Funding is to come from the commission, national governments and private defence and space firms.</div>
