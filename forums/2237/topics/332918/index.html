              <p><span id="intelliTXT">PERTH, Australia - Up to 40
              passengers and crew were injured, some suffering broken bones and cuts,
              when a Qantas jetliner suddenly changed altitude on Tuesday, Australian
              police and the airline said. <br> <br> The Airbus A330-300 made an emergency landing at an airfield near the
              Western Australian town of Exmouth after making a mayday call when the
              mid-air drama struck during a flight from Singapore to Perth. <br> <br> It is unclear yet if there are any Singaporeans on board the Qantas flight. <br> <br> "A number of passengers and crew sustained injuries, including
              fractures and lacerations, on board QF72 this afternoon en route from
              Singapore to Perth following a sudden change in altitude," the
              Australian flag carrier said. <br> <br> Emergency services and medical staff were on standby at the Learmonth
              air base, which lies about 1,100 kilometres (680 miles) northeast of
              the state capital of Perth, said Sergeant Greg Lambert of the West
              Australian Police. <br> <br> "It is understood up to 40 people were injured during a mid-air incident," he said. <br> <br> The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said early reports
              indicated that around 30 passengers and crew had been hurt, 15 of them
              sustaining serious injuries, including broken bones and lacerations. <br> <br> "While cruising in level flight, the aircraft experienced a sudden
              in-flight upset, resulting in injuries to a number of cabin crew and
              passengers, primarily in the rear of the aircraft," the bureau said in
              a statement. <br> <br> "The crew declared a mayday and diverted the aircraft to Learmonth ...
              where it landed without further incident," it said, adding that it was
              launching an immediate investigation. <br> <br> Qantas could not confirm the number of injured or whether the aircraft dropped or rose suddenly in altitude. <br> <br> An emergency services worker said paramedics had boarded the Qantas
              aircraft and were tending to the injured after it touched down at
              around 1:35 pm (0535 GMT). <br> <br> Emergency vehicles and ambulances surrounded the aircraft after it came to a halt, eyewitnesses said. <br> <br> A statement from Qantas said the A330-300 aircraft landed in Learmonth
              at 1.45pm (local time) and had been due to land in Perth at 2.10pm
              (local time). <br> <br> It added that those with inquiries about passengers should call Qantas in Australia on 1800 062 241. <br> <br> The Qantas statement also said the airlines is sending two aircraft, a
              B767 and a B717 to Learmonth from Perth to collect passengers and crew.
              The aircraft are due to arrive back in Perth at 7.50pm and 8:35pm local
              time. <br> <br> Qantas, which has long boasted a reputation of being one of the world's
              safest airlines, has suffered a spate of incidents in recent months
              that have tarnished its safety record. <br> <br> In July, an exploding oxygen bottle punched a huge hole in the side of
              a Qantas Boeing 747-400, forcing an emergency landing in the
              Philippines. No passengers were injured in the mid-air drama. <br> <br> The hole was ripped in the fuselage of the plane, which was carrying
              365 people, as it cruised at 29,000 feet (8,800 metres) en route from
              Hong Kong to Australia. <br> <br> Australian air safety investigators in August announced a safety review
              of Qantas after two other incidents occurred involving its aircraft
              within two weeks. <br> <br> On July 28, a Qantas Boeing 737-800 returned to Adelaide after a
              landing gear door failed to retract. In early August a Boeing 767 bound
              for Manila turned back to Sydney after developing a hydraulic fluid
              leak. <br> <br> But the aviation watchdog, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA),
              said that despite the review there was no evidence to suggest any links
              between three mid-air emergencies on Qantas flights. <br> <br> - AFP /ls </span></p>
