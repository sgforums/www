"Overshoot has increased by 4 percent since the last Living Planet Report, which was based on 2001 data, and is projected to rise to 30 percent in 2006."<br><br>"On current projections, humanity will be using two planets' worth of natural resources by 2050 Â— if those resources have not run out by then," the latest report said. "People are turning resources into waste faster than nature can turn waste back into resources."<br><br>"Humanity is living off its ecological credit card," Mathis Wackernagel, head of the Global Footprint Network, said in a statement. "While this can be done for a short while, overshoot ultimately leads to liquidation of the planet's ecological assets, and the depletion of resources, such as the forests, oceans and agricultural land upon which our economy depends."<br><br>The report noted that an index tracking 1,300 vertebrate species Â— birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals Â— showed that populations had fallen for most by about 30 percent because of factors including a loss of habitats to farms.<br><br>Eyes on China, other growing nations<br>The conservation groups added that the footprint from use of fossil fuels, whose heat-trapping emissions are widely blamed for pushing up world temperatures, was the fastest-growing cause of strain.<br><br>Leape said China, home to a fifth of the world's population and whose economy is booming, was making the right move in pledging to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent over the next five years.<br><br>"Much will depend on the decisions made by China, India and other rapidly developing countries," he added.<br><br>"The cities, power plants and homes we build today will either lock society into damaging overconsumption beyond our lifetimes," he added, "or begin to propel this and future generations toward sustainable living."</div>
