              <p>The West considers the Dalai Lama to be a compassionate, peaceful man, one who promotes non-violence etc. Is this the real truth? What about his past? Is he as morally sound as he seems?</p>
              <p>1)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS2M0sxuIlo&amp;feature=player_embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS2M0sxuIlo&amp;feature=player_embedded</a></p>

              <p>Watch this video and discover the truth. It recounts horrific accounts of torture, brutality and inhumane practices imposed upon the majority serf population in during the <strong>Dalai Lama's autonomous theocratic rule </strong>(pre 1959) - examples include eye gouging, skin peeling and chopping off of limbs.<br><br><img src="http://factandtruth.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/slavery2.jpg" border="0" alt=""> <br>Do you know what these are? These are Tibetan people’s skin! Dalai Lama used human skin to execute some Buddhism ceremony. The slaveoweners killed their slaves and peeled their skins. In this picture, obviously the left and the right are skins of children, and the middle belongs to an adult slave. The slaveoweners are willing to provide Dalai with human skins, because they believe they will be blessed by Dalai according to the Tibetan Buddhism.<br><br><img src="http://factandtruth.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/slavery1.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>picture shows that two Tibetans as slaves. Theire hands and feet are locked together by Tibetan slaveowners in case of escape.<br><br><img src="http://factandtruth.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/slave4.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>The third picture shows a slave whose arms were cutted off. When Dalai governed Tibet, human bones were made into religious instruments. The most cruel thing is that the slaveowners cut arms and legs from Tibetan slaves who are alive.<br><br><img src="http://factandtruth.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/slave3.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>This little girl starved to death. The slaveowners have sufficient foods and they intentionally let the female slave starve to death, because they want to use her heart, liver and other organs as sarcrifice. Besides, her head will be made into a container of drinks.<br><br><img src="http://factandtruth.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/slave5.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>Do you know how old the female slave were when this picture was taken? Most of you maybe think she was beyond 60 years old. In fact, this female slave, Jinyang, was 35 years old when the picture was taken. No doubt, it is the slavery life that lead this young woman to such terrible state.</p>

              <p>a democratic china is not really possible....but a social democratic model is more apt.....the issue of censorship with the CCP has always been a source of problem in its relationship with Tibet.</p>
              <p>it is dangerous for China to progress overnight from communistic to full democracy...this would create political and social unrest...but this should be done in stages...and dependent on the young generation with new and open minds to gradually change China the way they want it..but for now....China has already adopted free market policies that seen improved quality of lives than during Mao's era....this should be sustained via a social democratic model (or middle path) to adapt to the now dynamic global changes...slowly feeling the ground of changes to make correct changes...</p>

              <p>I suppose you are a Buddhist. My posting has nothing to do with Buddhism and I am sorry If I hurt your religious feeling. I respect Buddhism as a religion but not the Dalai Lama as a politician or spiritual leader.<br><br>The Tibetan's feudalistic cultural of master and slavery before 1959 was a given fact. <br>Like it or not, it is a fact. Those clips are not fake or lies.</p>
              <p>As I said, I have nothing against Buddhism. But these poor Tibetan people did lived under those sort of social conditions.  </p>
              <p>Let us face it this way. Buddhism is not equal to Tibet alone (if any, it should equal to Nepal) as much as Christianity is not equal to the Vatican City alone and Islam is not equal to the Palestine alone.</p>

              <p>It depends on who you ask. The way some Buddhists behave you would have swore the Buddha is God after a makeover, taking down scores and decide whether you have the grades to be born a human, animal or a fly. </p>
              <p>I would say the Vatican popes are more corrupted but the Tibetan lamas are more cruel.</p>
              <p>The popes behave like any tyrants in history, playing leaders against each other and starting wars to fulfill some silly ideological goals. It's not something i like but it's still something i can understand.</p>
              <p>The Tibetan lamas are of a different level of cruel. By hoodwinking the general populace that they the lamas are there because of accumulated karma, it gave the people the false hope that they could be like the lamas if they just obeyed the status quo long enough to accumulate the karma, much like America and it's vaulted Capitalism.</p>
              <p>And because you're a slave, you have bad karma. But it's ok, better luck next time maybe you'd get to be king next time round. </p>
              <p>Religion can only survive if they could explain the existence of those in power. It's just that simple. Not because they represent some inherent Truth.</p>
