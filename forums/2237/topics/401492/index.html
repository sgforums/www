              <p>A Latina lovely says her bosses at Citigroup canned her for flaunting  
              her ample assets at a midtown bank.<br> Dangerously curvy Debrahlee Lorenzana contends her ex-bosses at  
              Citibank in the Chrysler Building banned her from wearing sexy outfits  
              or heels deemed "too distracting" for male coworkers.<br> "I can't help it that I have curves," Lorenzana told the Daily News.<br> "And I'm not going to go eat and gain 50 or 100 pounds because my job  
              wants me to be the same size as everyone else."<br> The 33-year-old Queens woman filed suit in Manhattan Supreme Court,  
              claiming she was ordered to lay off turtlenecks, pencil skirts and  
              fitted suits because clingy clothes were drawing too much attention in  
              the workplace.<br> "Debrahlee Lorenzana would be very attractive in a burka," said her  
              lawyer Jack Tuckner, of Tuckner Sipser Weinstock &amp; Sipser.<br> Lorenzana, who is 5-feet-6 and 125 pounds, defended her fashion  
              choices, saying she never flashed too much skin and dressed  
              professionally, not provocatively.<br> "Never did I ever show cleavage," the divorced single mom said. "I  
              like fashion, but I always dressed professionally."<br> Lorenzana was hired as a business banking officer at Citi's Chrysler  
              branch in September 2008 and transferred in July 2009 to a Rockefeller  
              Center branch.<br> The suit claims she was moved to an out-of-the-way spot where she  
              couldn't lure in new clients as retaliation for her complaints about  
              sexual harassment. A month later she was fired.<br> "All it came down to was, 'We don't want to deal with you, because  
              you're just too good looking,'" Tuckner said.<br> In a statement, Citigroup said the suit is "without merit," but  
              declined to discuss Lorenzana's performance.<br> "Citi is committed to fostering a culture of inclusion and providing a 
               respectful environment in the workplace," the statement read.<br> Lorenzana, who works for another financial institution, said she's  had
               to face harassment her entire life because of a body that drives men  
              wild.<br> "I get harassed in the supermarket with my son just wearing  sweatpants
               with my hair in a ponytail," she said. "I can't help how I  look."</p>

              <p>Excerpts:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px;"><strong style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Debbie Lorenzana</strong>—whose mother is Puerto Rican and father is Italian—came to New York from Puerto Rico 12 years ago. She was 21 and pregnant, and had a degree as an emergency medical technician from a technical college in Manatí, a small city on the northern coast. The father, she says, didn't want to have anything to do with her or the baby. So she moved back to the States, where she had lived in her mid-teens (pinballing between relatives' houses and group homes), and took care of her elderly grandparents in Connecticut. After her son was born, she moved to Queens to stay with a friend. Then she got her first job in finance: working as a sales representative at the Municipal Credit Union, in 2002. She moved to Jersey City and worked long hours. She was successful.</span></p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px;">"Men are kind of drawn to her," says Tanisha Ritte<a style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; color: #253c87; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Tanisha Ritter" href="http://www.villagevoice.com/related/to/Tanisha+Ritter">r</a>, a friend and former colleague who also works as a banker and praises Lorenzana's work habits. "I've seen men turn into complete idiots around her. But it's not her fault that they act this way, and it shouldn't be her problem."</span></p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px;">"It's like saying," Tuckner argues, "that we can't think anymore 'cause our penises are standing up—and we cannot think about you except in a sexual manner—and we can't look at you without wanting to have sexual intercourse with you. And it's up to you, gorgeous woman, to lessen your appeal so that we can focus!"</span></p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">She says she loved to work, and eventually was earning close to $70,000 a year. "My ex-boyfriend says it's my Spic pride," she says. "As long as I have two hands and two legs, and can still walk, I will always work, so my son will have a roof over his head and food."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">And she will be well-dressed. Lorenzana is, by her own admission, a shopaholic. She shops for her work clothes at Zara, but when she has money, she says, she spends it on designer clothes. She has five closets full of Burberry, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Roberto Cavalli. In her son's closet, there's a row of tiny Lacoste, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and Ralph Lauren T-shirts. She says her love of fine clothes is a result of her growing up poor—she recalls running a high school marathon barefoot because she couldn't afford sneakers.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">----</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Citibank does have a dress-code policy, which says clothing must not be provocative, but does not go into specifics, and managers have wide discretion. But Lorenzana points out that, unlike her, some of the tellers dressed in miniskirts and low-cut blouses. "And when they bend down," Lorenzana says, "anyone can see what God gave them!"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">----</p>

"My entire life, I've been dealing with this. 'Cause people say, 'Oh, you got a job because you look that way.' So you gotta work four times harder to prove you are capable. To prove you didn't get this because of the way you look. First, I'm a woman, then I'm an immigrant, and I have my accent. At Citibank, when they were picking on me for every little thing, I couldn't take it anymore!"</p>
