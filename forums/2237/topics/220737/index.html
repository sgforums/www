"You hate like hell to damage a painting like 'Le Reve."'<br><br>Wynn was showing Picasso's 1932 work to several high-profile guests in his Las Vegas office when he accidentally poked a hole in the canvas with his elbow.<br><br>Wynn called it, "the world's clumsiest and goofiest thing to do," and said he was glad he was responsible and not one of his guests. He said no one but him said a word.<br><br>"The blood drained out of their faces," Wynn said, identifying his guests as screenwriter Nora Ephron and husband Nick Pileggi, broadcaster Barbara Walters, New York socialite Louise Grunwald, lawyer David Boies and his wife, Mary, and art dealer Serge Sorokko and his wife, Tatiana.<br><br>"They did not know what to say," Wynn recalled. "I just turned around and said, 'Oh, my God. How could I have done this?'<br><br>"At least I did it myself."<br><br>Wynn said the gaffe made him and his wife, Elaine Wynn, reconsider his deal to sell the painting to art collector Steven Cohen. Just 36 hours before, Wynn had agreed to sell "Le Reve," French for "The Dream" for $139 million.<br><br>Wynn said it could cost $85,000 to repair the damage. He wouldn't name the conservator in New York who was doing the work, but art experts say the painting can be repaired so that the tear won't be visible.<br><br>"Now the argument is over diminution of value," Wynn said.</div>
