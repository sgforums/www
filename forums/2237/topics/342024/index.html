              <h1>Crisis widens appeal of Islamic finance</h1>
              <p class="hn-byline">By  EMMA VANDORE  –  <span class="hn-date">2 days ago</span></p>
              <p class="hn-byline"><a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hhLD72VsDDxkQMxJiecdrOgvT1ewD9595GJO0">http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hhLD72VsDDxkQMxJiecdrOgvT1ewD9595GJO0</a></p>
              <p>PARIS (AP) — France is becoming the latest country to woo Islamic
              banks, which avoided much of the damage from the subprime mortgage
              crisis by following strict principles laid out in the Quran — as the
              global financial crisis broadens the appeal of Islamic finance.</p>
              <p>French
              Finance Minister Christine Lagarde has promised to make adjustments to
              the regulatory and legal arsenal to enable Paris to become a major
              marketplace in Islamic finance.</p>
              <p>At a recent forum in Paris, she
              said Western financiers could learn a thing or two from the Islamic
              world as global leaders try to establish "new principles for the
              international financial system, based on transparency, responsibility
              and, I would like to add, moderation."</p>
              <p>"In this sense, Islamic finance is calling out to us," she said.</p>
              <p>Finance
              that complies with Shariah, or Islamic law, accounts for around $700
              billion of assets and is growing at 10 to 30 percent a year, according
              to Moody's Investors Service.</p>
              <p>That's grabbing the attention of
              governments eager to oil their liquidity-strapped economies with money
              and deposits from the Islamic world. Islamic finance is concentrated in
              the Persian Gulf and Muslim parts of Asia such as Indonesia and
              Malaysia but is spreading into North Africa and Europe.</p>
              <p>Islamic
              banking does not have the scale to replace Western-style finance, but
              in these cash-strapped times it is seen as offering another alternative
              for raising money.</p>
              <p>London has attracted the largest pool of
              Shariah-compliant assets in the West and desire to compete with
              Britain's ailing financial center is motivating Paris to get in on the
              act. The country has some 5 million Muslims, but does not offer
              Islamic-based retail banking, and the country's secular traditions may
              present an obstacle to a French version of the Islamic Bank of Britain.</p>
              <p>Moody's
              ratings agency noted in a November report that Islamic financiers will
              need to quell fears that France's official religious neutrality could
              be put at risk.</p>
              <p>But more people are seeing business reasons to
              attract Islamic funds. A report by economics professors Olivier Pastre
              and Elyes Jouini claims that France could attract up to euro100 billion
              ($136.9 billion) from Islamic financial institutions.</p>
              <p>"We want to
              make sure that Paris is in a position to be able to welcome this money
              to finance the French economy," said Gilles Saint Marc, a Paris-based
              lawyer who is advising an Islamic institution which plans to make a
              formal application to start investment banking activities in France.</p>
              <p>Anouar
              Hassoune, a senior credit officer at Moody's France and co-author of
              the book 'Islamic Finance a la francaise," said that Islamic
              institutions could initially focus on investing in property and
              Shariah-compliant businesses, and within three to five years they might
              also offer retail services. He mentioned Kuwait Finance House and
              Al-Baraka Islamic Bank as possibilities.</p>
              <p>A November report by
              Moody's shows that Islamic banks have been fairly resilient. No Islamic
              financial institution has acknowledged investing in Bernard Madoff's
              $50 billion Ponzi scheme, and Saleh Al Tayar, Secretary General of the
              Franco-Arab Chamber of Commerce, said the $4.9 billion hit taken by
              Societe Generale SA from what it calls unauthorized trading by Jerome
              Kerviel couldn't have happened in an Islamic institution.</p>
              <p>"If
              global banking practices were based on Islamic practices then we
              wouldn't be seeing the kind of crisis we are living through now," he
              said.</p>
              <p>Islamic financial institutions work on a philosophy of
              prohibiting transactions considered immoral and promoting greater
              social justice by sharing risk and reward. Investing in casinos,
              pornography, arm dealers or anything to do with pork is out: long-term
              investments in projects considered to benefit society are in.</p>
              <p>Interest
              payments, short selling and contracts considered excessively risky are
              also prohibited. That rules out some of the products that got Western
              finance into so much trouble such as subprime mortgages, collateralized
              debt obligations or credit default swaps.</p>
              <p>Muslim scholars versed
              also in the arcane rules of finance have approved instruments that
              parallel many non-Islamic financial products from loans to insurance to
              bonds.</p>
              <p>Sukuks are the equivalent of bonds, but instead of selling
              a debt, the issuer sells a portion of an asset which the buyer is
              allowed to rent.</p>
              <p>"Islamic finance does demonstrate good banking
              behavior that has been perhaps lost over the last 10 years or so," said
              Neil Miller, head of Islamic finance at Norton Rose and an adviser to
              the British government.</p>
              <p>"Islamic banking is saying we are close
              to our clients and we're only going to do genuine transactions where we
              can see the asset, we understand the asset, we can make an assessment
              of that asset: whether it's financing a ship or an aircraft they will
              go and have a look at the business. It's giving guidance as to what
              banking should be."</p>
              <p>Hassoune says that conventional banks can be
              as ethical as an Islamic bank but competition and shareholder demands
              have encouraged excessive risk taking.</p>
              <p>"I don't think conventional banks are dirty, bad, money obsessed," he said. But "they are pushed to make unreasonable profits."</p>
