The countries which seek nuclear weapons are those which want to solve all problems by the use of force. Our nation does not need such weapons.<br><br>NUCLEAR RESEARCH<br><br>We are asked why we have started [nuclear] research. We answer that there is no limitation to research. There are no limits imposed on research in NPT [Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty] or in the Additional Protocol. Nor have we made such a commitment. Research is necessary for the life and dynamism of a nation.<br><br>THE UNITED NATIONS<br><br>The UN Security Council has been set up for the world security. Is the UN Security Council a mere tool in their [Western powers] hands to use at their will - threatening to send our case to the UN if we refuse to comply with their demands? Our understanding is that the UN Security Council belongs to all nations and is not a tool for a few countries. Why do they use it for their own purpose?<br><br>CHALLENGES AND THREATS<br><br>The prevalence of military domination, increasing poverty, the growing gap between rich and poor countries, violence as a means to solve crises, spread of terrorism - especially state terrorism - existence and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the pervasive lack of honesty in interstate relations, and disregard for the equal rights of peoples and nations in international relations, constitute some of the challenges and threats.<br><br>ISRAEL<br><br>As the Imam said, Israel must be wiped off the map.<br><br>THE HOLOCAUST<br><br>They have created a myth today that they call the massacre of Jews and they consider it a principle above God, religions and the prophets.<br><br>GOVERNMENT<br><br>Government belongs to all people. It has to address the problems of every parts of the country. All parts of the country should move forward simultaneously. Every Iranian is entitled to equal right, especially in developing individual talent and development.<br><br>MORALITY<br><br>Human excellence, the excellence of human society comes about in the light of justice and spirituality. Measures that are taken outside religious morality, politics minus morality, economics minus morality, culture minus morality only turns the world into a hell for nations and humanity.<br><br>HUMAN RIGHTS<br><br>We neither oppress anyone nor are we prepared to submit to anyone's oppression. We want justice, peace and security for all nations. We are defenders of human dignity all across the world.<br><br>BELIEF<br><br>Belief in a saviour is universal. It is the pivot of our beliefs as Muslims and Iranians. We believe that an offspring of the prophet, may peace be upon him, will be the ultimate saviour. His name and attributes are clear. He will come and will administer ultimate justice.<br><br>IRANIAN POWER<br><br>The Iranian nation is a learned nation. It is a civilised nation. It is a history-making nation... You know and we know: you need us far more than we need you.</div>
