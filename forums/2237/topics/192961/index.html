He convened a panel of 15 experts -- including veterinarians -- and asked them to come up with a massive rewrite of the city's animal-care ordinance that reins in irresponsible care that ultimately leads to aggressive behavior.<br><br>'Take better care of our dogs'<br><br>"We're setting up an infrastructure in our city to take better care of our dogs. People who don't, it sets a process in place, after repeat offenses, to take those dogs away from them and putting them in loving and caring environments," Schulter said. "In many areas of the city, we have a huge problem with dogs running wild and biting kids and adults. This will start to address some of those issues."<br><br>Initially, Schulter was planning to require identifying microchips, at a cost of $25, only for those dogs boarded at kennels. But, after Hurricane Katrina, he decided to broaden it to include all dogs six months or older. "There were so many dogs that were lost because they could not find pet owners. That has encouraged us to look at this more comprehensively" and require microchip scanners at kennels, Schulter said.<br><br>Steve Dale, a radio talk show host and longtime local activist on pet issues, said mandatory microchipping would help identify "repeat offender" dogs.<br><br>Equally important, Dale said, are the proposals to limit tethering -- which tends to cause aggressive behavior -- to three hours over a 24-hour period with food and water, and to increase tenfold -- to $50 -- the fee for licensing a non-neutered dog.</div>
