The jet streams' shift toward the poles means the zones are expanding.<br><br>The research is not predictive, but does show a long-term trend, Wallace said by telephone.<br><br>"If (this jet-stream shift) is going to stop and it just ends up being 70 miles, that's not a big deal," he said. "But if it were to continue at the same rate over the next century, then that would amount to a couple of hundred miles (kilometers) and that would start to have significant effects."<br><br>ENCROACHING ON THE TEMPERATE ZONE<br><br>The dry subtropical climate regions, which contain some of the world's major deserts, could encroach into temperate regions, Wallace said. Areas such as the Mediterranean, southern Europe and the northern part of the Middle East could have a tendency toward more drought, Wallace said.<br><br>The same might happen in southern Australia and South Africa, he said.<br><br>The study does not address whether this warming is due to the greenhouse effect or some other factor. It is different from previous models, which saw the fastest warming in the tropics, rather than the subtropics.<br><br>The greenhouse effect is seen as a major cause for global warming, in which so-called greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, swaddle the Earth like a blanket, keeping the sun's warmth.<br><br>Some greenhouse warming is natural, but many scientists believe that accelerated warming over the last century was caused by human activities including coal-burning power plants and the use of other fossil fuels.<br><br>Faster subtropical warming in the lower atmosphere, which moves the jet streams, could push storm tracks toward the poles, possibly reducing winter precipitation in places like southern Europe, including the Alps, and southern Australia, the scientists said in a statement.</div>
