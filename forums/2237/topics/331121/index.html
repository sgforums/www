              <p>If
              it seems like disasters are getting more common, it's because they are.
              But some disasters do seem to be affecting us worse - and not for the
              reasons you may think. Floods and storms have led to most of the excess
              damage. The number of flood and storm disasters has gone up by 7.4%
              every year in recent decades, according to the <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/time/us_time/storytext/whydisastersaregettingworse/28945254/SIG=10l7h2imf/*http://www.cred.be/">Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters</a>.
              (Between 2000 and 2007, the growth was even faster - with an average
              annual rate of increase of 8.4%.) Of the total 197 million people
              affected by disasters in 2007, 164 million were affected by floods.</p>
              <p>It is tempting to look at the line-up of storms in the Atlantic
              (Hanna, Ike, Josephine) and, in the name of everything green, blame <span id="lw_1220548623_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">climate change</span> for this state of affairs. But there is another inconvenient truth out
              there: We are getting more vulnerable to weather mostly because of <em>where</em> we live, not just how we live.</p>
              <p>In recent decades, people around the world have moved en masse to big cities near water. The <span id="lw_1220548623_1" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">population of Miami-Dade County</span> in Florida was about 150,000 in the 1930s, a decade fraught with severe
              hurricanes. Since then, the population of Miami-Dade County has
              rocketed 1,600% to 2,400,000.</p>
              <p>So the same intensity hurricane today wreaks all sorts of havoc that
              wouldn't have occurred had human beings not migrated. (To see how your
              own coastal county has changed in population, check out this cool <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/time/us_time/storytext/whydisastersaregettingworse/28945254/SIG=11dcdtsfk/*http://maps.csc.noaa.gov/hurricanes/pop.jsp">graphing tool</a> from the <span id="lw_1220548623_2" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span>.)</p>
              <p>If climate change is having an effect on the intensities of storms,
              it's not obvious in the historical weather data. And whatever effect it
              is having is much, much smaller than the effect of development along
              the coastlines. In fact, if you look at all storms from 1900 to 2005
              and imagine we had today's populations on the coasts, as <span id="lw_1220548623_3" class="yshortcuts">Roger Pielke</span>, Jr., and his colleagues did in a <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/time/us_time/storytext/whydisastersaregettingworse/28945254/SIG=12l2dd3dv/*http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-2476-2008.02.pdf">2008 Natural Hazards Review paper</a>, you would see that the worst hurricane would have actually happened in 1926.</p>
              <p>If it happened today, the Great <span id="lw_1220548623_4" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Miami</span> storm would have caused $140 to $157 billion in damages. (<span id="lw_1220548623_5" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Hurricane Katrina</span>,
              the costliest storm in U.S. history, caused $100 billion in losses.)
              "There has been no trend in the number or intensity of storms at
              landfall since 1900,"says Pielke, a professor of environmental studies
              at the <span id="lw_1220548623_6" class="yshortcuts">University of Colorado</span>. "The storms themselves haven't changed."</p>
              <p>What's changed is what we've put in the storm's way. Crowding
              together in coastal cities puts us at risk on a few levels. First, it
              is harder for us to evacuate before a storm because of gridlock. And in
              much of the developing world, people don't get the kinds of <span id="lw_1220548623_7" class="yshortcuts">early warnings</span> that Americans get. So large migrant populations - usually living in
              flimsy housing - get flooded out year after year. That helps explain
              why Asia has repeatedly been the hardest hit by disasters in recent
              years.</p>
              <p>Secondly, even if we get all the humans to safety, we still have
              more stuff in harm's way. So each big hurricane costs more than the big
              one before it, even controlling for inflation.</p>
              <p>But the most insidious effect of building condos and industry along
              the water is that we are systematically stripping the coasts of the
              protection that used to cushion the blow of <span id="lw_1220548623_8" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">extreme weather</span>. Three years after Katrina, southern Louisiana is still losing a football field worth of wetlands every 38 minutes.</p>
              <p>Human beings have been clearing away our best protections all over the world, says Kathleen Tierney, director of the <span id="lw_1220548623_9" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Natural Hazards Center</span> at the <span id="lw_1220548623_10" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">University of Colorado, Boulder</span>. "The natural protections are diminishing - whether you're talking about mangrove forests in areas affected by the <span id="lw_1220548623_11" class="yshortcuts">Indian ocean tsunami</span>, wetlands in the <span id="lw_1220548623_12" class="yshortcuts">Gulf Coast</span> or forests, which offer protection against landslides and mudslides."</p>
              <p>Before we become hopelessly lost in despair, however, there is good
              news: we can do something about this problem. We can enact meaningful
              building codes and stop keeping insurance premiums artificially low in
              flood zones.</p>
              <p>But first we need to understand that disasters aren't just caused by FEMA and <span id="lw_1220548623_13" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">greenhouse gases</span>.
              Says Tierney: "I don't think that people have an understanding of
              questions they should be asking - about where they live, about design
              and construction, about <span id="lw_1220548623_14" class="yshortcuts">building inspection</span>, <span id="lw_1220548623_15" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">fire protection</span>. These just aren't things that are on people's minds."</p>
              <p>Increasingly, <span id="lw_1220548623_16" class="yshortcuts">climate change</span> is on people's minds, and that is all for the better. Even if climate
              change has not been the primary driver of disaster losses, it is likely
              to cause far deadlier disasters in the future if left unchecked.</p>
              <p>But even if greenhouse gas emissions plummeted miraculously next
              year, we would not expect to see a big change in disaster losses. So
              it's important to stay focused on the real cause of the problem, says
              Pielke. "Talking about land-use policies in coastal Mississippi may not
              be the sexiest topic, but that's what's going to make the most
              difference on this issue." View this article on <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1838400,00.html?xid=feed-yahoo-full-nation"><span id="lw_1220548623_17" class="yshortcuts">Time.com</span></a></p>
