                  instances in America, if you aggravate the injury, as we have seen,
                  you will get sued. Most common law countries have some principles
                  of ‘duty to rescue’ . France for exmaple imposes such duties in a
                  stricter form.</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Back to being sued, it will depend on whether you are reasonably
                  qualified or not. Lets say u are someone who have no first aid
                  skills whatsoever, I would suggest alerting passerbys , call police
                  etc.. or whatever Just dont directly try and ressucitate the
                  injured person or move them.</p>
              <p>What was appaling in the video was that nobody did absolutely
                  anything. Not even stopping to ask for help, calling passerby’s to
                  assist or calling the relevant authorities.</p>
              <p>It will be a measure of your ability to the situation at
                  hand.</p>
              <p>You do not need any special skills to call for help or dial a
                  number.</p>
              <p>I know its ridiculous when u get sued for helping someone. That
                  just speaks volume about the particular person. If I get sued, so
                  be it. While there is a possibility of losing money, on the other
                  hand u get to destroy the persons character forever.</p>

              <p>This isn't as bad as an earlier case where a motorist ran over a
              pedestrian in the country side (the pedestrian was still alive),
              but the motorist took out a knife to stab her to death. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Murderer says he has not
              decided if he will appeal the court's judgment</strong></p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">XI'AN - Yao Jiaxin, a university
              student who stabbed a young mother to death after knocking her down
              with his car in a traffic crash in October 2010, was sentenced to
              death on Friday by a court in Xi'an, capital of Northwest China's
              Shaanxi province.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Yao, 21, a junior at the Xi'an
              Conservatory of Music, ran into Zhang Miao while she was riding a
              bicycle. Yao was driving a Chevrolet Cruze at the time of the
              crash, which occurred at 10:30 pm on Oct 20. Fearing that Zhang
              would remember his license plate number and report him to the
              police, he stabbed her to death, according to the Intermediate
              People's Court of Xi'an.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">The court also handed down a life-long
              revocation of Yao's political rights and ordered Yao to pay
              45,498.50 yuan ($6,983) in compensation to Zhang's family.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">After the stabbing, Yao drove away from
              the scene and, in his hurry to get away, injured two bystanders. In
              an interview with police on Oct 22, he denied he had committed the
              murder.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">The next day, though, he surrendered
              himself to police in the company of his parents and admitted to
              being responsible for the killing, the court said.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Yao said he resorted to murder because
              he feared the "peasant woman would be hard to deal with".</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">On the night of her death, Zhang, 26,
              the mother of a 2-year-old boy, was returning home from her
              temporary job as a cafeteria assistant at the Chang'an campus of
              Northwest University.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Police said the crash left her with a
              small fracture in her leg and other slight injuries.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Yao, after hitting the victim, did not
              try to help her but instead resorted to murder to silence her. That
              split-second decision made his crime heinous and eliminated a
              possibility that he would receive a lesser punishment, the court
              said on Friday.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">In China, criminals who turn themselves
              in are occasionally granted lesser punishments than those who do
              not.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">"The motive was extremely
              despicable...the conduct was extremely cruel...and the consequences
              are extremely serious," the court judgment said.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Yao, when asked if he wants to appeal
              the sentence, said he needs time to make such a decision.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Relatives of Yao and Zhang, as well as
              hundreds of journalists and students, were present for the
              judgment.</p>

              <h1 class="cN-headingPage articleHeading prepend-5 span-11 last">Only the guilty help the injured: legacy of the 'Nanjing Judge' all too apparent as passers-by ignore hit-run toddler</h1>
              <p>The sight of an injured toddler lying bleeding on the road for seven minutes while <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/a-seriously-ill-society-hitrun-case-of-little-yueyue-shocks-china--and-the-world-20111018-1ltv1.html"><strong>passers-by ignored her</strong></a> shocked many around the world, but to some in China it was the all too familiar legacy of the "Nanjing Judge".</p>
              <p>A judge in the eastern city of Nanjing made headlines 
              five years ago when he blamed a good Samaritan for knocking an old lady 
              over in the street because "common sense" meant only the guilty help the
               injured.</p>
              <p>Now the viral footage of two-year-old Wang Yue, nicknamed Yueyue, 
              being run over twice and left to bleed on a market street in Foshan, 
              Guangdong, <strong><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/toddler-hitandrun-raises-painful-questions-in-china-20111018-1lyq8.html">has left many in China asking questions about their personal and social morality</a></strong>.</p>
              <p>Discussion of Yueyue on China's version of Twitter, Sina Weibo, is under the hash tag "Please end the cold-heartedness", <strong><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/nanjing-judge-blamed-for-apathy-in-toddlers-hit-and-run/">America's ABC News reported</a></strong>.</p>
              <p>Many on the social networking site believed the 
              reluctance of nearly 20 pedestrians and drivers to help Yueyue could be 
              put down to the "Nanjing judge".</p>
              <p>While discussing Yueyue online, one person wrote: "Don't blame the 
              passersby; it was a Nanjing judge that killed this little girl."</p>
              <p>Another said: "It can only be said that the [woman who helped Yueyue] doesn't read news on the internet."</p>
              <p>In 2006 a man named Peng Yu helped the old lady who was injured on the street in Nanjing.</p>
              <p>The woman asked him to take her to hospital, where she then accused him of pushing her over and the case went to court.</p>
              <p>The judge ruled that if the man wanted to help the 
              elderly lady, "common sense" explained that he must have been to blame 
              and ordered him to pay her medical costs.</p>
              <p>The case was widely reported in China and apparently became a kind of cautionary tale.</p>
              <p>Three years later, a similar story came out of Nanjing 
              about an elderly man who fell while getting off a bus and was only 
              helped by pedestrians when he made it clear that he would take 
              responsibility.</p>
              <p>ABC News also quoted a report from <em>The China Daily</em> that the Ministry of Heath even issued guidelines about what to do if you see an elderly person fall.</p>
              <p>"Don't rush to lend a hand to the elderly after seeing 
              them fall over. It should be handled by different measures in different 
              situations,” the ministry said.</p>
              <p>It also reportedly advised trying to determine the 
              person's condition, the cause of the accident and whether rescue crews 
              should be called before giving help.</p>
              <p><strong><a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/usa/china/2011-10/18/content_13924846.htm"><em>The China Daily</em> website</a></strong> said local media reported Yueyue could now take weak breaths with the 
              help of a ventilator and her heart beat and blood pressure were stable.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">Despite critics' disparagements of the woman who rescued a 2-year-old girl this past week in Foshan, Guangdong province, the girl's mother said she believes the rescuer is a good person.<br><br>'I don't have enough words to thank her with,' the mother, who would identify herself only as Qu, said at the hospital on Monday.<br><br>Her praise was for Chen Xianmei, a 57-year-old woman who moved Mrs Qu's daughter Yue Yue to the side of a road after the girl had been run over by a van and a truck in a hardware market this past Thursday. Before Mrs Chen came to the rescue, 18 people had walked past Yue Yue without helping her.<br><br>A number of shopkeepers close to the accident scene denied that they had witnessed what had happened. Mrs Chen was the first person to offer help.<br><br>The rescuer hails from Qingyuan, Guangdong province, and lives with her son in Foshan, cooking meals at a small company in the morning and picking up rags in the afternoon.<br><br>According to Mrs Qu, Mrs Chen would occasionally remove refuse from the shop Mrs Qu runs in the hardware market.<br><br>'Every time she saw used cartons or plastic bottles, she would ask me, 'Do you still want them or not?' before she collected them,' Mrs Qu said. 'She is a good person. There is no doubt about that.'<br><br>Learning of the case, the public has poured out its anger on the passers-by who ignored the girl while praising Mrs Chen for being the only person at the accident scene who gave evidence of possessing a conscience.<br><br>Recalling the accident, Mrs Chen said: 'I was picking up trash in the hardware market when I saw a child lying in the road. I walked up in a hurry to the girl and heard her groan. I lifted her up and saw that one of her eyes was closed, that she had tears in her eyes, and she was bleeding from her mouth, nose and the back of her head.<br><br>'I wanted to carry her but she was soft and collapsed immediately. I was scared to try again and so I dragged her to the side of the road and shouted for help. But nobody showed up,' Mrs Chen was quoted in Yangcheng Evening News as saying. Mrs Chen asked a few nearby shopkeepers who the girl was and only heard 'I don't know' in reply.<br><br>Mrs Chen said she was not afraid of being wrongfully blamed for the accident. 'When I see old people who fall down, I help them,' she said. 'Somebody has to help. The most important thing is to save a life. She was just a little child. It was dark, but I could definitely see her.'<br><br>Since the rescue, Mrs Chen said she has been bewildered by the number of requests for media interviews she has received. She also heard that critics have accused her of helping the girl merely out of a desire for publicity.<br><br>Her daughter-in-law, who declined to state her full name, said those comments have been disappointing.<br><br>'Is it really so difficult to be a good person?' she said.<br><br>Mrs Qu said she puts no stock in what the critics are saying.<br><br>'I am truly grateful,' she said. 'She is really kind, not the type of person who enjoys publicity.'<br><br>Speaking of the indifferent passers-by, Mrs Qu said: 'I won't judge them. Let them make their own judgment. If they are married and have children, they will know. But I bear no grudge and refuse to be disappointed by society. Many kind people have come to help.'<br><br>Mrs Qu said she plans to stay by her daughter's side at the hospital where the girl is undergoing treatment.<br><br>'I didn't care for my child very well, and it's my fault,' she said. 'But Yue Yue can't leave her mother and her mum won't leave her.'<br><br>Yue Yue, who remains in a critical condition, underwent a special test of her brainstem on Monday. The results of that will show whether she is brain dead, said Dr Wang Weimin, director of the neurosurgery department of the General Hospital of the Guangzhou Military Command of the People's Liberation Army. The hospital said the test results will be made public on Tuesday.<br><br>Yue Yue's mother wrote on her micro blog that her daughter's four limbs have shown signs of having feeling and a doctor said her progress has been much better than expected.<br><br>Meanwhile, the civilisation office of Foshan's Nanhai district presented 10,000 yuan (S$1,987) to Mrs Chen on Monday as a reward for her kind deed, said Mr Guo Yu, director of the office.<br><br>'I feel indignant and disappointed about the passers-by, who should reflect on what their behaviour says about themselves,' he said. 'It wasn't that difficult to help the girl, and Chen Xianmei did it out of her heart and conscience.'<br><br>Charity groups have received donations for the girl and Mrs Chen, Mr Guo said.<br><br>As for the drivers who hit Yue Yue, one has been caught by the police and the other has turned himself in, Wang Zhen'an, chief of the Foshan traffic police, said on Monday.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ill tell you why they blamed the mother. because they couldnt identify those 17 fucking assholes, and in typical PRC nature, they HAD to blame someone. someone remotely related to the girl's death. they COULNT blame those fucking shopkeepers who CHASED AWAY THE ONE GOOD SAMARITAN WHO TRIED TO SAVE THE GIRL. SO WHO DID THE PRCs BLAME? the mother. fuck, of all ppl, the grieving mother over the single lousy mistake she made. U THINK she didnt know her mistake? what abt the 17 ass holes who walked by? the surrounding shopkeepers who told the samaritan to FUCK OFF? this is plain shit.</div>

              <p>That mother is very lucky. Thanks to the media, the hospital will have to treat her daughter.</p>
              <p>Chinese hospitals have been known to cut off your treatment or your painkiller if you can't pay. For a successful operation, you must bribe.</p>
