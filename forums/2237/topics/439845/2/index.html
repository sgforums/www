              <p><span><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Yue Yue, a toddler who was run over by two vehicles, receives treatment at hospital on Monday. Doctors say she is nearly brain dead as donations poured in for her and her rescuer. Provided to China Daily</span></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GUANGZHOU - Yue Yue, the 2-year-old girl who was run over by two vehicles in Foshan, Guangdong province last week, remained close to brain dead as donations poured in for her and her rescuer.</p>
              <p>"Her situation somewhat meets the standard of brain death," said Wang Weimin with the General Hospital of the Guangzhou Military Command of the People's Liberation Army.</p>
              <p>"We can say she is close to brain dead, but her pain reflex is very sensitive, which is the only feature not matching brain death," Wang said on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Yue Yue still relies on machines for maintaining blood pressure and respiration. Tests on Monday found severe damage in the functions of her brainstem and cerebral cortex. There are a lot of possibilities in the development of her situation and she remains in critical condition, said Su Lei, director of the intensive care unit of the hospital.</p>
              <p>Donations have poured in for Yue Yue and her rescuer, the 57-year-old woman Chen Xianmei, who moved the girl to the side of the road and shouted for her parents after the accident.</p>
              <p>A company based in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, gave 50,000 yuan ($7,850) cash to the girl's father, Wang Chichang, at the hospital on Tuesday. It pledged another 50,000 yuan and a cleaning job at the Foshan branch for Chen.</p>
              <p>Another company in Dongguan, Guangdong province pledged 500,000 yuan to Yue Yue's family, Chen and the fund in Guangzhou for rewarding those who help others in danger.</p>
              <p>Representatives from the Guangdong provincial women's federation visited the girl's family at the hospital and called for the public to help others in need.</p>
              <p>The father said they would go to the bank to check how much they had received and decide what to do with the donations.</p>
              <p>"We may open an independent account and put it under the supervision of the media," he said.</p>
              <p>Chen at first refused to take the reward and then decided she would share it with Yue Yue.</p>
              <p>"I didn't do it for money. I didn't earn the money. I will feel uneasy if I take it. My daughter asked me not to take any money for fear of unkind words from others," Chen was quoted saying by Southern Metropolitan News.</p>
              <p>While Chen hoped for a normal life after the bombardments of media interviews, Yue Yue's family also had to deal with a lot they had not expected.</p>
              <p>Responding to remarks that they had opened a micro blog account for publicity and donations, the father said the micro blog service operator opened the account for them and wrote the micro blogs after learning of Yue Yue's latest situation.</p>
              <p>"I can't express my feelings. I'm only thinking of saving my child. I didn't expect so many unrelated things to happen. I would like to stress that we didn't call for donations."</p>
              <p>Many of the 18 people who passed by the girl at the accident scene and did not help denied that they saw the girl or were aware of the situation.</p>
              <p>One of them, a mother of a five-year-old girl, said she felt "regretful, compassionate, painful at heart and guilty," for seeing Yue Yue but not helping her.</p>
              <p>"I thought she had fallen down from playing and didn't know she was run over by vehicles until her mother came in tears.</p>
              <p>"She was bleeding from the mouth and nose and crying faintly. I was scared and my daughter was scared to cry. So we left in a hurry," said the woman surnamed Lin, cited by Guangzhou Daily.</p>
              <p>"I wanted to lift her, but there was so much blood. I was scared. If someone was helping at that time, I would have done the same."</p>
              <p>A lawyer association will be set up as part of the Guangdong Law Society, which will study the practice of refusing to help dying people and push for legislation, said Zhu Yongping, a well-known lawyer at Datong Law Firm in Guangzhou.</p>

              <p>A video culled from surveillance footage and posted on YouTube and its Chinese equivalent, Youku, shows a van driver striking the 2-year-old girl, pausing with his vehicle straddling the girl’s torso, then driving forward, running her over a second time with his back wheel.</p>
              <p>None of the 18 people who saw the 2-year-old’s bloody body stopped to help. The girl, named Yueyue, was then run over again by a light-duty truck.</p>
              <p>In Ontario, among other places, a Good Samaritan Act protects from liability those who aren’t health care professionals who perform first aid on a victim at the scene of an accident. In many European countries, such as France and Germany, Good Samaritan laws impose on citizens a duty to rescue.</p>
              <p>In China, neither type of law exists, says Pitman Potter, a law professor and Hong Kong Bank Chair in Asian Research at the University of British Columbia.</p>
              <p>“That kind of system dissuades people from helping,” Potter said. “People have been either sued by the family of the injured person or held responsible by local authorities for the harm, and so getting wrapped up in that is something people want to avoid.”</p>
              <p>In 2006, a Nanjing man who escorted an elderly woman to the hospital after she broke her leg was ordered to pay 40 per cent of the woman’s medical bill. The rationale: It was inconceivable that the man would go to such lengths to help the woman if he wasn’t somehow responsible for her injury.</p>
              <p>“The reasoning of the courts is that if you hadn’t done it, why would you have taken them to the hospital? No normal person would have taken them,” said Donald Clarke, a law professor at George Washington University who maintains a <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/china_law_prof_blog/"><span style="color: #0066a4;">blog</span></a> on Chinese law.</p>
              <p>Some Chinese sources also suggest the van’s driver left the girl to die because compensatory damages for death are often less than for a long-term injury. For the latter, damages might include medical expenses and income compensation for missed-work time over many years. Death involves a one-off payment.</p>
              <p>“If she is dead, I may pay only about 20,000 yuan ($3,180),” the van driver told the <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-10/17/content_13909773.htm"><span style="color: #0066a4;">China Daily</span></a> before he surrendered to police. “But if she is injured, it may cost me hundreds of thousands of yuan.”</p>
              <p>China introduced compulsory car insurance five years ago. But an <a href="http://topics.scmp.com/news/china-news-watch/article/Perverse-logic-of-drivers-in-hit-and-runs"><span style="color: #0066a4;">article</span></a> in Hong Kong’s <em>South China Morning Post</em> earlier this year said many drivers ignore the requirement.</p>
              <p>According to Potter, personal liability insurance is also uncommon, meaning it would be financially prudent for a driver to flee an accident.</p>
              <p>Some Chinese social media users have called the general indifference toward the girl a sign of a deteriorating moral society.</p>
              <p>“This society is seriously ill,” commented one poster on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo. “Even cats and dogs shouldn’t be treated so heartlessly.”</p>
              <p>Regardless, Yueyue’s mother <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/usa/china/2011-10/18/content_13920575.htm"><span style="color: #0066a4;">told the <em>China Daily</em></span></a> she will not judge those who didn’t help her daughter, who remains on life support in a Guangzhou hospital.</p>
              <p>“I bear no grudge and refuse to be disappointed by society,” she said.</p>

              Different countries have slighly different kind of duties. For instances in America, if you aggravate the injury, as we have seen, you will get sued. Most common law countries have some principles of 'duty to rescue' . France for exmaple imposes such duties in a stricter form.
              
              Back to being sued, it will depend on whether you are reasonably qualified or not. Lets say u are someone who have no first aid skills whatsoever, I would suggest alerting passerbys , call police etc.. or whatever Just dont directly try and ressucitate the injured person or move them.
              
              What was appaling in the video was that nobody did absolutely anything. Not even stopping to ask for help, calling passerby's to assist or calling the relevant authorities. 
              
              It will be a measure of your ability to the situation at hand. 
              
              You do not need any special skills to call for help or dial a number.
              
              I know its ridiculous when u get sued for helping someone. That just speaks volume about the particular person. If I get sued, so be it. While there is a possibility of losing money, on the other hand u get to destroy the persons character forever.

              <p>This isn't as bad as an earlier case where a motorist ran over a pedestrian in the country side (the pedestrian was still alive), but the motorist took out a knife to stab her to death. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Murderer says he has not decided if he will appeal the court's judgment</strong></p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">XI'AN - Yao Jiaxin, a university student who stabbed a young mother to death after knocking her down with his car in a traffic crash in October 2010, was sentenced to death on Friday by a court in Xi'an, capital of Northwest China's Shaanxi province.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Yao, 21, a junior at the Xi'an Conservatory of Music, ran into Zhang Miao while she was riding a bicycle. Yao was driving a Chevrolet Cruze at the time of the crash, which occurred at 10:30 pm on Oct 20. Fearing that Zhang would remember his license plate number and report him to the police, he stabbed her to death, according to the Intermediate People's Court of Xi'an.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">The court also handed down a life-long revocation of Yao's political rights and ordered Yao to pay 45,498.50 yuan ($6,983) in compensation to Zhang's family.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">After the stabbing, Yao drove away from the scene and, in his hurry to get away, injured two bystanders. In an interview with police on Oct 22, he denied he had committed the murder.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">The next day, though, he surrendered himself to police in the company of his parents and admitted to being responsible for the killing, the court said.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Yao said he resorted to murder because he feared the "peasant woman would be hard to deal with".</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">On the night of her death, Zhang, 26, the mother of a 2-year-old boy, was returning home from her temporary job as a cafeteria assistant at the Chang'an campus of Northwest University.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Police said the crash left her with a small fracture in her leg and other slight injuries.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Yao, after hitting the victim, did not try to help her but instead resorted to murder to silence her. That split-second decision made his crime heinous and eliminated a possibility that he would receive a lesser punishment, the court said on Friday.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">In China, criminals who turn themselves in are occasionally granted lesser punishments than those who do not.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">"The motive was extremely despicable...the conduct was extremely cruel...and the consequences are extremely serious," the court judgment said.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Yao, when asked if he wants to appeal the sentence, said he needs time to make such a decision.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;">Relatives of Yao and Zhang, as well as hundreds of journalists and students, were present for the judgment.</p>
