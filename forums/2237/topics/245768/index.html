Company spokespeople refused on Wednesday to give more information. Thompson said PetroChina is likely to have to do more drilling to confirm how much oil it can extract.<br><br>Economists say Chinese oil demand, driven by blistering economic growth that reached 10.7 percent in 2006, has strained world supplies and pushed up prices.<br><br>China became a net oil importer in the late 1990s and now is the world's No. 2 consumer after the United States, and consumption last year rose another 9.3 percent to 2.4 billion barrels. Imports in 2006 surged by 16.9 percent and accounted for 47 percent of consumption, while domestic production edged up just 1.7 percent. China has some 16 billion barrels of proven reserves, according to British oil company BP PLC.<br><br>China's leaders see reliance on imported energy, a large share of it from the politically volatile Middle East, as a strategic weakness.<br><br>They are trying to improve the poor efficiency of China's fuel-guzzling economy, which consumes several times as much energy per unit of output as Japan or the United States, while pushing state oil companies to find new domestic sources.<br><br>Chinese drillers have found several big gas fields, but no major oil sources since the mid-1990s, when blocks were found in Bohai Bay and in the Tarim Basin of the northwest's searing Taklamakan Desert.<br><br>Chinese oil companies have spent billions of dollars to secure oil and gas supplies abroad, making deals in areas as far-flung as Venezuela and Kazakhstan. Their willingness to deal with pariahs such as Iran and Sudan has caused friction with the U.S.<br><br>China is feuding with Japan over control of possible gas resources in disputed waters between the two nations. China and Russia are building pipelines to deliver Siberian gas to Chinese markets. At home, foreign consultants have taught Chinese oilmen how to find more and extract more from existing fields, said Jim Brock, an industry consultant.<br><br>"They're adopting a lot of new methods, revisiting a lot of old fields using methods that were not available 10 or 15 years ago," Brock said. But much of it is of mediocre quality and in rock formations that are difficult and expensive to tap, Brock said.</div>
