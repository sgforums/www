Three passports were then stripped of their data, which was loaded on to a laptop computer.<br><br>NO2ID said the Government had encrypted the data on the microchip to stop it being stolen - but had made basic mistakes.<br><br>Instead of producing a complicated code - the sequence of electronic numbers and letters which unlocks access to the information on the chip - they had simply applied a minimum set of rules published by the International Civil Aviation Authority.<br><br>These state the code should include the holder's passport number, date of birth and the document's expiry date - all of which would be clearly visible over the shoulder of somebody preparing to show it to a border guard.<br><br>The chip reader, once it knows the code, then has open access to steal the data which it contains.<br><br>Mr Laurie said: "The Home Office is using strong cryptography to prevent conversations between the passport and the reader being eavesdropped, but they are breaking one of the fundamental principles of encryption by using non-secret information published in the passport to create a 'secret key'.<br><br>"That is the equivalent of installing a solid steel front door to your house and putting the key under the mat."<br><br>Gus Hosein, an expert in information systems at the London School of Economics, said: "This is stupid technology. If chips can be cloned they will be used in counterfeit passports."<br><br>Phil Booth, of NO2ID, added: "The government is clearly derelict in its duty to protect the privacy and security of British citizens."<br><br>The Government opted to introduce the biometric passports after the US authorities - in the wake of September 11 - demanded new security measures on travel documents. Without the changes, any Briton wanting to travel to America would require a visa, causing chaos for millions of holidaymakers.<br><br>But it has since decided to make the passports the cornerstone of the ID card project, which is due to begin in 2008 or 2009.<br><br>As a result, the cost of a new passport has increased from only Â£42 in December 2005 to Â£66. The Home Office said cloning the chip 'doesn't matter'.<br><br>A spokesman said: "The information itself cannot be altered; the photo would still be the same so the copy would be of no use to an impersonator trying to use it fraudulently.<br><br>"Other than the photograph, which could be obtained easily by other means, they would gain no information that they did not already have - so the whole exercise would be utterly pointless."</div>
