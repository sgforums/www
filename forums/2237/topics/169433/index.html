It is quite feasible that H5N1 could mutate. The fact that it has taken some years should not lead you to believe that we are through the worst."<br><br>Nabarro was speaking in Phnom Penh during a one-day visit to Cambodia, which has seen at least four human bird flu deaths.<br><br>Difficulties stockpiling anti-virals<br><br>He warned that there are difficulties stockpiling enough anti-viral medicines to combat the illness.<br><br>"We all would like there to be much more stock of anti-viral medicines. We are in a bit of difficulty because the production capacity, particularly of (Tamiflu), is quite restricted," he said, adding that the UN was in regular talks with drug manufacturers to build up stocks.<br><br>The bird flu virus has killed more than 70 people through Asia since 2003 and resulted in the culling of millions of birds, dealing a huge blow to regional poultry industries.<br><br>World health bodies have warned that once the virus achieves the ability to transmit from human to human, millions of people could die.<br><br>Nabarro, who will also visit Vietnam and Indonesia, commended Cambodia for its effort to combat the virus.<br><br>"Cambodia has to be prepared for a possible pandemic and my understanding is that is happening," he said.<br><br>"I don't say everything is fine because there is still much more to be done. One of the reasons I came to this country was because I believe there are lessons from Cambodia ... that need to be shared elsewhere."<br><br>*******<br><br><span style="color: blue;">An epidemic of super flu is inevitable! </span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
