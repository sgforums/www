The IRGCÂ’s forces are ready to face any foreign and domestic threat in accordance with this doctrineÂ”, Safavi said.<br><br>The military chief said that there was good unity among IranÂ’s government, Majlis (Parliament), and judiciary to counter foreign threats. Â“Domestic and foreign enemies are worried of unity and steadfastness inside the country and try to create ethnic strife in various regions [in Iran], especially in the border regions, using various excuses including underdevelopmentÂ”, he said.<br><br>Safavi went on to say that the theory for a uni-polar globe had met defeat. Â“Taking into consideration the existence of power poles, including Europe and certain Asian countries, nations of the Islamic world can be defined as a world power pole. They can even create a Union of Islamic States that can defend their religious identity and supremacyÂ”.<br><br>Â“There has been an increase of Islamic awakening following the victory of the [1979] Islamic revolution in Iran. The worldÂ’s Muslims have experienced an example of a religious democracy in the Islamic Republic.<br><br>Â“The United States was after control of the worldÂ’ political, economic, and cultural leadership, but the Islamic revolution, Islamic awakening, and the events in Iraq and Afghanistan have helped in brining about AmericaÂ’s defeat in its goals.<br><br>Â“At present, AmericaÂ’s foreign policy boat has gotten stuck in mud in Iraq. This countryÂ’s leaders in Iraq neither have a plan to move forward nor a plan to move back. If in IraqÂ’s parliamentary elections AmericaÂ’s opponents come to power, the occupiers must accept their defeat and leave IraqÂ”.<br><br>Earlier this month, the IRGC chief declared that the U.S. would suffer a greater defeat in Iraq than it did in its war in Vietnam.<br><br>Safavi told a gathering of senior military commanders in the north-eastern city of Mashad that a future Iraq would be in the hands of Muslims.<br><br>Â“AmericaÂ’s uni-polar domination of the world has failedÂ”, Safavi said.<br><br>Referring to the ThursdayÂ’s parliamentary elections in Iraq, he said, Â“More than 50 percent of IraqÂ’s parliament will be comprised of committed and Islamic forces. The future of Iraq will be in the hands of MuslimsÂ”.<br><br><a href="http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4831" rel="nofollow">Iran and the West</a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Do you believe in World War 3?</div>
