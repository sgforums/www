State-owned media have reported only 19 people killed.<br><br>The opposition Democrat party has accused Thaksin of being slow to help flood victims because the southern region did not support his political party in the last election.<br><br>'The government has played down the situation and ignored the plight of the people in southern Thailand because the people in south did not vote for Thai Rak Thai (Thai Love Thai) party,' said Sathit Wongnongtoey, an opposition lawmaker.<br><br>This year's flooding is regarded as the country's worst in 40 years.<br><br>In Vietnam, the coastal Khanh Hoa province has been the worst-hit with 32 deaths.

The 4,000 people who were displaced were allowed back, with some finding homes damaged by water or mudslides.<br><br>UNDAUNTED RESIDENTS<br><br>In Forestville on Sunday, a two-lane road leading into neighboring Guerneville remained flooded, as were several streets in the area. But local residents appeared undaunted, going about their daily activities as the rain returned.<br><br>One couple walked their dog as they tried to survey the flood damage to houses and trailers. Another couple drove to the edge of a flooded street with their groceries, then hopped into a small boat and rowed to their house.<br><br>Risks remained, and one driver surveying the region had to brake to avoid a falling tree.<br><br>Authorities reported plucking some people from the waters, in some cases by carrying them out on their backs and in others by using a helicopter.<br><br>Some agricultural land was flooded, and officials said it was too early to assess material damage. Initial reports suggested that the flooding would not cause significant long-term damage to grape production because vineyards were not growing grapes in the winter season.<br><br>Forecasters called for between 2 and 4 inches of rain to fall across the wine country and Southern California beginning on Sunday.<br><br>"A couple inches of rain can really affect those areas in San Diego County that were hit by wildfires last year, causing flash floods," said Pete Weisser, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources.<br><br>Rain was expected during Pasadena's annual Rose Parade on Monday for the first time in a half century. The last time the "rain or shine" event saw any rain was in 1955.<br><br>A few seemed to welcome the inclement weather, however, with some surfers and windsurfers taking to the water across the coast to take advantage of high winds and heavy surf.</div>
