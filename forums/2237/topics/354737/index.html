              Singapore sends autopsy report to Davidâ€™s family
              
              The Jakarta Post , JAKARTA | Sat, 04/04/2009 11:48 AM | National
              
              Singaporeâ€™s Nanyang Technology University (NTU) has finally sent the autopsy report of David Hartanto Widjaja, an Indonesian student who died on its campus last month, to his family.
              
              â€œWe have received a scanned copy of the report by e-mail,â€� William Hartanto, Davidâ€™s older brother, told The Jakarta Post on Friday by telephone.
              
              He added that at first the university had offered to send the report by a courier service.
              
              â€œThe report mostly contained medical terms. Thus, we will seek professional help to decipher them,â€� William said, refusing to divulge the contents of the report.
              
              Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Teguh Wardoyo said his office received no notification regarding the report.
              
              â€œIt was Singaporeâ€™s initiative to send it directly to the family and we cannot object to that,â€� he said.
              
              On March 3, 2008, David was found dead after plunging from the third floor of a building on the NTU campus.
              
              Singaporean authorities believe that the young man slashed his wrist and jumped to his death after stabbing a professor.
              
              However, his family has refused to believe this story, saying that David was not the kind of person who would act violently towards another person or himself.
              
              â€œThere were no eyewitnesses who saw my brother stab the professor or jump from the third floor. The reports were all based on the professorâ€™s own words,â€� William said earlier this week.
              
              He added that when he flew to Singapore to claim the body, he saw no indication that his brother had tried to slash his wrist.
              
              â€œThere was no blood flowing from his hands or arms, but there was some on his backside and legs, so why did they say he slashed his wrists?â€� he said.
              
              William says that Singaporean authorities made it difficult for the family, who flew to Singapore a day after the incident, to see Davidâ€™s body.
              
              â€œThe scene was immediately cleared and we were not allowed to see the body of David right away,â€� he said.
              
              Two other deaths on the NTU campus came soon after Davidâ€™s. Zhou Zheng, a 24-year old researcher at the universityâ€™s laboratory was found hanging, dead, in an apartment on the campus.
              
              Not long after, 29 year-old Hu Kunlun, another researcher, was hit by a car on his way to the campus. Both researchers were Chinese citizens.
              
              The incident has caused a stir among Indonesians, with conspiracy theories being circulated and talk of revolutionary technology being invented by the 21-year old David.
              
              Blogger Iwan Piliang has suggested that the confiscation of Davidâ€™s computer and cellular phone by the Singaporean police proves that Davidâ€™s thesis, which involved three-dimensional face recognition technology, was of high economic value.
              
              â€œThere may have been people with vested interests behind Davidâ€™s death because of his research findings ,â€� he told journalists earlier this week.
              
              Yayan Mulyana, spokesperson for the Indonesian Embassy in Singapore, said that the embassy was yet to receive the autopsy report.
              
              â€œWe will ensure that the investigation is well conducted and that Davidâ€™s family will obtain justice in this case,â€� he said. (dis)

Just ask, and they should be able to see the body.</p>
              <p>The cremation of the body is buffling... why not just return the body to the family, and let them do what they want with it... or they are wary the family will do things to the body, and destroy or create false evidence?</p>

              <p>Well, dun u think the family would have asked to see the whole body when they were only shown neck upwards? :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yeh, the body should have been left to the family for a proper funeral, maybe air flown back to jakarta.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure how great an invention it was but it was mentioned on Indo TV. I'm not an engine grad but my friend told me it was something like something with 8 video cameras. haha.</p>

              <p>Anyway, this inquiry in Singapore, i dun think the family will get much facts. This whole thing is too fishy.</p>

              <p>I hope if any fishy business is involved, swift justice will be delivered.</p>
              <p>In order not to bring about a bad name to singapore , and particularly the education sector, they need to do investigations into the matter and find out the truth</p>
              <p>if they dont do it, they will get negative publicity from all the rumours</p>
              <p>If they did it, at least it shows that rule of law is fillowed and justice being delivered but still get a negative publicity</p>
              <p>Either way they are farked. Just choose the most logical choice.</p>

              <p>well, i can imagine at the morgue, the dead body was covered with the white sheet, like that of the TV show. Than the guy in charge pull the sheet to reveal the face. the mother and father see le break down and cry, and they acknowledge that this is their son, and than they leave the room.</p>
              <p>If that is the case, than the parents didn't ask to see the whole body, the guy also don't reveal the whole body (seems  very unprofessional to do that right?) so only the neck up was shown.</p>
              <p>I find it hard to imagine that the guy show just the face, and when the parents ask to see the whole body. the guy says no, and forcefully usher them out of the room. That is way way too fishy.</p>
              <p>How the actual situation was, have to ask the parents, i don't know how it went.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the invention... how it works is not that important bah, but what it does. Having 8 cameras sounds cool, but what is the point of having 8 camera? is it a motion capture invention? If i don't hear more news about the invention, it is probably not that impressive bah....</p>
