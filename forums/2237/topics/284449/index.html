Â– making it exactly 6,009 last Monday.<br><br>In the 1650s, an Anglican bishop named James Ussher published his "Annals of the World," subtitled, "The Origin of Time, and Continued to the Beginning of the Emperor Vespasian's Reign and the Total Destruction and Abolition of the Temple and Commonwealth of the Jews." First published in Latin, it consisted of more than 1,600 pages.<br><br>The book, now published in English for the first time, is a favorite of homeschoolers and those who take ancient history seriously. It's the history of the world from the Garden of Eden to the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70.<br><br>(Story continues below)<br><br>Of course, there will be those who disagree with Ussher's calculations of time Â– especially evolutionists who need billions of years to explain their theory of how life sprang from non-life and mutated from one-celled animals into human beings.<br><br>Ussher's arrival at the date of Oct. 23 was determined based on the fact that most peoples of antiquity, especially the Jews, started their calendar at harvest time. Ussher concluded there must be good reason for this, so he chose the first Sunday following autumnal equinox.<br><br>Although the autumnal equinox is Sept. 21 today, that is only because of historical calendar-juggling to make the years come out right.<br><br>If you think this is a startling fact Â– an actual date for Creation Â– you haven't seen anything until you've pored through the rest of Ussher's "Annals of the World." It's a classic history book for those who believe in the Bible Â– and a compelling challenge for those who don't.<br><br>The new edition of "Annals" is one of the most significant publishing events of the 21st century.<br><br>In this masterful and legendary volume, commissioned by Master Books to be updated from the 17th-century original Latin manuscript to modern English and made available to the general public, is the fascinating history of the ancient world from the Genesis creation through the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple.<br><br>Find out:<br><br>* Why was Julius Caesar kidnapped in 75 B.C.?<br><br>* Why did Alexander the Great burn his ships in 326 B.C.?<br><br>* What really happened when the sun "went backward" as a sign to Hezekiah?<br><br>* What does secular history say about the darkness at the Crucifixion?<br><br>Ussher traveled throughout Europe, gathering much information from the actual historical documents. Many of these documents are no longer available, having been destroyed since the time of his research.<br><br>Integrating biblical history (around 15 percent of the text is from the Bible) with secular sources, Ussher wrote this masterpiece. Considered not only a literary classic, but also an accurate reference, "The Annals of the World" was so highly regarded for its preciseness that the timeline from it was included in the margins of many King James Version Bibles throughout the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.<br><br>"The Annals of the World" is a necessary addition to any church library, pastor's library, or any library Â– public or personal. The entire text has been updated from 17th-century English to present-day vernacular in a five-year project commissioned by Master Books. Containing many human-interest stories from the original historical documents collected by Ussher, this is more than just a history book Â– it's a work of history.<br><br>Special features:<br><br>* Important literary work that has been inaccessible in book form for over 300 years<br><br>* Includes CD of Ussher's Chronology of the World Â– full of colored charts, graphs, timelines, and much, much more<br><br>* Translated into modern English for the first time<br><br>* Traces world history from creation through A.D. 70<br><br>* Over 10,000 footnotes from the original text have been updated to references from works in the Loeb Classical Library by Harvard Press<br><br>* Over 2,500 citations from the Bible and the Apocrypha<br><br>* Ussher's original citations have been checked against the latest textual scholarship<br><br>* One of history's most famous and well-respected historians<br><br>* Spent over five years researching and writing this book<br><br>* Entered college at age 13<br><br>* Received his master's degree at age 18<br><br>* Was an expert in Semitic languages<br><br>* Buried in Westminster Abbey<br><br>About the book:<br><br>* Made of the highest quality material: Smyth sewn, gold-gilded edges, foil embossing on front, back, and spine<br><br>* Cover presented in the style of classic literary works<br><br>* Packaged in a beautiful box for display purposes and durability<br><br>* 8 appendixes<br><br>* Fully indexed<br><br>* Paragraphs numbered<br><br>This is one of the most important literary, historical and Christian works you'll ever own, a treasure for any home library. It's a must for your homeschool library.<br><br>For generations, this classic work was considered part of the essential reading for educated people. Now you can read it Â– in English.<br><br>"Annals" is now available in softcover, too.<br><br>In addition, consider puchasing the new, specially packaged editions of "Annals" and "Adams' Chart of History" -- available both in hardcover collector's editions and softcover for notes and everyday use.<br><br>As a very special added bonus, when you purchase "The Annals of the World" from WorldNetDaily's online store, you can also receive Â– FREE Â– three issues of our acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine, which many have called the best news magazine in the world. That's a $22.50 free value! (Offer good in the U.S. only.) Watch for the free offer during checkout.</div>
