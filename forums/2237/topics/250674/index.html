But now autonomous machines such as toys and vacuum cleaners which cover the room without needing any human instructions or guidance are being introduced.<br><br>Manufacturers are exploring ways to make robotic toys look after children, which experts say will lead to child-minding machines able to monitor youngsters, transmitting their progress to the parents by onboard cameras.<br><br>Scroll down for more<br><br>In Japan, scientists are producing robots to act as companions for the elderly and check their heart rate.<br><br>Alan Winfield, professor of electronic engineering at the University of the West of England in Bristol, said yesterday it would not be long before technological advances made it possible for robots to be introduced in the home, as well as prisons and the police service.<br><br>Speaking at a debate on robot ethics at the London Science Media Centre, he said: "It is highly likely that in a number of years robots will be employed both for child-minding and care for the elderly.<br><br>"But the danger is that we will sleepwalk into a situation where we accept a large number of autonomous robots in our lives without being sure of the consequences.<br><br>"The outcome could be that when given a choice the robot could make the wrong decision and someone gets hurt. They can go wrong just like a motor car can.<br><br>"We should be aware of the future that we are letting ourselves in for. We need to look at their safety and reliability."<br><br>His warning echoes the hit Hollywood sci-fi film I, Robot, starring Will Smith, in which a slave robot with a mind of its own causes chaos.<br><br>Noel Sharkey, professor of computer science at Sheffield University, said: "Technology is increasing at an incredible rate.<br><br>"My main worry is that these autonomous robots could be introduced very quickly. We need to have an informed public debate now before that happens."<br><br>The biggest advances in robots in recent years have been as weapons of war. The U.S. military is developing battlefield robots which will be given the ability to decide when to use lethal force.<br><br>At the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, a battlefield robot is being developed which will use radar data and intelligence feeds to make decisions based on a set of ethical rules, which has been compared to an artificial conscience.<br><br>The Korean government is looking to create robotic armed border guards as part of a Â£ 51million investment in robotics.</div>
