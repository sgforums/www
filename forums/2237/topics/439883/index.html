              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>NEW YORK: Raj 
              Rajaratnam was a top student, brilliant trader, then Wall Street's 
              ultimate whizz kid, and, by all accounts, a good and loving man. But he 
              was also a cheat.<br><br>And on Thursday, that one flaw in his 
              glittering record caught up with him. A man used to counting dollars by 
              the millions and billions had a new number to contend with: 11 years 
              behind bars for insider trading.<br><br>It was the biggest sentence ever
               in a US court for insider trading, which New York federal Judge Richard
               Holwell called "a virus that needs to be eradicated."<br><br>The sentence might have been higher had Holwell not decided to take into account Raj's need for an "imminent" kidney transplant.<br><br>Raj, 54, was told he would be allowed to remain free until November28, when he must surrender to start his sentence.<br><br>But
               as he walked out of the Manhattan courthouse, there was no illusion 
              about his disgrace: a mob of news photographers pushed and jostled, one 
              of them falling on his back, as they rammed their lenses in the face of 
              the former big shot.<br><br>Raj was born in the Sri Lankan capital 
              Colombo and attended England's University of Sussex, where he studied 
              engineering. He put that analytical mind to good use at the prestigious 
              Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 
              1983 with an MBA.<br><br>From there -- already well connected with other
               Wharton graduates -- he rose rapidly up the Wall Street ladder, with a 
              specialty in high-tech stocks.<br><br>And at the age of 34, he started his own fund.<br><br>In
               1997, the Galleon group was launched. The hedge fund quickly amassed 
              accounts through investments from Raj's ever-growing circle of contacts 
              and friends.<br><br>Raj appeared unstoppable, becoming emblematic of the
               new hedge fund culture, amassing US$1.5 billion in personal wealth, 
              according to Forbes, and managing US$7 billion at Galleon at its peak.<br><br>But
               there was more than brilliance and a huge team of researchers behind 
              that success. In 2008, prosecutors and the FBI began listening to 
              wire-tapped phones used by Raj and associates in Wall Street's biggest 
              insider trading probe.<br><br>What they found was shocking -- and might well have stayed secret if not for the recorded phone conversations.<br><br>Raj's
               job was to develop contacts and research companies, then read into the 
              future of the market. Instead, he was being told the future before it 
              happened.<br><br>Using his network, he discovered market-moving news 
              before it had been made public, whether it was involving Goldman Sachs, 
              Intel, Google or other big companies, then traded on the supposedly 
              secret information and made tens of millions of dollars.<br><br>Prosecutors said these were not mere slip-ups in Raj's ethics, but part of a careful, coordinated strategy.<br><br>Raj
               was "born into privilege" and "rose to the top of the securities 
              industry," prosecutor Reed Brodsky said at the sentencing. Yet he ended 
              as "the modern face of illegal insider trading."<br><br>There was a 
              better side to the man everyone knew as Raj. In a world where the super 
              rich routinely give money to charities, the convicted insider trader 
              apparently really meant to help, whether it was victims of the Sri 
              Lankan Civil War, of an earthquake in Pakistan or of the 9/11 attacks.<br><br>"The defendant's response to and care for the less privileged go considerably beyond the norm," Holwell said.<br><br>But
               even if his sentence is less than half the maximum demanded by 
              prosecutors, Raj's fate will serve as a grim example to others on Wall 
              Street tempted to skirt the rules.<br><br>"No one here or anyone running a hedge fund would wish to trade places with Mr Raj," his own lawyer said.<br><br>- AFP/ck</span></span></p>
