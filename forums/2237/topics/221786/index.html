You look at it, and you see that it's a four-legged machine. But the robot itself doesn't know that. All it knows is that it could be a snake, it could be a tree, it could have six legs," Lipson said in an interview.<br><br>Lipson said the robot used various movements of its joints, first to generate hypotheses and then to formulate an accurate conception of itself.<br><br>The researchers then tested the robot's ability to adapt to new situations--in this case injury--by shortening one of its legs. "The robot knows something's wrong," Lipson said.<br><br>Animals can compensate for injury by changing movements, like limping to favor an injured leg. Machines can be programmed to react to a problem in a certain way. But when they are damaged in unexpected ways, they usually are doomed.<br><br>This plucky robot responded by generating on its own a new concept of its structure, accurately sensing it had been altered, and then devising a new way to walk using a different gait to compensate for the injury.<br><br>The robot's smarts, awareness of itself and ability to adapt on its own separates it from its mechanical brethren.<br><br>The study was published in the journal Science.<br><br>"We don't really think this is self-consciousness, which is a robot thinking about itself thinking," Lipson said. "But I do think it is moving in the direction of consciousness, like a cat, that kind of level."<br><br>Aside from contributing to a philosophical debate, the research has practical implications--giving hope to people who envision sending robots that can adapt to unforeseen circumstances to explore other worlds or the ocean floor.<br><br>"There is a need for planetary robotic rovers to be able to fix things on their own," Bongard said in a statement. "Robots on other planets must be able to continue their mission without human intervention in the event they are damaged and cannot communicate their problem back to Earth."<br><br>Christoph Adami of the Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences in Claremont, California, wrote a commentary accompanying the research titled, "What Do Robots Dream Of?"--an allusion to science fiction writer Philip Dick's 1968 novel, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"<br><br>Adami described how a robot like this one might perform in unknown territory, exploring the landscape and then "dreaming" of new methods to overcome obstacles it had encountered.<br><br>"And even though the robots...seem to prefer to dream about themselves rather than electric sheep, they just may have unwittingly helped us understand what dreams are for," he said.<br><br>Reminded of malicious robots and computers turning on their human masters in movies like "The Terminator" and "2001: A Space Odyssey," Lipson was not worried.<br><br>"We just pull the plug out of the robot. That's all," Lipson said. "There are more immediate things to worry about than to worry about that."</div>
