              <p><strong>The Malaysian Insider, 22 Sep 2009</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Maybank Singapore passes on savings to staff </strong></span><br> <br> SINGAPORE, Sept 22 — I<span style="color: red;"><strong>nstead of pocketing
              everything, Maybank Singapore is passing on part of the savings from
              the Jobs Credit Scheme to its unionised staff in extra bonuses and
              training.<br> </strong></span> <br> Some 400 of its unionised employees — or slightly more than a third of
              its 1,300 local staff — will get 0.5 to 1.5 months’ more in bonuses,
              depending on their performance.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>This is on top of the 2.5 months bonus payout that
              banks in Singapore, including Maybank, have agreed with unions in the
              banking sector.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>With the additional payments, the bonuses of
              unionised staff at Maybank Singapore will match those of the bank’s
              non-unionised staff and executives.</strong></span><br> <br> The latter are getting an average 3.5 months’ bonus, which is
              “competitive compared to the market”, according to Maybank’s local
              human resource head Wong Keng Fye.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The extra bonuses to be paid out to the unionised
              staff add up to half the S$1.3 million (RM3.2 million) Maybank
              Singapore got from the Jobs Credit Scheme for its unionised staff. The
              rest of the money will be deployed for staff training.<br> </strong></span> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Maybank Singapore is believed to
              be the only bank here to use the savings from the Jobs Credit Scheme to
              dish out higher bonuses to unionised staff in the current economic
              downturn.</strong></span><br> <br> In the manufacturing sector, Murata Electronics reported last month
              that it shared some of the cash gains from the Jobs Credit Scheme with
              its workers in Singapore, offering them a one-off bonus payment of
              S$300.<br> <br> This came after the Japanese disk-drive maker revised its annual
              earnings forecast from a loss of 8 billion yen (RM303 million) to a
              loss of one billion yen.<br> <br> Murata’s managing director Masatoshi Koike, who indicated orders have
              risen in recent months after dropping to as low as 15 per cent at one
              point, said schemes such as Jobs Credit have been timely in helping
              companies cope with the recession and minimising layoffs.<br> <br> Introduced by the government in January, the S$4.5 billion Jobs Credit
              Scheme is intended to help employers in Singapore save costs and jobs
              in the face of declining business.<br> <br> Maybank Singapore has continued to post financial growth despite the
              downturn. Its operating profits here rose 35.6 per cent for the
              financial year ending June 2009.<br> <br> But the bank’s Wong said the extra bonus is not just a reward for the workers’ contribution to the good financial results.<br> <br> “Beyond financials, the management of the bank recognised the efforts
              of staff in supporting some of the initiatives that the bank had
              undertaken to excel in the area of service excellence and worklife
              balance,” he said.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>This year, Maybank Singapore became the first in
              the industry to achieve triple certification for business excellence in
              quality, service and developing talent.</strong></span><br> <br> “Maybank was also the only bank that received accolades for its series
              of pro-family and work-life initiatives in the workplace by clinching
              the Work-Life Excellence Award 2008 for the second time,” Wong said.<br> <br> Staff turnover at Maybank Singapore has also been consistently below the industry average.<br> <br> -------------------<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Latest updates @ Singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com<br> <br> 1.
