Look Lazerlordz, I do not have much to go on here. You cannot force me to discredit the judge based on what you and I do not know. If we take liberties then we can say that what happened may be that she went along with him thinking he was a good boy and then she got date-raped. This happens even in the West. The difference in the law is that in the West they will say the woman was not at fault because she didn't know he had the intent. In Saudi Arabia they say all gender relations are subject to the sexual event, therefore the object of sexual desire must guard against the possibility of unwanted sexual contact. Do you want me to choose the former over the latter?<br></div></blockquote>Look, guarding against sexual contact is not the same as guarding against RAPE.<br>RAPE = Sex against one's will.<br><br>What part of that do you fail to understand?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Frankly, I can't believe anyone would enshrine "invitation to rape" in a male-dominated society, and thus telling the world that men are unable to control their baser urges and need women to be locked up for something that is the problem of the men.</div>
