The answer is that it people have become more self confident in their ignorance. This is a sad side effect of the proliferation of American consumer culture.<br><br>Non-Eastern cultures differ from Singapore where ladies can walk about half naked and no one except for the Bangladeshis bats an eyelid. It is a well known fact that north asian men are somewhat more sexually repressed in their mindset wrt sexual relations with their female counterparts. In fact, one can say that in some Asian cultures, men and women are treated almost equally and shown the same amount of interest. This of course cuts both ways. Why this is so, whether its due to some kind of culturally derived sexual repression or its genetics (or its maybe the diet?) I cannot comment but suffice to say that it is a fact that Asian males generally have lesser tendency to impose themselves sexually on the female. That's why probably its so hard for Asian men to get blowjobs..haha. <br><br>This fact can of course lead to problems. North European/American societies and Middle-Eastern societies address this issue differently and of course one can debate the various social costs and benefits of either cultural attitudes towards the issue of gender and sex. IN SAUDI SOCIETY, the CULTURAL NORM is for there to be strict gender segregation among non-married couples. Maybe the Saudi elites really don't like Western sexploitation culture, or maybe they're afraid they'll lose one of their 4 wives. I dunno. Anyway, in SUCH A SOCIETY, for a woman to be in the situation of the victim, shows that the woman had put considerable effort to bypass many of the barriers put in place to segregate the sexes. Hence, the real story that we can see from the verdict was that the woman was a prostitute who got raped.<br><br>Now such a verdict may not be suitable here of course, where prostitution is seen as a social service and the vices are treated with economic pragmatism. The thing to remember of course is that when you want to understand what happens somewhere else, you need to see the context in which that event occured. CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THIS PEOPLE? Reading shallowly into what happens in Saudi Arabia and trying to impose some kind of spin on cultural superiority is well, quite Americanish, and I'm sure our gentle readers (readers get it?) do not want to be that.<br></div></blockquote>sorrie yo, i think most of us here are sufficeintly intellectual than be consumed by your bullsh$t.. tis has nothing to do with americanism by the way..most european/asian/north america countries is probably shocked by this outcome of judgment..<br><br>try harder next time.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Or is it that there is no correct answer and it depends on culture?<br><br>This thread got me thinking. There was once my friend was discussing about the woman's charter and he said it was a joke. That the woman's charter was made to make the law "more fair" to them. The charter was designed to make the men look like they're always at fault.<br><br>I didn't fully agree coz I'm not a lawyer. But it got me thinking. We are raised in a society that women is considered the weaker species and men must protect them. And wrong doing between the man and woman, the man is usually at fault.<br><br>Does this have anything to do with our judgement in this case. Are we really treating men and women as equal?<br><br>The Truth is... I don't know... I'm getting a headache just thinking about it. (-_-)"</div></blockquote>we are talking about a rape here, where does equality comes in ? ... did the woman rape the men, or the other way around ? ...<br><br>are you trying to say that the suggestiveness of women, equates to an invitation to rape, and thus makes the rapists any less culpable ? ... are you saying that Oh, she got into the car with me, she's asking for it ? ... or "Oh, she's dressed so sexily, so slutty ... I couldn't help myself ? " ....<br><br>and if you agree with the proximity offense judgement, then answer my question that I asked you, do you have a girlfriend ? ... or when you have one, are you going to go out with her as a couple ? ...</div>
