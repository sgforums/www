These issues are for the Scholars of Islam to investigate and to sort out.<br><br>We have no details on the whole case or what happened in it.<br><br>However, in Islam, the victim of a crime such as rape, should be treated in most respect and never hurt or punished in anyway. It is not from Shari'ah to punish victims or humiliate them.<br><br>Obviously this has nothing to do with religion, this behavior results from old alien bedouin cultural traditions that they have mixed up with religion to make it legitimate.<br><br>Only those who commit the crimes should be punished<br><br>Yet they're not punishing her for being raped, they're punishing her for being alone with a man she wasn't related to.<br>That itself falls under shariah (as shariah is a broad spectrum).<br><br>The men were convicted of kidnapping but not rape, because the judges seem to think that women who go out with men they're not related to (no matter how innocent the outing is), should be raped.<br><br>The "strange man" she was alone with (i.e. her ex-boyfriend) was not the rapist... but both the guy and the girl were raped by another gang.<br><br>That woman's ex-boyfriend was also raped by that gang and he is also being punished with lashes, so I wouldn't really consider it a feminist issue (since both the man and woman are facing similar charges). Both of them are not being punished because they were raped, but because of another silly reason about them being alone together just before they were raped. Even most Saudi lawyers consider the ruling to be outrageous.<br><br>The men were sentenced comparable to American standards, meaning they were basically given a slap on the wrist.<br>Perhaps we should petition.<br><br>-----------------<br><br>King Abdullah and the Saudi regime are big friends of people in power, they control the largest oil reserves in the world.<br><br>The vast majority of Muslims are Sunni, not Wahhabi. The Wahhabism that Saudi Arabia adheres to was a reform movement that originated in the 18th century.<br><br>Wahhabism was never "the strongest faction within Sunni Islam", and most orthodox Sunnis do not even consider Wahhabism a branch of Sunni Islam. Wahhabis make up only a small minority of the global Muslim population, and they only rule a few Muslim countries in the Arabian Peninsula (mainly Saudi Arabia) and have some limited power in East Africa. Most other Muslim countries in the world follow the school of Sunni, with the exception of Iran and a few other Shia countries.<br><br>Anyway, Wahhabism should be eridicated. Muslims (Sufi, Shia) have been victims of it, but that isn't so strange, since the founder of it is EXTREMELY INTOLERANT  of heretics (Shia's &amp; Sufi's).</div>

Looking at the issue from a cultural perspective, this focus is not surprising. In nearly every culture of the world, womenÂ’s sexual morality appears to be a particularly favorite subject for slander, gossip, and insult.26 The tendency of patriarchal societies, in fact, is to view a womanÂ’s chastity as central to the honor of her family, especially of the men in her family. For example, under the British common law (the law in Pakistan before the Hudood Ordinance), rape was a crime punishable against men, to be lodged by the husband of the woman raped against the man who violated her (Hale 1778, 637-39).27 The womanÂ’s place was apparently on the sidelines of a prosecution by her husband against her rapist.<br><br>This cultural phenomenon Â– that a familyÂ’s honor lies in the virtue of its womenÂ–exists in many countries today; Pakistan is one of them. Studies indicate that in Pakistan, when women are jailed for long periods of time on charges of zina, their families and friends are reluctant to help or even visit them, "as accusation of zina is a serious dishonor" (Patel 1991, 27). Even more disturbing, suicide is perceived as the honorable solution to the humiliation, especially sexual violation is involved. For example, when Khursheed Begum was raped in 1992,28 her husband and son "wish[ed] she had committed suicide," even after human rights activists explained to them that the rape was not her fault (Scroggins 1992, A10). This attitude lends itself easily to manipulation and the development of a tribal attitude where womenÂ’s bodies become tools for revenge by men against men. Indeed, increasingly in Pakistan, "[i]n cases of revenge against the male members of [a] family, instances have come to light where their women are violated" (Patel 1991, 36).29 Even within a family, physically harming (even killing) women for alleged infidelity or some other embarrassment to the familyÂ—-often by some sort of burningÂ–is an unfortunate tradition in the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent.30 And, as world human rights organizations have documented, "honor killings" of women suspected of sexual indiscretion, carried out by a male family member, are unfortunately not limited to this part of the world.31<br></span><br><br>http://www.crescentlife.com/articles/social%20issues/rape_laws.htm[/i]</div>
