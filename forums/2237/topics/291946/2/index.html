The judge concluded she was guilty, hence the punishment. I defer to his authority on this matter because he is an embedded scholar of law. On closer analysis, I concur that I was wrong in stating that he concluded she was a prostitute. That was how I read his verdict. It may likely be that his verdict was based on the crime of "close proximity with non-close male relations", which I did not consider a crime on first reading. I concur with this verdict because events upheld the premise the law.<br></div></blockquote>Our premise here is that the law in question violates the basic right of a woman to have protection from rape.

You cannot force me to discredit the judge based on what you and I do not know. If we take liberties then we can say that what happened may be that she went along with him thinking he was a good boy and then she got date-raped. This happens even in the West. The difference in the law is that in the West they will say the woman was not at fault because she didn't know he had the intent. In Saudi Arabia they say all gender relations are subject to the sexual event, therefore the object of sexual desire must guard against the possibility of unwanted sexual contact. Do you want me to choose the former over the latter?<br></div>
