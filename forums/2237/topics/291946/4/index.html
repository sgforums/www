            <div class='col-md body'>Andrew: Exactly. Powerful men should not rape but sometimes, they do. So how to prevent? Lets put it this way. In the West, the law is designed to create a reality. That reality is designed by the desires of the power elite and any who break that law will be punished. Hence, the people must live up to the law. The President must not rape. If rape = punish.<br><br>In Saudi Arabia, there is that element there too, but there is also an element of laws that address the basal condition of things and try to find the best way to prevent the crime from even occuring. The President must not rape. The President can have 4 wives. The President's words must be obeyed. People must not entice the president. blah blah blah. If President still rape = punish. Actually, in the West they have these things too but they're called State secrets.<br><br>Which is better? To each his own I guess and God will sort them out.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As I have mentioned before, the Islamic rules are very biased against the female gender.<br><br>Ask yourself this qn. Who wrote the Qu'ran? Who set the Islamic rules? of course is Men. (dun tell me Qu'ran just drop from heaven, given by God Allah himself)<br><br>As such, in the ancient time, they used religious laws as means to rule over the females. It is very often to see laws that are discriminative to the women in Arab Islamic laws. Men use religion to justify all kinds of unjust actions. Since they realize they have no right to impose their will on others, they claim that god commanded it.<br><br>In this case, you have to ask yourself again why a rape victim is punished more severely than the gang rapers. Cos the Islamic law put 99% of the blame on women. Men rape becos women wore too sexy clothes? Becos they are in the same cars as unrelated men?<br><br>So funny logic. then guess Arab men (even other Muslims eg in Malaysia) have no self constraint at all?<br><br>Talking about unjust act, do you all still remember in 2005 (I'm not sure also), there was a big fire in a all-female school in Saudi Arabia.<br><br>But the Saudi religious police refused to let the female students out of the school simply because the dress code. The students were not covered from top to bottom. In the end, most of the female students died in the fire tragedy just because the religious police deny their escapes.<br><br>So to those moronic idiotic brainless Saudi religious police, female lives are worthed much lesser than some stupid discriminative Arabic Islamic dress code. Screw those retards.</div>

Perhaps, there is a greater logic that is at work that we do not understand. It is good therefore to understand events within the context at which they occur. Only after sufficient study can we pronounce judgment. Mutual respect is a good basis for friendly relations.<br></div></blockquote>which part you still don't understand ? ....<br><br>it's not about cultural relativity here ! ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>there is right logic, and there is wrong logic ... you can either have your own ethical stand and stand by it, or you can hide behind the cloak of "cultural relativity" and agree with anything ... in this case we're not talking about the death penalty or even Terrorism here ... we're talking about rape ... and the victim ...<br><br>if it's the former, I think you need serious psychiatric help .... if it's the latter, then you're just trying to be an intellectual bullshitter who likes to spout what you think is fashionable ...<br><br>first you imply that she's asking for it, then you say that it's all relative to the society, then you say that you don't agree with the punishment, but you agree with the judge ? ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .... do you agree that it's right, or wrong ? you still haven't answered question yet ...<br><br>would you like to edit your post about her "being a prostitute" ? ... cos that is so telling about you ....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So we can draw two conclusions:-<br><br>(1) There are some forum members that believe that in a rape situation, the men is 100% at fault and it doesn't matter what the girl did.<br><br>(2) There are some forum members who believe that if there is a possibility that the chances of rape can be increased and the woman took that risk, the woman is at fault as well.<br><br>So who is correct? Or is it that there is no correct answer and it depends on culture?<br><br>This thread got me thinking. There was once my friend was discussing about the woman's charter and he said it was a joke. That the woman's charter was made to make the law "more fair" to them. The charter was designed to make the men look like they're always at fault.<br><br>I didn't fully agree coz I'm not a lawyer. But it got me thinking. We are raised in a society that women is considered the weaker species and men must protect them. And wrong doing between the man and woman, the man is usually at fault.<br><br>Does this have anything to do with our judgement in this case. Are we really treating men and women as equal?<br><br>The Truth is... I don't know... I'm getting a headache just thinking about it. (-_-)"</div>
