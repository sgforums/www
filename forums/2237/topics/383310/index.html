              <p>By 
                  <a class="author" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=y&amp;authornamef=Tony+Rennell">Tony Rennell</a><br> Last updated at 10:55 PM on 21st November 2009</p>
              <p>Sarah Robinson was just a teenager when World War II broke out.</p>
              <p>She endured the Blitz, watching for fires during Luftwaffe air raids armed with a bucket of sand.</p>
              <p>Often she would walk ten miles home from work in the blackout, with bombs falling around her.</p>
              <p>As soon as she turned 18, she joined the <a class="inline-link" rel="tag" href="http://explore.dailymail.co.uk/organisations/royal_navy">Royal Navy</a> to do her bit for the war effort.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/20/article-1229643-00221AC500000258-61_468x531.jpg" alt="Soldiers" width="468" height="531">
              <p class="imageCaption">Some WWII soldiers, and families of those lost
                  in the war, have complained society today shows no sign of the effort
                  they made to help</p>
              </div>
              <p>Hers was a small part in a huge, history-making enterprise, and her
                  contribution epitomises her generation's sense of service and
                  sacrifice.</p>
              <p>Nearly 400,000 Britons died. Millions more were scarred by the experience, physically and mentally.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But was it worth it? Her answer - and the answer of many of her contemporaries, now in their 80s and 90s - is a resounding No. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They despise what has become of the Britain they once fought to save. It's not our country any more, they say, in sorrow <cite>and </cite>anger.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Sarah harks back to the days when 'people kept the laws and were
                  polite and courteous. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We didn't have much money, but we were contented
                  and happy.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'People whistled and sang. There was still the <a class="inline-link" rel="tag" href="http://explore.dailymail.co.uk/locations/countries/united_kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, our country, which we had fought for, our freedom, democracy. But where is it now?!'</strong></span></span></p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/20/article-1229643-074D1755000005DC-949_233x423.jpg" alt="Royal Navy" width="233" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption">Sarah Robinson, who joined the Royal Navy when she was 18, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>says the Britain she once knew no longer exists</strong></span></span></p>
              </div>
              <p>The feelings of Sarah and others from this most selfless generation
                  about the modern world have been recorded by a Tyneside writer,
                  33-year-old Nicholas Pringle.</p>
              <p>Curious about his grandmother's generation and what they did
                  in the war, he decided three years ago to send letters to local
                  newspapers across the country asking for those who lived through the
                  war to write to him with their experiences.</p>
              <p>He rounded off
                  his request with this question: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'Are you happy with how your country
                  has turned out? What do you think your fallen comrades would have made
                  of life in 21st-century Britain?'</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>What is extraordinary about the 150 replies he received, which
                  he has now published as a book, is their vehement insistence that those
                  who made the ultimate sacrifice in the war would now be turning in
                  their graves.</p>
              <p>There is the occasional bright spot - one
                  veteran describes Britain as 'still the best country in the world' -
                  but the overall tone is one of profound disillusionment.</p>
              <p>'I sing no song for the once-proud country that spawned me,'
                  wrote a sailor who fought the Japanese in the Far East, 'and I wonder
                  why I ever tried.'</p>
              <p>'My patriotism has gone out of the window,' said another ex-serviceman.</p>
              <p>In the Mail this week, <a class="inline-link" rel="tag" href="http://explore.dailymail.co.uk/people/brown_gordon">Gordon Brown</a> wrote about 'our debt of dignity to the war generation'.</p>
              <p>But
                  the truth that emerges from these letters is that the survivors of that
                  war generation have nothing but contempt for his government.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They feel, in a word that leaps out time and time again, 'betrayed'.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>New Labour, said one ex-commando who took part in the disastrous
                  Dieppe raid in which 4,000 men were lost, was 'more of a shambles than
                  some of the actions I was in during the war, and that's saying
                  something!'</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He added: 'Those comrades of mine who never made it back would be appalled if they could see the world as it is today.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>'They would wonder what happened to the Brave New World they fought so damned hard for.'</p>
              <p>Nor can <a class="inline-link" rel="tag" href="http://explore.dailymail.co.uk/people/cameron_david">David Cameron</a> take any comfort from the elderly.</p>
              <p>His
                  'hug a hoodie' advice was scorned by a generation of brave men and
                  women now too scared, they say, to leave their homes at night.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Immigration tops the list of complaints.</strong></span></span></p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><br>
              <h2><span>'This Land of Hope and Glory is just a land of yobs and drunks'</span></h2>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'People come here, get everything they ask, for free, laughing at our expense,' was a typical observation.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>'We
                  old people struggle on pensions, not knowing how to make ends meet. If
                  I had my time again, would we fight as before? Need you ask?'</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Many writers are bewildered and overwhelmed by a multicultural
                  Britain that, they say bitterly, they were never consulted about nor

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'Our country has been given away to
                  foreigners </strong></span></span>while we, the generation who fought for freedom, are having
                  to sell our homes for care and are being refused medical services
                  because incomers come first.'</p>
              <p>Her words may be offensive to many - and rightly so - but
                  Sarah Robinson defiantly states: 'We are affronted by the appearance of
                  Muslim and Sikh costumes on our streets.' </p>

                  drunks'</p>
              </div>
              <p>But then political correctness is another thing they take strong
                  issue with, along with politicians generally - 'liars, incompetents and
                  self-aggrandising charlatans' (with the revealing exception of Enoch
                  Powell).</p>
              <p>The loss of British sovereignty to the European Union caused
                  almost as much distress. 'Nearly all veterans want Britain to leave the
                  EU,' wrote one.</p>
              <p>Frank, a merchant navy sailor, thought of
                  those who gave their lives 'for King and country', only for Britain to
                  become 'an offshore island of a <a class="inline-link" rel="tag" href="http://explore.dailymail.co.uk/locations/continents/europe">Europe</a> where <a class="inline-link" rel="tag" href="http://explore.dailymail.co.uk/locations/countries/france">France</a> and <a class="inline-link" rel="tag" href="http://explore.dailymail.co.uk/locations/countries/germany">Germany</a> hold sway.

              <p>'More clothes, cars, holidays abroad, home
                  ownership. As a young teacher in the Fifties I had one suit (Army

              <p>'The emancipation of women has also been a huge plus, with the

              <p>But she could not help asking whether people were any happier.</p>
              <p>She bemoaned the advent of the Pill and the collapse of sexual
                  morality. 'In my day, drugs were unknown, families remained together,
                  divorce was a rarity and children felt secure.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><br>
              <h2><span> 'We're now controlled by Germany and France. What a sad irony!'</span></h2>
              </div>
              <p>'Were our sacrifices made so hooligans may run wild? And aggressive
                  behaviour be accepted as the norm by TV interviewers and society in
                  general?'</p>
              <p>A captain with a Military Cross for valour under fire thought Britain was still the best country in the world.</p>
              <p>The 'occasional' sight of parents and nicely dressed children gave an
                  otherwise gloomy veteran of the Italian campaign a sense that 'what we
                  did all those years ago was not for nothing'.</p>
              <p>A grandmother, the widow of a Royal Marine who took part in the D-Day landings, felt the <a class="inline-link" rel="tag" href="http://explore.dailymail.co.uk/organisations/national_health_service">National Health Service</a> had descended into chaos but was grateful for a pensioner's free
                  television licence, 'which brings art, travel and animals into my
                  home', and being able to text her grandchildren.</p>
              <p>Just being alive was a bonus. 'Although I hate what is
                  happening to our country, I am so happy to be here, grumbling, but
                  remembering better, happier days,' she wrote.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But one of the bitterest complaints of the veterans was that
                  their trenchant views on many of the matters aired here were constantly
                  ignored by those in authority.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Their letters of complaint to councillors and MPs went unanswered.</p>
              <p>It was as if they didn't matter, except when wheeled out for the rituals of Remembrance Day.</p>

              <p>'Why do so many of the British public confuse sentimentality with genuine concern for others?' asked one letter-writer.</p>
              <p>But this was the generation honoured in Remembrance services
                  last weekend, showered with gratitude and teary-eyed sentiments as
                  their dwindling ranks marched unsteadily past the Cenotaph and other
                  war memorials throughout the UK.</p>
              <p>The overall impression any reader of the letters gets is that this generation feel unheard, unwanted and unimportant.</p>
              <p>This remarkable collection of their thoughts should give us pause for reflection.</p>
              <p>They
                  may be deemed beyond their sell-by date (and many of their views may
                  seem unacceptable, flouting every sort of 'ism' imaginable) but, by
                  their deeds of 60-plus years ago, they have won the right to be
                  listened to and their disillusionment noted with respect.</p>
              <p>In one letter in this collection, an RAF mechanic quoted a poem about comrades who fell in battle: <cite><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'I mourned them then, But now surviving in a world, Indifferent to their hopes and dreams, I grieve more for the living.'</strong></span></span><br></cite></p>
