              <p><strong>Gaddafi killed, confirms NTC</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 21 October 2011 0259 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SIRTE, Libya: Libyan
               strongman Muammar Gaddafi was killed Thursday in a final assault on his
               hometown Sirte by fighters of the new regime, who said they had 
              cornered the ousted despot in a sewage pipe waving a golden gun.<br><br>The
               demise of the hated dictator, who ruled his oil-rich North African 
              nation with an iron rod for close to 42 years, sparked a spontaneous 
              outpouring of joy and celebratory gunfire in streets across Libya.<br><br>"We
               announce to the world that Gaddafi has died in the custody of the 
              revolution," National Transitional Council (NTC) spokesman Abdel Hafez 
              Ghoga said in the eastern city of Benghazi.<br><br>"It is an historic moment. It is the end of tyranny and dictatorship. Gaddafi has met his fate," he added.<br><br>In
               Tripoli, interim premier Mahmud Jibril said NTC leader Mustafa Abdel 
              Jalil was to declare by Friday the country has been liberated, paving 
              the way for the formation of an interim government ahead of elections.<br><br>As
               Libyans danced for joy in the streets, world leaders welcomed Gaddafi's
               demise as the end of despotism, tyranny, dictatorship and ultimately 
              war in Libya.<br><br>Colonel Gaddafi, whose whereabouts were unknown 
              since NTC fighters overran the capital in August, was captured in a 
              sewage pipe waving a golden gun near Sirte, Libyan fighters said.<br><br>"Gaddafi
               was in a jeep when rebels opened fire on it. He got out and tried to 
              flee, taking shelter in a sewage pipe," an NTC field commander, Mohammed
               Leith, told AFP.<br><br>NTC fighters "opened fire again and he came out
               carrying a Kalashnikov (assault rifle) in one hand and a pistol in the 
              other," he said.<br><br>Gaddafi "looked left and right and asked what 
              was happening. Rebels opened fire again, wounding his leg and shoulder. 
              He died after that," according to Leith.<br><br>But according to Jibril,
               Gaddafi was shot in the head "in crossfire" between his supporters and 
              new regime fighters after his capture.<br><br>"When he was found, he was
               in good health, carrying a gun," Jibril told a press conference in 
              Tripoli. Gaddafi was transferred from the sewage pipe to a pickup truck,
               at which point he was shot in the right hand.<br><br>"When the vehicle 
              started moving, it was caught in crossfire between Gaddafi fighters and 
              the revolutionaries, and he was shot in the head," according to Jibril.<br><br>"He was alive up to (the) last moment, until he arrived at hospital" in the town of Misrata.<br><br>French
               Defence Minister Gerard Longuet revealed that a French Mirage-2000 
              fired a warning shot at a column of up to 80 vehicles trying to flee 
              Sirte early Thursday.<br><br>Libyan fighters then intervened, destroying the vehicles, from which "they took out Colonel Gaddafi," he added.<br><br>Longuet
               told reporters in Paris the convoy "was stopped from progressing as it 
              sought to flee Sirte but was not destroyed by the French intervention."<br><br>A
               videotape aired on Arab satellite channels showed a bloodied Gaddafi 
              alive and walking as he was being manhandled by Libya's new regime 
              fighters after his capture.<br><br>NTC fighters circled the 69-year-old 
              ousted strongman, who was bloodied in the head, face and shoulders, as 
              he apparently tried to cry out.<br><br>Leith, the NTC commander, said 
              one of Gaddafi's sons, Mutassim, was also killed in Sirte. "We found him
               dead. We put his body and that of (ex-defence minister) Abu Bakr Yunis 
              Jabar in an ambulance to take them to Misrata."<br><br>The NTC's Jibril 
              said that Gaddafi's most prominent son and one-time heir apparent, Seif 
              al-Islam, was believed to be pinned down in a village near Sirte.<br><br>Witnesses
               said they saw the bodies of both Gaddafi and Mutassim in Misrata late 
              on Thursday. "I saw his body, he had a wound on his head," said one 
              witness, Hakim al-Farjani.<br><br>"There was a lot of blood on his body.
               He had a bandage on his stomach," he said. "The body came in an 
              ambulance. Then the crowd became bigger and bigger so they took the body
               away."<br><br>An AFP photographer also saw Mutassim's body after it had been transferred to Misrata.<br><br>News
               of Gaddafi's death came as new regime troops overran the last redoubt 
              of his loyalists in Sirte, bringing to an end a two-month siege.<br><br>Fighters
               moving in from east and west overcame the last resistance in the city's
               Number Two residential neighbourhood where his diehard supporters had 
              been holed up.<br><br>"Sirte has been liberated, and with the 
              confirmation that Gaddafi is dead," Libya has been completely liberated,
               a top NTC military official, Khalifa Haftar, told AFP in Tripoli.<br><br>Fighters
               who had fought in the bloody eight-month conflict that toppled the 
              despot at a cost of more than 25,000 lives, erupted in jubilation, 
              firing volleys of gunfire into the sky and chanting "Allahu Akbar" (God 
              is greatest).<br><br>Pick-up trucks blaring out patriotic music 
              criss-crossed the streets of Sirte as fighters flashed V for victory 
              signs and chanted "Allahu Akbar" (God is greatest).<br><br>"We did it! 
              We did it!" chanted the fighters overcome with emotion, exchanging 
              well-wishes, hugs and handshakes against a backdrop of intense 
              celebratory gunfire.<br><br>World leaders began to weigh in on the death of the man who had ruled the oil-rich nation.<br><br>US
               President Barack Obama said Gaddafi's death ended a long, painful 
              chapter for Libyans and warned "iron fist" regimes in the rest of the 
              Arab world they would inevitably fall.<br><br>Speaking in the White 
              House Rose Garden, Obama said Gaddafi's demise vindicated the collective
               military action of the West and said Libyans now had a chance to build a
               "democratic" and "tolerant nation."<br><br>British Prime Minister David
               Cameron said the death was an occasion to remember his victims, while 
              hailing it as a chance for a "democratic future" for Libya.<br><br>French President Nicolas Sarkozy also hailed the end of Gaddafi and urged the country's new regime to pursue democratic reforms.<br><br>French
               and British forces spearheaded the air campaign against Gaddafi's 
              military by the NATO military alliance, which has launched nearly 1,000 
              strike sorties since March 31.<br><br>NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the alliance will begin Friday winding up its six-month mission in Libya.<br><br>Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi he hoped the death of Gaddafi would "turn the page of tyranny."<br><br>Arabi
               urged Libyans to "overcome the wounds of the past and to look to the 
              future with no grudges or sentiments of revenge, warding off all that 
              could disrupt national unity and peace."<br><br>UN chief Ban Ki-moon said it ushered in a "historic transition" for Libya.<br><br>"The
               road ahead for Libya and its people will be difficult and full of 
              challenges. Now is the time for all Libyans to come together," he said 
              at the UN headquarters.<br><br>Medics said at least three NTC fighters 
              were killed and 30 wounded in Thursday's fighting in Sirte, after 18 
              were killed and around 180 wounded over the previous two days.<br><br>Fifty
               pro-Gaddafi fighters were killed and 150 taken prisoner, including 
              three women, said NTC commander Leith. There was no independent 
              confirmation of the toll.<br><br>- AFP</span></span></p>
