It is estimated the total damage to the stonework will cost 'thousands' to repair.<br><br>Mrs Beech dismisses the Jesus and Mary Magdalene marriage story as a "complete myth" and is adamant the figure in her stained glass window is St John.<br><br>She is keen to trace the two Italian men, a father and son, but believes they have now returned to Italy.<br><br>"They were in the church at the right time and I would like to ask them some questions,' she said.<br><br>"It is very mysterious because it happened in the middle of the day last Friday. We had a lady in the church working on a flower arrangement and the bell ringers were in the church as well."<br><br>Of the two Italians, she added tongue-in-cheek: "Who knows, maybe they came over from the Vatican."<br><br>The pair did not break in or steal anything.<br><br>A spokesman for the Diocese of Lichfield said: "The Da Vinci Code is fiction, and while it's a very exciting read it's wrong to use that as an excuse to vandalise a very ancient and important church."<br><br>A Police spokesman said: "We were informed that some stone blocks had been tampered with in the church and we are appealing for any witnesses,"</div>
