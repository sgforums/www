              <p><span style="color: #003366;">L'AQUILA, Italy (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake struck a huge swath of central Italy as residents slept on Monday morning, killing at least 27 people when thousands of houses, churches and other buildings collapsed or were damaged.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">The dead in Italy's worst quake since 2002 were mainly in L'Aquila, a 13th-century mountain city about 100 km (60 miles) east of Rome with a population of 68,000, and surrounding mountain villages in the Abruzzo region.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">As aftershocks continued, officials put the death toll at 27 less than six hours after the quake but said the number was bound to rise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi cancelled a trip to Moscow and declared a national emergency, which would free up funds for aid and rebuilding. Pope Benedict said he was saying a special prayer for the victims.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Older houses and buildings made of stone, particularly in outlying villages that have not seen much restoration, collapsed like straw houses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Hospitals appealed for help from doctors and nurses throughout Italy. The stench of gas filled some parts of the mountain towns and villages as mains ruptured.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Residents of Rome, which is rarely hit by seismic activity, were woken by the quake, which rattled furniture and swayed lights in most of central Italy. It struck shortly after 3.30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. British time) and registered 6.3 on the Richter scale.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">"MY FATHER IS SURELY DEAD"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">"When the quake hit, I rushed out to my father's house and opened the main door and everything had collapsed. My father is surely dead. I called for help but no-one was around," said Camillo Berardi in L'Aquila.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Others considered themselves lucky, as old women wailed and residents armed with nothing but bare hands and goodwill helped firefighters and rescue workers look through the rubble.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">"I woke up hearing what sounded like a bomb," said Angela Palumbo, 87, as she walked on a street of L'Aquila.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">"We managed to escape with things falling all around us. Everything was shaking, furniture falling. I don't remember ever seeing anything like this in my life," she said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Rubble was strewn throughout the city and nearby towns, blocking roads and hampering rescue teams.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">"Thousands of people (could be left) homeless and thousands of buildings collapsed or damaged," said Agostino Miozzo, an official at the Civil Protection Department.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">A resident in l'Aquila standing by an apartment block that had been reduced to the height of an adult said: "This building was four storeys high."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Some cars were buried by the rubble.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">In another section of the city, residents tried to hush the wailing of grief to try to pinpoint the sound of a crying baby.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">It was the worst earthquake in terms of deaths to hit Italy since 2002, when 30 people, most of them children, were killed in a school collapse in the south.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">There were numerous reports of some the area's centuries-old Romanesque and Renaissance churches collapsing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Part of a university residence and a hotel collapsed in L'Aquila and at least one person was still trapped under the rubble with the number of dead still unknown.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">The quake brought down the bell tower of a church in the centre of L'Aquila. Bridges and highways in the mountainous area were closed as a precaution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">The quake was the latest and strongest in a series to hit the L'Aquila area on Sunday and Monday. Earthquakes can be particularly dangerous in parts of Italy because so many buildings are centuries-old.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">A powerful earthquake struck central Italy as residents slept on Monday morning, killing more than 90 people and making up to 50,000 homeless.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #339966;">The death toll from a devastating earthquake in central Italy rose to 207 on Tuesday and aftershocks hampered the race to dig possible survivors out of the debris.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">Rescuers worked under floodlights through the night and thousands of people whose homes were wrecked sheltered in tents and cars.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">"The hopes of finding anyone under the rubble now is very small," said a civil protection agency official at a camp set up outside L'Aquila, the historic mountain city shattered by the quake.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said <strong>207 people were now confirmed as dead</strong> in the worst quake to strike Italy in 30 years. Of some 1,500 people injured, about 100 were in serious condition</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #2550d9;">A series of aftershocks disrupted rescuers on Thursday as they picked through rubble in a search for survivors of Monday's earthquake in central Italy that killed 278 people and left thousands homeless.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #2550d9;">The death toll climbed to 278 after rescuers pulled more bodies from the ruins overnight, including two students buried beneath a dormitory hall. Many of the victims of Italy's worst quake since 1980 were students at L'Aquila university.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #2550d9;">Berlusconi said in total 28,000 people had lost their homes in the earthquake, with 17,000 now living in tents and the rest in free hotel rooms or staying with family. Officials said central L'Aquila would remain cordoned off until May.</span></p>
