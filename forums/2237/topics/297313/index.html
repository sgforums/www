Ganabatirau who was detained in Seremban being brought to Bukit Aman yesterday.</span><br><br><strong>KUALA LUMPUR: Described as a threat to national security and public order, five Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) leaders were yesterday detained under the Internal Security Act.</strong><br><br>The five were lawyers P. Uthayakumar, R. Kengadharan, V. Ganabatirau, M. Manoharan and a senior executive with Malaysia Building Society Bhd, K. Vasantha Kumar.<br><br>The four lawyers were legal advisers for Hindraf while Vasantha Kumar was the movement's co-ordinator.<br><br>All five were picked up in simultaneous operations in Bangsar, Petaling Jaya, Pantai, Brickfields and Seremban between 12.30pm and 2.30pm yesterday, according to a police statement.<br><br>Deputy Internal Security Minister Datuk Johari Baharum said the detention orders for the arrest of the five were signed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who is also internal security minister, yesterday morning.<br><br>Johari said: "It was based on reports by police that the five were a threat to national security and public order.<br><br>"This action is necessary as they have been a menace to the public."<br><br>He said under Section 8(1) of the Internal Security Act 1960, the five would be sent to the Kamunting detention centre in Taiping for two years.<br><br>The five were key officials of Hindraf, which organised a rally here on Nov 25 where some 10,000 Indians protested against alleged racial discrimination.<br><br>There were also clashes between police and the pro-testers several hours earlier that day when police tried to break up an illegal gathering at the Sri Subramaniam temple in Batu Caves. The protesters were also accused of damaging several vehicles.<br><br>Several policemen were attacked in both those incidents.<br><br>After the Nov 25 illegal assembly, there were similar gatherings at the courts in Shah Alam, Selayang and Kuala Lumpur when the protesters were charged with taking part in illegal assemblies.<br><br>On Tuesday night, there was a large gathering outside the Pudu prison when protesters demanded the release of Uthayakumar who was arrested earlier.<br><br>Abdullah had warned that he would invoke the ISA "without feeling guilty, without feeling sad" if Hindraf leaders and their supporters continued with their street protests, which could lead to racial unrest.<br><br>He had said he was aware of reports that Hindraf had been canvassing for support and help from terrorist groups and local gangsters.<br><br>He had also accused Hindraf of telling lies and accusing the government of cruelty and ethnic cleansing. He was referring to the memorandum sent by Hindraf to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.<br><br>The last time the ISA was used was in June 2006 when police nabbed 11 Darul Islam Sabah militants, who had allegedly helped organise the 2002 Bali bombings.<br><br>The 11 - six Malaysians, three Indonesians and two Filipinos - who had allegedly been smuggling firearms and ammunition into the region were arrested in Sandakan, Tawau and Klang.<br><br>There are 74 people, mostly suspected Muslim militants, in detention under the ISA.<br><br>The ISA, which was enacted in 1960, was initially intended to combat the communist threat.<br><br>Detainees can be held for 60 days without legal counsel, and preventive detention can then be renewed every two years. Most detainees are held at the Kamunting detention centre.<br><br><a href="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/Frontpage/20071214113632/Article/index_html" rel="nofollow">source</a></div>
