He filled his sack with cash, locked the two women in the safe and escaped.<br><br>He is still on the loose, but police in Tuebingen were able to nab a bank robber armed with a machine gun in a Santa costume with the aid of an infrared camera and helicopter. They found him hiding in a ditch in a nearby forest.<br><br>"The machine gun was fake," a police spokesman said. Dressed in a Santa cap, beard and wearing sun glasses, he was wanted for stealing 500,000 euros in four separate bank robberies.<br><br>One Santa was stopped by police for driving 150 kph (90 mph) on a northern German motorway, 50 kph over the speed limit.<br><br>"He said he was in a rush because he still had packages to deliver," said a spokesman for the police. They gave Santa a fine and took away his license.<br><br>Last week an inebriated half-naked Santa disrupted a Christmas market in Dabringhausen before police intervened.<br><br>That incident paled in comparison to what happened in Auckland on Saturday when 40 drunken Santas rampaged through the city center, stealing from stores and assaulting security guards in a protest against Christmas becoming too commercial.<br><br>In Britain, police said they were looking for a Santa acting suspiciously -- a flasher who exposed himself to women.<br><br>Officers in Swanage on the south coast of England said the flasher had struck a number of times since December 6, and a week later exposed himself whilst wearing a Santa Claus outfit.<br><br>A British agency recently issued a code of conduct to root out substandard Santas. "Santa is a magical and cuddly man, not a fat, smelly slob," said James Lovell of the Ministry of Fun agency in London. "He must not smell of drink or body odor."<br><br>Last Christmas, a shopping center in south Wales installed a webcam dubbed "Santacam" in his grotto to overcome parents' concerns after several high-profile paedophile cases in Britain.<br><br>(Additional reporting by Daniel Frykholm in Stockholm and Jeremy Lovell in London)<br><br>******<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Errr... any comments ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Oh my goodness......</span></div>
