Born Free Foundation More than 5,000 gorillas may have died in recent outbreaks of the Ebola virus in central Africa, a study says.<br><br>Scientists warn that, coupled with the commercial hunting of gorillas, it may be enough to push them to extinction.<br><br>The study, published in the US journal Science, looked at gorilla colonies in Republic of Congo and Gabon. Ebola is also blamed for many chimpanzee deaths.<br><br>One of the most virulent viruses known, Ebola has killed more than 1,000 people since it was first recorded in 1976.<br><br>Ebola causes viral haemorrhagic fever - massive internal and external bleeding - which can kill up to 90% of those infected.<br><br>Scientists are still working on a vaccine and there is no known cure.<br><br>Ape-to-ape transmission<br><br>The latest study, carried out by an international team, has confirmed previous concerns about how badly the virus is affecting gorillas.<br><br>EBOLA<br><br>* One of the most virulent viral diseases<br>* Damages blood vessels and can cause extensive bleeding, diarrhoea and shock<br>* Killed more than 240 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995<br>* Transmitted by infected body fluids<br>* Kills up to 90% of victims, depending on the strain<br>* There is no cure<br><br>"Add commercial hunting to the mix, and we have a recipe for rapid ecological extinction," the report says.<br><br>"Ape species that were abundant and widely distributed a decade ago are rapidly being reduced to remnant populations."<br><br>The researchers, led by Magdalena Bermejo of the University of Barcelona, focused on western gorillas, one of two gorilla species. The other is the eastern gorilla.<br><br>In 2002 and 2003, several outbreaks of Ebola flared up in human populations in Gabon and Congo.<br><br>The researchers found a "massive die-off" in gorillas in Congo's Lossi Sanctuary between 2002 and 2004.<br><br>Map showing Republic of Congo and Gabon "The Lossi outbreak killed about as many gorillas as survive in the entire eastern gorilla species," the study says.<br><br>The researchers concluded that the apes were not only infected by other species, such as fruit bats, but were also transmitting the virus among themselves.<br><br>Ebola was passing from group to group of the endangered animals, they found, and appeared to be spreading faster than in humans.<br><br>Outbreaks of the disease in humans have sometimes been traced to the bushmeat trade.<br><br>According to World Health Organization figures, Ebola killed 1,200 people between the first recorded human outbreak in 1976 and 2004.</div>
