              <p>FLORENCE, South Carolina (AP) -- A teen accused of plotting to blow up
              his high school told police that he wanted to die, go to heaven and
              kill Jesus, federal authorities said Tuesday.<br> <br> Prosecutors argued in a federal courtroom that the statements are an
              indication that 18-year-old Ryan Schallenberger needs a psychological
              evaluation.<br> <br> The straight-A Chesterfield High School senior was arrested April 19
              and faces several state and federal charges, including attempting to
              use a weapon of mass destruction. That charge carries a possible life
              sentence if he is convicted.<br> <br> "His conduct is bizarre," prosecutor Buddy Bethea told Judge Thomas
              Rogers III, who did not immediately issue a ruling. "I think it screams
              out in his conduct that he be evaluated."<br> <br> Defense attorney Bill Nettles said the request was premature, and that Schallenberger was competent to help in his defense.<br> <br> Prosecutors want Schallenberger, currently at Chesterfield County jail,
              moved to a federal facility because they think he may try to commit
              suicide. His journal writings have become increasingly violent over the
              past year, prosecutor Rose Mary Parham said.<br> <br> An agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
              testified that the teen told a sheriff he wanted to die after his
              arrest.<br> <br> "He said death was better than life," Craig Townsend said. "He told the
              sheriff he wanted to die and go to heaven and once he got there, he
              wanted to kill Jesus."<br> <br> Prosecutors also played a 911 tape of the teen's mother calling police
              after he smashed his head into a wall two days before his arrest. On
              the tape, she says her son threatened to shoot police if they came.<br> <br> "He's not going to do it," Laurie Sittler told the operator. "He's just got a bad temper."<br> <br> The teen left but his mother was scared he would return, she said in
              the call. "He's planning to go to college and everything, but I don't
              know what to do," she said.<br> <br> Schallenberger was arrested after his parents picked up at the post
              office a package addressed to the teen containing 20 pounds of ammonium
              nitrate. They got nervous and looked through his room where they found
              a cassette tape he wanted played after he died, which they took to the
              sheriff's office, the agent testified. Authorities found his journal,
              which lauded the Columbine killers, after searching his room.<br> <br> The 50-page journal contained notes on more than 10 types of explosives
              that Schallenberger experimented with and evaluated a year ago, the
              agent testified. It had a black cover and "Pisces" written on the
              front, and authorities have said it contained detailed plans to bomb
              Chesterfield High School.<br> <br> Schallenberger's parents were at the hearing but would not comment.<br> <br> Townsend also testified Schallenberger's mother called police to the
              home in April last year, when the teen was arrested for breach of
              peace. He said the teen became enraged and knocked over furniture after
              his mother asked him to walk with his sister to a grandparent's home.<br> <br> Authorities also seized a computer that shows he searched Web sites for
              making bombs, a shotgun, carbon dioxide canisters, "hundreds and
              hundreds" of matchsticks, and more cassette tapes that they have not
              yet heard, Townsend said.<br> <br> source: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/04/29/teen.charged.ap/index.html">http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/04....ap/index.html</a></p>
