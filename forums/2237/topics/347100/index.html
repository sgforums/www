              <p>KUALA LUMPUR (AFP) - - A pair of identical twins escaped being
              convicted and hanged on drugs charges in Malaysia, due to confusion
              over which one of them was the culprit, reports said on Saturday.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old twins, R. Sathis Raj and Sabarish Raj, had been
              charged with trafficking 166 kilos of cannabis and 1.7 kilos of raw
              opium in 2003. But police had trouble identifying which one was in
              possession of the drugs.</p>
              <p>"This is a very unique case as they are
              identical twins. Even the DNA evidence could not prove anything as the
              DNA could be either Sathis' or Sabarish's," said High Court judge
              Zaharah Ibrahim.</p>
              <p>"I can't be calling the wrong twin to enter his
              defence. I can't be sending the wrong person to the gallows," she said
              according to the New Straits Times as she acquitted the pair.</p>
              <p>The
              court heard that one of the twins was caught taking a car load of drugs
              to a house in suburban Kuala Lumpur. After he was apprehended the other
              twin arrived at the house and was also arrested.</p>
              <p>"It is clear
              that the first twin who was caught was the only one who had access to
              the house. Therefore, it is impossible for him not to know what was
              inside the bags," the judge said according to the daily.</p>
              <p>However,
              she said there was reasonable doubt as to which twin had been arrested
              first. The brothers cried and embraced family members in the court room
              when the verdict was handed down.</p>

              <p>That's precisely the point.</p>
              <p>As the judge pointed out, the first twin would definitely be the guilty party since he was the only one who was caught red-handed with the drugs as he was shifting them to the house.</p>
              <p>As soon as the second twin was arrested, the cops should have taken immediate measures to make sure that the twins can be told apart. Reasonable measures like putting them in separate cars and fingerprinting them separately would have prevented this sort of nonsense from happening.</p>
