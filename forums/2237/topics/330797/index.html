              <p>PHOENIX - "Man's best friend" doesn't go far enough for Buddy _ a
              German shepherd who remembered his training and saved his owner's life
              by calling 911 when the man had a seizure. And it's not the first time
              Buddy has been there for owner Joe Stalnaker, a police officer said
              Sunday. On a recording of the 911 call Wednesday, Buddy is heard
              whimpering and barking after the dispatcher answers and repeatedly asks
              if the caller needs help.</p>
              <p>"Hello, this is 911. Hello ... Can you hear me? Is there somebody
              there you can give the phone to," says the dispatcher, Chris Trott.</p>
              <p>Police were sent to Stalnaker's home, and after about three minutes Buddy is heard barking loudly when the officers arrived.</p>
              <p>Scottsdale police Sgt. Mark Clark said Stalnaker spent two days in a hospital and recovered from the seizure.</p>
              <p>"It's pretty incredible," Clark said. "Even the veteran dispatchers _ they haven't heard of anything like this."</p>
              <p>Clark
              said police are dispatched whenever 911 is called, but that Stalnaker's
              address was flagged in Scottsdale's system with a notification that a
              trained assistance dog could call 911 when the owner was incapacitated.</p>
              <p>Clark
              said Stalnaker adopted Buddy at the age of 8 weeks from Michigan-based
              Paws with a Cause, which trains assistance dogs, and trained him to get
              the phone if he began to have seizure symptoms. Buddy, now 18 months
              old, is able press programmed buttons until a 911 operator is on the
              line, Clark said.</p>
              <p>Clark said Buddy has made two other 911 calls when Stalnaker was having seizures.</p>
              <p>He said Stalnaker's seizures are the result of a head injury he suffered about 10 years ago during a military training exercise.</p>
              <p>Stalnaker was not listed in the phone book, and he did not immediately respond to a request through police for an interview.</p>
              <p>(This version CORRECTS name to Trott, sted Scott.)</p>
