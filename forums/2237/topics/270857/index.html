He soon finds himself on the bad side of a deal gone wrong with his employer, who just happens to be the Don of the New York mafia.<br><br>So what does he do? Well, what does any trained assassin do? He kills stuff.<br><br>Â• Click here to visit FOXNews.com's Video Gaming Center.<br><br>In "The Darkness," that includes pretty much everything in his path Â— mobsters, police officers and random strangers Â— in a blood-soaked zeal to exact revenge on his former employers.<br><br>He has a variety of weapons, including pistols and shotguns, at his disposal.<br><br>What makes this game different from other first-person shooters are the demonic powers Estacado gains as the game progresses.<br><br>You see, Estacado isn't just a professional killer. He's also somehow become possessed by evil spirits, giving him a pair of grisly, snarling tentacle-like serpents that sprout from his shoulders with the tap of a button.<br><br>He can summon this "Darkness" mode and other powers at will, and with devastating results on his enemies.<br><br>He gains the ability to withstand gunshot wounds more effectively, and his supernatural abilities add various possibilities.<br><br>I was able to guide one of the tentacles around corners to take out enemies from afar, for example.<br><br>You also can summon little demonic buddies who'll help unlock doors and fight for you. (Just be sure to shoot out all the street lamps; demons in this world don't last long when exposed to light).<br><br>It's this dynamic that makes the game so much fun. There's shooting aplenty, but the demonic powers bring a new dimension to the action, making the game much more that a simple point-and-shoot affair.<br><br>Blood splatters everywhere and the language is definitely adults-only, but this is a game that lets you bring out your inner demon unlike any other.<br><br>I did have a few complaints. "The Darkness" has some excellent graphics but the screen is Â— surprise, surprise Â— very dark. I found it hard to see unless I shuttered the blinds and flicked off the lights.<br><br>Another complaint, though it is really a compliment of sorts, is that "The Darkness" felt too short and left me wanting more.<br><br>I blew through the game in a couple days; more dedicated players could probably do it in one extended sitting.<br><br>"The Darkness" is proof that sometimes, anyway, it's good to be bad.<br><br>Three stars out of four.<br>[/url]</div>
