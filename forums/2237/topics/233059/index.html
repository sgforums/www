It's not a political statement . . . it's just an incorrect statement."<br><br>Morano noted that hurricanes (cyclones) do rotate clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.<br><br>"CullenÂ’s call for decertification of TV weathermen who do not agree with her global warming assessment follows a year (2006) in which the media, Hollywood and environmentalists tried their hardest to demonize scientific skeptics of man-made global warming,Â” Morano wrote on the committeeÂ’s Web site.<br><br>Scott Pelley, a "60 MinutesÂ” correspondent, compared skeptics of global warming to "Holocaust deniers,Â” and former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as "global warming deniers."<br><br>CullenÂ’s call for squelching scientific dissent comes as many skeptical university scientists have essentially been silenced over fears of loss of tenure and the withdrawal of research grant money, according to Morano.<br><br>Broadcast meteorologists critical of climate alarmism "have - up until now - been unburdened to speak out on climate issues,Â” he points out.<br><br>"CullenÂ’s call for decertification by the AMS can only serve to intimidate skeptics and further chill free speech in the scientific community.<br><br>"Stripping the Â‘Seal of ApprovalÂ’ from broadcast meteorologists could affect their livelihoods, impact their salaries and prestige. TV weathermen are truly the last of the independent scientists and past surveys have shown many of them to be skeptical of manmade global warming claims. Their independence is being threatened now.Â”</div>
