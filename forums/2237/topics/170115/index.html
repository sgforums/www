The West suspects Iran of developing atomic weapons but Tehran argues it needs nuclear technology to generate electricity.<br><br>Abedini gave more details about the tunnels than previously available and named companies and engineers involved.<br><br>He said a complex of tunnels at Parchin, east of Tehran, was used for work on laser techniques for uranium enrichment.<br><br>Another tunnel system in Khojeer, southeast of Tehran, was used to assemble ballistic missiles and was 1 km (0.6 miles) long and 12 metres (yards) wide.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The NCRI believes Iran could develop an atomic bomb in "a couple of years." </span></div>
