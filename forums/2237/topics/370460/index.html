              <p><cite class="auth">AFP - <span>Thursday, July 30</span></cite></p>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR (AFP) - - Malaysia's plan to deploy personnel from a
              notorious volunteer task force to help enforce a crackdown on crime
              triggered criticism Thursday from human rights campaigners.</p>
              <p>The New Straits Times said the home ministry had enlisted 254
              members from the Civil Defence Department and RELA, a 553,000-strong
              citizen corps that has been accused of serious rights abuses.</p>
              <p>The
              report described the personnel as the "cream of the crop" and said they
              were undergoing a two-week training programme before being assigned to
              crime hot spots next month.</p>
              <p>However, rights groups said that RELA
              officers were unsuited to the task, and called for the closure of the
              unit which has been accused of violence and extortion, particularly
              against suspected illegal migrants.</p>
              <p>"They shouldn't be given
              enforcement power because they are volunteers -- they are not trained,
              and have no background in law or how to handle criminals," said Temme
              Lee from leading rights watchdog Suaram.</p>
              <p>"We have made it clear
              from the beginning that RELA should be disbanded and the use of RELA
              corps with barely any training in law and enforcement will lead to more
              rights abuses," she told AFP.</p>
              <p>Amnesty International Malaysia also spoke out against the plan.</p>
              <p>"Why don't we hire more police instead? We should stop this temporary measure," said its Malaysia executive director Nora Murat.</p>
              <p>The
              US-based Human Rights Watch has accused RELA of harassing and abusing
              foreigners and said it was responsible for numerous cases of illegal
              detention.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Najib Razak this week announced a plan to cut crime by 20 percent, as part of a raft of populist measures.</p>
              <p>Spiralling street crime, including violent muggings, is a major concern for Malaysians, according to opinion polls.</p>
              <p><strong>RELA's
              uniformed volunteers have legal immunity and are allowed to arrest
              individuals as well as enter and search any premises without a warrant.</strong></p>
              <p>The
              force was established in 1972 under the home affairs ministry to help
              maintain public order. Its name is an acronym for People's Volunteer
              Corps in the Malay language.</p>
