              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>NEW DELHI - As the 
              global population hits seven billion, experts are warning that skewed 
              gender ratios could fuel the emergence of volatile "bachelor nations" 
              driven by an aggressive competition for brides.<br><br>The precise 
              consequences of what French population expert Christophe Guilmoto calls 
              the "alarming demographic masculinisation" of countries such as India 
              and China as the result of sex-selective abortion remain unclear.<br><br>But
               many demographers believe the resulting shortage of adult women over 
              the next 50 years will have as deep and pervasive an impact as climate 
              change.<br><br>The statistics behind the warnings are grimly compelling.<br><br>Nature
               provides an unbending biological standard for the sex ratio at birth of
               104-106 males to every 100 females. Any significant divergence from 
              that narrow range can only be explained by abnormal factors.<br><br>In 
              India and Vietnam the figure is around 112 boys for every 100 girls. In 
              China it is almost 120 to 100 -- and in some places higher than 130.<br><br>And
               the trend is spreading: to regions like the South Caucasus, where 
              Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia all post birth ratios of more than 115 
              to 100, and further west to Serbia and Bosnia.<br><br>Global awareness 
              of the problem was raised back in 1990 with an article by the Nobel 
              prize-winning Indian economist Amartya Sen that carried the now famous 
              title: "More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing."<br><br>Demographers 
              say that figure is now more than 160 million -- women selected out of 
              existence by the convergence of traditional preferences for sons, 
              declining fertility and, most crucially, the prevalence of cheap 
              prenatal sex-determination technology.<br><br>As many as half a million 
              female foetuses are estimated to be aborted each year in India, 
              according to a study by British medical journal The Lancet.<br><br>"Earlier
               villagers had to go to the city to get a sonogram (ultrasound)," said 
              Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the non-profit Population 
              Foundation of India. "Today sonographers are going into the villages to 
              cater to people who want sons."<br><br>Even if the sex ratio at birth 
              returned to normal in India and China within 10 years, Guilmoto says men
               in both countries would still face a "marriage squeeze" for decades to 
              come.<br><br>"Not only would these men have to marry significantly 
              older, but this growing marriage imbalance would also lead to a rapid 
              rise in male bachelorhood... an important change in countries where 
              almost everyone used to get married," he said.<br><br>How that change might manifest itself is hotly debated, although nearly everyone agrees there is no foreseeable upside.<br><br>Some
               forecast an increase in polyandry and sex tourism, while others predict
               cataclysmic scenarios with the rise of male-surplus societies where 
              sexual predation, violence and conflict are the norm.<br><br>A 
              particularly alarmist note was sounded several years ago by political 
              scientists Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer, who wrote that Asian 
              countries with too many men posed a security threat to the West.<br><br>"High-sex-ratio
               societies are governable only by authoritarian regimes capable of 
              suppressing violence at home and exporting it abroad through 
              colonisation or war," they said.<br><br>Mara Hvistendahl, a 
              correspondent for Science magazine and author of the recently published 
              "Unnatural Selection", says fears of full-scale wars are unfounded, and 
              points out that India remains a thriving democracy, despite its 
              shockingly high gender imbalance.<br><br>However she does agree with the underlying premise.<br><br>"Historically, societies in which men substantially outnumber women are not nice places to live," Hvistendahl stressed.<br><br>"Often
               they are unstable. Sometimes they are violent," she said, adding that 
              leaders in both China and India have spoken of the threat gender 
              imbalance poses to social stability.<br><br>UN agencies have issued 
              similar warnings about the correlation between a scarcity of women and 
              increases in sex trafficking and marriage migration, albeit with certain
               caveats.<br><br>"The data is really limited," said Nobuko Horibe, 
              Asia-Pacific director of the UN Population Fund. "It is very likely that
               this marriage squeeze would lead to these phenomena... but it's very 
              anecdotal at this stage."<br><br>But while more and more red flags are 
              being raised over the long-term implication of skewed sex ratios, few 
              solutions are being offered.<br><br>Sex-selective abortion is illegal in both China and India, but officials say the law is incredibly difficult to enforce.<br><br>There
               is "no silver bullet", admits Guilmoto, who believes the first priority
               is to make sure the problem is properly publicised -- and not just in 
              the developing world.<br><br>"In some countries in eastern Europe, people are absolutely not aware of what is going on," he warned.<br><br>- AFP /ls</span></span></p>
