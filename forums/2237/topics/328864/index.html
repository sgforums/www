              <p><span>SYDNEY - Eight years after it hosted an Olympics that were
              famously hailed as the "best games ever," Sydney has had to confess
              that it faked one of the key musical performances at the opening
              ceremony in 2000.
              <br> <br>The revelation came after it emerged that nine-year-old Lin Miaoke
              was just lip-synching when she "sang" a patriotic song before 91,000
              people and a global television audience during the August 8 opening
              ceremony at the Beijing Games.
              <br> <br>Orchestra bosses have admitted that the Sydney Symphony Orchestra
              (SSO) mimed its entire performance at the ceremony, and that some of
              the real music was in fact recorded by rival musicians in Melbourne.
              <br> <br>"It was all pre-recorded and the MSO (Melbourne Symphony Orchestra)
              did record a minority of the music that was performed," SSO managing
              director Libby Christie told Australia's Fairfax newspapers earlier
              this week. <br> <br> "It's correct that we were basically miming to a pre-recording," she said.
              <br> <br> The respected orchestra gave the fake performance because Olympics
              organisers "wanted to leave nothing to chance" and a second orchestra
              was found to record the backing tape because of a "mountainous
              workload" in Sydney, Christie said.
              <br> <br>The admission has columnists in Melbourne -- which has a
              longstanding rivalry with glitzier Sydney -- crowing over the fact that
              its musicians ghosted a crucial performance by their arch-rivals.
              <br> <br>The head of the MSO confirmed the performance had been pre-recorded
              but defended the move, saying it was "purely a workload issue" and in
              no way reflected on the relative quality of either orchestra.
              <br> <br>"It's nothing to do with priorities or which orchestra is better.
              It was decided to split (the work) between the two orchestras," he
              said.
              <br> <br>"It's quite a normal practice and if the Olympics had been in
              Melbourne, the Sydney Symphony would have been involved -- I'm sure of
              that."
              <br> <br>Christie said the Sydney orchestra had very rarely mimed
              performances but had done so at the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Sydney,
              while the MSO said it had used a backing tape at the opening ceremony
              of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. <br> <br> Beijing Olympic officials went on the defensive two weeks ago when it
              was revealed that pigtailed Lin Miaoke, who became a celebrity in China
              after her performance, had not actually done the singing.
              <br> <br>It later emerged the real voice belonged to chubby seven-year-old
              Yang Peiyi, who was deemed not attractive enough to go on stage, and
              that the switch was ordered by a politburo member of China's ruling
              Communist party.
