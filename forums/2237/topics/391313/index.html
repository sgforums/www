              <p><strong>Agence France-Presse, 17 February 2010</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><span id="contentbody">Malaysia said Wednesday that three women have been caned under Islamic law for having extramarital sex, in a first for the Muslim-majority country. </span></p>
              <p><span>Officials said the three women were caned on February 9 at a women’s prison outside the capital Kuala Lumpur after being convicted of “khalwat” or “close proximity” between an unmarried couple.</span></p>
              <p>“I hope this will not be misunderstood until it defiles the purity of Islam,” Home Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said according to state media.</p>
              <p>“The punishment is to teach and give a chance to those who have fallen off the path to return and build a better life in future,” he said, adding that none of the three sustained any injuries.</p>
              <p>Hishammuddin said the three women and four men were caned following a December decision in the religious courts — which operate in parallel to the civil system in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>He said one woman was released from prison last Sunday while another will be freed in several days and the third will be released in June.</p>
              <p>Malaysian Islamic authorities triggered uproar last year when they sentenced mother-of-two Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno to six strokes of the cane for drinking beer.</p>
              <p>Her case, which was to have been the first time a woman was caned under Islamic law in Malaysia, is under review and human rights groups have urged religious authorities to reverse the sentence.</p>
              <p>Kartika’s case has been given wide media coverage but the case of the three women convicted of extramarital sex came as a surprise.</p>
              <p>Bar Council president Ragunath Kesavan said it was worrying that the punishment had gone ahead even as the caning issue was being hotly debated by Muslim scholars, religious groups and human rights activists.</p>
              <p>“The impression was that Kartika’s case would be the first so I’ve got no idea what has happened,” he told AFP.</p>
              <p>“It’s not as if this is the Middle East… it’s not a good signal that they’re sending out.”</p>
              <p>“We are against any form of corporal punishment, for men or women,” he added. “The fact is that any form of whipping is barbaric.” – AFP</p>

              <p><br>Why will the Taiwanese 'hum' want to interfere in this thread when it has nothing positive to contribute - but prefer to troll for controversies ?</p>
              <p>Stay out of this Speaker's Corner when all you can contribute is your daily garbage of driving every thread off-track.</p>
              <p>Your interest here is to be a troll - by injecting your stoooopidity into every thread and make it controversial to drive the thread off track.</p>

              <p>I think they (the men and women) deserves the caning.</p>
              <p>That will deter them from commiting adultery in future.</p>
              <p>Imagine the pain and suffering their spouses, family and close friends will feel. The mental trauma will linger for a very long time. Trust once broken is difficult to restore.</p>
              <p>I will only agree to the extent that Islamic laws apply only to Muslims.</p>
              <p>Has 'modern' laws which has been around for centuries solve many of the world's problems; drugs, rapes, adultery, robbery, murder etc?</p>
              <p>We will view it as a harsh punishment because we are not the ones who suffer as a result of the offender's actions. If we are taking a long-term view of it, then the punishment of caning is not harsh. Physical wounds can heal but the pain will make the offender think twice before committing such acts in future. we are not talking about a death sentence or 10 years in jail etc.</p>
              <p>In some countries, murderers are only jailed and this, in the long run, creates a problem of congestion in prisons etc. I am just taking it as an example but in view of the offence, i feel caning is appropriate as a jail sentence will separate mothers or fathers from their children. Fines will not work especially if the offender is rich. Caning and release after that is the best solution for me; both short-term and long-term.</p>

              <p><br>Malaysia is NOT a muslim country. It's a majority-muslim country. Actual muslim country doesnt require their ppl to pay taxes etc. like dubai.</p>
              <p>It's not supportive or not. These cases have been around a long time and ppl usually keep 1 eye close as its a private matter. Dunno why now they are caning women for these acts.</p>
              <p>Malaysia is turning back time, how do they advance forward esp. with these barbaric ways?</p>

              <p>I am deeply saddened by your narrow-mindedness. Your post shows your biased views that Islam is a backward and barbaric religion.</p>
              <p>You failed to see the bigger picture that the punishment of caning is not as barbaric as it was made out to be. I may not be able to change your opinions and so can you on mine but i do hope that we all stick to the topic of caning and not use this as a means to attack a community or a country based on personal biased agendas.</p>
              <p>If you think caning is a harsh punishment, state you disagreement on the caning itself. I will not attack you for that and will respect your view on that but i cannot respect a person going overboard.</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>ltedino....i apologise if u never meant Islam but i will still have to correct you. Why do girls in Arab cover their faces except for their eyes? It is because they are living in the desert where dust and sand flies everywhere. They still do in some Arab desert regions. It has nothing to do with being backward.</p>
