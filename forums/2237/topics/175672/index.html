            <div class='col-md body'>FROM JOSEPH FARAH'S G2 BULLETIN<br><a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/printer-friendly.asp?ARTICLE_ID=48430" rel="nofollow"><strong>U.S., Israel to attack<br>Iran nukes 'before April'<br>Pre-emptive strike all but inevitable,<br>say military, intelligence sources</strong></a><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Posted: January 23, 2006<br>8:30 p.m. Eastern<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Â© 2006 WorldNetDaily.com<br><br>A pre-emptive U.S. and Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities is nearly inevitable, reports Joseph Farah's G2 Bulletin.<br><br>The incapacitation of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has made a pre-emptive attack on Iran more likely in the next nine weeks, Israeli sources tell the premium, online intelligence newsletter published by the founder of WND.<br><br>It was Sharon who vetoed the nearly unanimous recommendations of Israel's generals that a quick strike was the Jewish state's only chance at preventing Iran from building a significant nuclear arsenal.<br><br>Meanwhile, in Washington, there is growing concern that Iran's ultimate target is the U.S.<br><br>Earlier this month, Iran's Revolutionary Guards conducted a conference on the use of weapons of mass destruction Â– nuclear, chemical and biological. Included in those briefings were presentations on electromagnetic pulse weapons and other military technologies deemed to be under development for use against the U.S., rather than Israel or other enemies of the Islamic republic. Even one nuclear weapon, used in an EMP-style attack on the U.S., would prove catastrophic to the nation, a congressional panel studying the vulnerability of America to electro-magnetic pulse weapons concluded last year.<br><br>Such an attack would not require Iran to use long-range or intercontinental ballistic missiles, which it does not possess. But a simple Scud missile, with a nuclear warhead, could be fired from offshore and detonated above the U.S. wreaking near total devastation on the country's technological, electrical and transportation infrastructure. It would also have the advantage of offering Iran a degree of plausible deniability, given that "terrorists" armed with one nuclear weapon could achieve the same results.<br><br>For the complete detailed report on the impending attack, including contingency plans for the use of tactical nuclear weapons, subscribe to Joseph Farah's G2 Bulletin, now priced at just $99 a year or $9.95 per month.<br><br>Meanwhile, also in G2 Bulletin, missed in all the media attention on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's statements about wiping Israel off the face of the earth was the fact that he also called for the eradication of the U.S.<br><br>Ahmadinejad's speech in Tehran last fall, in which he called for Israel to be wiped off the face of the earth, got a healthy amount of coverage by the international media.<br><br>Yet, despite the number of stories published and broadcast, a key element of that address to 'The World Without Zionism" conference was overlooked, ignored Â– spiked, if you will Â– by major press organizations, according to a new report in Joseph Farah's G2 Bulletin.<br><br>It wasn't just a world without Zionism and Israel that Ahmadinejad and his friends in Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups were envisioning. It was a world without the United States of America.<br><br>They say a picture is worth a thousand words. In this case, it is literally true. Examine for yourself the photos published here of Ahmadinejad addressing the Tehran conference Oct. 26, 2005.<br><br>Some of them will look very familiar. Those showing the Iranian president gesticulating at a podium showing the name of the conference were published worldwide Â– from Al-Jazeera to the Associated Press. But those showing a wider view Â– and the complete poster for the event Â– are getting their biggest audience yet here in WND.<br><br>It is worth noting that Ahmadinejad didn't just stroll up to the podium. The Iranian government actually produced the visual aids you see here.<br><br>Yes, that is a ball representing the USA cracked at the bottom of that hourglass Â— with another representing Israel falling later.<br><br>It wasn't just the imagery of the conference that was overlooked, ignored, unreported and underplayed by the world press. It was also the anti-American substance of Ahmadinejad's speech.<br><br>"Is it possible for us to witness a world without America and Zionism?" he asked. "But you had best know that this slogan and this goal are attainable, and surely can be achieved."<br><br>What is he talking about?<br><br>Iran has developed a strategic "war preparation plan" for what it calls the "destruction of Anglo-Saxon civilization."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
