              <p><span class="date-info">Saturday, January 24, 2009</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2009/0124/1232474678061.html?digest=1">http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2009/0124/1232474678061.html?digest=1</a></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Evidence is mounting that the Israeli defence forces used the Gaza
              assault as a testing ground for new, horrific weapons that have
              confounded doctors’ attempts to save the wounded</span></strong>, writes <strong>LARA MARLOWE</strong> in Gaza.</p>
              <p>THERE WERE MANY ways to die during the Israeli offensive on Gaza.</p>
              <p>From
              their hospital beds at Gaza’s Shifa Hospital, Atallah Saad, 13, and
              Yussef Salem, 17, told me how “zananas” – remotely piloted drones that
              fire missiles – wounded them and killed Atallah’s mother and pregnant
              sister-in-law, and two of Yussef’s school friends. The drones were
              given the nickname because they make a loud z-z-z-z-z sound. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">But the
              most shocking thing about them is that an Israeli operator watches his
              target – in these cases, all civilians – through a surveillance camera
              before launching the missile. Death by remote control.</span></strong></p>
              <p>White
              phosphorous was another, much publicised means of death. Each M82581
              artillery shell, manufactured by General Dynamics in Pine Bluff,
              Arkansas, bears the initials PB. And each of the 155mm shells contains
              116 felt wafers soaked in phosphorus, which ignites on contact with
              oxygen. The phosphorous makes the white jellyfish-shaped clouds seen on
              television during the December 27th-January 17th Israeli offensive. It
              provides cover for advancing troops, but it also burns houses and
              people. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">If one of the felt pads lands on your skin, it burns until all
              the fuel is consumed, creating deep, wide, chemical burns, often to the
              bone.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Dr Nafiz Abu Shabaan pulls a plastic bag from under his
              desk. It is filled with white phosphorous, buried in sand. The brown
              pieces look like dog dirt, and re-ignite if broken open. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mahmoud al
              Jamal, 18, sits in the doctor’s office, his right ear congealed, his
              fingers and part of his chest eaten away by white phosphorous. The
              unsightly wounds make him look like a leper.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Al Jamal was
              walking at dawn when he saw the white jellyfish in the sky. “Everything
              was set on fire around me. I felt my body burning. I fell down and I
              asked the man lying next to me to help me, but he was dead. Then I lost
              consciousness.” Al Jamal’s brother later told him how smoke poured from
              his body in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The
              Israeli’s use of white phosphorous is amply documented. Israel says it
              is legal, but human-rights groups say its use in civilian areas might
              constitute a war crime. </span></strong>Dr Abu Shabaan is more concerned by evidence of
              new, mysterious weapons and appeals for an impartial international
              investigation into Israel’s use of new weapons.</p>
              <p>“<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">We’ve seen many, many cases of amputation – like a cauterised wound, with no bleeding,” he recounts.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">“Some have minor chest injuries, but the X-rays show nothing and they die suddenly, without explanation.”</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Palestinian
              and foreign doctors who’ have treated the war-wounded at Shifa suspect
              the injuries may be caused by Dense Inert Metal Explosive, also known
              as Focus Lethality Munition, a weapon invented through Israeli-American
              cooperation.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">“We are guinea pigs to the Americans and Israelis,”
              says Dr Abu Shabaan. “The Americans give the Israelis new weapons, and
              they try them out on us.”</span></strong></p>
              <p>“They are definitely testing weapons
              on us,” says Dr Sobhi Skaik, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons
              in Edinburgh and the head of the surgery department at Shifa. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">“The
              amount of damage done by these weapons is not commensurate to the
              wounds. We found computer chips, magnetic pieces and transistors in
              wounds. Sometimes there are only minute pin-point punctures to the
              abdomen and chest, but you see huge damage to internal organs. One
              patient had his liver burned black, as if it had been grilled. We think
              there must be something embedded in the human body that is releasing
              poison and killing.”</span></strong></p>
              <p>YET FOR ALL the high-tech and Frankenstein
              weaponry, perhaps Israel’s most vicious arm against the Palestinians
              has been “al-hissar”, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">the siege, imposed on the Gaza Strip 19 months
              ago when Hamas, after winning a democratic election that the world
              refused to recognise, seized power from the Fatah Palestinian Authority.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The
              world turned a blind eye as Gazans languished in the world’s biggest
              prison, unable to travel, import, export or interact with anyone or
              anything beyond their borders. And the world largely ignored the
              rockets Hamas fired in anger and frustration from within the siege.</p>
              <p>As a result of this dual negligence the conflict exploded, killing 13 Israelis and 1,300 Palestinians.</p>
              <p>The
              siege was one reason casualties were so high in the three-week war,
              says Fred Abrahams of Human Rights Watch. With the Israeli and Egyptian
              borders closed, “It wasn’t possible for Gazans to escape. The only way
              to get out was on a stretcher.”</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">For 19 months, Gaza has endured
              shortages of fuel, food, medicine and building materials. The
              Palestinians suffer the additional humiliation of using their
              tormentors’ currency, but two months ago the Israeli government cut the
              supply of shekels, creating a severe cash shortage.</span></strong> Fayad Salam, the
              prime minister of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, was forced to
              plea with the Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert.</p>
              <p>There were
              long queues at ATMs in Gaza City this week, but no matter how much they
              have in salary or savings, cash is rationed and Palestinians can
              withdraw only 1,000 Israeli shekels per month. “If the Israelis could
              deprive us of air, they would do it,” says a Palestinian doctor.</p>
              <p>The
              siege of Gaza lies at the heart of the conflict. “If the Israelis want
              the war to end, they must open all the borders and end the siege,” says
              Hamas government spokesman Tahir al-Nounou. “Because the siege is war;
              the siege is killing our people.”</p>
              <p>The only lifeline for Gaza are
              some 1,300 tunnels beneath the Gaza-Egyptian border. It costs $10,000
              (€7,800) to dig a tunnel. The best tunnels are bored with sophisticated
              machines that compress earthen walls so no give-away sand appears
              outside. Some have railway tracks and electricity, and the tunnels are
              a lucrative business for Gazans and Egyptians. Because Hamas is
              believed to import weapons through the tunnels, Israel carpet-bombed
              them during the offensive. Yet only an estimated 400 were destroyed,
              and by mid-week the tunnels were again open. Huge plastic cubes in
              metal frames, holding petrol, appeared on the pavements of Gaza City.</p>
              <p>But
              the return to a semblance of normality cannot efface the three-week
              nightmare. Whole families were wiped out. Abu Mohamed Balousha, who
              lost five daughters, and the Samounis of Zeitoun, where a four-year-old
              boy was the only survivor in a family of 30, have become causes
              célèbres.</p>
              <p>Everyone has a worst memory. For ambulance driver
              Hathem Saleh, it was desperate telephone calls from the wounded. “When
              you have been talking to him on the phone and you cannot reach him
              because the Israeli tank will hit you – it happened to me many times .
              . . I could hear cries and the Israelis were shooting at us.”</p>
              <p>Dr
              Mahmoud al Khozendar, a chest physician, tells of a colleague whose
              Russian wife was cut in half when an Israeli missile hit their home. It
              also killed their six-month-old child. “He took the two parts of his
              wife and put her on the bed with the baby. He escaped with a wounded
              son and daughter, and asked the Red Crescent to go back for the bodies.”</p>
              <p>At
              Shifa, al Khozendar had a room full of limbs he could not match with
              bodies, and one body with two heads. “Most of the bodies were buried
              without names,” he says.</p>
              <p>THERE WERE MANY ways to die during the
              Israeli offensive on Gaza. Perhaps the greatest number killed were
              crushed to death when the Israelis fired heavy tank artillery at their
              houses. Halima Radwan, 60, seemed particularly symbolic to me. Radwan
              was a young woman when she and her family fled from Israel in the 1967
              war. She spent her life as a wandering Palestinian, moving to Gaza,
              Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt. In 1996, in the glory days when Gaza had an
              airport and Palestinians carried passports, she and her husband Ahmad,
              a PLO official, decided to move back to “Palestine”. They built a
              five-bedroom villa in the Abed Rabbo district of Gaza. A month before
              the offensive, they paid off their debts and celebrated.</p>
              <p>Maher
              Radwan, 36, is Halima and Ahmad’s only son and a mechanical engineer
              with the Palestinian Authority. He, his wife and children lived with
              his parents. “Before the ground offensive started, I decided to take my
              wife and children further from the border,” Maher recounts in front of
              the ruined villa. “I begged my parents to come with us, but they said
              ‘No, we are old. The Israelis won’t harm us’.”</p>
              <p>On January 6th,
              an Israeli tank fired a shell at the Radwans’ house. Ahmad was wounded
              in the head and walked out with a white flag. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">He begged the Israelis to
              allow the Red Crescent to rescue his wife Halima, who was buried alive
              in her kitchen. The Israelis said no. Halima lived for four days under
              the debris of her house, which the Israelis then dynamited.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">“They knew she was there and they saw her, because they searched the house before they destroyed it,” says Maher.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">As
              soon as the ceasefire took effect last Sunday, he went with friends and
              relatives to dig his mother out. “I had the tiniest hope she might
              still be alive.” But Halima’s legs, shoulder and head had been crushed
              by concrete.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Broken porcelain, a framed verse from the Koran and
              a piece of plaster with Hebrew writing by the Israeli soldiers are
              scattered in the ruins of the Radwan family home. The pigeons they
              raised have returned to roost on the broken roof. Maher Radwan’s
              neighbours say there can be no peace with the Israelis who did this.
              But Maher is more sad than angry. Peace might still be possible, he
              says, “if only there were wise Israeli people”.</p>
