              <p>WASHINGTON (AFP) – 
              The US space agency's <span id="lw_1235077236_0" class="yshortcuts">Fermi</span> telescope has detected a massive explosion in space which scientists
              say is the biggest gamma-ray burst ever detected, a report published
              Thursday in Science Express said.</p>
              <p>The spectacular blast, which occurred in September in the Carina
              constellation, produced energies ranging from 3,000 to more than five
              billion times that of visible light, astrophysicists said.</p>
              <p>"<span id="lw_1235077236_1" class="yshortcuts">Visible light</span> has an energy range of between two and three electron volts and these
              were in the millions to billions of electron volts," astrophysicist
              Frank Reddy of US space agency <span id="lw_1235077236_2" class="yshortcuts">NASA</span> told AFP.</p>
              <p>"If you think about it in terms of energy, X-rays are more energetic
              because they penetrate matter. These things don't stop for anything --
              they just bore through and that's why we can see them from enormous
              distances," Reddy said.</p>
              <p>A team led by Jochen Greiner of <span id="lw_1235077236_3" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Germany's Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics</span> determined that the huge gamma-ray burst occurred 12.2 billion light years away.</p>
              <p>The sun is eight light minutes from Earth, and <span id="lw_1235077236_4" class="yshortcuts">Pluto</span> is 12 light hours away.</p>
              <p>Taking into account the huge distance from earth of the burst,
              scientists worked out that the blast was stronger than 9,000 supernovae
              -- powerful explosions that occur at the end of a star's lifetime --
              and that the gas jets emitting the initial <span id="lw_1235077236_5" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">gamma rays</span> moved at nearly the <span id="lw_1235077236_6" class="yshortcuts">speed of light</span>.</p>
              <p>"This burst's tremendous power and speed make it the most extreme recorded to date," a statement issued by the US <span id="lw_1235077236_7" class="yshortcuts">Department of Energy</span> said.</p>
              <p>Gamma-ray bursts are the universe's most luminous explosions, which
              astronomers believe occur when massive stars run out of nuclear fuel
              and collapse.</p>
              <p>Long bursts, which last more than two seconds, occur in massive stars
              that are undergoing collapse, while short bursts lasting less than two
              seconds occur in smaller stars.</p>
              <p>In short gamma-ray bursts, stars simply explode and form <span id="lw_1235077236_8" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">supernovae</span>,
              but in long bursts, the enormous bulk of the star leads its core to
              collapse and form a blackhole, into which the rest of the star falls.</p>
              <p>As the star's core collapses into the black hole, jets of material
              blast outward, boring through the collapsing star and continuing into
              space where they interact with gas previously shed by the star,
              generating bright afterglows that fade with time.</p>
              <p>"It's thought that something involved in spinning up and collapsing
              into that blackhole in the center is what drives these jets. No one
              really has figured that out. The jets rip through the star and the <span id="lw_1235077236_9" class="yshortcuts">supernova</span> follows after the jets," Reddy said.</p>
              <p>Studying gamma-ray bursts allows scientists to "sample an individual
              star at a distance where we can't even see galaxies clearly," Reddy
              said.</p>
              <p>Observing the massive explosions could also lift the veil on more of
              space's enigmas, including those raised by the burst spotted by <span id="lw_1235077236_10" class="yshortcuts">Fermi</span>, such as a "curious time delay" between its highest and lowest energy emissions.</p>
              <p>Such a time lag has been seen in only one earlier burst, and "may mean
              that the highest-energy emissions are coming from different parts of
              the jet or created through a different mechanism," said Stanford
              University physicist Peter Michelson, the chief investigator on Fermi's
              large area telescope.</p>
              <p>"Burst emissions at these energies are still poorly understood, and
              Fermi is giving us the tools to understand them. In a few years, we'll
              have a fairly good sample of bursts and may have some answers,"
              Michelson said.</p>
              <p>The Fermi telescope and NASA's Swift satellite detect "in the order of
              1,000 gamma-ray bursts a year, or a burst every 100,000 years in a
              given galaxy," said Reddy.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1235077236_11" class="yshortcuts">Astrophysicists</span> estimate there are hundreds of billions of galaxies.</p>
              <p>The Fermi gamma-ray space telescope was developed by <span id="lw_1235077236_12" class="yshortcuts">NASA</span> in collaboration with the US <span id="lw_1235077236_13" class="yshortcuts">Department of Energy</span> and partners including academic institutions in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden and the United States.</p>
