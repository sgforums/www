The HFPA is comprised of about 90 journalists for non-American publications, although many members are part-time and write for relatively obscure media outlets. Membership of the HFPA is notoriously selective, with many large overseas publications, including The Times, excluded.<br><br>Other winners in films with a gay theme included Philip Seymour Hoffman (best dramatic actor), for his well-received portrayal of the homosexual writer Truman Capote in Capote; and Felicity Huffman (best dramatic actress), who starred in Transamerica as a man who undergoes a sex change operation.<br><br>Huffman was widely praised for her performance as a pre-operative male transsexual on a road trip with a bisexual prostitute who doesn't know he's  her son. The actress, married to William H. Macy, is better known for playing Lynette in Desperate Housewives, which was last night named the best TV series, musical or comedy.<br><br>It was a relatively good night for British talent, in particular Hugh Laurie, 47, who managed to erase all traces of his English accent to play Gregory House, a misanthropic doctor, in the darkly humorous medical drama House, M.D.<br><br>The show became a huge critical and commercial hit last year, turning Mr Laurie into one of AmericaÂ’s best-known actors. Many Americans are surprised when they find out he is British.<br><br>Laurie won the Golden Globe for best actor in a TV drama, beating Kiefer Sutherland (24), Matthew Fox (Lost), Patrick Dempsey (GreyÂ’s Anatomy) and Wentworth Miller (Prison Break).<br><br>"I made a list of all the people who deserve to be thanked. It came to 172 names," Laurie told the press on the red carpet outside the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where the ceremony was held. "I wrote the names, put them in my left hand trouser pocket. I'm going to draw out three and thank them, the rest can lump it." In the end, Laurie thanked the show's script supervisor, hair stylist and his agent.<br><br>The other UK winner of the night was Rachel Weisz, 35, who collected the gong for best supporting dramatic actress The Constant Gardener, a Fernando Meirelles-directed thriller adapted from the bestselling novel by John le CarrÃ©. Her rivals included Scarlett Johansson (Match Point), Shirley MacLaine (In Her Shoes), Frances McDormand (North Country) and Michelle Williams (Brokeback Mountain). Weisz previously starred in About a Boy, alongside Hugh Grant.<br><br>Disappointment for the UK came when Polly Walker, 40, a former member of the Royal Shakespeare Company who starred in the BBC/HBO joint venture Rome, lost the best actress in a TV drama award to Geena Davis, who played a female American president in Commander in Chief.<br><br>Davis, best known for her role in the road trip movie Thelma &amp; Louise, said: "I want to let the Hollywood Foreign Press know I'm delighted. This is wonderful for a fledgling little show like ours. As I was coming in, I felt a tug at my skirt, and there was a little girl of eight or ten in her first party dress. She said, Â‘Because of you I want to be president one dayÂ’.<br><br>"Well, that didn't actually happen. But it could have. It very well could have. If I was in the farmlands in Nebraska or somewhere, there could have been a little girl. Were that the case, then all of this would be worth it."<br><br>Meanwhile, Reese WitherspoonÂ’s performance as June Carter in Walk the Line Â– a biopic about the late country icon Johnny Cash and his redemptive love for Carter Â– snatched the best actress in a comedy or musical award from Keira Knightley, 21, who was nominated for her role as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. "This film is very important because it's about where I grew up, and the music I grew up listening to," Witherspoon said.<br><br>IrelandÂ’s Jonathan Rhys Meyers, 29, won best performance by an actor in a mini-series for his role as the King in the CBS series Elvis. Meyers, 29, also played the anti-hero in Match Point, Woody AllenÂ’s homage to Alfred Hitchcock, regarded as an Oscar contender. Meyers also stars in Tom CruiseÂ’s summer blockbuster Mission Impossible III.<br><br>There were fond memories of 2004Â’s unexpected win for The Office Â– and its creator Ricky Gervais Â– when Steve Carell, the star of the successful American adaptation of the British comedy, won best actor in a TV musical or comedy.<br><br>"I really didn't expect this, and I didn't write anything," he said. "Fortunately, my wife did and she stuck something in my pocket." Carell, who also recently starred in The 40 Year Old Virgin, went on to read a speech that included a thank you in every sentence to his wife, Nancy.<br><br>Sir Anthony Hopkins was presented with the Cecil B DeMille award for lifetime achievement by Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays his daugher in Proof. She said that the Welsh actor had had a career "most of us can only dream of".<br><br>Although the Golden Globes are seen as less important than the Academy Awards and even the Grammys Â– both of which usually get better television ratings Â– a thumbs-up from the HFPA can statistically improve a film's chances of bagging an Oscar.<br><br>Nomination forms for the Academy Awards are due in this week, and the shortlist in announced at the end of the month. The Oscar ceremony itself is held in March.<br><br>This yearÂ’s Golden Globes Awards was moved by the NBC network to a Monday after the 2005 ceremony suffered a 40 per cent decline in its ratings to 16.7 million. According to a recent New York Times report, the non-profit HFPA sells the broadcast rights to the ceremony for as much as $5.7 million.<br><br>The HFPA came under increased scrutiny last year after one of its members, Nick Douglas, committed suicide amid a disciplinary proceeding.<br><br>Douglas had been suspended from the organisation after selling a photograph of himself with the actor Tom Selleck for $50. With his access to Hollywood celebrities limited as a result of the suspension, he gave up his column for Big Buzz, a Belfast magazine. His body was found hanged in a Belfast charity resale shop on December 8.</div>
