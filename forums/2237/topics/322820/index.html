              <p class="first">PHILADELPHIA
              - A man who authorities say posted an Internet video showing himself
              waving a gun and claiming to rejoice whenever a police officer is shot
              in the city was arrested Thursday.</p>

              <p>Andre
              Moore, 44, of West Philadelphia, faces charges of aggravated assault,
              terroristic threats, corruption of morals of a minor and harassment,
              police Lt. John Walker said.</p>
              <p>In the video posted on YouTube, a
              man authorities identified as Moore complains about officers in West
              Philadelphia's 18th police district, calling them "a bunch of liars"
              and saying he celebrates "whenever they shoot a cop in Philadelphia."</p>
              <p>At
              another point, he is shown waving a gun and talking about officer
              shootings in the city. According to a probable cause affidavit, the man
              removes the ammunition magazine from the gun, racks the slide, points
              the pistol at the camera and pulls the trigger as he speaks.</p>
              <p>"Boom!
              ... When you shoot the cop, you shoot them dead, OK? Anywhere, head or
              the heart. That's why the last cops lost their lives," he says.</p>
              <p>Three city police officers have been killed in the line of duty in a little more than two years.</p>
              <p>An
              arrest warrant was issued for Moore after he was identified in the
              video, which was posted June 7, said Kevin Harley, spokesman for the
              state Attorney General's Office. The video was removed from YouTube
              following Moore's arrest at his apartment, police said.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">We
              believe these were terroristic threats that are not protected by the
              First Amendment, particularly when he encourages people to promote
              violence in Philadelphia and when he shows people how to use a gun to
              shoot a cop</span>," Harley said.</p>
              <p>Arrest documents said Moore works as a
              security guard at Albert Einstein Medical Center, where Officer Chuck
              Cassidy died after being shot during a robbery on Oct. 31.</p>
              <p>Moore remained in custody Thursday and it was unclear whether he had an attorney.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moral of the story, freedom of speech doesn't incude freedom to entice violence... But it still supprise me America can go and arrest this guy for being anti police yet still let anti muslim to go on...</p>
