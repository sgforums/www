              <div class="articleSubTitle">Exclusive interview</div>
              <div class="articleSubTitle"><br></div>
              <p>by  Manuel  Zelaya</p>
              <p><em>-The neoliberal economic model has failed, and we need social
                  policies for the disadvantaged in our society. That's why I aim for a
                  new model of development, and part of my administration supported me in
                  that endeavor. But the neoliberals simply want to expand their wealth,
                  and they have no interest in the country's development. A few large
                  companies dominate the Honduran economy. This plays into the hands of
                  multinational corporations, which control the market, thereby creating
                  even more poverty.<br><br>-More than 1,000 people were arrested and are
                  now in prison, and four young people were killed in a protest march. I
                  am afraid that even more people have died. We don't know exactly what
                  is happening in the country. The coup leaders control most of the media.<br></em><br>In
                  a SPIEGEL interview, ousted President Manuel Zelaya, 56, discusses the
                  coup in his native Honduras, the lack of intervention from Washington,
                  his political ties to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his hopes to
                  unseat the regime by peaceful means.<br><br>SPIEGEL: Mr. President, you
                  have now established your headquarters in northern Nicaragua, only a
                  few kilometers from the Honduran border. Will you attempt, as you have
                  already done several times in recent weeks, to return to Honduras on
                  your own?<br><br>Zelaya: I could go back across the border today or
                  tomorrow, but I'm being threatened. The coup leaders want to murder me,
                  or at least arrest me, as they have done once before. I want to prepare
                  for my return in a peaceful way. Hondurans should know: I am prepared
                  to resume control of the country at the appropriate moment. For now, we
                  are organizing the resistance.<br><br>SPIEGEL: Your Costa Rican
                  counterpart, President Oscar Arias, has unveiled a peace plan designed
                  to reinstate you. Do you have faith in a negotiated solution?<br><br>Zelaya:
                  We accept the Arias plan. Negotiations are the only way. But it will
                  only work if the international community increases its pressure on the
                  coup leaders. It has to make sure that coups don't become an epidemic.
                  That would jeopardize security and stability on the entire continent.
                  If coups, revolutions and uprisings were to spread throughout Latin
                  America once again, the United States and Europe would also pay a high
                  price.<br><br>SPIEGEL: Under the peace plan, you would be required to
                  give up some of your power. For instance, you would no longer be able
                  to appoint your own ministers ...<br><br>Zelaya: I accept that. I'm a politician, and I'm tolerant.<br><br>SPIEGEL: Do you see an opportunity for dialogue with the new regime?<br><br>Zelaya:
                  International pressure would have to be increased for that to happen.
                  It affected the coup leaders when Washington suspended their diplomatic
                  visas, and the sanctions are also taking effect. In many ports, goods
                  coming from Honduras are no longer being unloaded. The German firm
                  Adidas, along with Nike and clothing manufacturer Gap, have announced
                  that they will cancel orders from Honduran factories unless democracy
                  is restored.<br><br>SPIEGEL: Your supporters claim that the US
                  ambassador and influential right-wing politicians in the United States
                  were told about the coup in advance.<br><br>Zelaya: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There were many
                  rumors leading up to the coup, as well as unusual military movements.
                  I'm sure that the Obama administration knew about it, but it didn't
                  agree to the overthrow.</strong></span></span><br><br>SPIEGEL: The secretary general of the
                  Organization of American States (OAS) and US Secretary of State Hillary
                  Clinton have criticized you for your attempts to return to Honduras on
                  your own, by crossing the Nicaraguan border. Aren't you just provoking
                  further violence with such actions?<br><br>Zelaya: They don't know
                  anything about the suffering of the Honduran people, and the sacrifices
                  Hondurans are making to bring me back. The military coup has turned
                  into a dictatorship. It is oppressing the people and committing massive
                  human rights violations. Hillary and the OAS should find out more about
                  that.<br><br>SPIEGEL: The US government has condemned the coup. Was that too lackadaisical for you?<br><br>Zelaya:
                  US President (Barack) Obama is sincere, but he is not acting decisively
                  enough. He ought to pursue the coup leaders more resolutely so that
                  such coups don't happen again.<br><br>SPIEGEL: The Honduran congress
                  and the country's highest court accuse you of having breached the
                  constitution. You wanted the people to vote directly on whether a
                  decision to convene a constitutional convention should be voted on in
                  the November elections.<br><br>Zelaya: But that isn't a reason to stage a coup right away. I didn't commit a breach of the constitution.<br><br>SPIEGEL: Will you insist on a constitutional reform if you return to Honduras?<br><br>Zelaya: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I want to actively involve the people in democracy. This is a historic process, and it cannot be stopped.</strong></span></span><br><br>SPIEGEL: One of the reasons you want to amend the constitution is so that you can be reelected, or so the accusations go.<br><br>Zelaya: I have never tried to do that, nor will I, because the constitution prohibits it.<br><br>SPIEGEL:
                  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is one your key supporters. That's why
                  you are suspected of trying to create a populist regime similar to his.
                  How much influence does Chavez have on your government?<br><br>Zelaya:
                  Absolutely zero. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>These accusations are just a trick to divert attention
                  away from the coup leaders' true motives. Chavez is the scapegoat.</strong></span></span> In
                  fact, the USA is the one intervening in Honduras. Seventy percent of
                  Honduran exports go there. We have a military, trade and immigration
                  treaty with Washington.<br><br>SPIEGEL: But Venezuela supplies discounted oil to Honduras, which makes you dependent on Chavez.<br><br>Zelaya:
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That's another of those lies.</strong></span></span> Venezuela covers only 15 percent of our
                  oil needs. American oil companies bring in 85 percent.<br><br>SPIEGEL: You are also considered an admirer of Fidel Castro. How is your relationship with Cuba?<br><br>Zelaya:
                  We have very good relations, just as we do with Europe and the United
                  States. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I have no problems with any country in the world, only with the
                  economic elite in Honduras, which is getting rich at the expense of the
                  poor. I don't want to drive them out. I just want them to change their
                  attitude.</strong></span></span> The wealth must be more evenly distributed. The <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>political
                  parties that have ruled Honduras for the past 100 years are merely
                  defending the economic elite.</strong></span></span><br><br>SPIEGEL: But now you and coup
                  leader Roberto Micheletti belong to the same party. You are both
                  considered part of the upper class, and you yourself come from a family
                  of wealthy cattle farmers. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When did you discover your heart for the
                  poor?</strong></span></span><br><br>Zelaya: It was a long process of developing awareness. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
                  neoliberal economic model has failed, and we need social policies for
                  the disadvantaged in our society. </strong></span></span>That's why I aim for a new model of
                  development, and part of my administration supported me in that
                  endeavor. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But the neoliberals simply want to expand their wealth, and
                  they have no interest in the country's development. A few large
                  companies dominate the Honduran economy. This plays into the hands of
                  multinational corporations, which control the market, thereby creating
                  even more poverty.</strong></span></span> I believe in entrepreneurship and economic
                  liberalism. But things have to become more equitable, which is why we
                  must amend the laws.<br><br>SPIEGEL: What happens if your efforts to return are unsuccessful? Will you call upon the Hondurans to rebel?<br><br>Zelaya: Under the constitution, the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>people have the right to resistance and rebellion if someone assumes power by force.</strong></span></span><br><br>SPIEGEL: But that creates the threat of civil war.<br><br>Zelaya:
                  There is the same danger if the coup leaders prevail. If that happens,
                  we could face a long conflict, because we will not be brought to our
                  knees. We are not afraid of their guns. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The military in Honduras has
                  only 7,000 men. If we were to take up arms, we would quickly drive away
                  those few soldiers. But we want to unseat the regime in a peaceful and
                  honorable way.</strong></span></span> Women, children, young people, students, workers - we
                  have all <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>joined forces in a civil front against the coup.</strong></span></span> Even my
                  80-year-old mother is taking to the streets and offering peaceful
                  resistance.<br><br>SPIEGEL: The coup regime claims that there is in fact little resistance, and that there have been hardly any dead or injured.<br><br>Zelaya:
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>More than 1,000 people were arrested and are now in prison, and four
                  young people were killed in a protest march.</strong></span></span> I am afraid that even more
                  people have died. We don't know exactly what is happening in the
                  country. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The coup leaders control most of the media.</strong></span></span><br><br>SPIEGEL: Are the armed forces behind the coup government?<br><br>Zelaya:
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The military is divided. Many young officers oppose the coup. They
                  could rise up against the military leadership any day.</strong></span></span><br><br>SPIEGEL: Will you put the coup leaders on trial when you return to Honduras?<br><br>Zelaya: Of course. There should be an international trial, to discourage copycats.<br><br>SPIEGEL: What happens with the elections planned for November? Would you agree to early elections?<br><br>Zelaya:
                  They can take place tomorrow, as far as I'm concerned, but I will not
                  participate. I am working on a big plan for social reforms. We are
                  merely changing the strategy, but the struggle continues.<br><br><em>Interview conducted by <strong>Jens Glüsing.</strong> Translated from the German by Christopher Sultan.</em></p>
