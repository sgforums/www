            <div class='col-md body'>At first, people said homosexuality is sin, then they said it is a sickness, now they say it is a life-style choice. Now, the world is slowly opening up to accept homosexual practices as a norm. Would homosexual marriage one day be in Singapore? Would you find it normal? What would the world be like in future?<br><br>. . . . . . . .<br><br>PARIS : Although it is one of the most divisive issues of the day, homosexual marriages and other forms of same-sex partnerships are gaining acceptance around the world.<br><br>Britain this month will become the fifth country to allow gay 'marriages' on roughly the same basis as heterosexual marriages.<br><br>The Netherlands was the first nation to celebrate gay marriages in April 2001, followed by Belgium in January, 2003, Canada in June and Spain in July.<br><br>In the United States, Massachusetts recognizes gay marriage and the California senate approved it before the bill was vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br><br>Canada legalized gay marriages in June and has already discovered one anomaly after a woman sued for divorce on the grounds of adultery between her husband and another man. A Vancouver court defined adultery as taking place only between men and women.<br><br>Gay marriages have thrown up other legal conundrums, including establishing paternity of a child born in a lesbian wedlock.<br><br>Homosexual marriage in Spain, once one of the world's most staunchly Roman Catholic nations, has called down fulminations from the Vatican, but appears to be supported by a majority of Spaniards, whether straight or gay.<br><br>In Britain, the establishment Church of England has refused to celebrate same-sex unions, even though the gay marriage law comes into effect on Monday.<br><br>In a first for Africa, South Africa's Constitutional Court ruled in favour of same-sex marriages on Thursday and ordered parliament to change "intolerant" laws within a year.<br><br>At a level lower than marriage, many countries recognize same-sex civil unions, with no presumption of sexual involvement, for tax and inheritance purposes.<br><br>Denmark was the first country to allow "registered partnerships" or civil unions followed by the other main Nordic nations. France recognizes a union between any two adults, whether man or woman, in a Pact of Civil Solidarity (PACS). Portugal has had a similar measure on the books since 2001, but Prime Minister Jose Socrates has said his government will not consider gay marriage.<br><br>In the United States also, Vermont and Connecticut recognize same-sex civil unions, while Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey and California allow couples living together the same rights as married couples.<br><br>But many countries reject any kind of union between homosexuals, usually on religious grounds<br><br>Australia's conservative government passed legislation last year that defined marriage as "a union between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others."<br><br>In India, homosexuality is an offence punishable by up to life in prison, and there is no discussion of the issue. Same-sex marriages are prohibited in China and Russia.<br><br>Japan also does not allow gay marriages and prohibits child adoption by homosexuals, although gays can obtain some inheritance and other family rights.<br><br>Thailand has a liberal attitude toward homosexuality, but not to gay marriage. In other countries, such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Afghanistan, it is simply out of the question.<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/181854/1/.html" rel="nofollow">Homosexual</a></div>
