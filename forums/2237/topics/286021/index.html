            <div class='col-md body'>PAMELA ANDERSON<br><br>JUST when you thought the buxom Baywatch actress couldn't do any worse than her ex-husbands, bad-boy rockers Tommy Lee and Kid Rock, she walked down the aisle for the third time with professional poker player and longtime pal Rick Salomon over the weekend.<br><br>Anderson, 40, and Salomon, 39, successfully applied for a marriage licence a week ago.<br><br>Their quickie wedding at Las Vegas' Mirage Hotel was squeezed in between Anderson's two Hans Klok's The Beauty Of Magic shows, reported People magazine.<br><br>She is starring as magician Klok's assistant.<br><br>Salomon was briefly married to actress Shannen Doherty in 2002.<br><br>But he's best known for dating socialite Paris Hilton, and their relationship was memorialised in a sex tape that made rounds on the Internet.<br><br>The pairing of Anderson and Salomon makes complete sense, seeing as both starred in the most scandalous celebrity sex tapes in history.<br><br>Anderson recently revealed on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show of Salomon: 'I paid off a (US$250,000) poker debt with sexual favours, and I fell in love. It's so romantic.'<br><br>But judging from his dubious credentials, Anderson's new man seems to be yet another poor choice on her list of losers.<br><br>According to imdb.com, Salomon blasted Lee for the explicit sex tape he made with Anderson when they were married, comparing it to his own romp with Hilton.<br><br>He said: 'At least Paris looked like she was having fun. Pam won't be wearing sunglasses on our honeymoon.'<br><br>Their whirlwind two-month relationship is just another sign of what Anderson's worried friends describe as increasingly wild behaviour.<br><br>A source told New York Post: 'She parties almost every night. She drinks... and she's got hepatitis C. Her liver is shot but she keeps living this crazy lifestyle. We don't think she understands how serious this is. She has two kids and may not be around to see them grow up at this rate.'<br><br>Anderson is no stranger to tempestuous unions.<br><br>She exchanged vows multiple times with Kid Rock, 36, last year in St Tropez, Detriot, Nashville and Malibu, but the on-off couple split up after four months.<br><br>They are now embroiled in a mudslinging match over a miscarriage which Anderson says she suffered and Kid Rock is denying.<br><br>Anderson divorced first husband, Motley Crue drummer Lee, 45, in 1998 after three years of marriage and two children.<br><br>That year, he was arrested for spousal abuse after assaulting her and was sentenced to six months in jail.<br><br>KYLIE MINOGUE<br><br>She should be so lucky in love - but somehow isn't.<br><br>The 39-year-old singer, who releases her 10th studio album X on 26 Nov, has had a string of high-profile relationships, all resulting in heartbreak.<br><br>She dated actor-singer Jason Donovan in the late '80s after they co-starred as reel lovers in the Australian soap Neighbours.<br><br>He recently spilled the beans about their romance and admitted to being jealous of Minogue's successful music career in his new autobiography Between The Lines: My Story Uncut.<br><br>Minogue, on the other hand, has refused to include any interview with Donovan, 39, for her upcoming fly-on-the-wall documentary film White Diamond.<br><br>In 1989, she dumped Donovan for the late INXS frontman Michael Hutchence, who once said his favourite hobby was 'corrupting Kylie'.<br><br>They remained an item until the drug-addled singer started seeing supermodel Helena Christensen in 1991. Hutchence committed suicide in 1997.<br><br>Minogue moved on to philandering male model James Gooding, 32, before calling it quits after three years.<br><br>But she was devastated and furious when the kiss-and-tell love rat sold his story of infidelity and private details of their love life to the tabloids.<br><br>Then French actor Olivier Martinez entered her life in 2003, causing everyone to speculate that he could finally be The One for unlucky-in-love Minogue.<br><br>They went strong for four years and even battled her breast cancer together, but it was not meant to be.<br><br>Martinez, 41, became romantically linked to Israeli model Sarai Givati, and Minogue is alone again, naturally.<br><br>HALLE BERRY<br><br>You could say the 41-year-old Oscar-winning actress has been a human punching bag. In the early '90s, an abusive ex-boyfriend (rumoured to be actor Wesley Snipes) struck Berry so hard that she lost most of her hearing in her right ear.<br><br>Her first marriage to baseball star David Justice, 41, ended so badly in 1997, she sought a restraining order from him and was so depressed she attempted suicide by sitting in her car inhaling carbon monoxide.<br><br>In 2001, she got hitched to musician Eric Benet, but he turned out to be a sex addict who committed adultery with his old flame. Benet, 41, checked himself into rehab and they enrolled in couples counselling, but eventually parted ways in 2003.<br><br>According to imdb.com, Berry even saw a psychotherapist to help her get over her disastrous track record, and has sworn she will never marry again.<br><br>Indeed, maybe wedding rings have been jinxing her all this time.<br><br>After all, she has been happily attached to male model Gabriel Aubry, 31, since Nov 2005, and is three months pregnant with his baby.</div>
