              <p>An Australian walked out of the district courts a free man on Monday after he was allowed to compound a molestation case, brought against him by a 26-year-old woman.</p>
              <p>James Anthony Woodburn settled the matter by apologising to her in court and paying $10,000 to her. He allegedly grabbed her breast in the shopping area at Marina Bay Sands, at 12.20am, on Oct 15. The 44-year-old regional manager of a marketing firm had also been charged with insulting her modesty by showing her his middle finger at about the same time.</p>
              <p>In his apology, Mr Woodburn - a Singapore permanent resident - said that he was genuinely and truly remorseful of his conduct and deeply regretted his actions.</p>
              <p>The slim, 1.7m-tall woman, with shoulder-length hair, later told reporters that she agreed to compound the matter as she wanted to put the incident behind her</p>

              <p>shouldnt the law breaker be fined n jailed too by the spore government justice system?</p>
              <p>if that didnt happen then spore is indeed a stupid country with stupid judge sleeping on the job.in most countries be it developed or undeveloped..u do a crime..its the slammer!u need anything else ......do it from jail!</p>
              <p>molestation isnt a case where it can be augmeented with monies  then  in a murder case i suppose u can settle out of court too...in which case assasination and civil wars might be settled in the same way as the molestation case too!</p>

              <p>lemme see was there a crime commited here???yes!!either the ang mo molested n broke a law or the girl was telling lies all alomng which then will face a jail term too.</p>
              <p>the tax p-ayers fund this courts n law.by right the judge should have fined the ang mo if he did the crime..if he did it he gets the music even compensating the girl.....so currently the girl just accept $$$$ means that she was telling lies and she could be extorting which is equally jailable.</p>
              <p>funny thing is judge let them both go without getting any $$$$$.judge must think the aircon n building he uses is solar powered n grow out from ground!its all from spore tax payers $$$$$$$ and judge wasted time n $$$$$$ over the case that went no where.</p>

              <p>when i first heard of a compounded molest case i reacted the exact way you do now.</p>
              <p>but after some serious thinking i find it a total waste of brain cells.</p>

              <p>so next time u go out to australia.</p>
              <p>they will laugh at u because they know your high court judge has no balls or forgot to have any initiatives to fix or red up on his law books.even a hillbilly judicial system made up of farmers can outrun and outmatch spore plastic judicial system mounted on a mountain of gold.</p>

              <p>shouldnt the law breaker be fined n jailed too by the spore
              government justice system?</p>
              <p>if that didnt happen then spore is indeed a stupid country with
              stupid judge sleeping on the job.in most countries be it developed
              or undeveloped..u do a crime..its the slammer!u need anything else
              ......do it from jail!</p>
              <p>molestation isnt a case where it can be augmeented with
              monies  then  in a murder case i suppose u can settle out
              of court too...in which case assasination and civil wars might be
              settled in the same way as the molestation case too!</p>
              <p>what is spore??wild wild west??</p>

              <p>murder case settle out of court? must get the victim to agree leh.. how u r going to get the victim to agree to settle out of court in a murder case?</p>
              <p>anyway, it all depend on the victim in the molest case. If the victim want to pursue further, then the judge will sentence the offenders... recently also got another case of waitress i think who accepted S$74000? and donated it to charity.....</p>

              <p><br>so what about kiddnapings??they can be solved best without a court even!the victim would pay plenty n outa court too....</p>
              <p>face it!spore has a screwed up system when things happeneded yes it did n yet the perpetrator was not fined n jailed.</p>
              <p>by law,the acccuser could be jailed for wasting the courts time and for extorting $$$ from someone without just cause.</p>
              <p>so why on earth did they ever need to goto court in first place?they could just kidnap beat each othner up till satis and hand over $$$$ without a police or court in sight ..see what i meanthe law system is not a developed one and was seemed to be made by not very great thinkers who intend to waste peoples time.</p>
