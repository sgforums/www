              <p class="first">WASHINGTON (AFP) - - Nearly one out of two women would rather give up sex for two weeks than go without the Internet, according to a survey released Monday.</p>
              <p>Far fewer men would choose to go without sex, according to the survey of 2,119 adults carried out by the online research firm Harris Interactive and sponsored by Intel Corp., the world's biggest computer chip maker.</p>
              <p>Forty-six percent of the women polled said they would rather go without sex for two weeks than give up access to the Internet for the same period of time, according to the survey, "Internet Reliance in Today's Economy."</p>
              <p>Only 30 percent of men said they would rather forgo intimate relations than cyber ones.</p>
              <p>Ninety-five percent of those surveyed said it is "very important, important or somewhat important" to be able to access the Internet.</p>
              <p>Sixty-five percent of those surveyed rated Internet access above other discretionary spending items such as cable television subscriptions (39 percent), dining out (20 percent), shopping for clothes (18 percent) or a health club membership (10 percent).</p>
              <p>Sixty-one percent of the women surveyed said they would rather give up watching television for two weeks than give up access to the Internet for one week.</p>
              <p>Harris Interactive and Intel said the survey was conducted November 18-20. They did not provide a margin of error for the results.</p>
