              <div><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">WASHINGTON - A United Nations climate change conference in Poland is about to get a surprise from 650 leading scientists who scoff at doomsday reports of man-made global warming - labeling them variously a lie, a hoax and part of a new religion. </span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">In fact, the total number of scientists represented in the report is 12 times the number of U.N. scientists who authored the official IPCC 2007 report.  </span></div>

              <p>I think it's more likely these 650 leading scientists are paid to lie. By not doing anything to at all to solve the global warming issue, developed countries have the most to gain, isn't it?</p>

              <p>Instead of being imprisoned in the perception that global warming is real, why not be open to the possibility that it may just be a scam that, far from saving the environment, is another corporate gimmick.</p>
              <p>After all, in the pre-WWII period, global temperatures rose in an un-industrialised world. After WWII, temperatures fell while the global economy developed. Up till the 1970s, scientists were fearing an ice age. It was during the recession of the 1970s that temperatures again started to rise. And today, the warming is no different. In fact, the warming stopped in 1998. While UN scientists reported that, the IPCC and the MSM continue to engage in doublethink and lie to the public.</p>

              <p>i think i will tend to agree that global warming is a scam.</p>
              <p>what is the percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere anyway? its 0.3%.</p>
              <p>doubling or tripling it will not have much impact, since it will never exceed the 1% mark.</p>
              <p>CO2 gas is inert, unlike oxygen. (increased oxygen concentration will cause increased difficulty in extinguishing fires, since fires will burn more fiercely.)</p>
              <p>you can read Michael Crichton's "State of Fear" for more on the alternative hypothesis that the earth is cooling, instead of warming.</p>
              <p>Take note, although the author presents his ideas in a form of novel, the story is backed up by official reports and studies by scientist.</p>

              <p>there're some reports that say it's just a natural cycle that earth is going through. It's not man-made. That was the explaination for the rise in temperatures too.</p>

              <p><br>Actually there is no evidence that the severity of natural disasters is increasing, only the increased media attention in today's world of instant news. Just like the Vietnam war wasn't really that bad by the standards of wars but the the media in the US blown it out of proportion.</p>
              <p>Furthermore many natural disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes are definitely not caused by global warming but rather the shifting of tectonic plates.</p>

              <p>I agree. Another example of the conditioning power of the MSM monster.</p>
              <p>Why focus on such a harmless factor (we are made of CO2) and ignore weapons like HAARP if you want to narrow down a cause of severe natural disasters.</p>

              <p>Sure, thats in a real greenhouse. On a global scale, the climate has just too many variables for climate models to predict. Ice core data shows that the CO2 lags behind temperatures by 800 years.</p>
              <p>There's a reason why its called climate change and not global warming. Even if climate change is really happening, its probably due to natural causes not the 0.0068% of anthropogenic CO2 that industry emits into the atmosphere.</p>

              <p>It takes a hell lot of energy to heat up the oceans. Think about it, 70% of the earth's surface. Taking the total volume of water... thats why the ice core records show a 800 year lag between temperature and CO2. As the Earth heats up, heating up the oceans, they release CO2. Not the other way round as has been portrayed by the lying MSM.</p>
