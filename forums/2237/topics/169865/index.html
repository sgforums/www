Iran, Syria, HizbÂ’allah, and Hamas are accumulating missiles from Kassams to Shihab 3 missiles.Â”<br><br>Iran was Â“determined to reach nuclear capabilities and obtain ground to ground missiles. It is turning into a regional power. I don't see a real possibility for diplomacy preventing Iran from becoming armed with nuclear weapons. In the coming months, we will witness the end of the abilities of our diplomatic maneuvers, and that of the world, against Iran.Â”<br><br>But FarkashÂ’s dark omen, as with the numerous similar and intensifying alarm bells that have been sounded down the last decade-and-a-half, is expected to go unheeded.<br><br>Like its predecessors since 1991, this Israeli government appears unable or unwilling to withstand the enormous pressure that has consistently been brought to bear by the Gentile nations.<br><br>The world universally insists that Israel move ahead and create the conditions for the birthing of a Palestinian state.<br><br>This demand has remained unwavering and has intensified, despite the terrible number of Jewish lives that have been lost, and the thousands of Israelis who have been mutilated and bereaved since the signing of the Oslo Accords Â– hailed in 1993 as heralding the arrival of peace.<br><br>The Palestinian state-in-the-making would be set up in the Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria Â– the former area the soft underbelly of Israel, the latter two comprising the cradle of IsraelÂ’s nationhood and the mountainous high ground that would tower over what would be left of Israel.<br><br>And while the forces from without squeeze down on the Israeli people, secular forces within the country, apparently blind to the suicide they expect their state to commit, are forging ahead towards next yearÂ’s elections.<br><br>Oozing with self-confidence in his ability and qualifications to secure Israel against the<br><br>Islamic threat, Sharon and his new Kadima Party is gaining massive momentum and drawing like-minded Israelis to him like moths to a candle flame.<br><br>Unless the flame is extinguished, things look increasingly bleak for the country that was supposed to be a haven for the Jewish people, but which has become de facto the most dangerous place for Jews to live on earth today.<br><br>*****<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><span style="color: blue;"> ...... to bring about the destruction of the Jewish state.</span></div>
