            <div class='col-md body'>Finger Scanning Has Biblical Implications, Says Calvary Chapel Founder Chuck Smith<br>Added: Nov 19th, 2006 1:16 PM<br><br>Biometric Scanning Reportedly Used by Millions of Consumers<br>Finger ID Has Biblical Implications, Says Calvary Chapel Founder Chuck Smith<br><br>By James L. Lambert<br><br>SAN DIEGO, CA (AgapePress) - More than 3.3 million consumers now use biometric technology to pay for their purchases at several U.S. retailers, reports Parade Magazine. One prominent church founder shares his thoughts on the biblical implications of such technology.<br><br>"Customers at several retailers can now literally pay by touch," says the magazine in its Nov. 12, 2006 issue. "By placing their finger on a scanner at the checkout and entering their home phone number, these tech-savvy shoppers can deduct the cost of a carton of milk directly from a bank account or credit card." Such futuristic technology, often relegated to scenes in high-tech thrillers or science fiction novels, is available now.<br><br>In a recent exclusive interview, Chuck Smith, founder and senior pastor of the original Calvary Chapel (Costa Mesa, CA), contends that "this development clearly illustrates that we are one step closer to what is described in the Book of Revelation." Smith indicates that "this should be yet another wake-up call from God that we are in the last of the last days. We already know of eye-identification scanning devices and other technology [identification chips for pets, GPS technology] that clearly shows us this."<br><br>Biometric scanning involves the use of automated methods for uniquely recognizing human physical traits. The information is then processed by a numerical algorithm and entered into a database. It is quite different from technology that places something inside the human body to identify a person, such as a microchip.<br><br>With the danger of identity theft, biometric finger identity is marketed to emphasize solutions to security and convenience issues in making financial exchanges. Smith notes that the technology described in Parade is introduced in a manner to make it friendly to the public. "This is just another way of desensitizing the public to the advantages of this new technology," he says. "It's a way for the public to buy into the system."<br><br>While this technology is presently received voluntarily, Pastor Smith emphasizes that there is a difference between this new technology and the mark of the Beast, which is described in the Book of Revelation. The mark referred to in the Bible is not voluntary, he points out; it will be mandated.</div>
