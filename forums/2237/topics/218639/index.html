Tunisia and the UAE have also shown interest.<br><br>All want to build civilian nuclear energy programmes, as they are permitted to under international law. But the sudden rush to nuclear power has raised suspicions that the real intention is to acquire nuclear technology which could be used for the first Arab atomic bomb.<br><br>Â“Some Middle East states, including Egypt, Morocco, Algeria and Saudi Arabia, have shown initial interest [in using] nuclear power primarily for desalination purposes,Â” Tomihiro Taniguch, the deputy director-general of the IAEA, told the business weekly Middle East Economic Digest. He said that they had held preliminary discussions with the governments and that the IAEAÂ’s technical advisory programme would be offered to them to help with studies into creating power plants.<br><br>Mark Fitzpatrick, an expert on nuclear proliferation at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that it was clear that the sudden drive for nuclear expertise was to provide the Arabs with a Â“security hedgeÂ”.<br><br>Â“If Iran was not on the path to a nuclear weapons capability you would probably not see this sudden rush [in the Arab world],Â” he said.<br><br>The announcement by the six nations is a stunning reversal of policy in the Arab world, which had until recently been pressing for a nuclear free Middle East, where only Israel has nuclear weapons.<br><br>Egypt and other North African states can argue with some justification that they need cheap, safe energy for their expanding economies and growing populations at a time of high oil prices.<br><br>The case will be much harder for Saudi Arabia, which sits on the worldÂ’s largest oil reserves. Earlier this year Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Foreign Minister, told The Times that his country opposed the spread of nuclear power and weapons in the Arab world.<br><br>Since then, however, the Iranians have accelerated their nuclear power and enrichment programmes.</div>
