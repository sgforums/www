              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slVX-301Ykw&amp;feature=related">Residents of a remote Chinese village are hoping that DNA tests will
              prove one of history's most unlikely legends — that they are descended
              from Roman legionaries lost in antiquity.</a></p>
              <p>Scientists
              have taken blood samples from 93 people living in and around Liqian, a
              settlement in north-western China on the fringes of the Gobi desert,
              more than 200 miles from the nearest city.</p>
              <p>They are
              seeking an explanation for the unusual number of local people with
              western characteristics — green eyes, big noses, and even blonde hair —
              mixed with traditional Chinese features.</p>
              <p>"I really
              think we are descended from the Romans," said Song Guorong, 48, who
              with his wavy hair, six-foot frame and strikingly long, hooked nose
              stands out from his short, round-faced office colleagues.</p>
              <p>"There
              are the residents with these special features, and then there are also
              historical records about the existence of these people long ago," he
              said.</p>
              <p>Studies claiming that Liqian has Roman ancestry
              have greatly excited the impoverished county in which it is situated.
              The village is now overlooked by a pillared portico, in the hope of
              attracting tourists. A statue at the entrance of the nearby county
              town, Yongchang, shows a Roman legionary standing next to a Confucian
              scholar and a Muslim woman, as a symbol of racial harmony.</p>
              <p>Even entrepreneurs have caught on: in "Imperial City Entertainment Street" there is a Caesar Karaoke bar.</p>
              <p>The
              town's link with Rome was first suggested by a professor of Chinese
              history at Oxford in the 1950s. Homer Dubs pulled together stories from
              the official histories, which said that Liqian was founded by soldiers
              captured in a war between the Chinese and the Huns in 36BC, and the
              legend of the missing army of Marcus Crassus, a Roman general.</p>
              <p>In
              53BC Crassus was defeated disastrously and beheaded by the Parthians, a
              tribe occupying what is now Iran, putting an end to Rome's eastward
              expansion.</p>
              <p>But stories persisted that 145 Romans were
              taken captive and wandered the region for years. Prof Dubs theorised
              that they made their way as a mercenary troop eastwards, which was how
              a troop "with a fish-scale formation" came to be captured by the
              Chinese 17 years later.</p>
              <p>He said the "fish-scale
              formation" was a reference to the Roman "tortoise", a phalanx protected
              by shields on all sides and from above. Gu Jianming, who lives near
              Liqian, said it had come as a surprise to be told he might be descended
              from a European imperial army. But then the birth of his daughter was
              also a surprise. Gu Meina, now six, was born with a shock of blonde
              hair. "We shaved it off a month after she was born but it just grew
              back the same colour," he said. "At school they call her 'yellow hair'.
              Before we were told about the Romans, we had no idea about this. We are
              poor and have no family temple, so we don't know about our ancestors."</p>
              <p>Another
              resident, Cai Junnian, 38, said his ruddy skin and green eyes meant he
              was now nicknamed Cai Luoma, or Cai the Roman, by friends. He has
              become a local celebrity, and was recently flown to the Italian
              consulate in Shanghai to meet his supposed relatives. The professor's
              hypothesis took almost 40 years to reach China. During Chairman Mao's
              rule, ideas of foreign ancestry were not ideologically welcome and the
              story was suppressed.</p>
              <p>Mr Cai said his
              great-grandfather told him that there were Roman tombs in the Qilian
              mountains a day and a half's walk away, but he had never connected them
              to the unusual appearance he inherited from his father. "People thought
              I had a skin problem," he said.</p>
              <p>The blood tests are
              part of a project undertaken by scientists and historians after local
              authorities loosened control over genetic research. The results will be
              published in a scientific journal. But Prof Xie Xiaodong, a geneticist
              from Lanzhou University, cautioned against over enthusiasm.</p>
              <p>"Even
              if they are descendants of the Roman empire, it doesn't mean they are
              necessarily from the Roman army," he said. "The empire covered a large
              area. Many soldiers were recruited locally, so anything is possible."</p>
              <p>The
              issue has split the university's history department, with some scholars
              supporting the claim, some rejecting it. Prof Wang Shaokuan poured
              scorn on Prof Dubs's thesis, saying the Huns themselves included
              Caucasians, Asians and Mongols.</p>

              <p>u see now how come central asia is lidat? Kazakh &amp; Kygryz on the northeastern fringe of central asia are mongoloid stock, Uygur and Uzbek on the central-southern central asia are mongoloid-caucasoid stock, Turkmen and Tajik are caucasoid stock</p>
              <p>and out of the above all, only the Tajik speak a different language from the rest of them. the tajik speaks the iranian branch of the language and not the altaic family</p>
              <p>in the history buddhist monks like å®‰ä¸–é«˜ and é¸ æ‘©ç½—ä»€ were also angmo looking and came from central asia countries of that time</p>
