Lambert<br>January 20, 2006<br><br>(AgapePress) - According to reports inside the porn industry, parents who already have to compete against earbuds pumping music directly into their children's ears may soon be facing an even more frightening opponent: pornographic images on video-capable iPods.<br><br>Parents are being warned of the smut industry's effort to make hard-core pornographic imagery available to users of Apple Computer's iPod and similar portable video devices. The popularity of Apple's new video-capable portable technology has driven porn industry providers to introduce iPod-compatible video content. Already there are at least three companies with divisions dedicated solely to adult content for these portable players. According to MacWorld magazine, Apple "already hosts an [adult-oriented] radio show on its own podcast directory."<br><br>Porn industry insiders believe they can cash in on the new technology by providing pornographic videos specifically matched for iPods. David Joseph recently told Adult Video News that "technology gives us the opportunity to provide this service. We're calling this 'porn on the pod.'"<br><br>Patrick Trueman, a former prosecutor for the U.S. Department of Justice, believes that "Apple has the responsibility to avoid providing porn content." He stresses that "the public [should] turn against them if they do not." Knowing that children are especially vulnerable to the portable forms of transmission iPods can provide, Trueman states that the government should require companies to provide some sort of digital transfer management so parents can control content.<br><br>When asked this week if they planned on providing such safeguards, an Apple spokesperson responded with no comment.<br><br>Dr. Judith Reisman, a consultant who worked with the Commission on Pornography in the mid-1980s, is equally as concerned as Trueman with this development. Reisman believes "iPods will bring pornography into the classrooms, sanctuaries, courtrooms, hospitals, libraries, everywhere. It is well past time for [government regulation] to catch up with runaway technology."<br><br>Other pro-family advocates are expressing similar concerns. Among them is Tim Wildmon, president of the Tupelo, Mississippi-based American Family Association, who says Apple needs to "demonstrate corporate responsibility" to the families of America.<br><br>"They need to offer safeguard alternatives for iPod users," Wildmon says. "By offering no comment, they show no sympathy to the concerns of many American families."<br><br>Syndicated radio talk-show host Paul McGuire concurs. "Parents need to understand that the porno industry has now declared all-out war on your family and your kids," he says. McGuire is particularly annoyed that the adult industry is targeting a technology that is popular with children. "Parents need to be warned," he adds.<br><br>Bob Knight, director of the Culture and Family Institute, is more emphatic. "This is a nightmare for parents who are trying to protect their kids from early exposure to porn," Knight says. "In terms of delivering smut, the hand-held gadgets are already making the Internet look like a quaint, old steam engine.<br><br>"Parents need to know that they are potentially putting an X-rated porn shop right into their kid's hands when they buy these [portable video players] for them."<br><br>Knight summarizes by saying that "parents need to put pressure on companies to offer tamper-proof blocking -- and Congress needs to step in as well if the makers don't respond."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
