It had been essentially buried beneath the preservation of glaciers until last year when Iran recorded the hottest year on record which melted some of the snowcap revealing 450 by 75-foot footprint of the Â“object.Â”<br><br>NoahÂ’s Ark was claimed to be found in Northern Iran rather than Turkey. Over a thousand expeditions had previously scoured TurkeyÂ’s Mt. Ararat, but by following the precise language of the Bible, Cornuke found what is believed to be NoahÂ’s Ark, nearly in tact. TurkeyÂ’s Mt. Ararat was incorrect because Marco Polo named the large mountain during his journeys in the 13th century. Through mapping scriptures in Genesis with ancient maps, Cornuke pieced together the clues and found where the Ararat Mountain Range made home for NoahÂ’s Ark in Northern Iran not far from Turkey. Bob Cornuke has been at the center of several controversies over his past findings as he has come at odds with secular scholars, but several people who I know personally were on this expedition as well as some credible, internationally known heads of Christian ministries. Cornuke and the participants are careful to not say emphatically that they found NoahÂ’s Ark, but have taken extensive documentation to present their facts for both the public, and the Biblical and scientific communities.<br><br>After crawling on hands and knees miles above the earthÂ’s surface in four below zero weather, the expedition found an altar, which could very well be the altar Noah built because it was made from the same materials they later found in the Ark. They found grapevines over two inches think in the area, of which the DNA from the grapes is the oldest known to man. Genesis 9:20 says that Noah planted a vineyard. But most amazing was the ark itself. It was found in sections, somewhat like a house that had collapsed over the years. Sections of petrified wood 12 to 14 feet high and 40 feet long were found. They found a huge pile of timber, thought to be floors or walls, in four-to-six foot sections.<br><br>Geologists took nine samples of the ark under the strict eye of a video team for analysis by the Smithsonian Institute. Over 23,000 feet of video was taken and will be released to the public. You can get your first glimpse of it on Fox News with John Kasich Saturday at 8:00pm Eastern time, according to the Cornuke team. The expedition members hope to spark debate over the Ark; hope to show that the Bible is accurate and true; and hope that people will come to know Christ through the truth that they have revealed. In John 8:32, Jesus said, Â“And you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.Â” May you be revived and energized by the possibility of this wonderful discovery that there is one God and His truth reigns forever.<br><br>=============<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Comments??</span></div>
