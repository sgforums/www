Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian Church held banners saying: "Be sure your sin will find you out", and "Do not be deceived, homosexuals will not inherit the Kingdom of God". But in a series of exchanges, supporters of gay rights responded to their critics with humour.<br><br>"You need to turn yourself away from your sinful lifestyle. YouÂ’re an abomination before God," the Rev. James Dawson, a Scottish vicar, told one lesbian couple as they walked past.<br><br>"You would be so lucky to have this lady, love," said the woman, referring to her partner. "IÂ’ll see you at the gates of heaven."<br><br>Others among the crowd carried posters mocking reactionary views, with the slogans: "Earth is flat" and "Bring back slavery".<br><br>"If there was a protest like this in London or Manchester, these people would be laughed off the street," said Andrew Thompson of Belfast Pride, a gay rights group, who added that Northern Ireland, despite an increase in homophobic crime, was becoming more tolerant.<br><br>"WeÂ’ve had 30 years of mindless crap here, but now more and more people are saying Â’LetÂ’s get on with life, letÂ’s live and let live,'" said Mr Thompson.<br><br>Ms Close and Ms Sickels were the first of three homosexual couples - one male, two female - scheduled to register their civil partnerships in Belfast today.<br><br>Northern Ireland was the last part of the UK to legalise homosexuality - in 1982 - but the first, because of the shorter registration period, to allow civil partnerships. Today's ceremonies come one day before the partnerships are legal in Scotland, and two days before the law comes into effect in England and Wales.<br><br>The new civil partnership law gives gay couples the same property and inheritance rights as married heterosexuals and entitles them to the same pension, immigration and tax benefits.<br><br>In all, 687 civil partnerships, including the union of Sir Elton John and his partner David Furnish, are due to be formed on Wednesday, the General Register Office said. Westminster will sign in the most new couples, with 20 couples due to be joined.<br><br>After a twenty-minute ceremony and an exchange of platinum rings to the tune of Dolly PartonÂ’s "Touch Your Woman", Ms Close and Ms Sickels emerged, legally bound, quickly to face the cameras once again.<br><br>"We are delighted. HereÂ’s to many more," said Ms Sickels, who is 27.<br><br>Marie Quiery, a friend of the couple, called the registration "moving and... very emotional".<br><br>"Grainne and ShannonÂ’s families were there and their work colleagues, their friends, their heterosexual friends, their gay and lesbian friends," she said. "It was a lovely occasion."<br><br>The festivities continued after Ms Close and Ms Sickels and their guests had driven away. No sooner had the crowds dispersed when a pink stretch limousine drew up at the City Hall carrying Christopher Flanagan and Henry Kane, Britain's first male couple to form a civil union.<br><br>Mr Flanagan and Mr Kane wore matching white morning suit jackets, black trousers and red cravats. The couple will spend their honeymoon in Gran Canaria.</div>
