If the promise of 'Never Again' supersedes the price of oil then the time for international indifference and hesitation in the face of the Iranian threat has long passed," the foreign minister said. Livni received a standing ovation by GA delegates at the conclusion of her remarks.<br><br>"Last summer, we experienced a confrontation between Israel and Iran. Though the war took place in Lebanon, it was the case of a rogue State, Iran, and its proxy, the Hizbullah, abusing a weak State, Lebanon, to advance a radical and hate-filled agenda," Livni said.<br><br>Several Israeli ministers are in attendance at this year's GA, whose theme is "Together on the Front Line: One People, One Destiny." The message from the ministers, including Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Tourism Minister Isaac Herzog and Education Minister Yuli Tamir, will first and foremost be one of thanks to US Jewry for their financial, physical, and moral support during and after the latest war in Lebanon.<br><br>"I came here to say thank you. It is important for us to know that we are not alone. During the war we saw our Jewish brothers and sisters stepping up to help - organizing rallies, coming on solidarity missions, university scholarships for students called up for army duty, air-conditioners for bomb shelters, camps for the children of the north and so much more, contributing with extraordinary generosity and thoughtfulness - with unconditional kindness," Livni said.<br><br>The foreign minister also addressed the issue of ties between Israel and the Diaspora, saying there was a need to foster the relationship and not take it for granted.<br><br>"As an Israeli, I have to ask myself whether we are not in danger of creating a new Israeli identity that feels removed from its Jewish heritage, and a result, from the Jewish Diaspora. I am sure, too, that you ask yourselves whether there is a risk that Jewish identity in the Diaspora is evolving in such a way that the deep connection to Israel may, in time, no longer be one of its central pillars."<br><br>"I believe strongly that we share a responsibility to prevent a rift developing between Israeli identity and Jewish identity. Together, we need to ensure that Jewish children throughout the Diaspora see Israel as their home, just as the Jewish children of Israel must see you as their family," Livni said.<br><br>Livni also wished all the newly elected and the returning Members of Congress "Mazal Tov" and said the special relationship between Israel and the United States crosses party lines.<br><br>Also speaking at the event, Jewish Agency Chairman Ze'ev Bielsky said US Jews "were there for us [Israelis] when we needed you."<br><br>Bielsky added that due to financial assistance from the Jewish Federations, and through the UJC, the Jewish Agency was able to evacuate 40,000 Israeli children from "the line of fire in the North" to the center of the country. Bielsky added that there were plans afoot to provide scholarships to students wishing to study in educational institutions in northern Israel. "Our priority now is to strengthen the Galilee, the Negev and Jerusalem," Bielsky said.<br><br>The UJC managed to raise $342 million for the Israel Emergency Campaign during the war.<br>The plenary session drew 2,600 of 5,000 GA participants, and culminated with a stirring recital of "Hatikvah," Israel's national anthem, by a jazz saxophonist, that brought the crowd to its feet, singing.<br><br>The plenary also featured an array of political and public leaders and entertainment figures, including actors Jeff Goldblum, Mare Winningham and Jon Voight; screenwriter and filmmaker Dan Gordon; musicians Debbie Friedman, Mike Burstyn, Julie Silver and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.</div>
