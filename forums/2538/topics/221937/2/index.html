            <div class='col-md body'>ok now regarding foot drills in NCDCC...<br><br>there has been alot of hoo-haa on who is right and who is wrong.... so i'm here to clear everything up....<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>which standard of foot drills do we follow?</strong></span><br>we are NCDCC (part of Home Team Cadet Corp HQ "HTCC HQ" as well as MOE)<br>therefore we do not come strictly under Singapore Civil Defence Force, we just learn their Civil Defence skills and knowledge....<br><br>Singapore Civil Defence Force drills come mainly in form of following the army styled foot drill manual...<br>However, being under the NCDCC, we do not follow the army terms of foot drills... because we are under the HTCC HQ, we follow what has been thought from HTCC HQ, therefore we strictly come under the Singapore Police Force (SPF) standards of foot drills...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>clarification on check-in-bang</strong></span><br>the term check-in-bang is not for people with short legs, and also NCDCC are not the first to use it as Police trainees in Home Team Academy and back at Old Police Academy have been using this standard for a very long time....<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the difference between [check-1-bang] &amp; [check-in-bang]</strong></span><br>check-1-bang... --&gt; at the point of "1", you take one more step with you're left foot forward, overshooting the position of the right foot, before coming to a compete halt...<br><br>check-in-bang... --&gt; at the point of "in", you actually "slide" your left foot so that it coincides its position together with the right foot before coming to a complete halt...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>so why do we use check-in-bang?</strong></span><br>the reason is clear... people marching have to maintain their "one arm and 3 inches" spacing from the person infront... by using "check-in-bang" we actually get to visualise that every one would reach the spot of halting before they actually commence on the bang.<br><br>if you use "check-1-bang", you can never tell where is the spot that they will eventually halt on BECAUSE everybody doesn't have a constant spacing once you "bang"... literally put it this way... soem people might take a bigger step at "1", some people might take a shorter step... therefore there is inconsistency, yes you may halt together, but the dressing of the squad at halt position would be TOTALLY off...<br><br>so yeah... hope this can clarify on the drills... anything can message me and i'll try to answer as much as i can...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Thanks</div></blockquote>you will just be more focused on the foot drill categories such as the proficiency badges mentioned Bronze, Silver and Gold...<br>I think it is more than enough to learn foot drills as NCDCC does not incorporate other forms of drills in its parade...<br><br>There is no standard no.1 uniform yet for NCDCC although many have seen SCDF wearing number 1 uniform...<br><br>also you must understand that the NCDCC does not have any sort of standard weapon to carry.... I don't think we want to carry an Axe, Fire Hose, Impulse Gun, Miz Gun, First Aid set whilst wearing our number 1... neither would we want to wear CA suits and march...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>and in the recent magazine edition of 995, i saw a picture of 2 SCDF officers in number 1 attires, one holding a "lance-guard" staff and the other holding the miz-gun... so i believe there are some sort of weapon drills...<br><br>NCDCC will be hoping to push for a confirmed number 1 uniform... and in future parades i shall be requesting for NCDCC to learn such movements as<br>- Flag Drills<br>- Sword Drills<br>- Slow March Drills<br>- maybe "Miz gun" Drills<br><br>the drills i shall refer back with Mr Firdous from the police side as to how the procedure goes... only the 4 drills above stated as well as the basic knowledge of foot drills shall be implemented in NCDCC...<br><br>There will also be a standard of simple conduction of parades where some of you will be placed as:<br>- "Parade Markers" for March Pass<br>- "Turn Out Guard" for Arrival of Guest Of Honour (GOH)<br>- "Officer In Attendance" for opening GOH cardoor<br>- "Flag Bearer" for raising or lowering flags<br><br>However, drills such as:<br>- Rifle Drills - M16<br>- Rifle Drills- SAR21<br>- Rifle Drills- HK-MP5<br>- Funeral Drills<br>- Baton Drills<br>even Wedding Drills will not be required to be taught in NCDCC as they are irrelevant to subject matters.<br><br>I've done all the drills mentioned here already except for the Lance-Guard drills... so i guess i will be able to help NCDCC with the other strings of drills during my stay with NCDCC...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

FI Firdous made the commands much more simpler to understand... he changed it to: "Memberi hormat semasa berjalan, ke kanan, hormat!"<br><br>by doing this... he removed such words that are not really required for the full commands such as:<br>1. "Akan" = which means "will"<br>Reason: "memberi hormat semasa berjalan" already means giving salutation on the march, by adding "akan"... it just makes the command longer when we already know what it means...<br><br>2. "Hormat x3" = if you realise, the old command has got the text "hormat" 3 times... with a new improvised drill command, FI Firdous made it much more simpler to say...<br><br>so yeah, easier to say that he is the right man to ask for drills... haha, plus his 25 years experience in NDP should be more than sufficient...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks dude!<br><br>Well, I believe the army has many more drills. BTW, do you guys have any idea wads the command for Pace stick drill?

Identifier, or who is to follow the command.

This is as true in the United States armed forces as in other services; however, the accent of the commander often leads this to be heard as simply huh on commands such as "Present Arms" and "Order Arms."
