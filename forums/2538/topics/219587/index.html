            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>About NCDCC:<br>National Civil Defence Cadet Corps, or NCDCC in short has been introduced in 12 schools since January 2005. For this pilot phase, 38 cadets  completed the very first NCO Course while 22 teachers were commissioned as  the  pioneer batch  of  NCDCC officers after their completion of  the first Officer Basic Course.<br><br>NCDCC Flag &amp; Crest:<br>The NCDCC Crest follows closely to the crest of the parent organisation, SCDF.<br>The international Civil Defence triangle features prominently in the crest. The equilateral blue triangle symbolizes the three main areas of Civil Defence Â— <strong>Fire Safety</strong>, <strong>First Aid</strong>, and <strong>Rescue</strong> and <strong>Evacuation</strong>.<br><br>Our state shield is set on the triangle, which is garlanded by a laurel of leaves, signifying the formal status of the SCDF as a national organisation.<br><br>The green laurel, with a red ribbon, represents the honour of service in the Civil Defence. These are supported by a blue banner with the white inscriptions "NCDCCÂ” which stands for National Civil Defence Cadet Corps. Blue, the colour of the SCDF, stands for loyalty and dedication to the nation and citizens.<br><br>Organisation:<br>HQ NCDCC comprises the Commandant's office, the Operations Branch as well as the Training Branch which are co-located with NPCC office at the Police academy. HQ NCDCC oversees and supervises day to day running of NCDCC related training or activities in the respective schools which have introduced the NCDCC Scheme. The Commandant is Lieutenant-Colonel Lim Kah Seng, a SCDF regular officer. The Head of Operations Branch is A/MAJ(NCDCC) Eugin Wong while A/MAJ (NCDCC) Lim Chien Chee, John is the Head of Training Branch.<br><br>Mission:<br>To nurture and develop our youths into resilient and responsible citizens through innovative and challenging CD activities.<br><br>Main Objectives:<br>Recognising the need to nurture cadets who are resilient, rugged and responsible citizens,  NCDCC seeks to achieve  3 objectives  through its activities. The objectives are:<br><br><strong>Imparting CD Knowledge and Skills.</strong><br><br><strong>Developing and Molding of Character and Leadership.</strong><br><br><strong>Imbue Awareness of Homeland Security through National Education<br>and Community Service.</strong><br><br><strong>Â“Imparting CD Knowledge and Skills.."</strong><br>Cadets  are  expected  to  be  proficient  in  basic  Civil  Defence   knowledge  and   also competent in Civil Defence Skills. The achievement of this expectation would  render our cadets to be useful citizens who are able to contribute to the society in times of crisis. Over time, it is hoped that NCDCC cadets can use the basic  knowledge and skills  that  they  have learnt to further their careers in SCDF where they can actively help  the country  and  the Force to   achieve  its  goal, to  " <strong>Protect  and  Serve</strong>  Â” Singapore  and  the  International community at large.<br><br><strong>Â“Developing and Molding of Character and Leadership.."</strong><br>In the course of  their training in NCDCC, ample opportunities would be created for cadets to be practicing leaders. Real life learning through hands on experience  in leading  would mould the cadets into sensible, competent leaders with a regard for the people  they lead and serve .  This  rite  of  passage  to  leadership  also  helps  in  character  building  and adoption of the right  values.<br><br><strong>Â“Imbue Awareness of Homeland Security through National Education and Community Service..Â”</strong><br>Like  many  Uniformed  Group  organisations,  NCDCC  has   a  responsibility  to   create awareness towards homeland security to provide a safer and more secure nation for all to live in. Proactive National Education measures  and  service learning  through community service would contribute to Total Defence as cadets feel a sense of being  a  stakeholder of  this sovereign state they call home.<br><br>Motto:<br><strong>We Learn, We Lead and We Serve</strong><br><br>NCDCC members always strive to Learn as many skills and get as much knowledge as possible so as to be able to Lead  fellow cadets and ultimately become responsible leaders in the community. They will then in turn Serve the society as a whole. The learning cycle will continue to evolve to a higher plane of achievement. The Motto will serve as our guiding principle for all training and activities organized by NCDCC.<br><br>5 Core Values:<br>Every Uniformed Group holds dear to its core training, a set of values and ideals that steer them in  the direction that has been charted by the mission. The core values of  NCDCC can be drawn from it's initials, forming an acronym. The explanation for each value is found below.<br><br><strong>N - Noble<br>C - Caring<br>D - Disciplined<br>C - Courageous<br>C - Committed</strong><br><br><strong>Noble</strong><br>The  value  of   being  Noble is to create a sense of empathy and chivalry in cadets. To remind them to put others before self. That acts of selflessness are valued, to protect and respect the weak and underprivileged for the benefit of the community at large.<br><br><strong>Caring</strong><br>Caring cadets are a vision of NCDCC. To be able to create an awareness of the needs of others   and environment. This awareness would translate into cadets with  an understanding about the need to be concerned about the world that they live in.<br><br><strong>Disciplined</strong><br>The hallmark of all Uniformed Group organisations. We are no different in this aspect. To enforce a   high  level of  discipline  in  regimentation and personal self. Cadets are to be disciplined in behaviour and mental thoughts. To be able to uphold and stick firm by the values that we believe in.<br><br><strong>Courageous</strong><br>Courage  in  many  forms is desired from NCDCC cadets. Courage in the  face  of  trying times to take the lead to make things happen and also the  moral courage to do the right thing even when pressured to do otherwise.<br><br><strong>Committed</strong><br>An important value in these times where changes are constant and decisions made may waiver at the slightest influence. Cadets should be able to stay focused and committed to their goals even if there are obstacles. Cadets should also be dependable and reliable in their commitments to both the community and nation.<br></div>
