            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by edyeo123:</div><div class="quote_body">Does NCDCC have no.1 uniform and wears them? NCC &amp; NPCC have one.<br><br>The picture below is the SCDF no.1 uniform.<br><img src="http://www.scdf.gov.sg/images/job_seekers/p_no1.jpg"></div></blockquote>I undestand that NCDCC is in discussion with its parent organisation, SCDF, regarding No. 1 uniform. This is a major step and accomplisment for a CCA which is 3 years old (and still growing). Certain points still stick out like: "NCC and NPCC cadets carry rifles and officers carry swords, so what can NCDCC cadets and officers hold instead?". Of course you can say cadets carry mist guns, but what about officers? I'm not sure but, officers carrying swords may not be a idea which may be well suited, since the nature of SCDF is to protect and safe lifes and properties.<br><br>Anyway, how often does SCDF wear No. 1 uniform? Singaporeans don't really get to see it in major national events like NDP.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I understand, SCDF doesn't wear the number 1 uniform in the NDP as it is not part of the guard of honour. This is because SCDF doesn't bear arms unlike the SAF and SPF. Thus it cannot be part of the GOH whose drills require the shooting of their weapons such as the SAR21 for SAF and the rifle for police.<br><br>However, the SCDF is no less important than the other organisations. While SCDF as we know it was formed completely in 1992, it has come a long way since then.   In 1997, SCDF was made the incident manager for any civil emergency, meaning that instead of the police (which was formerly the incident manager for civil emergencies) the SCDF does the command and control during such a situation. This exemplified in the nicoll highway collapse of 2004.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An undisclosed but definately reliable source has preliminary released that NCDCC's No. 1 Uniform is now in Yellow-Green zone.<br><br>The source said that red means nothing being done, yellow means being looked into and green means all systems go.<br><br>On further explanation, it seems that SCDF's Comissioner has approved in principal that NCDCC can wear No. 1. However the soruce said that that the idea of No. 1 has to be looked into and developed.<br><br>Cadets will carry mist guns and cadet officers and officers will carry swords.<br><br>However, due to the fact that the mist gun has a water inlet, reconfiguration of certain drills or reconfiguration of the gun will have to be looked into. Also attire wise, the head gear and bottom remains a question. (the top is white long sleeves, same as the other 2 national UGs) For sword drills, it would most likely follow what is available now.<br><br>For the concept to be further approved, it is hinted that a drill squad will be formed for experimental purpose of the No. 1 uniform.<br><br>In tandem with its sister national UGs (presuming there are no approval hiccups), certain requirements would also be in place before a unit can get approval to loan the No. 1 uniform.<br><br>Of course it goes without saying, resources for such a development will be needed. In addition, if and when the No. 1 uniform is approved, NCDCC would need funds to get the necessary for loaning of the No. 1 uniform to its units.</div>
