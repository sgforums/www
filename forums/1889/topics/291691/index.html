Its not Louis Armstrong, he was Neil Armstrong. And you are right, he did not convert. But you know rumors/myths are inevitable.<br></strong><br><br><strong> About Pigs and Dogs </strong><br>The proof of this is the Hadeeth of the Prophet Â– SallAllahu 'alahi wa-sallam Â– where he said:<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>"If a dog licks in the utensils of one of you, then he should wash it seven times, one of them with sand." </span><br><br>The Hanbalis included the najaasah of pig in the same ruling by way of Qiyas (analogical deduction) over a dog. In our time, sand has been replaced with soap and detergent etc, and surely they are better at cleaning then sand, and Allah knows best. An important point to note and remember is that Ghasl or washing means for water to run over a surface, whereas al-Mash or wiping means for one to wipe his wet hand over a surface.<br><br>P.S I am sure everyone knows that pork is forbidden for consumption thus i wont post the explanation for that.<br><br><strong>As for hair dyeing: </strong><br><br>Pure black dye is not permissible. Rasulullah "There will be people who will come later (in my Ummah) and apply black dye. They will not even smell the fragrance of paradise." (Abu Dawood). However, it is permissible for a Mujaahid (warrior) to apply black dye in order to give the impression of being young. (Jawahirul Fiqh vol 2 pg. 421)<br><br><strong>What is the ruling on dying hair? </strong><br><br>The ruling on dying hair differs for men and women. For men, it is forbidden except for two occassions, which are:<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>1)       OneÂ’s hair has turned grey at a young age in which case it is permissible to dye it to its original colour, i.e, black.<br><br>2)       OneÂ’s hair has turned grey due to old age in which case it is permissible to dye it other than the colour black.<br><br>3)       When one is in war in which case it is permissible to dye oneÂ’s hair black to deceive the enemy.</span><br><br>As for women, they are permitted to dye their hair with any colour at any time if the following conditions are observed:<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>1)       The hair colour used is within the natural colours of hair that has been created by Allah s.w.t such as brown, blonde, black and auburn.<br><br>2)       The hair must not be exposed to men who are not mahram.<br><br>3)       If she is married, initial permission from the husband must be obtained first.<br></span><br><strong><br>To dye the hair any other color besides black e.g. Mehndi or Katm (type of grass) is permissible. This was the practice of Rasulullah and the Sahaba, Radi-Allahu anhum. (Jawahirul Fiqh vol 2 pg 421).<br></strong><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>The general conditions for dying hair are that the product used must not contain any najis and it must not be waterproof. This is to ensure that water from wudhuÂ’ and ghusl reaches the hair sufficiently. Products that have the Â“HalalÂ” sign on it do not contain any najis but they may be waterproof.<br></span><br><br><strong> Mister, i am not being old-fashioned here. Im just following the laws. Please refer to your nearest local Islamic Center/Mosque, theres no use getting information from a Non-Muslim or those with no proper education. </strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">About the Alcohol, i know, you cant consume it but you do can use it for whatever other reasons. It has to be synthetic though. The naturally-made Alcohol is a total haraam. FYI, synthetic meaning, the Alcohol is made chemically.<br><br>In all, Muslims, can dye their hair with permitted hair dyes like henna that is not waterproof. And he/she must avoid the color of his/her natural color. Like if i am a blond, i am forbidden from dying my hair yellow except for if my hair greys too early. This is to avoid the person from forgetting that we are all getting old. It serves like a reminder. </span><br><br></span></div>
