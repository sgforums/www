Go and read up more about the difference between political extremism disguised as Islam by the media, and real debates about the future of Islamic thought by progressive scholars in the Middle East, America and Britain.<br><br>Just because you see what the mainstream global media wants you to see, doesn't mean the reality is not there.<br><br>And starting a debate without understanding the place that religion has in the heart and mind of a practising Muslim, and assuming that Islam and other religions are weighed equally by different individuals in their daily lives, is not very wise.<br><br>It's about the language and assumptions used. If you come to the negotiation table with a huge chip on your shoulder and are not prepared to put aside your hangups or assumptions for even that period of time, any debate will be a waste of time.<br><br>No one is forcing you to agree with anything, it's all about respecting the differences and trying to find the common ground.<br><br>If there's no room for debate, then this forum might very well be an illusion.
