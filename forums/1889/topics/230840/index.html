            <div class='col-md body'>Visiting A Mosque in Cambodia<br><br>This writerÂ’s work in Cambodia as an independent<br>volunteer over the last 15 months has involved<br>teaching a daily Yoga and Buddhism class at the local<br>provincial prison from Monday to Friday each morning<br>at 9 a.m.<br><br>For many of the men who come to this class, it is<br>their only opportunity to leave their large rooms that<br>serve as a confinement area for them.<br><br>The conditions in which they must live are quite poor<br>compared to what prisoners in the west experience. In<br>fact, seeing how they are confined makes the prisons<br>of the west look like institutions of enlightenment<br>and higher learning.<br><br>My work in teaching these men has of course led me to<br>get to know them and their situations and individual<br>stories better and I have become interested in<br>assisting them in other ways that are possible for me<br>to do.<br><br>This has started to include things such as providing<br>health and educational resources for them.<br><br>This includes actions such as providing notebooks,<br>pens and English language material so they can learn<br>and improve their English, talcum powder and medicine<br>to deal with skin problems, mats for them to sleep on<br>and shirts, blankets and jackets to keep them warm.<br><br>We have also, based on past experiences with life, men<br>and prisoners recognized that every man be given the<br>opportunity to learn about, study and practice his or<br>her religion or spiritual belief.<br><br>It was with this in mind that during our recent stay<br>there, we attempted to find a spiritual teacher and<br>advisor for the five Muslims in the prison.<br><br>This necessitated a visit to a local mosque.<br><br>Having been involved with Islam in the past and<br>visited mosques in Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan,<br>Bangladesh and Nepal, among other countries, I was<br>quite happy with the idea of visiting a mosque, but my<br>young Cambodian translator was quite nervous about it.<br><br>He had an unreasonable fear, as we all do or have had<br>from time to time, in thinking that something was<br>threatening to his person, that being visiting a<br>mosque.<br><br>He was surprised when upon the visit to  mosque and<br>meeting with the local Muslims who were there that<br>they were so friendly and supportive of both our idea<br>and work.<br><br>This is the way it is in life, that being that when we<br>overcome our fear and ignorance, we can see and learn<br>something new, both about ourselves and others that is<br>important to experience.<br><br>Any kind of fear, or anger and ill Â– will, or an<br>ongoing critical attitude to and condemnation of<br>others does nothing more then keep us and the world in<br>ignorance.<br><br>If we can open our heart and mind just a little bit to<br>others and see where they are coming from with greater<br>compassion and clarity, we can experience something<br>that will give us greater understanding about<br>ourselves and life, and make us wiser and more<br>peaceful and focused along the way.<br><br>Â©2007 John C.
