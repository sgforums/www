I'm just interested in the justification of <strong>NeWater</strong> in the laws of Islam. Because I know of some people who do not consume water from the common household tap (in which <strong>NeWater</strong> has been added) be it in form of cooking or drinking but somehow thinks that its 'pure' enough to be used for ablution, washing, and other uses other than consumption. I would think its a bit weird but still it got me thinking whether its drinkable or not. MUIS has given the <span style="color: green;">green</span> light but still there are some things that we as an individual cannot just place our trust on someone else.<br><br>I don't really think I explain myself quite well there, my apologies hehe yea but what do you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not too sure about this but I think the rules of istinja' may apply to this matter. To those not in the know, istinja' involves washing of the relevant parts of the body after answering the call of nature.<br><br>Anyway, istinja' is said be be carried out correctly when any waste matter can no longer be seen, smelled and felt by the human senses. As the NeWater filtration processes removes all signs of waste matter, I guess it can be said to be pure enough for human use. Furthermore, since it's super-purified to the extent that it becomes drinkable, I don't suppose it should be a problem.<br><br>I'm not an authority on these matters anyway, so I guess I'm just going to have to take MUIS' word for it.</div>

In Islamic legal terminology, such a change is called istihala. Since the newly transformed substance is not what it used to be anymore, it's legal status will change accordingly --  not only for external use but also for internal use." So, in changing poo poo and pee pee into drinkable water, which was first "unclean", then sterilized, refined, made palatable through many series of processes, is now very much edible.</div>
