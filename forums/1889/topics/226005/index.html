            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Scholars are divided on this issue, as smoking did not exist in the early days of Islam.<br><br>While some consider smoking to be makruh (reprehensible but not considered as a sin), more and more scholars are adopting the viewpoint that it is actually haram (sinful). While neither the Quran or the Hadith explicitly states flat-out that smoking is either makruh or haram, there are many general guidelines which point towards it. Among others:<br><br>1. Knowingly committing acts that harm yourself is forbidden. This comes from two verses in the Quran:<br><br>"And spend of your substance in the cause of Allah, <strong>and make not your own hands contribute to (your) destruction</strong>; but do good; for Allah loveth those who do good."<br><br>[Surah al-Baqarah (The Cow) 2:195];<br><br>"O ye who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves in vanities: But let there be amongst you Traffic and trade by mutual good-will: <strong>Nor kill (or destroy) yourselves</strong>: for verily Allah hath been to you Most Merciful!"<br><br>[Surah al-Nisaa (Women) 4:29]<br><br>2. Danger and inconvenience to others<br><br>To knowingly cause danger and inconvenience to others is considered a sin. That can arguably include second-hand smoking as well.<br><br>"And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, bear (on themselves) a calumny and a glaring sin."<br><br>[Surat al-Ahzaab (The Coalition) 33:58]<br><br>3. Addiction<br><br>Addiction itself is not a big issue if it does not interfere with one's religious duties. In the case of smoking, though, interference with religious duties can be a major issue. One major example would be fasting.<br><br>Smoking is not allowed during the daylight fasting hours of Ramadan, for it involves intentionally introducing foreign substances into the body.<br><br>4. Noxious Smell<br><br>We need to go into the hadith for this. Muslims are discouraged (though not prevented) from consuming foodstuffs such as raw onions that give off a pungent odour. By inference, the noxious smell that smoking brings about would be included as well. One authentic hadith states:<br><br>Â“Whoever has eaten from such greens as garlic, onions or leek should keep away from our mosque.Â”<br><br>5. Waste of Money<br><br>"And render to the kindred their due rights, as (also) to those in want, and to the wayfarer: But squander not (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift.<br><br>Verily spendthrifts are brothers of the Evil Ones; and the Evil One is to his Lord (himself) ungrateful."<br><br>[Surah Al-Israa' (The Night Journey), 17:26-27]<br><br>The wasteful expenditure of resources is frowned upon in Islam. Expenditure on cigarettes can run to a large amount of money due to the high cost of cigarettes brought about by taxation and import duties.<br><br>This waste of resources does not only involve the cost on the smokers themselves; it also involves the cost to society as a whole in terms of lost productivity, increased healthcare expenditure, and the like.<br><br>A more detailed article on this issue can be found here:<br><br><a href="http://islam.about.com/library/weekly/aa090600a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://islam.about.com/library/weekly/aa090600a.htm</a><br><br>So bottom line... there is nothing 'hip' about smoking when all indications are that it is at the very least frowned upon in Islam.<br><br>And if you really want to join Islam just so that you can smoke... you're making a big, big mistake.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Islamic principles are not anthropocentric. Islamic theology is based on a concept of revealed religion i.e. truth from above via Quran, Hadith and interpretations of time tested scholars. You accept it to you benefit, you don't to your own loss. Accepting, you find your plans are based on firm assumption, rejecting you find failure in every turn when your fancies are obliterated by the harsh realities.<br><br>Truths are self evident upon deep thinking and reaffirmed by miraculous events that deny the thrust of human fancy. In Islam, rationalizations is a requirement of Man, not of God. God does not need Man, he created Man for his own purposes, he guides who he wills and destroys who he wills. God in Islam is not so much a force of Nature but the Creator and Justifier of Nature. You can say there is a Duality in the Islamic concept of Allah and they are justified by his irresistable Power and Truth. Whether Man likes it or not, well, tough luck.<br><br>Islamic principles are by themselves highly egalitarian, the weaknesses of "muslim culture" today is due to ignorance and lack of understanding of what has become a fossilized traditionalist mindset. This failure, left unchecked, will lead to the destruction of muslim societies and if that happens that's EXACT what Allah wants. Can you follow this train of thought? Leading an Islamic life is about following the Enlighted Light, not simply defining it in human terms. There is no official authority to dictate islamic ideology, this means there is chaos in contemporary islamic thought. However, this also means that Islamic thought constantly evolves by finding an order out of this chaos. Islam is at once amorphous but also consistent, such is the path of Truth in Life. Hence you will find very enlighted muslims and you will find stupid barbarians who profess to be muslims. True to the nature of Man, one may change to the other on any given day.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, I am not trolling here. Please take me seriously. Of cos, we have buddhists &amp; christians breaking the religious laws too but the point is at least they try to hid it. However, for Muslims, it's the opposite. Too many premarital sex resulting in high abtortion rate, smoking, drinking, dropping out of school, drug addicts... which we can see for ourselves. Not to forget, their terrorist attacks on other communitites. If Muslims are serious abt the their religion, they should think twice abt their faith.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problems of premarital sex, high abortion rate, smoking, drinking, dropping out of school, drug addiction, are problems very commonly found in any secular western society. Its a reflection of how a materialist hedonistic lifestyle appeals to those who do not see any deeper meaning in life other than to sate their instinctive desires. Its clear that these people are not serious about religion that does not offer immediate material gratification. They have obviously chosen to  live by secular western values. After all, what makes these people any different from any other people of other communities? They are a bountiful resource for Christian missionaries to preach to and if they irritate you by french kissing on a bus that simply means that you are not comfortable with secular western values and overt public displays of sexual arousal. This behaviour is not because of Islam but rather is a reflection of life devoid of any moral compass.<br></div>
