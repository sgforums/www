Of cos, we have buddhists &amp; christians breaking the religious laws too but the point is at least they try to hid it. However, for Muslims, it's the opposite. Too many premarital sex resulting in high abtortion rate, smoking, drinking, dropping out of school, drug addicts... which we can see for ourselves. Not to forget, their terrorist attacks on other communitites. If Muslims are serious abt the their religion, they should think twice abt their faith.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>I sense an oxymoron here. And lest you start flaming me for calling you a moron, an 'oxymoron' refers to a statement which is self-contradictory in nature.<br><br>You want to be taken seriously, and yet you choose to make unqualified sweeping statements such as how 'Buddhists and Christians breaking the religious laws but the point is at least they try to hide it' while for Muslims, 'it's the exact opposite'.<br><br>So you're telling me that you're not being too liberal with the brush right now? So you're telling me that all those problems that you spelled out are not experienced by other communities as well?<br><br>And 'terrorist attacks on other communities'.... so you believe that is a phenomenon that is unique to Islam as well? Explain the terrorist attacks carried out by the IRA, then. Don't try to tell me that Islam has to do with that. And I suppose Timothy McVeigh ties into all this, huh?<br><br>And on top of that, you choose to follow up on these unqualified statements of yours with a patronising tone on how we Muslims should 'think twice about our faith' if we want to be 'serious about our religion'. If that's not enough, you think that it's all a big fat joke by topping it off with a laughing smiley.<br><br>If you want to ask about Islam, by all means do so, but with objectivity and open-mindedness. Since I see that you choose to hold on firmly to your agenda of slamming Islam at every turn, I see hardly any objectivity or open-mindedness in you. You want to be taken seriously? Then start acting seriously. You're an adult, for goodness' sake.<br><br>Somehow, every discussion on Islam turns into a pit of flames thanks to people like you. Because of you a proper discussion will always seem to be a distant dream.</div>

I wanted to expand the discussion on the viewpoint of smoking in Islam, and you choose to reply with incendiary attacks on Islam with things that have totally nothing to do with the topic at hand like premarital sex and terrorism.<br><br>Oh well.
