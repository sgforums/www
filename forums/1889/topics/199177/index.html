            <div class='col-md body'>Now, most people believe that Muslims do not appear prominently on the World Cup scene. There's the Saudi and Iranian teams, of course, but both teams didn't do much to impress and were both kicked out in the first round.<br><br>Now, what most people don't know is that there are several prominent football stars in the top teams who actually are Muslims. This thread is just for general interest; I'm just gonna briefly talk about several Muslim stars in the FIFA World Cup 2006.<br><br>All pics and descriptions taken from Wikipedia.</div>

His 'nickname', 'Yazid' is derived from his family name and means 'He Grows') (born June 23, 1972, in Marseille, France), nicknamed Zizou, is a French football player of Kabyle Algerian descent who has starred for both the French national team and for four club teams, most recently Real Madrid. Despite rumor to the contrary, Zidane's family was not a French collaborator, something that he made clear himself.<br><br>Zidane is often considered to be the best footballer of his generation, and one of the greatest of all time. His elegant dribbling, balance, passing ability, shot accuracy, shot selection and well placed free kicks have made him one of the game's finest artists and the natural successor of Michel Platini as France's top playmaker.<br><br>On 1 July, 2006, France beat Brazil 1-0 in Frankfurt to set up a semifinal meeting with Portugal. Turning in a virtuoso performance complete with one of his trademark "roulette" spins, Zidane provided the free-kick assist from which Thierry Henry scored the winning goal, and was named Man of the Match by FIFA's Technical Study Group.<br><br>On 5 July, 2006, France met Portugal in Munich for the semifinal. Zidane scored a penalty kick, which turned out to be the only goal of the game and saw France through to the final.<br><br>Source:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zin%C3%A9dine_Zidane" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zin%C3%A9dine_Zidane</a></div>

At an early age he was involved in a car crash that resulted in scars on the right side of his face and his forehead.<br><br>RibÃ©ry follows the Muslim faith along with his wife who is of Moroccan descent.<br><br>On June 12, 2006, he was named in the starting lineup of the French team for their opener in the 2006 FIFA World Cup against Switzerland. His first international goal proved to be a crucial one, levelling France at 1-1 with Spain in the 41st minute of their knockout round match after calmly rounding the Spanish keeper, Iker Casillas. Though Spain were the favourites, France went on to win that game 3-1 to book a quarterfinal slot against Brazil.<br><br>Upon facing Brazil on July 1, 2006, RibÃ©ry was substituted in the 75th minute of the 1-0 victory following an impressive performance.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franck_Ribery" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franck_Ribery</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Robin van Persie</strong><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/Vanpersie.jpg"><br><br>Robin van Persie (born August 6, 1983 in Rotterdam) is a Dutch footballer currently playing at English FA Premier League team Arsenal as a striker. He can play as a striker (as he normally does for Arsenal) or on either wing, as he primarily does for the Netherlands.<br><br>Van Persie began as a youth player for Dutch side Excelsior Rotterdam and later Feyenoord Rotterdam, earning caps in the process for Netherlands U19 and U21 teams. He was unexpectedly called up to Feyenoord's injury-plagued first-team squad soon after he signed a three-and-a-half year deal with the club in January 2002. These performances, including his playing an integral part in the 3-2 UEFA Cup final victory over Borussia Dortmund at the De Kuip on May 8, 2002, earned him the prestigious Best Young Talent award offered by the Dutch PFA for the 2001-02 season.<br><br>Robin Van Persie recieved his first full international cap against Romania on 4th June 2005. Despite not being an automatic first choice to start for Arsenal, van Persie was selected as one of Holland's forwards for the 2006 FIFA World Cup by national coach Marco Van Basten. His first World Cup goal came in the group match against CÃ´te d'Ivoire, a powerfully-struck free kick in the 23rd minute. He has now played twelve times for the Netherlands, scoring 2 goals.<br><br>Van Persie's mother is a teacher and his father an artist. His father brought him up as a single parent. He grew up in a rough neighbourhood of Rotterdam alongside its large immigrant population. He had a series of behavioural problems at school and was often excluded from classes. He is married to Bouchra, a Dutch-Moroccan. They live in Hampstead, north London. While some sources claim he is a convert to Islam, van Persie has never disclosed his faith in interviews.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_van_Persie" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_van_Persie</a></div>

A Togo international, he helped them reach the 2006 World Cup, their first World Cup ever. Kader Mohamed's star rose in his home country after he scored the late winner in the 1998 African Cup of Nations match against Ghana, thus securing TogoÂ’s first ever win at the tournament.
