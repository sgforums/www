If you may find flaws in any religion why can't you just accept it? If we lived the time about thousands of years ago, then can debate la. Now what is there to debate? Everything is over. Everything is in place now. We have all sorts of religions now. Anyway, you all are not debating. You all are just critizing each other. And thats soooOOooOo wrong. Thank you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>Isnt it basic human nature to question and seek answers?<br>We are not scholars, or I am not, but I think we're all here just trying to understand each others' religions. Even tho we may not have absolute answers, but not to question is i dont know, worse to me.</div>
