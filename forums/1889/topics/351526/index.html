              <p>Assalamualaikum to all my brothers and sisters,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was intrigue by my friends recommendation of Halal Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). I have Diabetes and have tried Western Medicine such as Metformine, Glipizide and Glucobay but with mixed result. I am wondering if there is such thing as Halal TCM?</p>
              <p>It might be effective as the Jamu which I hate to take due to its bitterness and heaty.</p>
              <p>Do Singaporean Muslim comfortable with TCM?</p>
              <p>i believe other chronic disease such as High Blood Pressure, High cholestrol and Gout could be treated with  TCM but its authenticity of HALALship can be suspected. I am at end loss and wants to use other alternatives then Western medicine and Jamu.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there anyone else is taking TCM who can advise me?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Waalaikumsalam.</p>

              <p>yes, EuYanSang is now halal, you can now go for your treatment without fear:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.singaporehalaldirectory.com">http://www.singaporehalaldirectory.com</a><br><br><span class="newsContents"><span style="color: #ff0000;">2007: TRADITIONAL Chinese Medicine (TCM) just got a further boost in reaching out to Muslim customers. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Last month, Science Arts, a home-grown maker of TCM products, obtained halal certification from the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) for 19 of its medicinal products. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">These items, including lingzhi and bilberry capsules, are taken to treat ailments from joint aches to high cholesterol and diabetes (see other story). </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Even before they received the halal okay, there have been other health products which have been similarly certified. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">TCM chain Eu Yan Sang, for example, sells Essence of Chicken and Essence of Fish, both of which are halal-certified by the Islamic authorities in Malaysia. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Halal is Arabic for permissible by Muslim law, and goods must be certified halal before they can be consumed by Muslims. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">A product is non-halal if it contains, for example, certain animal parts, or if alcohol is involved in the production process. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Science Arts is the first maker of TCM products that has got the halal nod from Muis. The certification is recognised by Muslims worldwide. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ingrelife, Singapore's first halal TCM store in Geylang Serai Temporary Market, has sold an average of 5,000 TCM products each month since it opened in March last year, mainly to Malay customers but to some Chinese ones as well. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Rhazaly Noentil, who runs Ingrelife, says that with the new halal certificates, sales are expected to increase, although he cannot tell by how much yet. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He says that TCM is basically the same as jamu - traditional Indonesian herbal medicine, 'but TCM is a certified science by Chinese universities while jamu is not something you formally study'. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'We just want to stress the importance of health and introduce TCM as an alternative to Western medicine,' he adds. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Science Arts' halal products are also sold in traditional Chinese medical halls such as Beijing Tong Ren Tang in South Bridge Road. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">To be sure, TCM is not new to Muslims here. They have been using products like Tiger Balm to relieve aches, says Mr Rhazaly. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The number of Muslim TCM users is rising due to the wider range and availability of halal-certified products from other countries such as Malaysia and China. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Rhazaly says roadshows done by Science Arts at various mosques in the past three years have won over an estimated 2,000 Muslims to TCM. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Muslims seeking treatment at its TCM clinic in MacPherson Road now make up about 6 per cent of Science Arts' total clientele, says its president Tan Lee Huak. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Koh Chong Cher, a physician at Cheng Hong Medical Centre, a free TCM clinic in Eunos Crescent, estimates Malays make up 3 per cent of his 900 patients each month. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ingrelife sees between 10 and 20 people - some first-timers, some regulars - every day, says store operator Zarimah Mohamad. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Take Mr Abdul Karim, 52, who popped into Ingrelife at noon last Friday to have his blood checked. He suffers from diabetes and hopes that the cordyceps sinensis, which Madam Zarimah has recommended, will help lower his blood glucose level. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'I've been taking jamu but it is quite heaty. I am giving TCM a try because my wife recommended it to me,' he says. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Science Arts is now conducting study trips in the Middle East with trade promotion agency IE Singapore as it hopes to export its halal-certified TCM products to cities like Doha and Dubai. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But before it does that, it must change the product packaging to include Malay or Arabic explanations and instructions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Currently, the packaging features only English and Chinese instructions and a stick-on label of what the product is for in Malay. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Science Arts is also working on increasing the number of products for halal certification. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Says Mr Tan: 'Eventually, we don't just hope to explore the Middle East. We also hope our products will reach Muslims all over the world.' </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">may you be blessed with good health</span></p>
