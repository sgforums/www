However, emphasis is made for the women to adopt a motherly figure in the family. The father will work and provide the substantial economic need while the mother will be providing the emotional and "psychological" comforts. In other words, the father's contribution will be quantitative while the mother's contribution will be qualitative. That is why, for the <strong>Zakat Fitrah</strong>, only the contributing males proceed with the payment.<br><br>There are numerous important dates in the beautiful religion of Islam.<br>The most important being Eidl Adha (Hari Raya Haji), Eidl Fitri (Hari Raya Puasa), Isra' Mir'aj (whereby the day being the ascension of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) to the Heavens), Islamic New Year Day, Ashurah (Day when prophet Moses begins his journey from Egypt to the Blessed Land).<br>Each of the Hijri month has its own significance and bears testimony to important events in the Biography of the Life of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). They serve as a reminder to Muslims (men and women) of the struggle of the Blessed Prophet (PBUH) to accomplish his task of conveying the message of Islam (Submission to ALLAH). Moreover, the Hijri months are closely linked with the sunnah tradition of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his teachings to Mankind.<br><br>To answer the next 3 questions,<br><br>Islam frowns upon the element of risk when making money. Money made when it may be lost or gained in that sense. Just like gambling. Strictly also, money made from Investments are also frowned upon. When you put in a FD of any amount, the interest made is not for you to keep.<br><br>Also, Islam forbids business where it involves booze or sleaze. As long as your payslip comes from an Establishment where it sells/makes/serves Beer,Wine or any alcoholic products, the money is strictly forbidden for your own consumption.<br><br>More to come but i'm hungry ah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi....<br><br>i think for question 4 &amp; 5.....<br><br>4) The Prophet Muhammad taught us to seek knowledge. Even the first words of God to him is "Read!" Muslims are taught not to abandon this life and only seek the afterlife. We are encouraged to marry and have kids. We are taught to seek a balance of happiness in this life and he afterlife. Therefore, seeking success in this life is equally important as seeking success in the afterlife.<br><br>5) The above may also help answer question no. 5. Anyway, during the glory days of Islam....there were many Muslim scientists and businessmen contributing to the world economy and progress. In Islam, businessmen cannot take any interest etc....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its been more than a week already. Do you still need the info? Well, cant really give sound examples but heres another elaboration.<br><br><strong>Roles of men and women?</strong><br>Towards God - I dont think theres any difference. Its about the daily prayers, zakat (alms to the needy) and fasting. Towards each other in a relationship - its all about being a sensible lifelong partner isnt it? Trying to work within the relp. O.O Nothing Islamic of that although there are lots of guidances coming from the religion which Master had expounded.<br><br>In a family unit though, "For example, the husband should not share the money or assets that a Muslim woman possesses, either through inheritance or from her work. He doesn't have any claim on any part of it, which is opposite to many constitutions that give the husband a claim on his wife's wealth.<br><br>On the other hand, while husbands are not obliged to sustain their wives in western family laws, the Muslim wife is exempted from spending her income - however big it is - on the family unless she would like to help in a voluntary way. This is while the husband is asked to sustain her fully, regardless of her wealth. If he doesn't do it, it becomes a reason for her to get a divorce.<br><br>.... <strong>it is obligatory in Islam that the male member of the family should be responsible for sustaining all female members, either the wife, the mother or even the unmarried sisters.</strong> If he doesn't fulfill this obligation out of his free will, he should be forced by the power of law."<br><br>http://tinyurl.com/828bg<br>Thats more or less the basic differences of gender roles.<br><br><strong>Work &amp; business attitudes?</strong><br>Work is worship in itself. "Although some people believe that they are not obliged to work because they dedicate themselves to worshiping God, this is actually a wrong perception of the concept of worship.<br><br>The Muslim scholar Imam Al-Ghazali mentioned in his book that Jesus (peace and blessings be upon him) once saw a man who had completely devoted himself to worship. When he asked him how he got his daily bread, the man replied that his brother, who worked, provided him with food. Jesus then told him, "That brother of yours is more religious than you are".<br><br>Al-Ghazali also mentions the Prophet�fs Companion `Umar ibn Al-Khattab, who used to stress this point further by telling people, Never should anyone of you think that du`aa (supplication) for sustenance without work will avail him, for heaven never rains gold nor silver."<br>http://www.islamonline.net/english/introducingislam/Individual/article09.shtml<br><br>The Prophet advocated Muslims to follow the spirit of Prophet Daud's (PBUH) (David) industriousness who earned his living from his own labour. He also said that faith of a Muslim is not complete if he is not good in his profession. He said: "If you leave matter to those who are not professional, you are waiting for a disaster".<br>http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/prophet/asblessing/#Economy (Expertise and Outlook)<br><br><strong>Beliefs and teachings on material success?</strong><br>The main principle is that everything belongs to God and wealth therefore is held by us in trust. In the Qur'an, theres something that goes, "All that we have created on earth and in heaven is for your use." meaning, not to fear or hate or renounce but to use it. The possession of more wealth does not raise a man's dignity, nor does poverty degrade him. It is true that wealth is necessary for man to live on this earth but it is only a means, not the end. The end is happiness in life by attaining the higher values and not losing sight of in the pursuit of wealth.<br><br><strong>Business &amp; work biases?</strong><br>That work must be through halal (lawful) means. Generally every job is fine lah, just gotta try not to affiliate with alcohol, pork and vices.<br><br>Goodluck with the project if you're still at it!</div>
