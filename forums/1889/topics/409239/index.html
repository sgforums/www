              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; padding-left: 30px;">“Friendship with dogs is a blind imitation of the West”</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">A senior Iranian cleric has decreed dogs are “unclean” and should not be kept as pets in a move aimed at discouraging western-style dog ownership in the Islamic state, a newspaper reported Saturday. Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi has sent a clear message to his people with a fatwa ruling that this trend must stop.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; padding-left: 30px;">“There are lots of people in the West who love their dogs more than their wives and children.”</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Although the Qur’an does not explicitly prohibit contact with dogs, Shirazi says Islamic tradition has showed it to be so, “We have lots of narrations in Islam that say dogs are unclean.” Even guard dogs and sheep dogs are not beyond the law; people carrying dogs in public are liable to stopped and fined.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The Calgary Herald reports: The interpretation of religious rules on personal conduct is a constant source of debate and potential conflict in Iran, which has been an Islamic republic since a revolution ousted the Western-backed Shah in 1979.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In a television interview last week, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad weighed in on the issue of the Islamic dress code, saying women who fail to cover their hair completely should not be harassed by the police.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Morality police are conducting their annual crackdown. Ahmadinejad’s surprisingly liberal view was condemned by fellow hardliner politicians and senior clerics.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The Radio Free Europe Liberty reports:</p>
              <div>In an unprecedented move, the police in Iran have been detaining dogs for crimes such as “walking in public”. In the past, dog owners have received warnings or were forced to pay fines for having a pet dog. Despite such harassment, dog ownership has increased over the years, especially among young people in Tehran.One of them is 23-year-old Banafshe, whose dog was recently detained in Tehran for 48 hours and then released on bail. Banafshe says she was walking her young puppy, Jessica, when Iranian police snatched the dog and took her to a dog “jail”.
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">All detained pets are taken to a newly created detention center. Radio Farda reports that some dogs are housed amid piles of garbage and debris. Others reported that a very large dog was confined to a cramped cage within the dog “prison.”</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Dr. Javid Aledavud, the head of Iran’s Society to Defend the Rights of Animals, told Radio Farda that conditions at the center are very poor and unsuitable for pets. He says there are no passages in the Koran about dogs being dirty.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">He adds that sniffer dogs are being used in Iran in the fight against drug trafficking. Iranian security forces say the ban against walking dogs in public is meant strictly to fight Western influences.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Reza Javalchi, the secretary of the Society to Defend the Rights of Animals, says dog ownership, more common in the West, is considered by Iranian officials to be a sign of Western influence. “But that is not the case,” he said. “If we want to speak about symbols of Western civilization then maybe wearing a suit is also Western. These are issues that have become part of human life. Based on our research, domestic dogs were kept in Iran for hunting and guarding maybe long before it became widespread in the West.”</p>

              <p>Its not weird.</p>
              <p>There's a strange perception in Singapore and Malaysia amongst Muslims that keeping dogs is wrong or illegal in their religion.</p>
              <p>I don't know which genius decided to cherry pick and intepret it for the masses but in keeping dogs in Islam is ok (halal) only if:</p>
              <p>1- They are working dogs. (i.e. shepard dogs, guard dogs, etc)</p>
              <p>2- They are technically discouraged to live indoors (because they have 'unclean' saliva so imagine that getting all over your indoor furniture and the logistical nightmare of cleaning it.)</p>
              <p>3- Upon touching the dogs' saliva you have to wash your hands with dirt, sand or water 7 times.</p>
              <p>Its not the dog which is 'dirty' it is its saliva.</p>
              <p>But as long as you wash your hands, keep it outside and have an actual purpose for it (most dogs double as guard dogs anyway) its actually permitted.</p>
              <p>That's why many Muslims keep dogs in most other countries. I had a friend from Saudi Arabia visit my house and petted my dog.</p>
              <p>Some Malay dude walked by and gave him a lecture through my window (!) that its wrong and you can't 'touch' dogs.</p>
              <p>Needless to say he got bashed Islamically (not literally lah. Verbally.) Haha.</p>
