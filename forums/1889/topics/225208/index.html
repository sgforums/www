            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Name of Questioner: John<br>Title: Why Didn't Prophet Muhammad Die for Muslims' Sins?<br><br>Question: I want to know why didnÂ’t Muhammad die for your sins?<br><br>Date: 22/Nov/2006<br><br>Name of Mufti: Sheikh Ahmad Kutty<br><br>Topic: Muslim Belief</strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Answer:</span> </strong><br><br><strong>In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.<br><br>All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.<br></strong><br>Dear questioner, we would like to thank you for the great confidence you place in us, and we implore Allah Almighty to help us serve His cause and render our work for His Sake.<br><br>First of all, it is to be made clear that the entire concept of someone dying for our sins is in utter contradiction with the Islamic view of the nature of man and God. In Islam, every individual is responsible for his/her own salvation. Everyone, male or female, can directly approach God without any intermediary of a prophet, saint or priest.<br><br>Answering the question you raised, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto,Ontario, Canada, states:<br><br>It seems to me that you are coming from a Christian background. In order for you to be able to understand the Islamic position, it is important to be clear about certain points.<br><br><strong> First</strong>, Islam, unlike Christianity, does not teach a concept of Â“original sinÂ”. AdamÂ’s sin was his and his alone; and, according to the QurÂ’an (for the QurÂ’anic narration of the story of Adam and Eve, see: the QurÂ’an: 2: 30-39; 7: 19-25; 17: 61; 18: 50; 20: 116-122, etc.), God forgave both Adam and Eve when they turned to God in repentance; accordingly they were once again restored to divine mercy. Hence, there is no concept of Adam passing on to his progeny an original sin, and therefore no need for stipulating a redeemer for such sins.<br><br><strong>Second</strong>, as there is no original sin, every one is born into a state of fitrah, a state of natural innocence; sin is acquired later by our own conscious and willful actions. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, Â“Every child is born into a state of fitrah (natural state of innocence.)Â”<br><br>(to be continued)</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>(continued)<br><br><strong>Third</strong>, Islam teaches that God is All-Compassionate and All-Merciful; He is not bound by the rule of a blood sacrifice in order to forgive His servants. To assume that God can forgive only by accepting a blood sacrifice and therefore to state that Jesus or Muhammad died for our sins is not acceptable in Islam. Allah says: (O My servants who have wronged against their souls! Do not despair of AllahÂ’s mercy! For Allah forgives all sins; for He is indeed Forgiving, Compassionate. Turn to your Lord repentant, and submit to Him before the torment overtakes you when you shall not be helped.) (Az-Zumar 39: 53-54)<br><br><strong>Fourth</strong>, Islam teaches that every individual is responsible for his/her own salvation. Not Abraham, or Moses, or Jesus, or Muhammad can save us; they are only capable of saving themselves through GodÂ’s grace. In the words of the QurÂ’an: (Whoever commits a sin commits it only against himself. Allah is Knowing, Wise.) (An-Nisa' 4: 111); (Allah does not charge a soul with more than it can bear. It gets every good that it earns, and it suffers every ill that it earns.) (Al-Baqarah 2: 286); (Each soul earns only on its own account, nor does any laden (soul) bear anotherÂ’s load.) (Al-An`am 6: 164) (Whosoever goeth right, it is only for (the good of) his own soul that he goeth right, and whosoever erreth, erreth only to its hurt. No laden soul can bear another's load.) (Al-Israa' 17: 15)<br><br><strong>Fifth</strong>, everyone, male or female, can directly approach God without any intermediary of a prophet, saint or priest. God is closer to us than our own jugular veins. Almighty Allah says in the QurÂ’an: (We verily created man and We know what his soul whispereth to him, and We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.) (Qaf 50: 16) (When My servants ask you about Me, tell them I am nigh, ready to answer the prayer of the suppliant when he prays to Me; therefore let them respond to Me and believe in Me, that they may walk in the right way.) (Al-Baqarah: 186)<br><br>So, the entire concept of someone dying for our sins is inimical to the Islamic world-view or understanding of the natures of man and God. Islam beckons us all to respond to GodÂ’s message and receive His grace and salvation through faith, good works and leading a responsible moral and ethical life.<br><br>Excerpted with modifications from:<br><br><a href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1119503546872&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaEAskTheScholar" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1119503546872&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaEAskTheScholar</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Name of Questioner: Fahmi   - Egypt<br>Title: How Does Islam View Genetic Engineering?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Question</span>  : Could you please shed more light on the Islamic view on genetic engineering and its ethical principles?<br><br>Date: 05/Dec/2006<br>Name of Mufti: Yusuf Al-Qaradawi<br>Topic: Genetics<br><br><span style="color: red;">Answer:</span><br>In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.<br><br>All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.</strong><br><br>Thanks for your question, which reflects your concern about Islam. We really commend your efforts in pursuit of truth. This is what is required of all people, to seek truth and not to give in to anything that may cloud their minds with fake ideas about Islam.<br><br>Genetic engineering is one of the greatest discoveries of our time. It can be used for treating genetic diseases. All such new discoveries that help alleviate the suffering of humanity is welcomed in Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have said, Â“There should be neither harm nor reciprocating injury.Â”<br><br>Responding to the question, the eminent Muslim scholar, Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, states the following:<br><br>One of the blessings of Islam is that it never abstracts scientific programs or narrows the scope of the mind in the field of science and technology. Unlike other religions, there is no conflict between science and religion in Islam. Christian clergy opposed scientists, thinkers and pioneers of technology that we take for granted today. Many were punished, tortured and sentenced to death.<br><br>The QurÂ’an shows that Allah, Almighty, bestows many gifts on mankind enabling them to discover the mysterious nature around them and to recognize the laws that control the universe. Allah Almighty also submits the whole universe with its heavens, earth, sun and moon to mankind.<br><br>Allah Almighty says: (See ye not how Allah hath made serviceable unto you whatsoever is in the skies and whatsoever is in the earth and hath loaded you with His favors both without and within? Yet of mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah, without knowledge or guidance or a Scripture giving light.) (Luqman 31: 20)<br><br>He Almighty also says, (And in the earth are portents for those whose faith is sure. And (also) in yourselves. Can ye then not see??w (Adh-dhariat 51: 20-21)<br><br>When manÂ’s knowledge advances, it becomes compulsory for him to deepen his faith and moral virtues. One must not go alone, doing whatever one wants, ignoring religious morals or the welfare of people in general.<br><br>The problem in Western civilization is that science is separated from religion and in some cases it fights religion.<br><br>Allah Almighty says, (And when he turneth away (from thee) his effort in the land is to make mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle; and Allah loveth not mischief.) (Al-Baqarah 2: 205)<br><br>We welcome the idea of genetic engineering. It is one of the greatest discoveries of our time and is shared by many countries. Whether it is considered more important than the discovery of penicillin or man landing on the moon, we hope it is used for the benefit of humanity and that its guidelines will be according to the views of qualified jurists.<br><br>There are many benefits we can derive from this, say, for instance, in treating genetic diseases by using the effective genes to prevent harm or disease. This is something commendable in Islam according to the legal rule "Prevention is better than cure"; the rule is taken from the hadith; Â“There should be neither harm nor reciprocating injury.Â”<br><br>By this, through the assistance of such a scientific device, man will be able to prevent many diseases.<br><br><strong>Excerpted from:</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1119503544298&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaEAskTheScholar" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1119503544298&amp;pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaEAskTheScholar</a></div>

Obviously, you can only repent only after you recognise your own wrongdoings.<br><br>At least, that's what I think. Anyone with alternative viewpoints?</div>
