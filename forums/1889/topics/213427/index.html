            <div class='col-md body'>One day while I was returning home from school, I glanced at my watch to find that it was 5pm in the afternoon. As I was already at Paya Lebar MRT, I decided to stop by the Wak Tanjong Mosque for my Asar prayers. It has been quite a while since I visited that particular mosque.<br><br>Even though it's near the MRT station, it took me some time to find the way there. Not surprising, considering how the construction for the new Circle Line has obstructed it from easy view, much less easy access:<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/Tioman006-1.jpg"><br><br>I had to engage in a spot of jaywalking across a busy road just to make my way to the mosque.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/Tioman001-1.jpg"><br><span class="small"><strong>Masjid Wak Tanjong</strong></span><br><br>The place seemed pretty deserted, even after considering the fact that it was a weekday afternoon and would thus not expect to have that many visitors. However, with all those hoardings and contruction sites, it would thus be difficult for pedestrians to make their way here and for drivers to find a suitable place to park their vehicles.<br><br>(to be continued....)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(continued)<br><br>A newspaper article put up on a message board says it all:<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/Tioman003-1.jpg"><br><span class="small"><strong>"Construction Works 'Hiding' the Wak Tanjong Mosque:<br>Worshippers lacking, donation boxes going dry, mosque facing monetary issues."</strong></span><br><br>The way I see it, it hardly seems fair for the mosque to undergo such problems for the sake of construction works to build the Circle Line. While I agree that the Circle Line would undoubtably be a boon to commuters in the future, it doesn't help the mosque at all in the meantime.<br><br>To all Muslim readers: please do continue visiting this mosque. It is still functioning and in good working condition. Don't let some construction works deter you from visiting it.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/Tioman004-1.jpg"><br><span class="small"><strong>'We would like to inform the general public that the Wak Tanjong Mosque is still operating as per usual and we would continue moving on.' -<br><br>Haji Mohammad Sidek, Treasurer, Wak Tanjong Mosque</strong></span><br><br>As for me, I'll visit the mosque whenever I can for my worship. If I can spare the money, I'll drop whatever sum I can afford to part with into their donation boxes. It's not much, but I hope it's a start. Muslim readers, if you're reading this, do help to support this mosque as well.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/Tioman007.jpg"><br><br>May Almighty Allah reward you generously and keep you on the right path should you continue to support this mosque , Insyallah.</div>

That's the original building as it was constructed many years ago - in the fifties, methinks. It has seen a number of upgrading and renovation works over the years.<br><br>Anyway, the Hajjah Fatimah Mosque has a pretty interesting architecture as well - Moorish, Chinese, Portuguese and Malay influences can all be found in its design.
