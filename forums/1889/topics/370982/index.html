              <p>I'm a muslim, but nevertheless, I hope you really think of converting seriously. It is not a mere change in lifestyle, but more on understanding of life and after life.</p>
              <p>I doubt you can get in-depth, and much non-misleading understanding of Islam through a forum like this. But it's a start though. If you are really serious, try going to the muslim convert association at haig road there I think, to get your queries answered and understand more on Islam.</p>
              <p>I try to answer as much as possible to my best, but I can't guarantee quality answers as my knowledge is quite limited ( I know I'm ashamed but I'll try enrich myself in the near future).<br><br>As for understanding arabic, I can't understand them and I'm sure most malays they don't either. But it is best that you do understand a bit when you do your prayers. There are arab-english books on prayers and some basic translations. You must understand that it is best that prayers and other things like fasting and so forth are not to be done out of obligation but sincerely and understanding why you are doing such actions.</p>
              <p>Typical normal daily compulsory prayers is 5 times. There are quite a number of details for prayers. Need to learn them haha.</p>
              <p>As for halal food, there are a different interpretations and different approach from the muslim community in SG. Again quite a number of details to be understood. Can't say it exhaustively in just 1 post.</p>
              <p>Sorry, but I can't explain everything within 1 post. Islam is not something which a typical man can fully understand in his lifetime. That is why have to go for classes and have continuous learning even when till old cos one can never learn everything there is about Islam.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of doubts by non-muslims about Islam, about the concept of god, and I'm ashamed that I cannot clear some of the misunderstanding not because Islam can't but because I am not knowledgeable enough to do so.</p>
              <p>I hope you get the answers that you seeked. And may you not regret any decision after much serious thinking. After all, what matters most, is that you should not be influenced by any form of persuasion, but instead you get properly informed as much as possible and you evaluate and make your own judgements, and ultimately your own decisions.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
