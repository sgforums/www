Such virtues<br><br>'should lead us away from blind fanaticism and hatred because<br><br>Islam considers all human beings to have come from one mother and<br><br>father'.<br><br>Islam is a peaceful religion and will offer its hand in peace, if<br><br>others likewise offered their hands in peace, he said.<br><br>But he also said that in the face of aggression towards Muslims,<br><br>'we should stand and fight against those who would do this to us'.<br><br>Earlier in the morning, Dr Tantawi met Deputy Prime Ministers S.<br><br>Jayakumar and Wong Kan Seng over breakfast.<br><br>He was also hosted to a dinner by National Research Foundation<br><br>chairman Tony Tan, who is also chairman of Singapore Press<br><br>Holdings.<br><br>Dr Tantawi rounds off his visit today with a lecture, titled Islam<br><br>And The Modern World. He will also attend an inter-faith lunch<br><br>hosted by Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim.<br><br></div>
