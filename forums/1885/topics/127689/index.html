            <div class='col-md body'>These information is for those who are curious.<br><br>I just came back for a 1 night stay at Harris Hotel in Batam. I did all my booking seperately.<br><br>(A) Pengiun Ferry<br>Ticket cost = $22<br>Departure tax (sin) = $5<br>Departure tax (Batam) = $3<br>Pls check the ferry timing cos some of the timing have been cancelled due to lack of "traffic".<br><br>Dino ferry (competitor) timing not so "fantastic", go very few timing slots!<br><br>(B) (i) Harris Hotel<br>- It is about 5 mins away from the waterfront city.<br>- Pickup by van (very clean)<br>- Hotel is so-so (like 1st world hotel but bigger and cleaner)<br>- Food (we had pizza "big" and carbona pasta "little") but good<br>- Room is not carpeted but very clean. 2 single bed (quite BIG) + 1 sofa + 1 armchair<br>- I would say YES to stay there again if I can get cheap rates. Cos the staffs are good and very responsive!<br><br>(ii) Holiday Inn<br>We saw that it was the opposite direction (i.e. when van came out of the ferry terminal, left is towards harris, right is towards Holiday Inn)<br><br>(iii) Melia (Parnoma &lt;-- I think) Hotel<br>It's in the city<br><br>(C) From Harris to City<br>Taxi = $10 (But u can ask to pay rupiah = 50k which is cheaper) on way<br><br>(D) City<br>It's very much like going Malaysia, Johor when it was a "hit" in the 90s. Everything simple<br><br>(F) Food<br>- Ate at the street food, pretty clean (the place we went). Ate Bak Kut Teh, dh loved it cos got pig's blood...he miss it! *yuck* I had Nasi goreng.<br>- Water, pls buy from super market...cheaper<br>- A1 Food Court - Hai San seafood. CHEAP! Had 2 small steam crabs, black pepper chicken, Dou Miao and white rice. Total 85k rupiah (S$15/S$16). The shop is near Lucky Plaza, pls don't let taxi driver cheat u like we did. Taxi shld cost abt 5k - 10k. Either that, walk! (ask around) Cos it's really NEAR!<br><br>(G) Shopping<br>(i) Matahari (Lucky Plaza)<br>--&gt; Forgot abt shopping there...cos when we went to city we were hungry for lunch<br>(ii) Robinson<br>--&gt; Bought 3 tops and 2 pants for my kids. Relatively cheap...abt $2-$3 per top or pants<br>(iii) Centrepoint<br>--&gt; pretty new. We bought DVDs there. Buy 5, free 1. Cost us abt 90k rupiah ($16/$17).  Very CLEAR...ask them to let u check first.<br><br>(H) Exchange rates<br>- we changed our money in Sin at suntec. Pretty good rates.<br>- Or u can change at the shopping centre. (Yesterday rate S$1 = 5.7k rupiah)<br><br>(I) Massage<br>Didn't go for it. So can't comment.<br><br>Pls note:<br>- For taxi, take those that have the word TAXI<br>- Going to town, if u not afraid of dust and dirt (it's really like Malaysia lah), then bring the kids. If not, stay at the hotel<br>- Bring some spare singapore dollars =)<br>- For hotel (harris), u can check if u can pay via rupiah or S$. Though everything there is priced S$.<br>- Mineral water (500ml) in supermarket cost abt 700 - 1300 rupiah. Outside is twice the price.<br>- Indonesia is 1 hour behind us!<br>- Some pple speak hokkien/cantonese, english and Indo Malay, Indonesian.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just came back from Harris Resort-Batam. I concur with what the topic mentioend but would like to add the following.<br><br>Go-Kart<br>----------<br>Go-kart at $17 for 10 mins. The track is less then 5 mins from the resort. There is a 1 for 1 promotion, so both my companion and myself did the Go-kart together at $17. It was our first time and really very very fun.<br><br>Spa<br>----<br>There is a 20% off. It is the first time that my partner and I tried. but we really like it. a 180 min package cost about $200 for the both of us. Not sure how it is compared to packages in bintan or singapore but we find it quite affordable and value for money. the place is quite clean and the env was actually quite romantic. This is actually the highlight of the trip for us.<br><br>Currency<br>----------<br>Actually, if u r only staying at the resort, there is no need to change rupiah at all. All transactions can be charged to the room and final settlement at checkout can be in Sing dollar....<br><br></div>
