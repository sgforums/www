            <div class='col-md body'>Ingredients for the cheese fillings<br><br>Mascrapone Cheese 250 gm<br>Caster sugar 80 gm<br>Egg yolk 3 nos<br>Egg white 3 nos<br>Millac Cream (whipping cream) 150 ml<br>Gelatine powder 1 tbsp mixed with 3 tbsp hot water stir to dissolve<br><br>1. Mix egg yolks and mascarpone cheese together until creamy and smooth<br>2. In another bowl whip up cream to a soft peak and mix into the cheese mixture.<br>3. Whip up egg white and sugar to a soft peak and fold into the cheese mixture and mix well.<br>4. Pour the dissolved gelatine into the mixture and mix well.<br><br>Sponge cake<br><br>Egg yolks 5 nos )<br>Castor sugar 75 gm ) A<br><br>Egg white 5 nos )<br>Caster sugar 75 gm ) B<br><br>Plain flour 150 gm<br><br>1. Whisk A until creamy.<br>2. Beat B to a soft peak. Mix A and B together and slowly fold in flour and mix well.<br>3. Spread on baking tray and level it out and bake at 180?C for 15 mins.<br><br>(Tip: Divide mixture equally and pour into 2 trays lined with greased proof paper to bake. If you only have 1 tray, no problem, bake 1 at a time as baking time is only 15 mins you can wait for 1st tray to bake, take it out to cool on rack and then line another paper and bake the remainder mixture.)<br>4. Since I have want to use a round cake ring (bottomless type), I press the cake round onto the bake and cooled sponge cake hard to try to get an impression onto the cake so that I can use a small sharp knife to cut out the cake for later use. So for those who have whatever shape cake ring, you can use it but the mould must not be bigger than 9? if not tiramisu will come out too low.<br><br>For those who like sponge finger, you can put mixture into a piping bag and pipe out onto the lined tray and bake. Tips: Use a pencil and draw equal length lines on the greaseproof paper so that your sponge fingers are equal in length when you pipe them (remember to turn the paper over so that the face with the pencil mark is facing down).<br><br>Coffee syrup:<br><br>Put in a pot 100 ml of water, 50 ml of Kahlua (coffee liquer), 2 tsp of instant coffee, 2 tbsp sugar and boil till sugar dissolve. Leave it aside to cool before use. For those who doesn?t have Kahlua, nevermind, just boil 150 ml of water with 50 gm of sugar and 4 tbsp of instant coffee.<br><br>Assemble the cake:<br><br>Use aluminum foil to wrap bottom of the cake ring and place it on a cake board. Put one piece of the sponge cake in the mould. Brush the coffee syrup generously onto the whole sponge cake and then pour half cheese mixture on it. Put the 2nd layer of cake on it and again brush with coffee syrup and pour the rest of the cheese mixture into it. Level the cake and put into freezer to freeze it. Can leave cake overnight or about 3-4 hours to harden it. Unmould the cake and spoon some cocoa powder in a sieve to sprinkle on top of cake. If cake is keep overnight in freezer, before serving leave it outside for a while for easy cutting.<br><br>Another tip for you, to unmould any cake that is in the freezer (those really frozen hard type) here is what you can do:<br><br>Tear away the aluminum foil, place cake on cake board, use a hairdryer to blow on the side of the mould turning the mould round. Do that for a few mins and try lifting the cake ring up, the cake should slide nicely onto the cake board.<br></div>
