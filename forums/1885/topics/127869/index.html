            <div class='col-md body'>Latest Update (28th April)<br><br>Non elimination round!!!! LOL...<br><br>so no one got eliminated lah.<br><br>1st Group: Uchenda and Joyce got first<br>2nd Goup: Meredith and Gretchen.<br>3rd Group: Rob and Amber<br>4th Group: Ron and Kelly<br><br>**Ron &amp; Kelly lost all their belongings and $$ as a penalty for being last.<br><br>However!!!! Ron and Kelly were last. HOwever, they received US$20,000 to be spent on travelocity. Why? Because the gnome that they found had an airplane sign underneath it. The rest didn't get it.<br><br>Other stories updates!<br><br>R&amp;A + R&amp;K team-up against U&amp;J + M&amp;G. Uchenna managed to get a head lead as he managed to get much earlier flight for the 4 of them. Rob thot he was leading all along until such time when he was more than 2 hours behind. Before that, he commented that U&amp;J was stupid to team up with M&amp;G, its the blind leading the blind. R&amp;A ditched R&amp;K and thot they were first....<br><br>On the way, each of the team was to collect a Gnome and stand a chance to win a special prize at the pitstop if they hold the Gnome till then.<br><br>They went thru a roadblock that require some climbing. All guys took up except G. She was amazing, doing all the hard climbing, a test of her will power.<br><br>So U&amp;J got first again. M&amp;G second. R&amp;A thrid. They were pretty close with R&amp;K. But this is a non elimination round. R&amp;K won the special prize of 20k from travelocity with their 'airplane' Gnome. But they lost all their belongings and $$ as a penalty.</div>
