(The equations will be given in the paper so not to worry.)<br><br>Sodium Hydroxide reacts with the acid immediately after the 1st stage.<br><br>Calculate the mass accordingly.<br><br>(The above is testing you on Skill C)<br><br>Precautions you must mention:<br>(Now for Skill DÂ…)<br><br>P.S For Skill D, The type of question asked was exactly the same a TJC's.<br><br>The procedure given us was that a measure mass of something and something was dissolved in 1dmÂ³ of water in a <strong>larger beaker</strong>.<br><br>25cmÂ³ of whatever was measured out using a <strong>measuring cylinder </strong>into a conical flask.<br><br><strong>Four drops </strong>of SMO was added and the titration continued to the final end.<br><br>The same titration procedure was repeated another <strong>three times</strong>.<br><br>Take note of whatÂ’s written in <strong>bold</strong>. IÂ’ll address them nowÂ…<br><br>Now, a beaker is not a suitable apparatus to prepare the standard solution. <span style="font-style: italic;">The precision of a beaker is very poor and the accuracy of the experiment depends on the accuracy of the concentration of the standard solution.</span> A standard flask should be used.<br><br>NextÂ…. A measuring cylinder is not a suitable apparatus to measure out accurate volume of reaction mixture. <span style="font-style: italic;">This is because its precision is poor. Since the volume measured out is only 25cmÂ³ the imprecision will result in a large percentage error in volume.</span> A pipette should be used.<br><br>Excess indicator is used!! <span style="font-style: italic;">Too much indicator will affect the accuracy of the result because an acid base indicator is a weak acid or a weak base and will react with the reaction mixture.</span> Only 1-2 drops of indicator can be used.<br><br>You donÂ’t need to carry out the titration 4 times.<span style="font-style: italic;"> If 4 readings are inconsistent, then the final results will also not be accurate. Instead the titration should be carried out until consistent readings (within +-0.10cmÂ³) are obtained. </span><br><br>Ask your why... Why are you carrying the titration out 4 times... Why should be pipette be used instead... etc...<br><br>Oh yah the reliability of your data must be included tooÂ… You can follow this format.<br><br>Only the ____ and _____ titration readings are used because they are consistent. (Within +- 0.10cmÂ³)<br><br>The total calculated mass of _____ is ______, which is less than ______. This could be due to the fact that the solid had absorbed some moisture or impurities<br><br>Okay! Now for the extra stuff you must add inÂ…<br><br>Tap water/plain water should not be used to prepare the standard solution as water may contain impurities, which will react and affect the final results. Instead, de-ionized water should be used to prepare the standard solution.<br><br>The accuracy of the experiment could be affected by the difficulty to identify the end point color of both indicators. (Human error) A date logger or a pH meter should be used to determine the end point.<br><br>The container containing the standard solution should be capped or covered at all times when not in use. This is to prevent accidental contamination of standard solution.<br><br>Precautions for marking scheme: For the paper, a beaker, some solutions and burette is issued. DonÂ’t be foolish enough to carry out the experiment. Spend all the time wisely on the written paper. IÂ’ve confirmed this with my chemistry teacher already. Even though the apparatus are given to you, there is NO NEED for you to carry out the experiment Â‘cos youÂ’ll only land up with inaccurate readings.<br></div>
