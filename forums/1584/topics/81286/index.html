            <div class='col-md body'>spa is nothing but a burden, a poor half-baked manifestation of it's predecessor. It's weightage per practical assessment is whittled, but the period it encompasses is extended, from june of jc1 to the  june of jc2.<br><br>yes, yes, some may defend their pride and so-called 'honor' by adamantly refusing to cheat or share information for spa. i bet you guys must have seen all this: your friend for 4 years telling you to screw off after he walked out of the lab when you approached him for information of spa. now i will tell you 5 great reasons why you should cheat for spa.<br><br>1) Everyone is cheating. you think there is only 1 network here? Dream on. People are already creating an msn network for spa. If you don't cheat and the unpalatable truth is that everyone is cheating, YOU LOSE OUT. (not me)<br><br>2) SPA isnt easy. You've seen the questions, they are more technical and tricky that A'level practicals.<br><br>3) SPA is stressful. In most junior colleges, spa seems like a marathon... week after week... braving through a battery of practical assessment. Why mug mindlessly for this shit? You can get all you want here.<br><br>4) SPA concerns your future. It's your A'levels, you dickhead.<br><br>5) SPA is stupid. That's why we cheat.<br><br>Now you seen the reasons, we'll move on to 2 chapters, namely "how to read information posted" and "how to post information"<br><br>************************************<br><br>CHAPTER 1 :<br><br>to get people to post, you yourself have to motivate them to start posting by posting information yourself. a network will run dry once everybody is damn kiasee and refrain from sharing information [once again i have to stress that the creators of spast.ic have nothing to lose because we have our own secret network]<br><br>and thus posting information is your duty.<br><br>format of the information will be like this<br><br>Name of sch: Raffles Junior College<br>Subject of SPA: Biology<br>Month of attempt: April<br>Skill: B only<br>No. of attempt: 1/3 &lt;-- Most schs give their students 3 tries for the same sch. It is impo to state which try is it. For my friend, it is his first bio skill b spa.<br>Topic on: Osmosis<br><br>SET-UP:<br><br>Rather easy piece of crap. You're given big big pieces of potatoes, cut into 2 similar seperate pieces, same size (3 x 3) cm.<br>Take one and sub-divide it into 27 small cubes of 1x1 cm.<br><br>now you have 1 big 3 x 3 cm cube and 27 small 1x1cm cubes.<br><br>let's call them A and B respectively<br><br>they will prepare some sucrose solution for you.<br><br>the experiment goes by weighing the increase in weight of the cubes. pour <strong>equal</strong> volume of sucrose solution into two containers. then put the 2 stuffs A and B into seperate containers. starting timing your watch for 1 minute intervals. then take out the stuffs and weigh them on the electronic weighing machine. record the increase of weight.<br><br>TABLE:<br><br>remember to include weigh, 2 seperate columns for A and B and initial weight, final weight and percentage change<br><br>SHAPE OF GRAPH:<br><br>no graphs involved here<br><br>OTHER VALUES/MEASUREMENTS WE MUST FIND:<br><br>nothing else in this experiment<br><br>PRECAUTIONS FOR MARKING SCHEME:<br><br>remember to keep table clean and put knife away. keep container closed at all times with anything to prevent evaporation, same for the potato specimens.<br><br>IF IN DOUBT, POST BELOW THIS THREAD AND I WILL ANSWER YOUR QUERIES<br><br>****************************************************************<br><br>above is a sample (real one) of RJC's bio spa. of cuz it's not by me and im nt from rjc.<br><br>****************************************************************<br><br>CHAPTER 2:<br><br>here's the format to post, always refer to the example above to give u an idea on what to write<br><br>format***<br><br>Name of School:<br>Subject of spa:<br>Month of attempt:<br>Skill: (remember to write the word 'only' for certainty behind)<br>Number of attempts: (eg: 2/3 -&gt; second out of three tries)<br>Topic on:<br><br>SETUP:<br><br>TABLE:<br><br>SHAPE OF GRAPHS:<br><br>OTHER VALUES/MEASUREMENTS WE MUST FIND: &lt;--eg, gradient, y-intercept etc...<br><br>PRECAUTIONS FOR MARKING SCHEME: &lt;-- <strong>mistakes</strong> u made and dun want others to follow and other areas to look out for[/b]</div>
