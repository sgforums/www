            <div class='col-md body'>THERE IS A SECRET IN MY SOUP: Well, yet another "BODY HORROR" tale of that terrible real life "Hello Kitty Murder" crime that took place in China. The other, more impressive, film being HUMAN PORK CHOP which I'm sure you've already read about. This movie however, is much more slick in it's presentation of the inhuman treatment that the poor girl gets. I also believe this project must have been aimed at a larger audience because it almost seems like one big long music video of contemptable, unremorseful behavior. It really tries so hard to stay "mainstream" even though it's still about that horrible Category 3 subject matter of body mutilation and evil human behavior. It even co-stars popular "straight to video" action star, MICHAEL WONG as a detective out to solve this murder case. But again, just like the other movie, it's over an hour of mind-numbing degradation, ego-crushing humiliation, super-pain inflicting torture, and finally, the brutal murder and desecration of another human being. And no matter what I may say about it to make you think otherwise, it's not for the squimish, that's for damn sure. Yet it is, for the lack of a better description, easier to view than the PORK CHOP since it's alittle more high gloss than the former. Or it's just the fact that I had already braced myself for what might be thrown at me this time. I can't really say for sure but let me tell you though, it DOES have it's share of nerve-rattling, soul-stealing, innocence-smashing moments that differ from the first film. Let's see, there's a nice cheese grater to the spine scene (or as they call it, the Human Grinder), a quick pissing on the face (followed by steaming human excrement), some VERY WELCOMED nude scenes (this girl's far finer than EMILY KWAN from PORK CHOP), a nifty knuckle busting (ouch), and a high pressure air hose, drug induced sex scene that's just plain funny to watch. The movie itself ISN'T funny though and if you stop to think about what you're actually seeing, you'll grab the remote and cut this sleezy mess off before it goes too far. Remember, this is still a vile and morbid display of the graphic murder of another human being even if it comes in a "not-so-serious" attempt to present itself to the audience. I would highly recommend that you find something else to watch instead and leave this one to the hardcore shock-horror viewers only!<br><br>-Steve<br></div>
