            <div class='col-md body'>EBOLA SYNDROME:  Well, in the "Underground Cinema", you'll certainly meet all kinds of strange, disgusting, repulsive, and unredeemable people (it's the nature of the beast, I guess) but I have to admit that good old fat-faced Chinese scumbag, ANTHONY WONG takes the cake for the the MOST repugnant, appalling man in existance. I mean, the guy displays just about everything that's loathsome in the human male psyche. And from what I hear, this is a very similar character to his other Category 3 splatter-rama, THE UNTOLD STORY (aka HUMAN MEAT PIES) so I guess director HERMAN YAU must have needed that extra helping of Mr. Wong to satisfy his cravings for sheer nausea. And as close minded as this may sound (I'm usually NOT like this), no matter what this actor has done in the past (co-starred in such hits as THE MISSION, the YOUNG AND DANGEROUS series, and A MAN CALLED HERO) or what he plans to do in the future, he'll always be that same sorry, nasty piece of shit "meat fucker" that we got to see here. And don't ask about the "meat fucking" either, you'll just have to watch that sickening scene for yourself. But, ya know, if you really think about it, my statement only flatters Mr. Wong in his acting ability because if he's able to provoke that kind of reaction from a viewer, especially one as jaded as I am, it means he's really got that "magic touch", I suppose. Anyway, this movie has a pretty simple premise for a story though, supra-degenerate Wong plays a derranged serial killer who flees Hong Kong after commiting multiple murders and ends up contracting the Ebola Virus during his brief hideout in Africa. How did he get the virus, you ask? Well, what better way than to rape a poor native girl who's been infected and has passed out in the wilderness. He spots her and quickly takes sexual liberties with the lass before she can wake up. He then gets the disease when she goes into convulsions and spits vomit into his face. She tenses up (with the grip of the death nerve) so he's forced to bash her head in with a large rock while screaming, "Gimme back my dick!". Yup, as I said before, this man is totally without any sort of morals or scupples. So after comitting several new murders in Africa, he returns to Hong Kong with some stolen cash to start all over again. Now, he's spreading the deadly virus (which, by the way, doesn't kill him, he's the new host) by serving food to the public, through the joys of prostitution, murdering anyone that bothers him, and however else he can get away with it. The sky's the limit when it comes to the depths of onscreen outrage that's thrown at us in this flick. But, unfortunately, this same appaling insanity that I had hoped to witness, actually kinda ruined the movie for me. I wasn't offended at what was happening. I simply found myself laughing, trying to guess what the next nastiest thing he could do would be. And that, in my opinion, is the ultimate downfall for this despicable Chinese Category 3 shocker. I quickly forgot that the film should be disturbing in it's presentation of absolute human wickedness and saw it as somewhat of a slapstick and downright silly waste of a potentially fantastic idea which is really a shame because I had such high hopes for this lowdown, sucker-punching sleazer. Now, don't get me wrong, there's enough "unspeakable acts of exaggerated revulsion" to go around and you'll see things that no should ever have to see (whether it's fictitious or not) but I felt this entire experience was lost in the extremely over-the-top, almost comedic antics of the films's "bad guy". Oh well...<br><br>-Steve<br></div>
