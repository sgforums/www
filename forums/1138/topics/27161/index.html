            <div class='col-md body'>HUMAN PORK CHOP: Well now, I'm just not too sure what to make of this movie. It's another one of those heart-pounding, bile-churning, vomit-inducing Oriental Category 3 "BODY HORROR" flicks and it's aim is to inflict as much pain as possible to the victim of the movie... as well as the viewer. Director BENNIE CHAN got it going right from the start though. The Hong Kong police bust in, find the boiled remains of the deceased victim in question, and nab the suspected evil-doers (led by the bloodthristy pimp Hok, perfectly played by actor WAYNE LAI). So through their confessions, the tragic story is now told to us. It's a sobbering, very powerful film with the subject matter being of the most extreme in nature. I will say that I do really LOVE the name of the movie but watching it is, indeed, a totally different disgusting animal altogether. It's not nearly as graphic in it's malicious realism as the popular Japanese snuff-wannabe series, GUINEA PIG, but it's pretty damn painful punishment to view none-the-less. Yet I suppose that if you're a true sadist, then you're into seeing a group of some really unlikable people (let's do this in degrees shall we) kidnap, mistreat, humiliate, degrade, torment, hurt, beat, burn, torture, murder, and finally mutilate another human being for a hour and a half, then this just might be your cup of tea. It wasn't mine at the time. And the toilet scene was almost enough to send me spewing chunks just from simply watching it, no smell or touch needed.  FUCK! It's something I can NEVER "un-see" and really made me wonder why I ever wanted to watch this filthy mess to begin with. Those horrid scenes of feces eating lingered in my mind LONG after the film had actually ended. EMILY KWAN, you're certainly an actress that deserves a Golden Dragon (the Chinese equivalent of an Oscar Award) because you made it all seem so damn real from the first beating, to the "human plunger" scene, and right down to the final inhuman violation and ultimate visceration of your body. And believe it or not, they say that this film (along with two others, entitled THERE'S A SECRET IN MY SOUP and THE UNTOLD STORY aka HUMAN MEAT PIES) is based on an actual true crime event in Chinese history (known as the "Hello Kitty Murder") so that makes it even that much worse and just goes to show you how wickedly perverse and evil some people can really be. And that, my friends, just might be the greatest horror of them all.<br><br>-Steve<br></div>
