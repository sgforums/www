            <div class='col-md body'>HORRIBLE HIGH HEELS: Yup, I know you're probably wondering about the name. And nope, it's NOT a transvestite or homosexual film! No chicks with dicks here. It's just more of that wacky self-destructive fun from the Asian "BODY HORROR" genre. TRIPLE H (no, not the wrestler either) is Category 3 at it's BEST (or WORST, whichever the case may be). It's ingrediants are: one part porn movie wanna-be, one part Kung-Fu Theatre, one part badly acted B action flick, and one part rawness similar to the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. Well, with all that, how the hell can you go wrong?! Oh, it finds a way, trust me. Basic storyline... a group of small time gangsta's (and some of the ugliest Chinese men you'll ever see on screen too) supply a local shoe making store with a fantastic new line of special shoe leather. The reason it's so smooth and easy to work with is because it's made from human skin! Yes, that's right. These thugs will make anyone a potential victim but they prefer young men and women. Their skin is softer and more elastic, I suppose. So watch out, if they catch ya, they'll rape ya (if you're female, that is), they'll kill ya, cut ya up, and skin ya for shoe leather. But not only that, there's other scenes a-plenty of violent murder, graphic mutilation, exploitation of women, explicit sexual deviance, and horribly foul behavior that can ONLY be seen as totally vile, totally loathsome, and just down right nasty (depending on your own personal tastes in Oriental sleeze)! I believe there was some sort of a love story hidden in this mess somewhere but after seeing the things that I saw, I forgot all about it. I remember one scene in particular that involves a picture of a woman's face (with the mouth cut out) taped to a live duck, ass-end up. Now I'll let your imagination fill in the blanks of that story. And one thing I just couldn't quite understand about one other scene, if you love someone, why would you want to urinate all over them the first chance you get to have them alone to yourself? Like I said before, just plain nasty. It really makes you worry about their way of thinking for them to make trash such as this. And if they're not careful, movies like this could give China a really bad name. Are you listening, CHOW CHEUNG?!<br><br>-Steve<br></div>
