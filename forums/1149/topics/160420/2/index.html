            <div class='col-md body'>indeed, but unfortunately the global market doesnt seem to care and the chinese manufacturers have been pushing hard.<br><br>unfortunately its also the cause of some major problems - most notably of its cheapness leading to its accessability to those we would rather not have access to it - ie. the common street thug or criminal or the stupid little kids that go and take these, and commit criminal or harrassing acts with them.<br>in the eyes of the law there is no difference between people who use them legitimately [like wargaming, training] and those who dont.<br><br>i believe that this was the way airsoft went in singapore and the uk is following..<br><br>this has led to the acceleration and now the introduction of the Bill in the uk which is going to strangle airsoft until its dead, and also taking with it childrens toys and anything remotely gun-shaped.<br><br>personally, i wouldnt buy the cheap plastic chinese copies anyway as they hold little interest for me, and lack the out-of-the-box performance ive come to expect from other manufacturers.<br><br>the chinese manufacturers i do go for though are people like classic army [yik fung?] and the taiwanese manufacturers [ksc/kwa/g&amp;g/g&amp;p] as they do produce quality pieces [and full metal guns which arent exactly available in japan due to various restrictions on the market, so TM would never be able to make them], with high performance out of the box - no need for upgrades - and can be better in some cases than the TM equivalent.<br>Also, they can also produce products that TM are quite clearly never going to produce - like the HK33, the SOPMOD M14, the G36K, M60's, M249's, MP7's, the L85, and for a long time, the M14..<br></div>

Besides, it will be more expensive to own one legally and the choices are quite limited. Only GBB pistols and no AEGs<br><br>No skirmish too<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, well, if i'm bringing my gear over [at its height i had 30-40 odd guns] - then i might try and sort out some kind of arrangement. you never know, it might work out.<br>at least i wouldnt be buying my 15-year old collection all over again.<br><br>i recall speaking to some people who i think briefly ran a skirmish site in singapore, and they said that they shut down due to alot of pressure - but i still think theres a market for it..<br>and if not airsoft, theres RAM.<br><br>theres still that CQB RAM-based site operating in sg isnt there?<br>RAM comes in the form of M4's, MP5's and Glocks, and newly released are fully functional [cocking action and mag-empty non-functioning are features of the new system] Kalashnikov's.<br>Sure you'd need to wear heavy duty protection [think paintball] but you can apply real world firearms techniques in the deployment of these weapons.<br><br>afaik, there are AEG's legally in sg. i've seen them.</div>
