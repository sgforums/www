From the way they screwed up that smoking ban...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Yea anyways im staying at newington green, 10 mins from Angel Islington, 10 mins from Highbury n Islington. Heard them popping off whole night long but didn't see much. Was supposed to go out to Alexandra Palace to catch the fireworks but got lazy about it. In any case my flatmate thot it was a delicious irony to have a fireworks display at a place which has been razed to the ground by fires 3 or 4 times previously.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Wheres u at nowadays?</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>i moved around work-wise - i'm now south of the river..<br>3P/SMK are rather notorious, not to mention expensive, as theyve going around, being heavy handed claiming they have the sole rights to sell anything in the european market, to which all the other retailers laugh.<br><br>as youre in london you've got two main places to go, both have stock, both have showrooms.<br>airsoft armouries in little chalfont [nw london, jubilee line iirc], who have a good rep last i heard, and wolf armouries in camden [a few mins walk beyond sainsburys].<br>wolf have a back room to which they have to grant you access - be specific about what you want and youll be ok, and be taken through.<br><br>price-wise, both are on the high side, given that theyre bricks &amp; mortar shops.<br>AA is probably cheaper. both are more expensive than shipping in from HK, perhaps even after shipping and import taxes.<br>but this does give you the opportunity to look at, feel and handle the ranges youre looking at.<br>After the ban comes in though, you wont have anywhere to get them from [mail order, shops, etc all get the chop]<br><br>again, slimelight round the back of angel still has the game nights on tuesdays - dont know if youve been yet - i havent been for sometime now. ive heard its achanged a little game-wise and theyve got home teams etc and i'm not sure it'd be what i'm looking for anymore.<br><br>the bill's going through right now. because theyve lumped it with other offences and bans [knives and drinking], it all looks good to those eager to make themselves look tough on crime. there were suggestions of exemptions [which was the best the community couldve hoped for] but i think itll be difficult to see them grant these exemptions.<br><br>back to guns - if youre not after quality, then dont look at western arms. they also dont take too kindly to green or anything above 134a.<br><br>KSC/KWa are your best bet for green-friendly guns and the price is ok. you get some good deals on half metal combo's [glocks for example].<br><br>for full-metal fun [sounds great] and sheer cheapness [you could buy 2 for the price of one ksc/wa] at the expense of visual accuracy and trades, then KJW are good to look at. there have been stories of higher proportion of lemons from KJW but the recent production runs have had good feedback [Para ordnance and M9 primarily, both black and nickel].<br><br>[although i mention, and almost recommend KJw, these might be hard to find in the uk - WA, TM and KSC/KWA are by far easier to get in the uk]<br><br>hth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The more expensive items will be costlier to obtain but the cheaper ones, cost maybe up to 5 quid less because shipping costs r fixed for other sites.
