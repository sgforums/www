              <p>I posted it in sgforums,but didn't saw this Airsoft forum untill some lucky googling&gt;Wonder anyone still around...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After my topic in Chit Chat(Where buy Airsoft?),I have decided
                                      to write a short "convincing" letter to people new to Airsoft or
                                      don't know what is that in an effort to promote the sport and at
                                      the same time try to unban it.Airsoft is like paintball,with the
                                      exception that holding a replica gun feels more "real" and fun then
                                      holding a weird piece of metal that shoots paint at you.(Not
                                      insulting Paintball fans here.).In short,it is a hobby in many
                                      countries.Guess what?It's banned here even though it is perfectly
                                      legal in other countries (with some exceptions) though.It's like
                                      having MacDonalds,KFC,Pizza Hut,Subway and things you love to eat
                                      having banned.Contrary to government belief,Airsoft is VERY
                                      safe,precautions will have to be taken.Here is an excerpt from
                                      airsoftking.com:</p>
              <p><em><strong>Should parents allow kids the use of Airsoft
                                      guns?</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>When your child is writing his wish list for Santa Claus or
                                      for his/her birthday and you read that he/she wants an “Airsoft
                                      gun”, you don’t have to be alarmed. Air soft guns are harmless
                                      providing safety rules are observed. Airsoft shooting is probably
                                      <strong>one of the safest and most popular sports enjoyed in the
                                      world today</strong>. But, still there are some people that think
                                      they should be banned.</em></p>
              <p><em>But let's give this matter a thought. Forget the air/BB gun
                                      you know from when you were a kid. You remember the one that shot
                                      out a neighbor’s kitchen window. Or maybe the time that you or
                                      someone you knew shot a small whole in the car door. Some one might
                                      have already been telling you, it isn’t a BB gun, it's an Airsoft
                                      gun. It shoots a light weight (soft) plastic BB. <strong>It will
                                      not and cannot break the neighbors' windows or ruin a cars paint
                                      job.</strong></em></p>
              <p>Some might say:</p>
              <p>Load a metal BB in the gun,accidentaly shoot a window and see
                                      the auntie in the opposite block yelling expletives.This is one of
                                      concern.I don't know about Airsoft enough that there is metal
                                      BBs.But as you know:Metal BB+Accident involving eye=accident.But
                                      wait,this is where the convincing part comes:</p>
              <p><strong>Safety issues</strong>:</p>
              <p>The government does not have sufficient information on what
                                      Airsoft guns are.If you were born in the 80s/90s you know there was
                                      a widespread of Airsoft all around.It's like the latest craze in
                                      town.Many children went running around at void decks,playgrounds
                                      firing their Airsoft without concern that someone may get hurt.Then
                                      someone got hurt up real bad he even complained his whiny little
                                      a** to TCS(Now Mediacorp)that he got shot in the eye.Guess what?He
                                      deserved it.No sympathy coming from anyone,please.He did not
                                      observe rules of Airsofting and just fired his AK-74 like a moronic
                                      killer on the loose.Government received the news about the
                                      incident,sent it to lab for testing,and "anything that harms people
                                      using a toy" is considered banning material.Look,every sport
                                      carries a risk.Swimming may risk drowning.Basketball may break your
                                      finger.Football can break your nose.Heck even Dragonboating and
                                      Sailing carries some risk.(If you are following the news.)</p>
              <p><strong>Security Issues:</strong></p>
              <p>Another reason the gov banned it is the reason that it is the
                                      spitting image of the gun it is made from,hence the word
                                      "replica".And the word robbery comes to mind.If the robber were to
                                      consider robbing a store or something,he would just rob it.The
                                      Airsoft does not affect his decision.Even if there is no gun,he can
                                      just take his parang or whatever and just go rob.That innocent
                                      Airsoft gun does not change the fact that someone is going to use
                                      it for harm.</p>
              <p><strong>What I propose:</strong></p>
              <p>-Orang tip at barrel of every Airsoft weapon to differentiate
                                      from the real deal.When I saw Airsoft guns at first look,i thought
                                      the guns were something that the Power Rangers would use,since the
                                      orange is so obvious to the eye.</p>
              <p><em>It has already been confirmed that airsoft rifles CANNOT be
                                      changed to a real firearm. Even if robbers try to use these airsoft
                                      weapons to rob banks, they would have to consider the high
                                      probability of getting shot and killed.</em></p>
              <p>-<em>From a Singapore Airsoft petition</em></p>
              <p>-Restrict 100 FPS to 280 FPS.(sorta like speed the gun can
                                      fire)</p>
              <p>-BAN IT FOR KIDS AND MINORS.They started the banning.No second
                                      chance for them.</p>
              <p>-Skirmish matches be played at Government set up areas.(No,not
                                      playgrounds)</p>
              <p>-Protective gears a must.</p>
              <p>-Airsoft guns cannot be taken out in public or anywhere not
                                      expected except official skirmish sites.Those trying to be a gun
                                      totting moron walking down Orchard Road like James Bond faces the
                                      possibility of getting shot.</p>
              <p>-Sell WWII replica guns!Since people know that robbers won't
                                      take a M1A1 Thompson submachine gun that was used in WWII.</p>

              <p>Sign this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/legalize-airsoft-in-singapore.html">petition</a>(not mine).Because if we just sit back
                                      and pray to gods that the gov will somehow unban it,it may never
                                      come.By signing,you are helping us one step closer to an
                                      unfortunate sport that got banned.</p>
              <p> Government bans too much things.Learn to control matters
                                      and not just ban them to solve the answer.First they ban chewing
                                      gum,then Airsoft,now even porn they also want to ban.-_-II</p>
