            <div class='col-md body'>Do you think that Airsoft should be legalized in Singapore?  Why?<br><br>Personally, airsoft should be recognized as a sport.  Ideally, those who are interested should be allowed to buy and store airsoft equipment and use them at designated ranges.<br><br>If necessary, follow US Airsoft regulations, and enforce compulsory non-removable orange paint on the tip of Airsoft guns.  And limit purchases to those 18 years and above.  Those under 18, may purchase, but must store their arms at designated range armories.  When transporting, all airsoft guns can also be regulated to be kept in carry cases, together with a regulation forbidding airsoft guns from being brought around in public.<br><br>My answer, a resounding YES.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The current generation of Airsoft guns cannot be modified into firearms.  All the current airsoft guns are firing plastic BBs, which rely on compressed air for propulsion.  There is no way with whatever modification, to rechamber it to fire an actual round.  Its easier to make a gun from scratch than to try to convert a 6mm BB carbine to an actual firearm.</div>

Would you take the risk of believing its a fake ?</strong></blockquote>Would you, the police officer or whatever, take the possibility its not real? no, of course not. that criminal has taken to gamble their lives if they do that. And in that situation, when it comes to threatening someone elses life, regardless of whether you use a real gun, a fake gun [airsoft or otherwise], or a banana-in-a-bag, you deserve all that you get - be it maiming or death.<br><blockquote><strong> Many times I answer this question with another question, "How is it possible genuine guns can be smuggled into Singapore"</strong></blockquote> thats for your internal security and customs people to find out. it has nothing to do with whether to legalise airsoft in singapore or not. And with criminals - why should they care about what laws you have anyway? they'll just keep on using whatever theyre using now.<br><blockquote> <strong>Problem with airsoft is that it is possible for you to modify into a real gun. Requires alot of work. However possible.</strong></blockquote> like i said. Utter BS. sort out your facts will you? Go ask some people who really know about airsoft then. Come back and back up your argument.<br><blockquote><strong> Therefore the govt. govt have no gurantees that by legalising airsoft. </strong></blockquote> that by legalising airsoft.. what? i think you forgot to finish your sentence.<br><blockquote><strong>Not to mention, with the age limit imposed. I still find 30 year old mature adults using their pets as moving targets. </strong></blockquote> Registration, as you suggested, should weed out some of these.<br><blockquote><strong>Personally I love airsoft alot. But because of these minor population who decides to do funny things with it makes it impossible for such products to be legalised.</strong></blockquote>Then why not ban cars, people use them irresponsibly, motorbikes, cellphones for that matter... theres always going to be a small group of idiots somewhere in each society. Are you going to wrap yourself up in cotton wool because of it? Are you going to deny to others [who would be responsible] this otherwise harmless sport and hobby because of a few uselss individuals who'd be doing that sort of damage in another way regardless?<br>[which brings me to paintball - this isnt banned in singapore yet its 12+ times far more powerful than airsoft and at least person has died during a game! its also about 3 or 4 times more expensive than airsoft! Airguns - this is legal in singapore? amount of people shot and killed by airguns: quite a few. amount of people shot and killed by airsoft: none]</div>

Some people in there doesn't even know the difference between airsoft and airgun! </strong></blockquote> yeah, i've come across that before - the press are quite bad about it too [they arent even interested in reporting the truth anyway]. 'BB' is also misleading cos BB has a different meaning in japan, whereas eleswhere its generally known as Ball Bearing, which, based on its American origin, is usually a metal [lead] shaped projectile that is pretty lethal. Still, people keep referring ot them as BB guns and so people keep thinking theyre firing metal bullets and so they get mixed up with air guns [which i think are useless anyway - a lot of the IPSC community [uk at least] think so too, and so when GBB and NBB pistols came up for competition they went for that instead..]<br>The confusion with Air guns/pistols leads to the mess over the Brocock revolver - modifying the air cartridge system it uses - to fire .22 calibre bullets. Again, its an Air pistol, and not even remotely to do with airsoft but this point iis missed by so many...<br><blockquote><strong>some people doesn't know that airsoft was firstly created in asia and not america. I quit arguing with them, cause they kept on repeating their statement</strong></blockquote>this'll be the confusion with the BB description again which leads to the american Daisy BB guns that came out over 50 years ago.<br>People forget that Soft Air [eventually Airsoft] came about in Japan because of the problems over the lethalty of paintball [which seems to be the opposite problem in singapore - paintball, far more lethal, is allowed and given recognition..]</div>

Even with red barrel tips.  And I understand that.  Which is why i feel that educating people, and correcting them on proper airsoft usage is more important.</strong></blockquote>education - sure thing. where do you start? you could start with educating the authorities first...<br><br><blockquote><strong>In any case.  If some guy points a "gun" to your head, or at your back, you probably won't see if its real or not.  It can be a real pistol, or it can be an airsoft pistol.  Or it can be one of those bright yellow water squirting pistols painted black, or just a banana.   Chances are, you don't want to find out the hard way.  So if the govt allows airsoft, would there be a surge in these supposed armed robberies?  Would there really be people robbing banks with airsoft guns?</strong></blockquote>  whats to say that isnt happening right now? look at your existing gun clubs - is their existence posing an increased risk of bank robbery, muggings and general gun-related crime? you tell me...<br>[if an airsoft skirmish site can exist under present conditions of a paintball and gun clubs already established in singapore then why not? - according to my last enquiry there used to be an airsoft skirmish site - but it wasnt shut down because of legal reasons - allegedly - with the closure of universal archery i'll never know more]<br><br><blockquote><strong>Question is, if you are a robber, would u dare to rob a bank with guards armed with real 9mm pistols, with just a 6mm Peashooter?<br>Would you threaten someone with a Airsoft gun, rather than a knife to rob him?  </strong></blockquote>Stupid question that shouldnt be entertained.</div>

An everday item can be a weapon if you want them to be and causes greater damage than airsoft. why go through the pain of buying an airsoft when greater pain can be inflicted for free ?. plus it isn't the general idea of an airsoft.</div>
