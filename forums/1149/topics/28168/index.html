US$600 easily.</div></blockquote>i wouldnt say that tho, the two i quoted were custom jobs - special creations or modifications - their prices are between US$600-1000.<br><br>you can get a M41A Pulse rifle [Aliens], from a limited production run of 50, for US$750.. [battery is housed in non-functional grenade launcher]<br><br>The latest large-production run AEG [the G36C from Tokyo Marui] can be had for under US$220 - a price which matches the price of older AEG's now [that wouldve been around US$300-400 when first released].<br>So, from my pov, it looks like the price range of AEG's has dropped overall.<br><br>same goes for pistols [i bought my WA 1911 variant for new about US$275, you can get the latest variants [Para Ord.] for US$150-200]<br><br>and i have to say, that even the cutoms jobs, previously prohibitively expensive, are now more reachable - the M14 i'm having made in HK was only US$800.<br>[before this run was announced i was previously quoted US$1300 for a single conversion from a Hudson model]<br><br>[i realise the US$-S$ isnt that good, so i imagine that Airsoft was 2-3 times more expensive for you guys right from the start..!]<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So I guess I've been right holding the Aug with more respect than the L85.  What about the SA-80? Is it as "problematic" as the L85?<br><br>We've switched to the SAR-21 now, in most aspects, its quite a versatile and useful combat rifle.  Low recoil, user-friendly.  Only dislike is the reloading, and that its a right handed only gun.  It looks kinda like a cross-breed between an Aug and a SG-552, IMO.  Whether it is, technically, or not, I'll only find out if I am thrown into a combat vocation.<br><br>To my knowledge, in descending order of most advanced combat rifle/systems (rifles that can mate accessories to), is as follows.<br><br>OICW<br>FN2000<br>G-36<br>SAR-21<br>SG-552 (these things can take real punishment.
