That shallow cow's main concern was whether she was going to be fined or prosecuted for running over a cat.<br><br>The fact of the matter is that she'd be in way over her head standing in a puddle, so of course she's simply not bloody interested in anything to do with the value of life.  If you happen to know which village she's from, could you please call them and ask them to reclaim their lost idiot?<br><br>Despite her delusions of adequacy, she's got to be a really crap driver if she's going to worry about running into a tree when she stops the car.  Don't they teach emergency braking in the basic driver's course?<br><br>Hell, I've managed to stop my car, park it across two lanes so that the semi-trailer coming up behind me would stop as well, and make sure a baby possum crossed the road safely.  If this retard couldn't simply bring her car to a halt, somebody had better take her licence away.<br><br>I might just sign up for that forum so that I can abuse the hell out of her.
