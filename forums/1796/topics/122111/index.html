            <div class='col-md body'>since last year there was this female cat that will always loiter around my workplace in camp. somehow she had made my department her home and i will always see her everyday, on the sofa, sleeping on the bed beside me. it great to have her around, kinda give my workplace a homey feel to it. i enjoyed her company and will pat her whenever she comes near me.<br><br>but the sad thing is, my sergeant hated the cat. i don't know whether it's army rules that we are not allowed to keep pets in camp or his own personally hatred for cats, he will always shout and chase away the cat away whenever he sees it. he even threaten to punish us if he sees us with the cat again.<br><br>the cat was pregnant at that time and she gave birth in a isolated corner in my workplace. at first we didn't knew where she gave birth, it was when we saw her always going in/out of this certain part of the building that we suspected something. sure enough, inside we saw 4 cute small kittens.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  they are still very young, eyes are still shut, can barely walk. it's always a joy to see the feminine side of her feeling her kittens with milk.<br><br>sadly, soon the evil sergeant found out about this and ordered the kittens to be removed immediately. i have no choce but to comply and left the kittens outside the vet not far away from camp. not knowing where her kitten went to, the poor cat will always meow at the place where she normally hide her babies. it was very sad seeing her like this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>after that incident, she became more clever and will avoid coming to my workplace during daytime. she will reappear during the night when my evil sergeant has gone back home.<br><br>quite recently, she was pregnant again. she gave birth again in the same place as her previous birth. unfortunately same as last time, she was caught yet again by the evil sergeant and her kittens was taken away by the AVA. i don't even have a chance to look at her kittens.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>last friday, my evil sergeant did the most evil thing. he called the AVA and requested for a trap to catch the cat. and guess what, when i came for work today, there she was, caught helplessly inside the cage, crying desperately for help. she even reach out her paw out of the cage when she saw me coming. but there was nothing i can do. i cannot defy my sergeant and later this morning, the AVA came.<br><br>she was taken away forever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some ppl jus don't understand.. The cat didnt ka jiao them or what.. WHY must they do such evil things to small living things?! Your sergent seriously is a son of a biT_CH! Shit him!!!!<br><br>WHY WHY WHY?! Human needs to eat, cats need to eat too! They've the rights to share this world with us!!! No wonder there's so many natural disasters against us.. Retribution.. Ppl are doing evil things against our animal friends and the world is showing no mercy to us too.. What comes round, goes round..<br><br>I'm in a cold war with my dad now.. Cos i defy him and went to feed the stray cats.. He asked me out on the weekend, but I had to feed the cats what?! He say one day dun feed they wun die.. I was like "oh f*ck?! One day you dont eat you can tahan anot?" I'm jus trying my very best to provide the strays at least a meal each day.. And i'm being responsible to them by giving them food on regular basics.. I'm assume I'm not wrong right? But he jus dun understand!! He even opened up the windows hoping my cat will jump out or what.. F*cking shit.. I had to keep my cat in my room now and I really pity her that she can't run everywhere she wants.. And worse still, my dad took away the air con remote and I had to use bloody fan in this hot weather..<br><br>But.. I didn't regret defying him.. I'm sharing cos I hope if ever you guys encounter evil ppl who mistreat the cats, try to help them fight for their rights of living.. A cat's life is a life too.. We human can endure little punishment, but imagine the impact on them.. They're so fragile..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
