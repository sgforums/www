            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.korats.com/images/korateye.gif"><br><br>The Korat<br><br>DESCRIPTION<br>The Korat (Koh-Raht) is a medium to small, shorthair cat with thefemales weighing between 6 and 8 pounds and the males from 8 to 10 pounds. The Korat is a very compact cat with a low percentage of the weightas body fat. This means the Korat may appear to be a small cat, but in reality they are much heavier and more solid than they look. They have broad chests with well developed muscles, even the females. They have a single close lying coat that is always silver-blue. Single coat means they do not have a downy undercoat and the coat lies flat. The head is heart shaped. The heart is outlined by drawing imaginary lines from the rounded tip of the chin up to the top of the ears and then back to the top of the head. The eyes are oversized for the face but arenot protruding or "bug eyed." The eyes are round when fully open butappear slanted when closed or partially closed. They are peridot green(in the mature cat) and translucent in all stages of development. Koratsare slow maturing cats. They can often take up to 5 years to reach theirfull potential. The coat will always be silver-blue, but the silver tipping will become more pronounced as they mature. The eye color, a vivid peridot green, also appears as cat matures. The Korat is a cat that gets better and better as it ages.<br>HISTORY<br>The Korat is an ancient cat from Siam (now Thailand) that iswritten of in the "The Cat-Book Poems." This book was writtenbetween 1350 and 1767 AD. The Korat is known as the Si-Sawat catin its native country and the Korat name was originated when KingRama V of Siam was presented with the cat. He asked what kind ofcat it was and was told it came from Korat, a high plateau innortheast Thailand. It is known as the good-luck cat of Thailandand a pair of Korats are often given to brides on their wedding dayto ensure a happy marriage. Korats are rarely sold in Thailand,but given to people held in high esteem.<br><br>The first Korat to be exhibited was probably in England in the late19th century. It was entered as a Siamese because that is wherethe owner obtained it. It was listed as a solid blue anddescriptions of that judging still exist today. The first modernKorats were introduced to the U.S. by Mrs Jean Johnson in 1959. Her husband retired from the foreign service in Thailand and theywere presented with a pair of Korats as gifts when they returned tothe United States. Since that introduction, many additional Koratshave been imported and every Korat can trace its ancestry back toKorats living or have lived in Thailand. This why the Korat issometimes referred to as the Silver-blue cat with the Thaipassport.<br><br>Shortly after the Korat arrived in the United States the Korat CatFanciers Association was formed. It is a non-affiliatedinternational club dedicated to the protection and development ofthe Korat. This club was instrumental in getting the Koratrecognized in all associations and helps ensure that the standardsfor the Korat remain virtually the same in all associations.<br><br><img src="http://www.korats.com/images/korats.gif"><br>CHARACTERISTICS AND TEMPERAMENT<br><br>The Korat is an active cat with strong likes and dislikes. Theyare quite territorial and consider their "human" part of their territory. For this reason they make outstanding companions, always nearby andfaithful. Korats are very intelligent and take well to most training. Korats have been trained to play games such as fetch and can be trained to walk on a leash. Korats "bond" with their owner either as kittens or as adults. The bonding usually takes place in the first few weeks a Korat is in its new home. After the bonding, the Korat will want to be with their "person," whatever that person is doing and will follow their chosen person from room to room to be nearby. This behavior has been known to annoy some people. Bonding with a Korat is not limited to humans. Korats will bond to what ever entity they like best. This can be an adult, a child, another cat, or a dog. Bonding with a Korat doesn't mean it will reject offers of affection from others. It simply means they have a chosen preference in companionship. Korats have thrived in every environment this author has known. They do tend to elevate themselves to the Number 1 position in a group of cats and other cat breeds have been known to resent this.<br><br>Korats in the show ring show all of the above mentioned traits. Korats arenot generally fearful cats, so most of their show behavior is learned. Theymay learn that aggressive behavior gets them taken home. They may also learnthat certain behaviors get them special attention from their chosen person.Showing a Korat takes time and firm control. It takes time to train a Korat to show. The exhibitor must ensure the Korat learns the show routine andwhat is expected of the show cat. An exhibitor of Korats must have firm control of themselves, because any "pay-off" of unacceptable behavior bythe Korat, teaches the Korat to repeat the behavior in order to getwhat he wants most, attention from his "person."<br><br><img src="http://www.korats.com/images/koratkit.gif"></div>

Happie Valentine's Day in Advance <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><img src="http://www.fanciers.com/cat-pix/rag1.jpg"><br>The Rag Doll<br><br>Brief Introduction<br><br>Ragdolls are large, docile cats. They are sweet-faced and muscular, with an overall impression of elegance and balance. They have a medium-long, non-matting coat with a soft texture like rabbit fur. They are pointed in color (like the Himalayan or Siamese) and appear in seal point, blue point, chocolate point, and lilac point, with or without white markings.<br>Is This The Breed For Me?<br><br>If you want a large cat which is non-aggressive, loves to be with people, and is very placid, you may want to consider a Ragdoll. Also, if you love the look of a long-haired cat, but do not want the constant grooming associated with breeds such as the Persian, a Ragdoll would be a good choice. The gentle Ragdoll is also good with children and is easy to introduce into a multi-pet household.<br><br>If you want a very active or talkative cat, then you might not be happy with the less-active Ragdoll.<br><br>(This is an informal description. Precise breed standards are available from the various associations. If you plan to show or breed your Ragdoll, you should obtain breed standards from the associations in which you want to show, and read them carefully.)<br><br>Ragdolls are large, heavy cats, with broad chests and large hindquarters. They are slow-maturing, and do not reach full maturity until approximately three years of age. Females are smaller than males, weighing about 10-15 pounds on average. Males weigh an average of 12-20 pounds as adults, although some may grow to be larger.<br><br>Ragdolls have large, oval, blue eyes and sweet expressions. Their large, rounded ears are set with a slight forward tilt. They have a curved profile with the look of a "ski slope" as it merges to the top of the head.<br><br>Their medium-long coats and bushy tails have a soft texture that feels like rabbit fur. In general, Ragdolls have longer fur around the neck (a "ruff") and on the back of the hindquarters (sometimes referred to as "britches"). The fur does not tend to mat, and is easily combed. It does, however, require occasional grooming.<br><br>Ragdolls are pointed cats. Like other pointed breeds such as the Himalayan and Siamese, Ragdoll kittens are born all white and slowly develop color. The color continues to deepen as the cat ages.<br><br>In most associations, Ragdolls are accepted in 3 patterns and 4 colors. The three patterns are "colorpoint," "mitted," and "bicolor":<br><br>* A "colorpoint" has dark points (ears, tail, face, and feet) with a body of a lighter shade. The nose leather and pawpads match the point color. Colorpoints do not have white markings (although the pale body color may appear white on some cats).<br>* A "mitted" has dark points and lighter body like a colorpoint, but also has white "mitts" on the front paws, white "boots" on the back legs and feet, a white chin, a white strip on the stomach, and a white ruff.<br>* A "bi-color" has the dark points (ears and tail), but the mask is interrupted by an inverted "V" running between the eyes and expanding into the muzzle. The body color forms a "saddle" on the cat's back and the remainder of the cat is white. Bi-colors have pink nose leather and paw pads.<br><br>The four colors are "seal," "chocolate," "blue," and "lilac" (also known as "frost"):<br><br>* A "seal" has dark seal brown points with a light tan body color.<br>* A "chocolate" has milk chocolate points with an ivory body color.<br>* A "blue" has dark gray points with a pale gray body color.<br>* A "lilac" has pinkish gray points with a frosty white body color.<br><br>To describe a Ragdoll, combine the color and pattern names. For example, a seal Ragdoll, depending on the pattern, might be a "seal colorpoint," "seal mitted," or "seal bi-color."<br><img src="http://www.fanciers.com/cat-pix/rag3.jpg"><br>Characteristics and Temperament<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ragdolls (as their name implies) are extremely "laid-back," docile, non-aggressive cats. They tend to relax when held. They are said to possess a non-fighting instinct, which means that if attacked, they do not defend themselves. They are very "people" oriented and love to be around others, which often finds them greeting guests and/or following their owners around in a fashion similar to a puppy. They are often quite an attraction in a show ring because of their docile dispositions and acceptance of the judge placing them on their backs, holding them like a baby, etc.<br><br>In general, Ragdolls are not extremely vocal, but they do voice their opinions concerning certain things (such as at mealtime!). Ragdolls are generally placid cats, but they do love to play with all types of toys and like to be involved in whatever "action" is going on.<br>Care and Training<br><br>Ragdolls are intelligent and like to please their owners. Training Ragdolls is much more successful when done with rewards. For example, they can be trained easily to use a scratching post instead of your furniture by lavishing attention on them whenever they use the post. As with most cats, however, Ragdolls can be their "own boss" if they so choose!<br><br>They do not shed excessively, and need little care to keep their coats in good condition. Their soft, rabbit-like fur does not tend to mat. The fur does require occasional combing or brushing, and the longer fur around the hindquarters should be combed regularly. In general, Ragdolls do not mind being groomed and, in fact, often enjoy the grooming sessions.<br><br>Because Ragdolls lack the instinct to defend themselves when attacked, they must be kept as indoor pets only. However, they can be easily leash trained so that they can go for walks with you outside.<br><br>Otherwise, good food, fresh water, regular vet-checkups, regular vaccinations and lots of love is what they need to thrive. Bits of fresh raw beef can also be fed, as it helps clean the teeth and gives good nutrients, but be *very* sure of your supplier before doing this!<br>Special Medical Concerns<br><br>No specific medical conditions have been noted with this breed. However, as with all breeds, certain "lines" might have a tendency toward specific health problems. It's probably a good idea to talk to the breeder about whether his/her cats come from lines with any health risks.<br>Brief History<br><br>In the early 1960's, a woman from California named Ann Baker created the Ragdoll by breeding a white female Persian to a male Birman. She then introduced a female Burmese into the breeding program. This combination resulted in the Ragdoll breed. She then founded the IRCA organization in approximately 1971, which had very stringent "rules" for owners of her cats. The IRCA still exists, but Ragdolls produced by the IRCA are not accepted in any major association.<br><br>Fortunately, a husband and wife team bought a pair of the original IRCA Ragdolls and realized that this breed needed to be standardized, shown, and accepted by the various associations in the cat fancy. They worked on an extensive, selective breeding program, out of which grew the standardized Ragdolls. The Ragdoll Fanciers' Club International (RFCI) was then formed to promote the breed and set specific guidelines for Ragdoll breeders.<br><br>RFCI Ragdolls are bred Ragdoll to Ragdoll only, with no outcrossing to any other breeds. They have specific breed standards, to which the breeders must adhere. RFCI Ragdolls are now accepted for registration in all cat registering associations.<br><img src="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/jpgs-bob/ragdoll.gif"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Turkish Angora<br><br>The Turkish Angora is a naturally-occuring breed of cat, originating from the Manul cat which was domesticated by the Tartars. Eventually they migrated to Turkey, and are considered as a national treasure in that country.<br><br>If you decide to be owned by a Turkish Angora, you will no doubt consider it your own "domestic treasure." They are one of the most intelligent breeds of cats, intensely devoted, indefatigably playful with a zest for life. Turkish Angoras meet life on its own terms and love every minute of it. Quite an example to follow, it seems.<br><br>Breed Brief:<br><br>Body: Well balanced and graceful, of medium size, with a long slender torso and long legs.<br>Coat: Fine and silky, medium-long, and shimmering with every step. Although white was the traditional color, a wide array of colors are acceptable in several patterns.<br><br><img src="http://cats.about.com/library/graphics/turkAngora170.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/articles/jpgs/ta9596.jpg"><br><br>ELEGANT, ETHEREAL, REGAL, STATUESQUE, STRONG and OPINIONATED are the words perhaps most descriptive of this ancient and oftentimes controversial breed. Most previous accounts of the Turkish Angora have focused on history and legend. Although these stories are interesting and often inspiring, this time we will focus on the cats as they are today: being bred, shown and living with us as our pets.<br><br>Elegant - oh yes! When a lithe Turkish Angora sits up tall, on its long, fine-boned legs, a silken sheen of gossamer fur dripping from its slender, graceful neck, with its delicately pointed face and large, expressive almond eyes (looking down on us commoners, mind you) and a crown of large, pointed, tufted ears set high atop its head, it is no wonder that the Turkish people and our breeders are so enthralled with and protective of this regal creature. It is a great shame that most people, including our judges, do not see the Angora in motion. It is then that it appears most beautiful; like a great thoroughbred horse, it literally floats through space with its ears held high, its slender, finely muscled, long body followed by a long, erect tail with a silky banner of a plume streaming out behind it.<br><br>The Turkish Angora is thought by many people to be the original longhaired cat. Ankara, formerly Angora, is known as the home of several types of animals with silky, delicately textured, long coats. The goats and rabbits still provide fur for the creation of the beautiful angora knits manufactured today. Turkish Angoras still roam the villages and countryside of Turkey, virtually unchanged through many centuries. The character that has led to their survival is strongly instinctual and extremely intelligent. Today, they are adapting well to living with people, instead of living free, but they still maintain their own, strong personality traits. Anyone who has ever owned a Turkish Angora or shown one, is very aware of that fact. These cats will reward you with exuberant affection and they love to show off, but once an Angora makes up its mind about something, not even the most clever of us can change it. Perhaps one of the best Turkish words to summarize the breed is "yaman:" strong, smart and capable. They do everything with skill and agility, from leaping to the top of your kitchen cabinets, to watching you while you work, to finding ingenious ways of eluding you when it's time for their bath. They are fantastic breeders, both male and female, having healthy, robust kittens with little difficulty and much enjoyment during both the courtship and the raising of their litters.<br><br>The Turkish Angora has an unquenchable thirst for play. They love to race through the house chasing imaginary prey. Their long slender bodies and legs, having evolved for the hunt, have the need for the continued chase at home. They can be found in the most unlikely places - making the open door of your closet swing to and fro while sitting on it or playing hockey in the bathtub, with a bottle cap for the puck, in the middle of the night. Fortunately, the silky coat of the Angora is single, which means that it has no undercoat, creating an almost care-free, longhaired cat. This is great for the cat, as well as the owner, for then it has more time to devote to "helping" around the house. An Angora feels it mandatory to be involved in every aspect of your home and life. It will love you with a profound devotion and refuse to accept any less in return. You will find your Angora interested in everything that you do. Whether you are working at your computer or cleaning your bathroom, your Angora feels it must be present to supervise the proceedings. You know it means well, even if it is not always welcome. Please don't tell it so, however. You may hurt its feelings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A cat with a raised paw beckons from the doorway. The cat is ceramic and the traditional Japanese symbol of good luck. They are modeled after the famous and favored bobtailed cats of Japan.<br><br>From written records it seems certain that the domestic cat first arrived in Japan from China or Korea at least one thousand years ago. The Japanese Bobtail breed has certainly existed in Japan for many centuries; it is featured in many ancient prints and paintings.<br><br>In 1968 the late Elizabeth Freret imported the first three Japanese Bobtails to the United States from Japan. In 1971 they were given provisional status in The Cat FanciersÂ’ Association (CFA) and were accepted for championship competition in 1976.<br><br>In 1993 the longhair Japanese Bobtail was accepted by CFA for championship competition. Mrs. Betty OÂ’Brien, who judged the first CFA show in Japan in 1968, was deeply impressed by a longhaired mi-ke owned by Mrs. Kiyoko Tanaka which was exhibited at the show. The longhair Japanese Bobtail has existed for centuries in the orient as have the shorthairs.<br><br>A large painting from the 15th century hangs in the Freer Gallery of Art in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC, showing two lovely longhaired Japanese Bobtails. Their coats are parted neatly down the back and their tails are large and plumey. The longhair Japanese Bobtail exhibits all the same characteristics as the shorthair Bobtail.<br><br>Japanese Bobtails are strong and healthy cats. They usually have litters of three to four kittens that are extremely large for newborns. Compared to other breeds, they are active earlier, walk earlier and start getting into trouble earlier. This breed has a low kitten mortality rate and high disease resistance. Kittens are never born tailless, nor are they born with full tails. They are active, intelligent, talkative cats. Their soft voices are capable of nearly a whole scale of tones; some people say they sing. Since they adore human companionship they almost always speak when spoken to.<br><br>They like to carry things in their mouths, and most enjoy a good game of fetch. Masters of the pounce, these cats love to ride on shoulders. They are good travelers. They donÂ’t panic at shows or strange hotel rooms, they adjust to dogs and other animals, and are especially good with children.<br><br>The Japanese Bobtail is a natural breed and does indeed come from Japan; all CFA registered cats can be traced back to the original imports. Any color except the Siamese pattern or Abyssinian type agouti is permitted, the most popular colors are the mi-ke and those colors that can be used to create it: white, black, red, black and white, red and white, and tortoiseshell. Vividly contrasting colors and bold dramatic markings are preferred on the bi-colors.<br><br><img src="http://www.cfa.org/breeds/profiles/jpgs-bob/jbobsh.gif"><br><br>The tail is unique not only to the breed, but to each individual cat. Like our finger prints, no two tails are ever alike. The tail must be clearly visible and is composed of one or more curves, angles, or kinks or any combination thereof. The furthest extension of the tail bone from the body should be no longer than three inches. The direction in which the tail is carried is not important. The tail may be flexible or rigid and should be of a size and shape that harmonizes with the rest of the cat. The genetic factor which created the Japanese Bobtail is completely different from the Manx, a naturally tailless cat. Unlike the Manx, it is due to recessive genes and breeds true. The two breeds are not related in any way. Not only are their tails different, but the body types are completely opposite.<br><br><img src="http://www.cfa.org/breeds/profiles/jpgs-bob/jboblh.gif"><br><br>Pricing on Japanese Bobtails usually depends on type, applicable markings and bloodlines distinguished by Grand Champion (GC), National or Regional winning parentage (NW or RW) or of Distinguished Merit parentage (DM). The DM title is achieved by the dam (mother) having produced five CFA grand champion/premier (alter) or DM offspring, or sire (father) having produced fifteen CFA grand champion/premier or DM offspring. Usually breeders make kittens available between twelve and sixteen weeks of age. After twelve weeks, kittens have had their basic inoculations and developed the physical and social stability needed for a new environment, showing, or being transported by air. Keeping such a rare treasure indoors, neutering or spaying and providing acceptable surfaces (e.g. scratching posts) for the natural behavior of scratching (CFA disapproves of declawing or tendonectomy surgery) are essential elements for maintaining a healthy, long and joyful life.<br><br><img src="http://www.cfa.org/breeds/profiles/jpgs-bob/jbobsh2.gif"><br><br><img src="http://www.cfa.org/breeds/profiles/jpgs-bob/jboblh2.gif"></div>
