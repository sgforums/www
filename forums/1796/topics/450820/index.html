              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>TOKYO: For the young
               women whiling away their evenings with a cappuccino in hand and a cat 
              on their lap, Tokyo's "neko cafes" are the ideal place to unwind and 
              soothe their stresses.<br><br>"After a long day at work, I just want to stroke cats and relax," said saleswoman Akiko Harada.<br><br>"I
               love cats, but I can't have one at home because I live in a small 
              apartment. I started coming here because I really missed having fun with
               cats and touching them."<br><br>For Harada and others like her, the 
              "neko cafes" of the Japanese capital are a harmless institution where 
              customers pay a premium for their coffee in exchange for the chance to 
              pet the cats that stroll among them.<br><br>But for animal rights activists, these cafes are exploitative places where animals are subjected to unnatural stress.<br><br>They welcome a new ordinance, coming into force later this year, that will ban the display of animals after 8:00 pm.<br><br>The
               rules were drawn up by the environment ministry after it received more 
              than 155,000 requests for action from the public -- an unusually high 
              number in politically ambivalent Japan.<br><br>The law is primarily 
              aimed at the pet shops in Tokyo's entertainment districts that regularly
               raise the eyebrows of Western visitors with their brightly-lit windows 
              displaying dogs and cats in cramped glass tanks late into the night.<br><br>But
               cat cafe manager Shinji Yoshida says he will also be snared by the law 
              and will have to close in the evenings -- his busiest time.<br><br>Yoshida's
               cat cafe in Ikebukuro, a busy commercial and commuter hub in Tokyo, 
              keeps 13 cats in a carpeted room where they have the freedom to jump 
              around and climb all over the large fake tree.<br><br>"It is a huge blow to us cat cafes, and it's nothing to do with protecting cats' health," said Yoshida, 32.<br><br>"As
               you see, cats can walk and play freely. I ask customers not to touch 
              them if they are sleeping. At night, we dim the room light," he said. 
              "And cats can rest during daylight."<br><br>He says about 80 per cent of
               his customers are salaried workers who drop in for a welcome change 
              from the daily grind of work and long commutes.<br><br>"If I close this cafe at 8:00 pm, I'll see red ink," he said.<br><br>Yoshida's customers definitely want the cafe to be allowed to stay open.<br><br>Office
               worker Ayako Kanzaki, 22, began visiting cat cafes three years ago 
              because she loves cats but her apartment is too small to keep one.<br><br>"I
               like to do things at my own pace, and I must say I am not a very social
               person. So I come here alone, because I want to focus on the cats," she
               said.<br><br>"During the day, cats are mostly sleeping, and if they are
               awake, they often don't pay attention to the people. In the evening 
              they are very lively, it's more enjoyable."<br><br>Saleswoman Harada agrees.<br><br>"If cat cafes are shut down at night, I won't have many opportunities to come any more," she said.<br><br>Animal
               welfare campaigner Chizuko Yamaguchi says the sheer number of customers
               in cat cafes can make life difficult for the animals.<br><br>"From 
              morning to night these cats are being stroked by people they do not 
              know. For the animals, that is a real source of stress," she said.<br><br>Fusako
               Nogami, head of animal rights group ALIVE, said the rule change banning
               the display of animals in the evening was a good thing, but 
              acknowledges the cat cafes are not the target.<br><br>Nogami said the 
              commodification of animals in Japan was a real problem, with many people
               looking at them purely as fashion accessories, and not as lives in 
              their own right.<br><br>"What deserves more public attention is the way pets are sold in Japan," she said.<br><br>"We need to ban the trade of newborn kittens and puppies just because they are pretty and sell well."<br><br>- AFP</span></span></p>
