              <h1 id="ext-gen58">Cat crippled after being thrown 32 FEET from a building is back on the prowl after vets fit her with a set of wheels</h1>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She may 
              have been thrown from the ninth floor of an apartment building, but this
               cute cat has certainly landed on her feet with plenty of loving friends
               to help her recover from her nightmare fall.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Christened
               Hei Hudie - meaning Black Butterfly - because of the black fur on her 
              face and body, the unlucky moggie fell 32 feet down to the fifth floor 
              of the block in the city of Chongqing, southwest China.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Her cruel assailant had reportedly stepped on her before flinging her to what could well have been her death.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>But
               the resilient feline survived the fall, which fractured her spine, and 
              after four major operations in six months the eight-month-old kitty she 
              is able to get around again using a wheeled brace.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The
               poor cat has lost the use of her hind legs and requires daily 
              physiotherapy following the fall in the Jiulongpo Shiqiaopu area of 
              Chongqing in November last year.</span></p>

              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She has been inundated with well wishers 
              at the Yu Bei Area Animal Hospital, including an anonymous woman who has
               put more than 10,000 yuan - nearly £1,100 - towards helping Black 
              Butterfly recover.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Because of her frailty the director of the hospital, Cheng Yu, placed her in her office to make it easier to take care of her.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>When she sees a stranger, Black Butterfly will hide her head under her blanket. </span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Cheng
               has to gently take her out to pet her and before attaching the wheels 
              to her back legs and encouraging her to walk with them attached using 
              food as an incentive.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Black Butterfly weighs 2kg and the wheels make up almost 30 per cent of that weight. </span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>With
               her wheels attached she is able to gingerly walk on her two front legs 
              and after a few steps she will stop for a rest then start over again.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Cheng
               said: 'She is still on the slow road to recovery and needs to exercise 
              her front legs daily to develop the strength in them. </span></p>

              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'Last year we operated on her three times and had to repair her spleen, liver and bladder as well as amputate her hind legs.' </span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Cheng
               said that earlier this month Black Butterfly suddenly developed a 
              swollen cheek and to save her life they had to operate on her again on 
              March 8 to remove a gland under her tongue. She is currently in good 
              health.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>After
               going under the knife four times she is not able to relieve herself in 
              the normal way anymore and will have to use nappies every day.</span></p>
