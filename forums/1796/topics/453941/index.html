              <p>Just a while ago, Niko, a Japanese kitten had severe 
              conjunctivitis and was abandoned. Fortunately, she was found by someone 
              kind and under the family's tender loving care, she was nursed back to 
              health. Niko's transformation over the days was recorded and narrated by
               her saviour in a video.<br><br>Niko was found by her saviour blind with
               both her eyes closed shut due to conjunctivitis. She seems upset and 
              hisses at people repeatedly. Since she cannot see anything initally, she
               does not move. Her nose was stuffed too and she had difficulties 
              breathing. After umpteen visits to the vet and a month later, Niko is 
              slowly recovering and becoming more active to the relief of her saviour.
               Her recovery was described as being miraculous -- from a sick kitten 
              who stays in a corner of the house all the time to an active kitten 
              opening up to the family.<br><br>Her savior, Mr Jin650 says:</p>
              <p>"No one in our family thought Niko would turn into such a beauty in just one month!<br><br>"We had so much fun while she was with us. Niko put a smile on everyone's face.<br><br>"Some people may say that an abandoned cat should be left alone, that's natural selection in a way.<br><br>"But I'm really glad I found her that night.<br><br>"She helped teached the children what it means to own a pet and the responsibility it entails.<br><br>"It's quite possible that she gave us more than we gave her."<br><br>STOMPer transfomers writes:<br><br>"I feel so touched watching the video, tracing the transformation that Niko underwent.<br><br>"Pets
               are being abandoned by their owner on a daily basis, but this video has
               shown how one person's effort can have so much positive impact on a 
              kitten.<br><br>"Niko's strong fight for survival is truly inspiring."</p>
