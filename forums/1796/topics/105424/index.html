Litter-trained, not picky eaters, easy to cut nails and bathe. In the pink of health and very playful!<br>Bishop (black) is mischievous, muscular, has striking orange eyes, and a little stumpy tuft of fur for a tail, and adores human company (but also loves to play with his sisters). His specialty is running.<br>Opie (splotchy) is gentle, easy-going, sweet, and has a cute fluffy kinky tail. She's slightly less extroverted than her siblings, but can also be quite mad when playing with them. Her specialty is jumping.<br>Tassie (stripey) is soft and round, very playful, and has a 90-degree kink at the end of her tail. Sort of looks like she's wearing long sleeves and shorts. Her specialty is purring.<br>It's preferable they're taken as a group or at least as a pair because they really are extremely close and excellent playmates for each other. If taken alone, s/he should join a household that has another playful cat, or at least has a person who's home all day and likes playing with the kitty.<br>The foster also has 2 adult cats who are rehome-able: a gentle snowshoe-like male, and a soft black female with perfect long tail and striking orange eyes.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Up for Adoption - Rose</strong><br><br>Please help to re-home this lovely kitty, named Rose. She's 10-months old and has a really sweet and affectionate nature. She has a soft meow and is a quiet pet as she seldom meows. She has been sterilised and will be a perfect loving companion to anyone who loves cats. However, she's used to be a lone pet and will be more suitable to owners who will have only her and no other cats.<br><br>Her owner loves her deeply but only reason that he can't keep her is that he's going back to Hong Kong and won't be able to bring her along.<br><br>Interested parties please contact Mr Wong Kwok Keung at kwokkeung.wong@jurong.com<br><br><img src="http://pic4.picturetrail.com/VOL751/2947639/5957562/76866483.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://pic4.picturetrail.com/VOL751/2947639/5957562/76866454.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://pic4.picturetrail.com/VOL751/2947639/5957562/76866441.jpg"></div>

U need to keep the new one in a separate room for a few days and let them smell each other's things. Cats are VERY territorial...but luckily it took only 1 day for cats to like each other. THe younger they are the easier it is to like each other. Let them eat and play near the door, gradually leave the door slightly open for them to see each other but they cant hurt each other and they will feel safe. Soon they will start to  like each other! Because they are not pack animals like dogs, they will need to be gradually introduced.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Therefore, if you already have one cat, do consider getting another! Polo LOVES lorren, and they play together when I cant be there for long hours.
