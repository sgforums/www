She has, apparently, been caring for cats for ten years.<br><br>According to a neighbour, Ms Low fell out with the person who helped her with the costs of taking care of the cats and has allegedly refused help from other people. This has resulted in a lack of funds to pay for rent and food.<br><br>However, Ms Low denied this, saying: "I donÂ’t starve the animals. I starve myself. I survive on cup noodles. I have been feeding them every day. In fact, three times a day."<br><br>Ms Low admitted that she had been receiving about S$500 a month for the past two months from a sponsor. The financial contribution is not written in a contract.<br><br>The money was used to help defray the total cost of caring for the cats, which amounts to about S$2,560 per month. This includes the monthly rent of over S$1,700.<br><br>The person who reported the situation, James Tan, claimed the cats were underfed for the past couple of days because the owner had to leave the premises. He said other tenants had been trying to feed the cats through the fence.<br><br>The owner of the pet farm, however, said he was not aware of the situation.<br><br>Eric Lim, director of Ericsson Pet Farm, said: "A lot of cat feeders like to mind other peopleÂ’s business. I always tell them, Â’Mind your own business. Look after your own animalsÂ’."<br><br>The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) said it was refused entry to the pet farm, so it would channel its report to the AgriÂ—Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) on Thursday.<br><br>Those found guilty of cruelty to animals can be fined a maximum of S$10,000 or sentenced to 12 monthsÂ’ jail, or both.
