I know my cat like things really warm ...<br>He don't mind the bathing part but don't like the drying part.<br>He used to sit in the pail of almost hot water and let the water be poured over him.<br>Use care not to get water into the ears.<br>After that, usually to keep him warm and dry him fast (he's a mix breed with rather thick fur)<br>We had to use a hair dryer. Of course, he would not be happy<br>If you let him lick himself dry, his "sai" will be soggy too and it takes hours...<br>Licking also cause he to eat a lot of his fur and then later he will cough out hair balls.<br>One way to reduce fur loss is to ensure there is loads of fish oils in the diet... and more<br>if the cat is a long fur, thick coat type.<br>Most cats are very clean and cleaning is like their horly routine. The vets advised to wash them about 1 time a month... or 3 months ... cause everytime they are washed, they loose the natural oils that protect them<br><br></div>

You want me to put her in a big tub of water. OMG.. she's old, neurotic and from the RSPCA, if she was a kitten and she can get used to being manhandled into the tub it's ok... i'll consider it. Snowy might run away from home. I don't know anyone who bathes their cats and there are heaps of cat owners amongst my friends. Actually all of them have at least one cat.</div>
