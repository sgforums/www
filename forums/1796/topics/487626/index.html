              <p>Thousands of cats smuggled from China have been buried by Vietnamese 
              authorities, many of them reportedly alive, after a truck, which was 
              illegally carrying the cargo to restaurants as feline meat, was 
              intercepted by local authorities.</p>
              <p>Police said on Wednesday that they had intercepted a truck
                carrying 3 tons of cats that had been stashed in bamboo baskets
                the previous week. The truck driver was issued a smuggling fine
                of 7.5 million dong ($360) – but for animals the story ended in a
                much more gruesome way.
                <br><br><em>“The cats were from China, with no official origin papers and
                no quarantine,”</em> an unnamed police officer from the Dong Da
                district environmental police told AFP.
                <br><br> The officer was unable to confirm how many of the cats had been
                buried alive, but said that they had to be disposed of to ensure
                there were no environmental and health risks: <em>“Several of
                them had died, there was a terrible smell that could affect the
                environment and carried risks of future diseases. Therefore, we
                culled them by burying them.”</em> <br><br> Despite the 1998 law prohibiting the sale of cats as food, cat
                meat, locally known as <em>“little tiger,”</em> is still not hard
                to come by in Vietnam’s specialty restaurants, especially in the
                country’s northern part that borders China. The prohibition of
                the cat trade was implemented in order to save local crops from
                rats.
                <br><br> Animal rights activists have been trying to stop the cat culls in
                Vietnam. The Asian Canine Protection Alliance is one of the
                organizations behind the movement. It said that there had been
                <em>“inhumane stories as to how the [cats] may have been
                destroyed,”</em> urging authorities to end the cruel practice.</p>
