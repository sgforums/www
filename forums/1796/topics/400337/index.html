              <p>The Siamese cat gets its title from the old name for Thailand. Thailand used to be known as Siam until 1939, and briefly again from 1945 until 1949. Natives of Thailand used to be called "Siamese", and this breed of cat, believed to be descended from the sacred temple cats of that country, were introduced to Britain and America as "Siamese cats" in the 19th century.</p>
              <p>The Siamese cat was one of the first breeds of cat recognised by cat clubs as being of distinctly Oriental origin.</p>
              <p>Its country of origin, Thailand, has several native breeds of cat, so the Thais themselves do not call the Siamese cat by that name (all their native cats are technically "Siamese" cats!). Instead, the breed that we know as the Siamese is known in Thailand as the Wichien-maat, meaning "moon diamond".</p>
              <p>The word "Siam" itself is said to be derived from a Sanskrit word, "Syama", which means "brown", or "dark".</p>

              <p>I know Cat JuJitsu. Yes. Whenever I see stray cats. I have the ability to use my heavy steel safety steel boots and step on their elongated body. There is no way, they can run away. Because when I step on them harder, their legs will buckle and they will sit sit on their stomach. Wakakakaka.</p>
              <p>Then I step harder until all the air come out.</p>
              <p>But I nice guy, I let them go. After that I pet them nice nice.</p>
              <p>It is very hypnotic to them. After I do that, they come back !</p>
              <p>And the cat want more.</p>
              <p>It just roll roll and roll. So manja, want me to step on it even more.</p>
              <p>So now I teach you the art of seducing cats.</p>

              <p><br>Dont say like that. People who curse other people will get back 3 times as worse as what they curse the other people. Yes cursing would only bounce back to yourself. So you better get ready for slow slow death.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the cat enjoyed it. It was like Siatsu. You dont know anything about cats. What I do, they enjoy it. It is so therapeutic. You ever gone to Thai Massage? Yes the Massager will stand on top of your back and walk along that. It is like that wat. What is so torturing or cruel to the cat.</p>
              <p>I tell you, 80% of the time, the cat will manja manja and roll over want more. I tried it on the kittens but they dont seem to like it.</p>

              <p>it depends on the pressure and speed in which you deal the stepping on. if you apply pressure on them slowing and pull off to avoid crushing them it is okay. hey i ever did try on tigers and lions at the zoo. it works too, you want to try?</p>

              <p>seriously, by just looking, it's v hard to differentiate. perhaps experts or those who freq mis ard w cats can tell the breed by 1 look. well, Birman are slightly smaller in size compare to Siamese</p>

              <p><br>Dont curse other people for death to come. It may back come to you three times faster.</p>
              <p>Anyway everybody dies.</p>
              <p>I dont want to shoo. I like cats, they are so cute. Especially when you wrestle them down. I once have a cat, I call him Ringo. I purposely feed him so much food that he became so fat. So fat that he could not run. So he always get bullied one. My German Shepard dog always manages to chase up to him because he cannot run away and throw him like a rag doll. So cute.</p>
              <p>You should look at Ringo, so fat, he cannot run away. But he got scared behaviour. Everytime guess come, he will run away. But the children always catch up because he is too fat and slow. And they will tickle him.</p>
              <p>Too bad Ringo died 10 years ago.</p>
