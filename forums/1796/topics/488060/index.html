              <p>CAIRO: After an estimated five years of “entrapment” behind a wall in a 
              Cairo Metro station, a cat was saved from its “tomb” and brought into 
              the daylight, thanks to an elderly man who fed it every day all those 
              years and a group of women who pressured to set it free.</p>

              <p>Sometime in 2010, the cat found a hiding spot between the outer surface 
              of the wall and a fire extinguisher installment at the Mohamed Naguib 
              Metro station in downtown Cairo. One day, however, the cat squeezed into
               a hole in the wall and did not come out again, the cat’s caregiver, 
              known as Uncle Abdo, told Veto Gate Friday. Uncle Abdo, the owner of a 
              glasses shop right outside the station, named the cat Biso.</p>

              <p>“When we removed the wall, a heinous smell emerged from the dark hole, 
              which was 15-centimeter wide and four-meter long. It was like a tomb. 
              There were black worms along four meters of the edge, where Uncle Abdo 
              was able to put in food for Biso,” Mounira Shehata, an animal rights 
              activist who participated in the rescue, told The Cairo Post Tuesday.</p>

              <p><strong>Biso taking food from Uncle Abdo – Screenshot from Vetogate video</strong></p>
              <p>On March 12, someone posted a picture of Biso's tail <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1605090309705225&amp;set=gm.421486224676813&amp;type=1"></a> hanging from behind the wall on “Help and rescue homeless animals” 
              Facebook page, complaining that he could not break the wall to free the 
              cat because it would be considered sabotage of public property.</p>
              <p>Another person shared the picture on the “Save an Innocent Animal’s Soul” page on Facebook; 
              that is how Shehata found out about Biso and took off with Marwa 
              Elgebaly, a fellow animal rights activist, to save the cat. Their friend
               Rania el-Kordy, who shares the same interests, followed them on the day
               of the rescue.</p>
              <p>Veto Gate released a video
               the same day of someone feeding luncheon to Biso behind the wall, in 
              which the cat’s paw appears trying to grasp the meat, and a similar one 
              the next day of Uncle Abdo.</p>
              <p>Shehata and Elgebaly spoke to employees at the metro station in the 
              evening of March 12, but they were told they needed to come March 14 
              when the maintenance official would be present, as the 13<sup>th</sup> was a Friday and is part of the weekend.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Dina Zulfikar, a renowned and accredited animal rights 
              worker who knew about Biso from social media, filed a report at the 
              Abdeen police station March 13, along with animal rights defender Dalia 
              Shaheen. The police and civil defense personnel arrived at the metro and
               informed the head of Mohamed Naguib metro station there was a 
              prosecution order to rescue Biso. The workers were brought from their 
              homes on their day off.</p>

              <p><strong>Workers created three outlets for the cat to come out on its own – Hany Sobhy on Help and rescue homeless animals Facebook page</strong></p>
              <p>Uncle Abdo told Masr al-Arabia he used to feed the cat when it was free 
              as a kitten. Biso hid between the outer surface of the wall and a fire 
              extinguisher installment, but after a “stronger cat” beat Biso, it 
              escaped into the hole and never came out, Uncle Abdo said. A few years 
              ago, workers at the station tried to get Biso out, but it was scared off
               and remained inside, he added.</p>

              <p>“I do it for God. What is for God does not go away,” Uncle Abdo told 
              Masr al-Arabia, adding that “God rids” him a lot of problems because of 
              such charity.</p>

              <p>Amid lawlessness during the January 25 Revolution in 2011, most stores 
              were closed, including Uncle Abdo’s. He still went to the station daily 
              to feed Biso, he told Masrawy.</p>

              <p>Biso, however, swiftly ran away before anyone could catch it. The rescue
               took over five hours, according to Shehata. She and Uncle Abdo are 
              still looking for Biso inside the metro station.</p>
