              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Some Town Councils said they receive regular complaints on cats in their neighbourhood. <br><br>Sembawang-Nee Soon told Channel NewsAsia that for the month of June, it received 35 complaints. <br><br>With
               the Housing and Development Board (HDB) still reviewing its policy on 
              whether cats should be allowed in HDB homes as pets, this may pose a 
              problem to some.<br><br>But animal experts said it boils down to responsible cat ownership.<br><br>41-year-old
               Kareen Kaur is the proud owner of two cats. Ginger has been with Kareen
               for three years, while Bella is the latest addition. <br><br>Kareen 
              lives in a two-room apartment in a high-rise condominium, and she said 
              her neighbours have not complained about her pets so far.<br><br>The HDB does not allow cats mainly because cats are seen as difficult to confine within flat premises.<br><br>"I
               think it really depends a lot on the character of the cat. If you have a
               cat that's very hyper, very curious, I think it's better to put 
              barricades on the window," said Kaur. <br><br>And erecting barricades was the first thing Kaur did when she adopted Bella.<br><br>Experts said the onus is on the cat owner to make sure measures are in place to avoid disturbances.<br><br>"It
               becomes a human's responsibility. It cannot be a cat's responsibility. 
              Their nature is to jump, to play. Whoever wants to keep a cat in the 
              house, in the HDB flat, needs to take up that responsibility in order to
               keep peace in the area," said Dr Denise Ng, a veterinarian at the Light
               of Life Veterinary Clinic &amp; Services. <br><br>Sembawang-Nee Soon 
              Town Council told Channel NewsAsia that residents usually voice concerns
               about cat noises or scratches on vehicles. <br><br>On its website, HDB cited urination in common areas as another concern.<br><br>"Most
               cats that dirty the corridors or general public areas are cats that are
               not sterilised. The male cat, the tomcats will generally mark the area 
              to increase their territorial or territories in order to mate as many 
              females as possible. In this sort of situation, sterilisation would 
              really help," said Dr Ng. <br><br>Dr Ng also suggests that if the 
              government were to allow cats in HDB flats, cat owners should be 
              required to barricade their windows on top of having a license for their
               cats.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>
