            <div class='col-md body'>Today really very sad.. Got no choice but to send MeMe(if you have read my past topic, you'll know who is her le) to SPCA.. We all know de mah.. send to SPCA they might put the cat to slp.. Really hope she's fine lor..<br><br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2005-8/1068473/ME.jpg"> MeMe<br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2005-8/1068473/MEME.jpg"> MeMe when young<br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2005-8/1068473/P412175715.jpg">MeMe and her brother GoGo<br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2005-8/1068473/P822180136.jpg">MeMe when pregnant..<br><br>She has such a big tummy during pregnancy, but her body is so weak and small.. Worse still she's so much under stress, therefore we think that she has labour difficulties(her backside got some fluid and blood stains and she seems restless). And her stress come from a F*CKING OLD MAN!!!!<br><br>This old man live at 3rd storey of certain block at Aljunied and after suffering from heart attack, he had stop working. Recently, he saw a black cat peeing and pooing infront of his doorstep and he assume it was MeMe!!! MeMe was a pregnant cat(usually cat pregnant, they wun really move ard), and she's very obedience and well-liked by us cuz she's very frenly!!! Jus because she's black, she got accused for climbling up 6 flights of stairs to that CRAZY OLD MAN's doorstep to pee and poo!!! How ridiculous!!! There's so many black cats around!!!<br><br>I, in fact not only me, but also my mum, and few others witnessed him chasing poor MeMe around with broken tree branch and slippers, trying to hit her!! Thus, she dun dare to come out from her "nest" to eat, and everytime she sees him coming, she'd rush across the road to a safe place to hide, imagine those scenes where some cars almost hit her while she's running for her life!! But this old man, would still go to her hiding place to hunt for her, if he can't see her, he'd throw the branch inside. Thus MeMe got weaker, and under such pressures, she has difficulties to give birth.<br><br>See how small and weak she is from those pics up there!! Can you believe a man actually abuse her?? My mum tried talking to him, telling him not to do that, but he still continue. Today, no choice, she talked to that crazy man's wife, hoping that she'll try to help a little, but instead she got angry and try kicking another cat!!! CRAZY OLD COUPLE!!! Then dunno why, they 2 went up to discuss something and come down to confront us and another cat feeder, that F*CKING OLD MAN even tried to use 2 stones to throw at MeMe who's lying that restlessly, and unable to run cuz she's feeling rather heavy and sick!!! That cat cannot move liao leh, sit down there like no energy liao, he still trying to use stone and throw her u know?? HOW RUTHLESS!!!!<br><br>We've really got no choice but to send MeMe off.. We really cried when she's about to go(and I'm still crying now while typing lor!!). Cause she really might be put to slp.. And we can't afford to send her to hospital cuz I'm jus a student, and the other cat-feeder is unemployed de.. Sending her to hospital will cost like 600-700. If not for that OLD MAN, MeMe could have deliver her babies safely..<br><br>We tried complaining his act against SPCA, cuz SPCA always says "REPORT ANIMAL ABUSER TO THEM". But then, they say with no pic nor video, they can't do anything. But we have many witnesses lor!! If today is a human who got hitted by another person, and have eye-witnesses, the police or what confirm deal immediately lor!! But even if we report, can only made a verbal file!! We thought of letting that old man off since that couldn't revive MeMe. Cuz if we report him, those who kena will be the cats lor!!!<br><br>And know what? That old man is still downstairs at lift lobby there spreading that "CAT SH!TS CAUSE CANCER" to those 3gu6po!!! And he's kpkb about me and my mum feeding cats in the neighbourhood etc. Pls!! We feed moderately, and didnt really dirty the places. Moreover, cats deserve to live too!! To eat and live well!!!<br><br>Now i couldn't be bother with that le.. I really really pray that they wun put MeMe to slp.. She's very cute and frenly.. Hopefully if she manage to survive this time round.. She will get adopted by good family..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
