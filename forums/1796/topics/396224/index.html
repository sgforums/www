              <p>Although well-cared-for cats tend to live longer than dogs, most cats are still considered "senior" when they are seven years old.</p>
              <p>Like older dogs, older cats may face reduced kidney function, meaning that waste materials are no longer being as effectively removed from the bloodstream and excreted through the urine as before.</p>
              <p>To help your cat live out its senior years healthily, happily &amp; in good shape, discuss with your vet what kind of diet will help your cat maintain its fitness &amp; health. Avoid treats &amp; snacks that may unbalance its diet or make it put on weight, further stressing the kidneys &amp; other organs. Provide a supply of clean drinking water 24 hours a day, every day of its life.</p>
              <p>Cats fastidiously groom themselves &amp; hate dirt on their coats. An old cat, however, may be less flexible than it used to be, and may have trouble cleaning itself as well as it used to. Ageing may also bring on skin &amp; coat problems. The cat may be distressed by the state it is in, so soothe it gently &amp; diligently grooming it each day, to help it remain clean &amp; comfortable.</p>
              <p>Because of its reduced flexibility, it may not be able to reach its favourite sleeping or hiding places in hard-to-access corners either. Make it easier by providing furniture of different heights as "steps" towards its favourite spots. It is good to keep your older cat active so that its joints don't stiffen &amp; organs don't lose their condition.</p>
              <p>An old cat's senses may deteriorate further over time, so approach your cat slowly so as not to startle it, but maintain physical contact with it often so that it will be more assured by your gentle &amp; loving touch, even if it cannot see, smell or hear you any more.</p>

              <p>
              </p><p>From about the age of ten to twelve years, a cat may begin to show signs of growing old. This may not be immediately apparent as the slowing down process is very gradual. Internal organs may not work as well as they once did and joints may become that little bit stiffer. Over time the cat seems to restrict its activities, is far less playful and becomes a creature of sedentary habits. Particular health conditions such as diabetes or arthritis require constant supervision and medical intervention.</p>
              <p>        The oldest cat recorded was a tabby called Puss who was said to have lived for 36 years. The oldest pedigreed cat on record is Sukoo, a Siamese who died in 1989, at the age of 31 years. These are exceptional ages, however. Most cats live for about 14-16 years and a few may reach 20 years. With pedigreed cats there is a very accurate means of determining age, as they are normally registered with an exact date of birth and registration number.</p>
              <p>        When you first get a 12-week-old kitten, it is very likely that its lifespan will be something between ten and fifteen years. This could mean that the cat will become a companion to your children as well as to yourself. A longer life is not unusual, in which case it may well live to see your grandchildren as well. To borrow from the dog world, a cat is for life, not just for Christmas. This has to be thoroughly understood before a kitten joins the household.</p>
              <p>        Neutered (altered) cats have a slightly longer lifespan than those which remain unneutered. This is particularly true of male cats. An unneutered (unaltered) tom will fight to defend territory and the resulting injuries and infections may shorten his life. Females lead a much quieter life, and a career spent having kittens, in an environment in which her condition is well-maintained, appears to have little effect on the female's longevity.</p>
              <p>        Apart from differing nutritional requirements at various stages of its life, a cat's physical responses slow down as it gets older and joints become stiff. This not only has the effect of reducing suppleness and agility, but has implications for the daily care of the cat such as grooming.</p>
