              <p>Valentine was hardly more than a kitten when he was dropped off at a Los Angeles shelter missing his claws.</p>
              <p>Even
               worse, the surgery was so brutally botched, it left Valentine in 
              searing pain. His paws were so infected, the staff wasn't sure if he 
              would even survive.</p>
              <p>"He was in so much pain, he was acting out," Jennifer Conrad, a veterinarian and founder of The Paw Project, tells The Do. "He was biting. He was terrified."</p>
              <p>Valentine's apparent aggression led him to being put on the shelter's euthanasia list</p>
              <p><img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/9599995/980x.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480"></p>
              <p>And if his picture hadn't found his way to Aurelie Vanderhoek, founder of Zoey Place Rescue, Valentine would not have been long for this world.</p>
              <p>"I
               saw the picture and my heart dropped," Vanderhoek tells The Dodo. "The 
              incisions the vet had made were not even stitched. They were left open 
              to bleed.</p>
              <p>"I said, 'I don't care how we're going to do this. He's coming with me.'"</p>
              <p><img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/9599996/980x.JPG" alt="" width="680" height="490"></p>
              <p>Freed from his shelter cage, Valentine was brought to the Animal Healthcare Centre in Eagle Rock, where veterinarian Lisa Hsuan worked to ease the pain in his festering paws.</p>
              <p>And a week later?</p>
              <p>"Now, he's in my bathroom," Vanderhoek says with a laugh.</p>
              <p>It took a few days, understandably, for Valentine to warm up to her.</p>
              <p>"All
               I did was sit next to him," Vanderhoek recalls. "I gave him a small 
              room to get control over. And I just let him come to me. And within 
              three days, he was purring and playing."</p>
              <p><img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/9599997/980x.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="734"></p>
              <p>Plenty of care also poured in from a community that had heard of the cat's plight.</p>
              <p>Jackson Galaxy even donated calming remedies to soothe those troubled paws.</p>
              <p><img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/9599999/980x.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="960"></p>
              <p>Perhaps most importantly, The Paw Project's program, is covering the bills for Valentine's spiraling medical expenses.</p>
              <p>"We
               take animals who were going to lose their lives because they were 
              declawed — and we rehabilitate them," Conrad says. "We've had a 100 
              percent success rate in finding these animals homes once they've been 
              taken out of pain and the infection in their paws has been taken away."</p>
              <p>And Vanderhoek took it upon herself to soothe Valentine's troubled mind — which is proving the easiest job of all.</p>
              <p><img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/9600739/980x.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="640"></p>
              <p>"He gets startled very easily with loud noises. I think he was abused
               because he has very, very sharp triggers," she says. "He's playful. All
               he wants right now is to be held. He just wants to cuddle.</p>
              <p>"This is a cat who just needs a nice, quiet environment and he'll be fine."</p>
              <p>Vanderhoek
               credits an entire community of animal rescuers for coming together to 
              give Valentine a real chance at a life — an opportunity that's all too 
              often not given to declawed cats.</p>
              <p>While some people think taking away a cat's claws makes them easier to deal with.</p>
              <p>"There's
               no doubt that a declawed cat bites more often and bites harder because 
              they've been robbed of their primary defense," Conrad explains. "Anytime
               you have a behavioral problem, you should treat it with behavioral 
              management. Not with surgery.</p>
              <p>Instead, she suggests simple alternatives like a scratching post or a toy. Because kittens will be kittens.</p>
              <p>"That's
               what kittens do," Conrad says. "They attack each other. They attack 
              toys. They go crazy doing their little kitten stuff. But that's because 
              they're babies."</p>
              <p>And now, thanks to an entire community's efforts, Valentine will get to be the kitten he was meant to be.</p>
