            <div class='col-md body'>HUMBLE PIE<br>by Jaye Lewis<br><br>MeowMeow is anything but a complicated kitty.<br>She's friendly, hungry, and not terribly bright.  Every morning she<br>wakes me up with a yowl.<br>She wants two things in life.  The first and foremost is FOOD!  Yours,<br>mine, hers, the dogs, anybody's.  She doesn't care, just as long as it can<br>be chewed and swallowed.  She doesn't care if you leave, just as long as<br>you leave food.<br>MeowMeow's second priority is to find that perfect place to relieve<br>herself, after the food.  You see, she believes that we move the cat box<br>from room to room, and she is there to tell us where we should have put it.<br>Each time, it should have been someplace else, and part of MeowMeow's<br>assignment is to inform us of our mistakes.<br>On the day after our anniversary trip, where my husband and I spent<br>three days convincing each other that we were no more than twenty, MeowMeow<br>unveiled her most special assignment.<br>My husband and our youngest daughter were setting up her classes at<br>the University, so I knew that I would have the entire day to do some<br>writing and editing on my book.  I was still feeling rather<br>twenty-something, and as the day progressed, I was becoming really<br>impressed with my editing skills.  That was the time that my sweet, yellow<br>tabby chose to put me in my place.<br>MeowMeow was busy ignoring the perfectly clean cat box and looking for<br>the perfect place to relieve herself!<br>"Good gosh!" my daughter, Jenny, exclaimed.  "Someone went in the bathtub."<br>"Well, it wasn't me!" I called out, merrily.<br>"MeowMeow!" cried Jenny, as the little trickster scuttled under my bed.<br>"Oh Gosh, Jenny!  Do you want me to clean it out?"<br>"That's okay.  I'll do it," Jenny answered, without enthusiasm.<br>"Great!  Thanks, Hon!"  I was glad for her capitulation, because I was<br>busy being the writer and thinking that I was pretty special.<br>Hours passed, as Jenny went off to her summer job, and I continued<br>editing.  Finally, I admitted that I needed a break.  So, I prepared to<br>take a shower -- totally forgetting that Jenny had cleaned and bleached the<br>tub, leaving the hand shower dangling.<br>Still in my flannels, I gathered my shower things and plodded into the<br>bathroom.  Reaching into the tub to turn on the water, I replaced the hand<br>shower, precariously, into its holder above my head.  When the cold water<br>was running, I turned the shower knob to the "high" position.<br>Suddenly, the nozzle jumped out of place!<br>The ice-cold water hit me in the face, drenching my hair, the walls,<br>the floor, and my clothes.  Instantly my fifty-eight year old bladder<br>responded.<br>Quickly, I managed to kick off my shoes and hop into the shower<br>without breaking my neck.  There I stood, fully clothed and blind, under a<br>frigid waterfall, waiting for my bladder to finish emptying, while I<br>struggled to turn off the knobs to my bathtub.<br>For a flicker of a second, I was really ticked-off!  I couldn't make<br>up my mind whether to get Jenny or my cat.  That's when I started to laugh,<br>and I just laughed and laughed until I nearly cried.<br>There was a lesson here.  MeowMeow went in the tub.  I went in the<br>tub.  You might say that we grew into a new understanding.<br>As I went ahead with my intentional shower, the writer in me couldn't<br>resist the thought of what a hilarious story this would make!<br>After all, MeowMeow had fulfilled her special assignment, keeping this<br>writer humble.<br><br>-- Jaye Lewis<br><br>Source: Petwarmers</div>
