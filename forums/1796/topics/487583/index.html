              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1422594454667_1615" class="first">TAMPA, Fla.  - A cat in Florida is on the mend after clawing his way back 
              from the dead, surfacing five days after he was hit by a car and buried 
              for dead, according to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay.</p>
              <p>Bart the cat is recovering from a broken jaw and facial injuries, 
              said the agency on Wednesday, the day after he underwent surgery. One of
               his eyes was wounded so badly it had to be removed.</p>
              <p>The Humane Society is calling Bart a "miracle cat," while the ordeal earned him the nickname "zombie cat" on social media.</p>
              <p>Bart's seemingly lifeless body was buried after he was hit by a car 
              earlier this month, local media said. Five days later, he showed up 
              alive in a neighbor's yard, according to a blog post by the Humane 
              Society.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1422594454667_1706">"He had dug himself out of the 
              grave and slowly made his way back home, albeit weak, dehydrated and in 
              need of medical attention," the agency said.</p>
              <p>He was brought to the Humane Society's veterinary clinic by his 
              owner, who could not afford medical treatment for the injured cat at 
              other veterinary providers.</p>
              <p>Bart should be able to go home in about a week, once he can eat on 
              his own, according to the Humane Society, which called him a "brave 
              boy."</p>
              <p>Full recovery is expected to take about six weeks.</p>

              <h1 class="headline">Florida 'zombie cat' hit with custody motion</h1>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1423803045756_1098">TAMPA, Fla.  - The Florida cat that crawled out of its grave after a 
              traffic accident is now ensnared in a legal dispute over custody 
              involving its owner and the Humane Society of Tampa Bay.</p>
              <p>Bart the cat, nicknamed "zombie cat" on social media, 
              made international headlines last month when he surfaced five days after
               he was hit by a car and buried for dead.</p>
              <p>He was initially expected to return home after surgery 
              at the Humane Society's veterinary clinic, where Bart was treated for a 
              broken jaw and facial injuries. One of his eyes had to be removed. 
              [ID:nL1N0V72FP]</p>
              <p>But the agency, which is chronicling Bart's recovery 
              online in a blog, http://humanesocietytampa.org/blog/, decided not to 
              return the cat to its owner after learning more about "circumstances 
              leading up to his burial," the agency said.</p>
              <p>Bart's owner, Ellis Hutson of Tampa, filed a court 
              motion earlier this week to demand the return of the black and white 
              pet. Hutson claimed the society's leadership sought to use Bart for 
              fundraising, according to court filings provided to Reuters by the 
              Humane Society.</p>
              <p>The motion said Bart's owner was not being allowed to 
              visit the feline, nor receiving updates about his condition. Hutson 
              could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
              <p>The Humane Society disclosed the legal action on its 
              website and said it reviewing legal options. Bart remained in the 
              agency's care on Wednesday, officials said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1423803045756_1186">The agency has 
              received donations from around the world that helped to pay for Bart's 
              care, according to its blog, which earlier had noted that Bart's owner 
              could not afford other veterinary providers.</p>
              <p>In a later blog post, the society said animal welfare investigators were going to evaluate the Hutson home.</p>
              <p>A welfare check was conducted at the residence, 
              according to the Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center. A spokeswoman 
              said officers found two mixed-breed dogs in good health and there is no 
              investigation.</p>
