              <p>This fine gent over here began appearing at the void deck of my flat some time back last year in December. A very friendly and affectionate tom, I was a bit unsettled by his die-hard pursuit of me going up the stairs as it was late past midnight. Very soon, I began to appreciate him more, because once a cat shows that he likes you by rubbing his cheek and body repeatedly against your leg using great strength, it is only appropriate and nice to return the affection. One trait of him that made me like him even more was whenever he rubs his head on my feet while looking like he wants to sleep on them.</p>
              <p>A rather old ginger tabby, I could tell he was around 12 years old due to the cloudy lens in his eyes. Also, he used to be rather burly around the backsides and upper shoulder blades but lost quite a lot of weight over the months, so now he has the perfect animal resemblance of an aging old man, albeit aging gracefully of course.</p>
              <p>In the past, he used to show his affection with only head rubs to my legs. Right now, our relationship became close as family members and there was once where he leapt up onto my lap to rest while I wiped off his drool gently from his mouth. Whenever he got abused by someone, I would phone the SPCA and tell them to take action. I looked upon him as a 'brother' whom i would even shed my blood for to protect him. He is also very particular about cleaniness and would constantly groom himself or use excessive earth/soil to cover his deed after nature's call. The way he behaved in all aspects made me admire him for his way of life and his freedom. He also quivered with righteous fury once when he saw a neighbourhood black cat bully pick on his girl or a weaker cat and went over to chase the intruder away.</p>
