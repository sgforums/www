"Fluorescent" objects glow as long as they are illuminated with black light. "Phosphorescent" objects glow for a while after having been exposed to black light. They continue to glow even after the black light is removed, and are often called "glow in the dark" or "GITD".<br>"Ultraviolet light" generally refers to electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the range of 10 to 400 nanometers. This is subdivided into:<br><br><strong>UV-A = 315 to 400 nm.</strong>345 to 400 nm = used for "Black light" effects.<br>315 to 345 nm = are used for suntanning (some sun lamps also generate UV-B)<br>UV-B = 280 to 315 nanometers. Hazardous! Largely responsible for sunburn.<br>UV-C = 200 to 280 nm. Dangerous! Used to kill germs.<br>Vacuum Ultraviolet - 10 to 200 nm "<br><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some myths and facts abt cats....<br><br>Myth: Cats always land on their feet.<br>Fact: While cats instinctively fall feet first and may survive falls from high places, they also may receive broken bones in the process. Some kind of screening on balconies and windows can help protect pets from disastrous falls.<br><br>Myth: Cats should drink milk everyday.<br>Fact: Most cats like milk, but do not need it if properly nourished. Also, many will get diarrhea if they drink too much milk. If it is given at all, the amount should be small and infrequent.<br><br>Myth: Cats that are spayed or neutered automatically gain weight.<br>Fact: Like people, cats gain weight from eating too much, not exercising enough or both. In many cases, spaying or neutering is done at an age when the animal's metabolism already has slowed, and its need for food has decreased. If the cat continues to eat the same amount, it may gain weight. Cat owners can help their cats stay fit by providing exercise and not over-feeding.<br><br>Myth: Cats cannot get rabies.<br>Fact: Actually, most warm-blooded mammals, including cats, bats, skunks and ferrets, can carry rabies. Like dogs, cats should be vaccinated regularly according to local laws.<br><br>Myth: Indoor cats cannot get diseases.<br>Fact: Cats still are exposed to organisms that are carried through the air or brought in on a cat owner's shoes or clothing. Even the most housebound cat ventures outdoors at some time and can be exposed to diseases and worms through contact with other animals feces.<br><br>Myth: Tapeworms come from bad food.<br>Fact: Pets become infected with tape worms from swallowing fleas, which carry the parasite. Also, cats can get tapeworms from eating infected mice or other exposed animals.<br><br>Myth: Putting garlic on a pet's food will get rid of worms.<br>Fact: Garlic may make the animal's food taste better but has no effect on worms. The most effective way to treat worms is by medication prescribed by a veterinarian.<br><br>Myth: Pregnant women should not own cats.<br>Fact: Some cats can be infected with a disease called toxoplasmosis, which occasionally can be spread to humans through cat litter boxes and cause serious problems in unborn babies. However, these problems can be controlled, if the expectant mother avoids contact with the litter box and assigns daily cleaning to a friend or other family member.<br><br>Myth: A cat's sense of balance is in its whiskers.<br>Fact: Cats use their whiskers as "feelers" but not to maintain their balance.<br><br>Myth: Animals heal themselves by licking their wounds.<br>Fact: Such licking actually can slow the healing process and further damage the wound.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tips for Naming a Cat</strong><br><br>For everyday use, choose a short and simple name for your cat, preferably no longer than two syllables. This could be the short version of a longer, more complex name, but make sure you are comfortable with the shorter version as well, because you will probably use it more frequently.<br><br><span style="color: green;">If you have other pets, make sure the name has a distinct sound. Because we usually assign meanings to names, it is easier for us to distinguish between names that sound similar. Dogs and cats, however, need different sound patterns to differentiate between words. You don't want to call Fluffy the cat and have Toughy the Poodle running to get at that bowl of cat food.</span><br><br>Remember that the tiny kitten may grow up to be quite a large cat. You may like the idea that your future giant red tabby will be called Tiny, and that's just fine (fortunately, cats don't make a fuss about their name). However, if you're looking for a name that will describe your feline for years to come, keep in mind that kittens grow and their looks and personality may change.<br><br><span style="color: green;">If you name your kitty after a loved cat that you used to have as a child, don't expect her to become the same cat. Each cat is different and even if she looks just like your dear old Miss Kitty and has the same name, she will probably turn out to be quite different.</span><br><br>Be creative! Naming a cat is nothing like naming a child. You won't cause him any psychological difficulties if you call him Twinkle Toes, and you don't have to make sure his name has the right initials or that it is compatible with your family name. And don't worry; the other cats won't make fun of him because of his name.</div>
