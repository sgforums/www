Without doubt of coz not, i presumed! How un-subtle can you be? Perhaps you misunderstood what i meant so probably you can read up my previous reply again! Is that how you treat a guest in your forum? By issuing a warning? Oh my God, i am so surprised! Well some may like HelloKitty, some may not so its really very individual. You can't expect all to like HelloKitty just like Miffy, Its an International Character which is patented. Seriously, i do not think its owed by anyone in here unless they want a Lawsuit over copyrights issues. Sometime Simple things in Life are complicated by One's Personal Perspective, don't you reckon that? Just a Crappy Discussion Topic in here, is there a need for such a big fuss? Anyone can give their comments so is there anything wrong with my comments?<br><br>Watch it? Yeah i am watching you, assessing the kind of mentality you have through such Action that is neither Necessary nor Any Business of mine. I am greatly disappointed by your words &amp; actions which has clearly shown you lack the Maturity &amp; seriously doubt your communication skill with others in this society.<br><br>Anyway thanks for your warning, I will take that in Mind &amp; Consideration!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

Maybe such thread can clearly show the EVILNESS in Some who Harboured ill Intentions &amp; will seek to benefit in time of Chaos or Unrest just like Plunderer of Ill gotten Loot. I pity all these Scavengers, I guess my thread work fine as they are showing their true colors.<br><br>However i would like to clarify Heng@ is not of such intent, he just misunderstood the purpose of my thread thus out of concern he commented in a moment of emotional upturn &amp; seriously whatever he said i don't take it to heart as he was hot blooded ever since he's been around. At times i may seem harsh but however it did attract some main dubious Figures of ill Intent here so that all can see &amp; witness it in their own eyes.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
