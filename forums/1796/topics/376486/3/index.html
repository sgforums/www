              <p>You, obviously do not read enough (and therefore, must be an ignorant fool), and it is fucking obvious from your random conclusion "dun tell me this type of stuffs dun happens in other part of the world...most likely u must be one of those white ppl worshippers.."</p>

              <p>And you fucking piece of shit..kindly stop the assumption that I "worship" white people. Whoever I worship is none of your business, but you can be sure that shit like you will not get the least bit of recognition from others. Confidence issues, perhaps?</p>
              <p>Fucking pro-china son of a bitch. Or maybe your ego(or lack of) has taken such a beating from self confident alpha males, leading you to bash anyone who has a higher probability of liking "white people"?</p>
              <p>Have a good day.</p>
              <p>Edit: Oh, and please watch the videos of the cat and dog meat trade in China. You ought to watch the way those animals are killed. Being stabbed alive and bleeding to death. And guess what? There are absolutely no laws to protect those animals. I am not even talking about banning the trade; I am only talking about making sure that those animals die with as little suffering as possible. Also, dog meat and cat meat can only be found in China. (I stand to be corrected.) If so, how can such acts "happen<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span> in other part(s) of the world"?</p>

              <p>I do not, DO NOT, worship white people. They are full of hypocrisy and while claiming to be "unlike the chinese in many ways", their attitude towards people of different races suck.</p>
              <p>As for these acts of cruelty being carried out by immigrants in China, I pose to you a question - Why is nothing being done about it? I am very sure that the government is able to pass laws, but they are not doing it. So who is to be blamed? The ignorant (or retarded) immigrants? Or the Chinese government who does not give a fuck at all?</p>

              <p>Friends of mine who travelled to China and used credit cards there in departmental stores got scammed. For example, the item that they wanted to purchase was replaced with the try-me-ons, without their knowledge. At the same time, the cashier refused to open the package, claming that "it is in perfect condition". And then, they pretend that you "forgot" to key in your credit card PIN number, when you actually did. This results in a double payment.</p>
              <p>When found out and reported to the comsumer's association in China, they claimed to have "cancelled the transaction". But upon reaching Singapore, the transaction was untouched.</p>
              <p>Ended up that she had to cancel her credit card with advice from a consultant from the credit card company.</p>
