              <p>(USA)</p>
              <p>As the standoff between San Francisco police and a suspected car 
              thief threatening to jump from a South of Market building crept into its
               third hour Wednesday evening, officers turned to an unlikely source to 
              help them talk the man down: his cat.</p>
              <p>The man, barefoot and wearing only black shorts, was distraught and 
              hanging out of a third-floor window of a building at 10th and Harrison 
              streets, threatening to leap. Officers set up foam pads below him as the
               department’s trained hostage negotiators perched precariously on a fire
               escape, urging the suicidal man figuratively and literally off the 
              ledge.</p>
              <p>But after three unsuccessful hours, reinforcements arrived — in the form of the man’s orange-and-white feline.</p>
              <p>Using his pet, hostage negotiators were able to 
              persuade him to go back inside the building, come down the stairs and 
              surrender without incident.</p>
              <p>Within 45 minutes of the cat’s arrival, the 3½-hour standoff was over.</p>
              <p>“Using the cat was ingenious,” said Officer Albie 
              Esparza, a police spokesman. “Never underestimate the power of the love 
              between people and their pets. I think it was great to think outside the
               box like the officers did. It made enough of an impact on this person 
              to bring him down and come to his senses.”</p>
              <p>The man had run into the building about 2:30 p.m., after he had been 
              stopped while driving a white Toyota Highlander that had no license 
              plates.</p>
              <p>While California Highway Patrol officers questioned 
              him, he sat on a sidewalk. When a computer check showed that the car was
               stolen, the man jumped to his feet and ducked into the building, CHP 
              officials said.</p>
              <p>San Francisco police responded to the scene once the 
              situation devolved from a traffic stop to a possible suicide attempt. 
              Officers from the hostage negotiation team, the tactical unit, the 
              motorcycle unit, the traffic division as well as Southern Station 
              arrived to aid in the standoff, Esparza said.</p>
              <p>A common strategy in these situations is to call the family of the 
              person in crisis, in hopes a loved one can talk them down, Esparza said.
               The man’s family was on its way from the East Bay as negotiators gently
               spoke to him from the fire escape.</p>
              <p>When police learned the man’s relatives brought his 
              cat to the scene, officers took it up to the negotiators. Shortly after 6
               p.m., the man went back inside the building and the standoff was 
              resolved.</p>
              <p>“I don’t remember ever using a cat before, but it 
              worked,” Esparza said. “The guy voluntarily came out of the window and 
              opened the door and was taken into custody without incident.”</p>
              <p>Esparza said he never got the cat’s name, but he 
              applauded the officers for their quick thinking, as well as their 
              sensitivity. Even as the man was handcuffed and taken to a police car, 
              officers brought the cat to him so he could see his beloved feline 
              before going to jail.</p>
              <p>“The hostage negotiators establish a trust with the 
              person, regardless if they are suicidal or a suspect, and you want to 
              maintain that trust as much as you can,” Esparza said. “The guy wasn’t 
              resisting. There was no need not to help him out. Obviously, he had a 
              very emotional attachment to the cat and it was nice to comfort him as 
              much as possible.”</p>
