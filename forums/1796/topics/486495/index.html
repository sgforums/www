Mr Anthony 
              Hong, who has started a website detailing the cat abuse cases in the 
              area, found out about the incidents from the elderly residents who feed 
              the cats there.<br> <br> A shopkeeper is on a mission to find the culprit, or culprits, behind the serial abuse of cats in Beach Road.<br> <br> Since 2011, there have been at least 50 cases of abuse in and around the
               Housing Board estate across from the Golden Mile Complex, according to 
              animal lover Anthony Hong. He launched <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.savebeachroadcats.com">www.savebeachroadcats.com</a> on Sept 14 to raise awareness and appeal for information.<br> <br> Just yesterday afternoon, a cat was found in the area with a stab wound to its neck.<br> <br> "Most of the cat carcasses showed signs of abuse - such as slingshot 
              wounds, knife wounds and punctures in their body," said the 35-year-old,
               who did not want his picture taken as he was worried about vandalism at
               his shop.<br> <br> His site details where and when several of the dead cats were found, 
              along with grisly photos. Mr Hong, whose sundry shop is in the area, 
              found out about the deaths after meeting elderly people who feed and 
              care for Beach Road's strays. One such "auntie" lodged a police report 
              in August 2011 complaining about an elderly man seen shooting stones at 
              cats with a catapult.<br> <br> In September 2011, Mr Hong paid $2,000 to hire a private detective for a
               week to check on this suspect but this did not unearth any evidence. A 
              month later, a black cat was flung from "a high level" at Block 5, Beach
               Road. The police and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
              Animals (SPCA) were called. "But the police told us they could not 
              arrest him as there was no concrete photo or video evidence," Mr Hong 
              said.<br> <br> The abuse is seemingly still going on. Earlier this year, a few cats 
              were found dead with stab wounds. On Aug 1, the carcass of a grey cat, 
              with blood coming from its mouth, was found at Block 9, North Bridge 
              Road. It was taken to the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority, which is 
              looking into the case. It said it has received feedback about the 
              suspected cruelty cases.<br> <br> Mr Hong decided to set up the website after years of appealing to the 
              authorities yielded no results. "They kept asking us for evidence, but 
              the elderly feeders are not tech-savvy," he said.<br> <br> Last month, the SPCA and Cat Welfare Society (CWS) jointly produced 
              posters appealing for more information. These were pasted at the notice 
              boards of blocks in the area. Ms Joanne Ng, chief executive of CWS, 
              urged residents there to keep their eyes open. Ms Corinne Fong, SPCA 
              executive director, said information collected so far has been sketchy 
              at best, and that "real credible evidence" is needed.<br> <br> Madam S. K. Koh, who has been feeding strays in the area for the past 19
               years, admits she has never seen the suspect harm a cat. The 
              74-year-old retiree said: "But when he walks by while I'm feeding the 
              cats, all of them will run and hide."<br> <br> Mr Hong, who is single, also runs a separate Facebook page to raise 
              funds for food and veterinary bills for Beach Road's cats. His passion 
              for cats grew in 2010, after he adopted a sickly stray which had the 
              feline version of AIDS. He said: "I cannot understand why anyone would 
              want to kill cats."<br> <br> - See more at: <a class="externalLink" href="http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/man-starts-website-nab-serial-cat-killer#sthash.rj7a3epN.dpuf">http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/man-starts-website-nab-serial-cat-killer#sthash.rj7a3epN.dpuf</a> </blockquote></div>

              <p><strong>Stray Cat Found Stabbed at Beach Road</strong><br> <strong>More than 10 Volunteers to Hunt for the Killer</strong></p>
              <p>Translation of report by Eu Si Yuan in Shin Min Daily News, 29 Mar 2015</p>
              <p>Another stray cat from Beach Road was found stabbed in the abdomen a 
              few days ago. Determined members from an animal welfare group are 
              assembling a team of more than ten volunteers to hunt for the “murderer”
               within the estate.</p>
              <p>The incident happened at Blk 5 of Beach Road.</p>
              <p>The Cat Welfare Society posted photos of the abused cat on its Facebook page yesterday.</p>
              <p>The gruesome images show a cat bleeding profusely from a suspected 
              stab wound in the abdomen, possibly inflicted by a sharp object.</p>
              <p>Writer Veron Lau, 43, the group’s vice president, told reporters that
               based on the evidence, there have been over 50 cases of cat abuse in 
              the Beach Road HDB area.</p>
              <p>Many community cats have been found dead or dying from injuries like 
              stab or kick wounds, or even thrown down from one of the flats.</p>
              <p>“These acts are extremely deplorable and we strongly condemn the serial abuse,” she said.</p>
              <p>The society intends to gather a group of volunteers to go down to the estate to catch the killer.</p>
              <p>Miss Lau revealed that besides educating residents, they will also be
               going door-to-door to hopefully gather evidence regarding the serial 
              cat abuse.</p>
              <p>Volunteers will also evaluate whether CCTV coverage in the area is 
              adequate, and will forward their suggestions to the relevant 
              authorities.</p>
              <p>Cat lovers from the estate had previously shared the costs of hiring a private investigator but to no avail.</p>
              <p>When we visited the Beach Road HDB estate, cat lover Mdm Chan told us
               that after the previous few abuse cases were publicised in the media, 
              the abuse stopped for about three months.</p>
              <p>The abuser shockingly struck again the day before. The cat that was 
              stabbed was still breathing when feeders discovered it but had to be put
               to sleep due to its severe injuries.</p>
              <p>She says, “There used to be more than a hundred stray cats in the 
              entire area, now there are only about 70 left”. She told us that she and
               other residents pooled together $2000 to hire a P.I. about three years 
              ago. However there were no findings even after a week of investigation.</p>
