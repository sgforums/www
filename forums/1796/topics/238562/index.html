Â— SHAHRIYA YAHAYA</span><br><br>Most people would think that six cats taken in by a loving family to be getting the better end of the deal.<br><br>In fact, the Lu family feels that itÂ’s the other way round.<br><br>The six cats that live with them have blessed them in more ways than they imaginable, said the Lus.<br><br>They are especially thankful of any blessings they have received since Mr Edgar Lu was diagnosed with ALS, or Lou GehrigÂ’s disease, in 1993.<br><br>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a disease that causes the death of nerve cells and hence the paralysis of voluntary muscles.<br><br>In 2000, Mr Lu, 54 and a former IT consultant, became completely bed ridden.<br><br>Three years later, Mr Lu and his wife Gina got their first cat, Gandalf.<br><br>Though they bought Gandalf to help their son Kevin, who was going through depression, they found that having a cat helped everybody.<br><br>The cats also help Mr Lu deal with his condition.<br><br>He is unable to move, except to smile and speak in a voice incomprehensible to everyone but those who know him. He has to be constantly under watch, as thereÂ’s a risk of him choking on his saliva.<br><br>Â‘Prior to the arrival of the cats, he was more focused on his own problems,Â’ said his wife, Mrs Lu, 47, a systems analyst.<br><br>Now, Mr Lu can watch the cats while he lies on the bed placed in the living room.<br><br>ItÂ’s very comforting to have them lie on the bed, he said through his wifeÂ’s translation.<br><br>Aside from providing emotional comfort, they even help to reduce his physical pain.<br><br>A cat lying on his hip can be more effective at relieving the pain than a hot water bottle, said the Lus.<br><br>The cats have also helped the whole family bond in a way that they couldnÂ’t previously.<br><br>Mrs Lu said that because of her husbandÂ’s illness the family wasnÂ’t able to spend as much time together as they wanted.<br><br>As the two sons grew older, they had less in common to talk about.<br><br>Â‘The cats indirectly serve as a link for the family,Â’ said Kevin, 20, a student at LaSalle-SIA College of the Arts.<br><br>Perhaps most important of all, the cats have helped the rest of the family get through hard times.<br><br>They really are, in their own way, members of the family.<br><br>Having Gandalf around helped Kevin get out of his depression, which hit him just around his O levels.<br><br>Gandalf is like a pal to her son, said Mrs Lu.<br><br>Kevin prefers to call Gandalf Â‘an animal version of a soulmateÂ’.<br><br>Â‘We understand each other,Â’ he added.<br><br>Both mother and son say the cats understand orders.<br><br>Â‘ItÂ’s uncanny,Â’ said Mrs Lu. For example, they will go into a room if she asks them to.<br><br>And whenever they are asked to do something they donÂ’t like, the cats will respond with an indignant look.<br><br>And while one would think that keeping six cats in the house would create a mess, Mrs Lu said the opposite is true.<br><br>Â‘TheyÂ’re very clean and well behaved,Â’ she added.<br><br>All they need is for fresh water and food to be left around the house and their litter boxes cleaned. ThatÂ’s not much to ask.</div>
