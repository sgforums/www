            <div class='col-md body'>This reminds me of the horrendous times when I had to feed my cat pills.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I live alone so after struggling and screaming and yelling and getting scratched at and spat upon, I finally grabbed a large towel, wrapped the cat snugly in it, tucked it under my arm and with one hand, tried to open the cat's jaw whilst the other hand would quickly pop the finger into its mouth.<br><br>Sounds easy right?  But nope...<br><br>Cat somehow struggled out of the towel and started to scratch madly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I simply hate feeding cats their medicine!<br><br>I tried to hide it in their favourite canned kitty food but somehow, they manage to pick it up with their sharp sense of smell.<br><br>I just detest having to feed cats their medicine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
