              <p>Like that it'll be better off as a stray...as long as it's neutered, vaccinated and tagged, the guy can keep it as a outdoor cat.</p>
              <p>And don't worry, it'll develop fighting skills in time, after all it's still young. All you have to do is to make sure it's fatter than the other cats. Lol, like that the other strays see already also scared.</p>
              <p>Cats can lead a good outdoor live too, it may be a little risky, but I'm sure it'll be happier than being stuck inside a cage all day.</p>

              <p><br>I picked up an injured tiny kitty last week. She was bitten by bigger cats. Bitten on neck.</p>
              <p>She sat on my lap for 3 hours haha. Whenever i tried to move her abit, she would cry. She seemed so comfortable and safe in my arms</p>
              <p>So tiny but so fierce, dare to growl at my dog heh heh</p>
              <p>She is in the safe hands of my relative now.</p>
              <p>I miss kitty very much :( </p>
