We have the responsibility to do something about it but taking responsibility is not equivalent to doing a half-farked job. It's taking in the animal and keeping it safe at home.<br><br>What ticks me off more is that before i brought my cats home in my old neighbourhood, nobody bothered abt stray cats... the population was minimal (only one or two around) but once my neighbours saw my cats and thought they were adorable, they started feeding strays cos they thought it was kind and cats are cute. its almost like a child wanting a pet but only when it is a kitten. To me, i think its not sincere and end up being utterly cruel to the strays. The worse part is they took strays from other neighbourhoods and left it at ours. What makes them think they are being any responsible to these cats? Even when they have no pets at home, they refuse to bring in the cat cos they think the cats will dirty or mess up their home! You see why i get worked up with these people? Such hypocrites! And I won't be surprised that my neighbours are not the only ones doing that in Singapore.... it just upsets me so much that these people don't realise the full meaning of being responsible for an animal's life!<br><br>and in case you are wondering, I am a cat owner... kekeke....<br></div>

Yet did we not bring about these homeless cats in the first place? Don't we have the responsibility to do something about it?"<br><br>That is what i meant. We have the responsibility to do something about it but taking responsibility is not equivalent to doing a half-farked job. It's taking in the animal and keeping it safe at home.<br><br>What ticks me off more is that before i brought my cats home in my old neighbourhood, nobody bothered abt stray cats... the population was minimal (only one or two around) but once my neighbours saw my cats and thought they were adorable, they started feeding strays cos they thought it was kind and cats are cute. its almost like a child wanting a pet but only when it is a kitten. To me, i think its not sincere and end up being utterly cruel to the strays. The worse part is they took strays from other neighbourhoods and left it at ours. What makes them think they are being any responsible to these cats? Even when they have no pets at home, they refuse to bring in the cat cos they think the cats will dirty or mess up their home! You see why i get worked up with these people? Such hypocrites! And I won't be surprised that my neighbours are not the only ones doing that in Singapore.... it just upsets me so much that these people don't realise the full meaning of being responsible for an animal's life!<br><br>and in case you are wondering, I am a cat owner... kekeke....<br></div></blockquote>That's why i named this forum Cats, and not kittens.<br><br>I really want to bring one home, but my mom don't let me =/<br><br>And your neighbours... it can't be helped i guess. Irresponsible people are everywhere.<br><br>I guess they just wanted the milk without having the cow~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've got three cats. All strays.<br><br>Two live in my backyard. Half the time they hang around there, and half the time they venture out into the neighborhood. But they always know to come back, cos here's where the food always is! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The other is a new kitten I picked up. Currently it stays in the car porch in front of the house cos the two adult cats behind don't seem to get along with it. They run away when they see the kitten. Instead the kitten is the one chasing after them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
