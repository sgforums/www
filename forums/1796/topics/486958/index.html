              <p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content">PARIS
               —  Police officers were sent to guard schools, while hundreds of 
              security officers scoured large areas near the French capital. Spooked 
              drivers locked their car doors. Residents cowered at home, fearful that a
               menacing tiger would devour them whole.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But
               a little more than 24 hours after the French police began their frantic
               search, they concluded that the errant feline was no tiger but, 
              possibly, a large or perhaps overweight domestic cat.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">At
               a time of economic and political malaise, the French could use a 
              diversion, and the renegade beast — first spotted in Montévrain, a town 
              east of the capital not far from Disneyland Paris — captured the 
              national imagination, while also stoking more than a little fear.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-2" class="story-body-text story-content">It
               may also have played into what commentators have said is a growing 
              public anxiety, stemming from 14 illegal drone flights over French 
              nuclear plants in recent weeks, raising concern about the security of 
              the country’s main source of electricity. French authorities say they 
              have no idea who was behind the mysterious flights.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Then
               came the reports of a large wild cat on the loose, slinking around the 
              outskirts of the French capital and eluding a hunting squad that 
              included officers armed with tranquilizer guns and a helicopter equipped
               with a thermal detector. As of Friday evening, they proved no match for
               the elusive cat, which officials estimated weighed at least 100 pounds,
               based on the size of its tracks.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text story-content">The
               national agency for hunting and wildlife was quoted by Agence 
              France-Presse as saying that the cat was not dangerous. “It is between a
               domestic cat and a larger feline,” said Eric Hansen, an official from 
              the agency, who also ruled out that it was a lynx.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The police said dozens of sightings have been phoned in. One driver 
              reported spotting the cat crossing the A4, a major highway, prompting 
              the authorities to tell drivers and residents in the area not to leave 
              their cars, or, worse, venture into the woods. The feline was also seen 
              stalking a gas station and prowling near the parking lot of a 
              supermarket, news reports said.</p>
