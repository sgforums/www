            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><img src="http://images.smh.com.au/2014/09/11/5752637/Article%20Lead%20-%20narrow6118128110fbnt1410447809995.jpg-300x0.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="433"></p>
              <p>A cat moves through the tall grass with a small, squirming rodent in 
              its mouth. Eye shine reflects the light as the cat turns to look at the 
              camera. Then it moves off into the undergrowth, unafraid and lord of its
               domain.</p>
              <p>It could be any patch of open ground in urban Melbourne and 
              the cat, indistinguishable from any well-fed domestic feline, could be 
              ridding the land of one more rodent that will scarcely be missed. This 
              is, after all, what cats do, what we expect them to do.</p>
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">But this is not suburban Melbourne. The rodent is not a pest. And there 
              is nothing domestic about this cat. Indeed if a new study is to be 
              believed, feral cats such as this one are eating their way through 
              Australia's native wildlife at a rate that is almost impossible to 
              fathom.</div>
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Action Plan for Australian Mammals, released in June, found that 
              55 of Australia's land mammal species face serious threat of extinction.
               Dr John Woinarski of Charles Darwin University and co-author of the 
              plan says "for land mammals in particular, predation by feral cats is 
              the principal factor that is contributing to decline".</p>
              <div id="conditionalAd-300x250-pos-3" class="ad adCentred" style="display: block;"></div>
              <p>Such is the language of academia, necessarily measured and cautious.</p>
              <p>But there is so much more to this story than dry, scientific 
              assessment. The Australian Wildlife Conservancy, Australia's largest 
              private conservation organisation, puts it more starkly: according to 
              the AWC, there are 15million feral cats in Australia and they kill an 
              estimated 75 million native animals every night across the country.</p>
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;"></div>
              </div>
              <p>It is a figure, almost apocalyptic in scale. And yet, Atticus Fleming, 
              the AWC's Chief Executive, describes this figure as "very conservative". There are other published studies, he warns, that 
              record up to 30 native animals being killed in a night by one cat alone.</p>
              <p>It is a perfect storm. And it is sending many of Australia's native wildlife species spiralling towards extinction.</p>
              <p>Where did all of these cats come from? To answer this 
              question requires a journey back into the early decades of white 
              settlement.</p>
              <p>"Cats arrived here very early on," Fleming says. 'Some probably survived from shipwrecks. Others came with the first settlers.'</p>
              <p>Whether brought as pets, or as a means of controlling rodents
               on ships bound for Australia, these cats quickly gained a foothold in 
              areas surrounding the first settlements.  "Feral cats probably became 
              widespread in Victoria and NSW by about the 1840s," says Woinarski.</p>
              <p>Throughout their relatively short stay in Australia, feral 
              cats have proved themselves to be a highly adaptable species with few 
              natural enemies in the wild. And since they arrived they have been 
              breeding like rabbits.</p>
              <p>Indeed domestic cats going wild are only a small part of 
               this long-established problem. "Strays are a problem, particularly 
              around the urban fringe," says Fleming, "and obviously in urban areas 
              with cats that are now going wild. But we have to remember that feral 
              cats have been in the landscape for a couple of hundred years."</p>
