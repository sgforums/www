              <p>A cat was found with his paws frozen in ice unable to move during harsh 
              weather. A man and his wife went on a mission to save him.</p>
              <p><img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/8888749/980x.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="578"></p>
              <p>The winter in the town of Zlatoust, Russia has been relentless. A man
               named Sergey Baranov discovered a cat  whose paws were stuck in the 
              ice.</p>
              <p>He said the cat was trying to hide underneath his car to 
              seek warmth, but the icy cold weather eventually froze his paws and 
              wedged him in the snow. Baranov moved his car and got his wife, Yelena, 
              to help him rescue the cat.</p>
              <p>The fluffy feline was stuck in cold temperatures that were as low as -35C. A blanket of ice encased his fur coat and his whiskers were caked in frost.</p>
              <p>Yelena
               immediately went to get a bucket of warm water to help defrost the ice 
              while her husband stayed put to watch over the cat.</p>
              <p><img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/8888750/980x.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="594"></p>
              <p>After several buckets of warm water, they were able to safely free 
              his paws from the ice and quickly wrapped him up with a large blanket 
              and brought him inside their house.</p>
              <p>During the entire 10-minute rescue operation, the cat didn't make a sound as if he knew that they were trying to help.</p>

              <p>"Always check what's under your cars before you start the engine!" Baranov said in the video.</p>
              <p>"We called a vet who came right away and he did an anti-inflammatory 
              shot. By the end of the day, the cat had started to walk," the couple 
              told The Siberian Times. The vet determined the kitty to be seven to nine months old.</p>
              <p>Three
               days after the rescue, the couple found a lady from their city who was 
              happy to give their rescue cat a loving home. "The cat has now lived at 
              her house for a week and she says he seems to be fine. He runs and jumps
               around."</p>
              <p>The kitty's new human mom gave an update on her cat in a video.</p>
              <p>His
               paws are fine, and they are keeping him indoors. The kitty seems to 
              love his new home and likes to be held and cuddle with his mom.</p>
