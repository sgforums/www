              <p>PETALING JAYA: A cat has allegedly gone missing on a Jeddah-Kuala 
              Lumpur flight, according to a now-viral Facebook post calling for help 
              in locating the pet after its cage arrived intact but empty at KLIA on 
              Friday morning.</p>
              <p>“She was placed aboard the Malaysia Airlines flight MH0151 at 2100 in
               Jeddah last night (4am on Friday, Malaysian time). The ground staff at 
              KLIA have lost her,” said Richard Bradbury in a Facebook post on Friday,
               in which two photos of the cat, Princess, were shared.</p>
              <p>Bradbury told <em>The Star Online</em> that Princess belonged to his girlfriend Eila Ezaar Reduan.</p>
              <p>“Please help me to track her down. Who should I contact? Please share
               and help find her. Her owner is distraught. This is Princess. She is a 
              street cat that was rescued from the streets of Jeddah and nursed back 
              to health. She was just about to start her new life here in Malaysia,” 
              said Bradbury in his post.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>He later told <em>The Star Online</em> that the cat’s cage was intact and locked when it arrived at KLIA.</p>
              <p>“Someone must have opened it using the clips around the edges,” Bradbury alleged.</p>
              <p>Eila explained how Princess was rescued three months ago after she 
              was found roaming around Albawadi Street in Jeddah by Eila and her 
              friends.</p>
              <p>“We used to feed the street cats at our apartment area. Some of my 
              friends and I rescued her and nursed her back to health as we are going 
              back to Malaysia in July. One of my colleagues sent me a message saying 
              there was an injured cat on the street. We took her home and sent her to
               the vet,” said Eila.</p>
              <p>She explained that Princess was flying back with a friend because no 
              pets are allowed on the flight, Eila had booked for herself.</p>
              <p>“One of my colleagues was going back on Thursday night so we rushed 
              to get all the documentation done before the departure date. I was there
               right up to Thursday night, checking her in at the counter,” said Eila.</p>
              <p>She added that all the necessary paperwork and veterinary procedures –
               such as microchipping, vaccinations and export permits from the 
              Agriculture Ministry and the Health Department were done in preparation 
              for the flight</p>
              <p>Eila said she had accompanied her pet to Customs in Jeddah for the 
              final checks of all the documentation, right up to the point where the 
              porter took Princess to be delivered to the aircraft.</p>
              <p>She questioned the response by airline staff when informed of 
              Princess’ disappearance, saying that they should have immediately 
              checked the cargo manifest.</p>
              <p>Eila added that when live animals are brought onto an aircraft, it 
              would be stated in the cargo manifest and load sheet so the captain can 
              adjust the temperature and oxygen accordingly in the right cargo 
              compartment.</p>
              <p>When contacted, a MAS spokesman said that the airline was aware of the matter and that it was under investigation.</p>
