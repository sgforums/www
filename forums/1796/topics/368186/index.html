              <p><strong>Cats coax their owners into giving them what they want with a special
              purr that blends their normal soft, low sound with a high-pitched
              element that is hard to ignore, British researchers said on Tuesday.</strong></p>
              <p id="ynw-article-part2">The high-frequency part is similar to a cry
              or a meow, and cats incorporate this into their normal, contended purr
              to exploit the nurturing instincts of humans for their own needs --
              usually to get fed, according to scientists.</p>
              <p>Lead author Dr Karen
              McComb of Sussex University in southern England said she initiated the
              study after being repeatedly woken up in the mornings by her own cat,
              Pepo.</p>
              <p>"I wondered why this purring sounded so annoying and was so
              difficult to ignore. Talking with other cat owners, I found that some
              of them -- including co-author Anna Taylor -- also had cats who showed
              similar behaviour," she said.</p>
              <p>McComb and her team tested human responses to different purring
              types, including "solicitation" purrs -- which included the
              high-frequency element and were made by hungry cats -- against
              "non-solicitation" or normal purrs.</p>
              <p>"When humans were played
              purrs recorded while cats were actively seeking food at equal volume to
              purrs recorded in non-solicitation contexts, even those with no
              experience of cats judged the ?solicitation? purrs to be more urgent
              and less pleasant," she said.</p>
              <p>When the team re-synthesised the purrs to remove the embedded cry, the urgency ratings decreased significantly.</p>
              <p>McComb
              concluded that the cats were using the special purr to make their views
              known without risking irritating humans with an overt meow.</p>
              <p>However,
              this solution appears only to work in cats living one-on-one with their
              owners -- cats in large households usually have to meow to be heard.</p>
