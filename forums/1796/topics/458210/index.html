              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>INLE LAKE, Myanmar: 
              They are known for their sleek good looks, alluring eyes and sunny 
              disposition, but one group of "Burmese" are virtually unknown in modern 
              Myanmar -- the country's namesake pedigree cats.<br><br>Once believed to
               be the favoured pet of royalty and guardians of temples, the Burmese 
              cat had vanished from its Southeast Asian ancestral homeland until 
              enthusiasts decided to return them.<br><br>Yin Myo Su, who took on the 
              project with the aim of preserving the country's heritage as it emerges 
              from military rule, has installed a growing family of the pedigree cats 
              in a house on the shores of Inle Lake, in eastern Shan State.<br><br>The
               hotelier hopes to raise the profile of the breed among Myanmar people 
              and even gave one to democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi -- what seemed like
               a sure-fire strategy to give the cats a badly needed public relations 
              boost.<br><br>But the Nobel Peace Prize winner's notoriously possessive 
              dog became "jealous" of the feline intruder and Suu Kyi was forced to 
              send the cat back.<br><br>"So now we are taking care of her cat at home as well! In case one day she can take it back with her," Yin Myo Su told AFP.<br><br>From
               just seven cats imported in 2008 -- some sourced from Britain's Harrods
               department store -- the project now has 50 moggies living around Inle, 
              including nine kittens, and has become a tourist draw.<br><br>A further 17 have been given to cat lovers in Shan State and the main city of Yangon.<br><br>Yin
               Myo Su -- who has pursued the project despite a slight allergy to 
              felines -- gives neutered Burmese cats to interested local people free 
              and charges foreigners 500,000 kyats ($580).<br><br>"They like to be 
              cuddled all the time," she said at the cats' home, the Inthar Heritage 
              House, as a purring chocolate brown feline wound itself around her feet 
              before collapsing onto its back for a tickle.<br><br>The idea of 
              repatriating Burmese cats came from the China Exploration and Research 
              Society (CERS), whose activities have included tracing a new source of 
              the Yangtze river and promoting a yak cheese cottage industry in the 
              Chinese province of Yunnan.<br><br>According to the non-profit group, 
              Burmese cats -- which share characteristics with other regional breeds 
              such as the Siamese -- have existed in mainland Southeast Asia for over a
               thousand years.<br><br>The breed was diluted out of existence by an 
              influx of other types of cats to the region in the 19th and 20th 
              century, with only a handful of purebreds taken to Britain during 
              colonial rule, which ended in 1948.<br><br>Much of the modern breed has 
              descended from a single female cat, Wong Mau, who was taken to the 
              United States in 1930, according to world pedigree organisation The 
              International Cat Association.<br><br>The short-haired cats have golden 
              eyes and come in a range of colours from silvery blue to cream, although
               rich brown is the primary colour.<br><br>"We are quite happy with the 
              reproduction because we got (mostly) original colours," said Yin Myo Su,
               who runs the upmarket Inle Princess hotel.<br><br>She has two of the 
              pedigree moggies at home in a menagerie of animals that she calls a 
              "mini zoo", including ducks, pigs, goats, geese and a monkey they have 
              to keep hold of because it was "a gift from a monk".<br><br>The hotelier
               is involved with an array of preservation projects and said she was 
              keen for the house to be more than just a picturesque cattery.<br><br>"It's
               hard for people to have a house in this region and I am building all 
              this for cats? No way," she said, adding that a restaurant, serving 
              traditional recipes, was added to cover the $800-a-month cost of looking
               after the cats.<br><br>Among her other projects, Yin Myo Su is building
               a centre for the study and preservation of fish native to Inle Lake, 
              but she said her staff have become sceptical about her motives for the 
              new aquatic endeavour.<br><br>"They laugh at me and say: 'Is it cat food?'"<br><br>- AFP</span></span></p>
