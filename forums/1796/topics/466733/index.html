              I have learned this little trick from my ex-neighbor who love cats and keep lots of them.
              
              Domesticated cats and dogs are just like human being, they don't shit at the place they eat and relax.
              
              Play with them, stroke their head, neck and back where their paws can't reach and play with them at your corridor. When they are accustomed to  you and your boundary,  they will never shit at that area again.

              <p><br>take photo and show lah. something must be relly wrong if it alwasy shit at the same spot. Leave some little news paper in a cozy box outside see the cat will shit there or not. for your info cannot keep cats in hdb, only chong pang area now trial run for 1 year. so tok to your neighbours nice. after meal or once in a while tell them to make it a practise periodically walk the cat outside so they can shit, unless the cat is lausai.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dont go and put poison. what goes aroudn comes around. if a human being's child shit at your place youtok to the parents and still the child shit will you put posion? that';s murderr of course. but a cat you can put posion lah?</p>

              <p>Bro troublemaker, relax la. There's a reason why my name is such right? I'm a cat lover myself. I just see no point cleaning the droppings of my neighbours cat without any benefit. Report all u want. My conscience is clear <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Of course while I wouldn't go to the extent of harming the cat, I may have to call in related authorities as I oso went and check it out -- really cnt keep cat in hdb sio... Miniature sized dogs can, but why not cats ar?</p>
              <p>But yea, I rather discuss wif my neighbours first. If all comes down to nothing, den who to call ar?</p>

              <p>neighbours first. tell them about the cat sniff scent and behaviour. tell them they have to at least keep their cats indoors, walk it our accompanies ocasionally if they want.</p>
              <p>tell them the cat if alow to roam may endanger itself, get lose, get killed, or poop on people;s doorsateps. an example as you highlighted tell them. if tehy still bochap. call CWS first., tehya re a non profit organization for cats, not govvernment linked but has enuff authorithy to mediatate teh situation. they have qualified people and volunteers to handle such cse. if the neighbour dont corportae even after CWS steps in, then that makes things even more easy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HDB dont allow cats at this momnet. chong pang's 1/2 year pilot programe has not a conclusion and gahmen havenot decide on any act yet. so they neighbor is actually breaking teh law. byt keeping cats in hdb, and also check the cat if the cats is microchipped.</p>
              <p>depending on the exisitg law on such breakers, or if you decide to sue the neighbour for such inconveneience, where involved authorities wanna take any legal action against the neigbour, the penalty can rang efrom formal warnring, rehoming the cat and if youur casue succed in court if you bring it up with lawyer's assistance, fine or jail is also possible. that will deoend how stroing your case and how far you wanna bring the case forward.</p>

              <p>aiyah write so much also dont know how the cat look like. take a photo of the cat lah. show us this notti fellow.</p>
              <p>dont worry about photos rights if the 'owner' ever know.</p>
              <p>as long as you follow my expert advice the following when you take the photo</p>
              <p>(1) Check and ensure you and the neighbour are not living in chong pang area.</p>
              <p>(2) Check and ensure the owner had not microshipped the cat (anyway dont matter if point #1 is TRUE). But may matter if point #1 is not true. if points 1 and 2 passes, proceed to point 3, else take photo secretly, or at a public place. Then if neighbour discovered refer the family to me i will take on the photography rights part.</p>
              <p>(3) Once point 1 and 2 cleared, take a photo of the cat and ensure you are at a public place or angle of photo is from your own place outwards.</p>
              <p>then post here we see the cat is round or flat one.</p>

              <p>no need lah. those irresponsible so called 'owners' dont know how easily it is if we want to go law by law. even if HDB allowed to keep cats what the owner did allowing the cat to roam about is wrong already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you just take the cat and put it up for rehome in front of the owner, the owner alsoc annot do aything. because in HDB he should not own a catch unless its in chong pang undergoing the 1,2 years trailrun period in conjunction with CWS when cats has to be neutal, sterilized and microhipped, homes cat proof and reviewed by CWS. </p>
