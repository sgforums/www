            <div class='col-md body'>canned food .. Whiskers or Friskies and also cat biscuits. my dad's cat is particular about his food, he like pure tuna, chicken, prawns. Don't like sardines and anything with jelly in it. The canned food is mixed with some rice and sometimes, just throw in 1 piece of vege. He likes biscuits and we trained him to shake hands for biscuits.<br><br>The can has difficulty dealing with bones as its teeth is not strong to chew it.  If its a greedy cat, it might try to eat the bones and sometimes this will choke it. So don't give cats bones.. especially house cats. When they gag and/or use their paws to try to scratch their muzzle, its means something is lodge in its mouth and its trying to throw it up. Its quite gross.<br><br></div>
