            <div class='col-md body'>Potential profile of an animal abuser...<br><br>That kind of fellow could be in his mid-30s to 40s, lacking in social skills, loner type personality.Unable to find a job, possesive of weird socially-unpalatable habits, might be very brilliant in academics but hasn't got an inkling of how to relate to others.Mollycoddled from birth, until death of one or more parents.Stressed easily and generally anal-retentive in nature.Speaks very arrogantly and loves to think all around him are inferior to him.Might be small-built,  therefore the abuse of small animals because he is afraid of people larger than him and the former makes him feel in control.<br><br>Am I accurate? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

They serve as great fertiliser to the grass, since they only excrete in out of sight areas(usually grass).<br>2) How much of a mess can we make, if we clean up after they finish eating?<br>3) How cats affect his health? If he's allergic than stay away! If not, how can it affect him but positively? Since stroking cats is a known stress remover ...<br>4) How annoying cats are? How? Everytime i see them i smile a bit... how annoying are they?<br>5) This is worse. The writer is obviously biased. If cats are a nuisence to the entire world, why would Cats be ranked no.1 in the US for being the Most popular pet?<br>6) What a joke. If that's the case, No need for SPCA, Nanas, Cats Welfare Soc.<br><br>Can we email the evening chinese paper instead? This is ridiculous, really.<br></div>
