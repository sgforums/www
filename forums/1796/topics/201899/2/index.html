            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by KittynMeow:</div><div class="quote_body">Usually little kittens are left alone because the mother cat has probably gone off looking for food for herself. If the kitten is not in any distress, the best option is to walk away... as any trace of human scent around the kitten would tell the mother cat that a human has been around and possibly touching the kitten. It is probable that the mother cat would then refuse to nurse the kitten out of fear or dislike for humans....<br><br>rather than think of what to do, think of what NOT to do:<br>- DON'T feed the kitten with milk meant for human consumption. If the kitten is really in distress and hungry, feed it with kitten milk formula (available from pet shops) using a dripper or a kitten milk bottle.<br><br>- DON'T play with it. If the kitten is not in any sign of distress, there is no need to touch it. The mother cat is probably out to hunt and will be back after you are gone.<br><br>- DON'T keep hanging around the area where the kitten is located. The mother cat would feel intimidated about coming back to the kitten and may end up indirectly causing the kitten to be abandoned.<br><br>If you are concerned about the kitten or unsure whether the mother cat will come back, just keep a lookout for the mother cat from a distance.<br><br>Taking care of a baby kitten is serious business... requires constant feeding (almost once every 2 hours) etc. Pretty much like taking care of a human baby. If you can't commit that kind of time or attention, just observe and look out for the mother cat to come back. </div></blockquote>May I add one more?<br><br>- DON'T tell the whole world about it.  Too many people going to see the poor kitty will only attract more cat-fearing bigots to complain to the Town Council.  End result = more deaths.<br><br>But seriously, if you are going to take care of a kitten of nursing age (ie, lost its mother), you can opt for the alternative of feeding warm Magnolia (Fresh) milk.  Though that will give kitten slower growth compared to the specialty formula for babies.  Heard from some CWS caregivers that a "S26" or something powdered milk is best.<br><br>You'll need to get a few (3-4) nursing bottles though, cause after the first 1 week, your first bottle would get totally chewed up by the kitty.  And throughout all times, keep them warm.  Hot-water bottles under the box or blanket is good for simulating mother's body heat, and so is good for helping kitty to sleep (and grow).<br><br>This fellow, named Fuji, was nursed from 1-week old (mother was run over) in Dec 2004.<br><img src="http://barnie.photonx.org/albums/userpics/10002/1035.jpg"></div>
