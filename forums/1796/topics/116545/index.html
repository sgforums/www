After some time of searching and findings, he concluded the following:<br><br>1. The kittens were placed in a side drain alley<br>2. Whenever it rains, the mother cat would carry one by one to a safe place<br>3. Whenever the mother forage for food, the kittens were left alone<br>Thus...<br>The litter were killed when the rain comes heavily and at least one was washed away. Secondly, whenever the mum was away, rats would come and drag off one of the kittens, easy meal.<br><br>In the end, all the kittens were gone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>-------------------------------------<br><br>The next time it was pregnant, my friend brought it home and gave it a warm box(I think).
