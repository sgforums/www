               the dismemberment of the kittens," she said. "We've also alerted the

              <p>videoere. very clean. very clear is a planned act.</p>
              <p>no dripping blood stains. the bodies might have be severed and places in bags or containers. then pieces are left bythe murders at the serval locations reported. if the flats have survellence TV, probably can nab the suspect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>might be some pyscho out of job or really dislike cats.</p>

              <p><strong>Help identify those responsible for mutilating cats, Shanmugam urges residents</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 02 January 2013 1346 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Law and 
              Foreign Affairs Minister K Shanmugam is encouraging residents to come 
              forward to help identify those responsible for mutilating two cats in 
              Yishun.<br><br>He described the act as "sick".<br><br>Mr Shanmugam, who 
              is also the MP for Nee Soon GRC, said that "how one is judged as a 
              society can be seen from the way one treats animals."<br><br>On Sunday, two kittens were found dismembered outside an HDB flat in Yishun Ring Road.<br><br>The
               Cat Welfare Society posted the photo on its Facebook page after being 
              alerted to the incident by a resident who found the remains.<br><br>The 
              flat is in the Chong Pang neighbourhood, which has a pilot programme to 
              encourage responsible cat ownership. Under the pilot, Chong Pang 
              residents can legally own one cat per flat but must fulfill certain 
              conditions.<br><br>These include ensuring that the cat is sterilised and microchipped.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>from what i see this incident is not the first, and from poast experience we know usuaally what tyope of people will do this type of job. this one is clean cut, likely industrial machinery that can cut or a meat cleaver (chopper). also some efforst have been done to prepare these body parts for display as the blood seems have been bleed dry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the recent move to house cats in hdb MAY have some impact on this act as peopl who simply dont like cats may be trying to send a strong opposing signal. yishun area is also near chong pang area.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but i urge CWS an SPCA to contrinue their fight for rehoming cats in HDB, and also educate fully and continuously about responsible cat / pet ownerchip, public awareness that cat are docile and companion pets suited for hdb homes. as long as we take good care of them, understand their nature and characters, at the same time pay attention to those who may fear or dislike their occasional cat calling and  litter nuisances. owners should watch their own pets behaviour for any sudden chance that may irrtate or cause a nuisance to neighbors, and pet societies should avoid putting pets with strong anti-social behaviour up for adoption until further care and observation</p>

              <p>its very difficult to talk to irresponsible owners or 'owners' who likes their 'own point of view' sinstead of understanding nature and act to do good for pets and cast in a long run.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>look at those aunties and ah mahs who feed cast. just leave the litters there and only feed not suitable food to the cats.  to prove the point that she like cat does not mean that you dont study them go online a or search for information about them, their behaviours and diet. feed them improper food the cast will die sooner, the litter tehr after is a nuisances. and worse by feeding them in packs and allowing them to breed without conrtol will prove a nuisance to the public and environemnt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>those people that see cat wondering the palce just take them home and keep hundreds of them in one appartment how? just pity them so wanna keep them safe in one place in thre result of conjestion and no one to care for cats individually they messed and create noise air polution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have even seen worse. i ever saw an old lady once saw ants on the food she left to feed the cats and spray insecticid e on the food to drive the ants away, then palce the food for cats to eat. very caring, but did it the wrong way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>pet owners, they just feed keep a pet at home and ignore their chane of behaviour, allowing them to roam and poop and at night call cat disturb other people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>really tok to suchirresponsible boh chap owners? try talking to a wall instead.!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for the solution? no need to talk to such psychopaths who kill and dismember bodies, their mind is far more complicated. they might have tried to talk to such owners, or mayb even observe from owners' behaviour that talking is pointless.</p>

I hope my offer of a reward will help bring the perpetrator of this crime to justice," he added.<br><br>He also urged for more to be done in educating the public on responsible animal welfare, as well as for penalties to be stiffened for animal abusers.<br><br>The number of animal welfare and abuse cases have spiked in recent years, from 292 in 2007 to 399 in 2011.<br><br>Under the Animals and Birds Act, anyone convicted of animal cruelty can be fined up to S$10,000 and/or jailed for up to 12 months.<br><br>This case happened less than three months after a government-backed pilot programme to encourage responsible cat ownership was launched in the estate. - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">TODAY</span></span></a> </span></p>
