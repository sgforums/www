              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">An article on Today</span></span> (extracted below) which featured an interview with SPCA says that there are lesser cats being surrendered to SPCA last year. This has been attributed to the effectiveness of TNRM currently being practiced in Singapore.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">SPCA could put down the animals</span></span> surrendered to them in 24 hours due to a limitation on facilities as they take in more than 800 animals a month - too many animals, so little space.</p>
              <p>As for cats being removed by pest control engaged by Town Councils and property management, the cats are sent to AVA, which means they would be put to sleep in 3 days.</p>
              <p>The Cat Welfare Society advocates the humane practice of Trap-Neuter-Return-Management as a more effective way to control the population of community cats in Singapore.</p>
              <p>We certainly hope to see an increase in tolerance for the cats living amidst us, as we aim to chip off the misconceptions about community cats bit by bit, through more awareness programmes targetted at the public.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Rise in lost dogs, despite laws</strong></span><span><br><br><br>LOH CHEE KONG<br><br><br>DESPITE recent laws making it compulsory for dogs to be licensed and implanted with microchips,the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) received more lost dogs last year, even as the population of stray cats appears to be under control. <br><br>The ruling, which animal activists hoped would discourage pet dumping, took effect in September 2007. But it did not stop the SPCA from receiving 1,162 lost dogs last year, a marginal increase as compared to 2007, according to its latest statistics. <br><br>Last week the SPCA said in a press statement that most of the lost dogs were “pedigree or pedigree crosses and the majority had no microchip or identification”. Only just over a third was claimed by their owners. <br><br>The dumping of such dogs — a concern the SPCA had flagged last year — continue unabated, with 1,550 purebreds received. Mindful that some could have been lost pets, the SPCA reminds owners to microchip their dogs at veterinary clinics. <br><br>“More importantly, they mustlicense their dogs with the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority for the microchip to be effective,” it said. Jack Russell Terriers, Maltese and Golden Retrievers were some common breeds surrendered or abandoned, as well as a “considerable number” of Huskies. <br><br>The Society receives around 700 animals each month, with only two out of every 10 possibly finding new homes. The good news is that the number of cats coming through its doors has dropped by 13 per cent — or 600 cats — year-on-year. The average number of cats taken in each month has also fallen from 500 to 300. <br><br>Such a “significant change” was likely due to more stray cats being sterilised, the SPCA said. <br><br>Since 1991, the SPCA has implemented a free voucher scheme under which it pays for the sterilisation of neighbourhood cats brought by volunteer caregivers to participating veterinary clinics. More than 2,000 vouchers were distributed last year. <br><br>“Although the demand for vouchers always exceeds the supply, many community cats are being sterilised, which ultimately means the number of births should decline,” the SPCA said</span></p>

              <p>Did they give you any reasons for rejecting you?</p>
              <p>I think a law should be passed so there is a price floor for dogs. &gt;$1000 is way too cheap for a life, albeit a canine one. Maybe it can sieve out those who buy dogs as pets without conducting sufficient research on them first, and act as a deterrent against abandonment e.g. if your dog cost you $10,000 then maybe you will think twice about dumping it in the streets or the SPCA but seek out a second owner instead. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"></p>
              <p>That should also put a lot of horrid pet shops out of business and people who can't afford $10,000 will turn to the SPCA and dog shelters instead.</p>
