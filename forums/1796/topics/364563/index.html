              <p>FOUR more sick cats were found at the Bayshore Park condominium over
              the weekend, bringing the total number of affected cats from the estate
              to 16 - about half the number of strays there.</p>
              <p>The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) had
              to put down two cats yesterday. Another one died last Friday. SPCA
              executive officer Deirdre Moss said the two cats put down were in bad
              shape, were unresponsive to treatment and 'hardly had any pulse'.</p>
              <p>Three birds were also found dead at the estate yesterday.</p>
              <p>Since last Thursday, stray cats at the private estate have been
              found unconscious or disoriented. The police are investigating.</p>
              <p>Some cat food was found at a block in the estate and the SPCA
              is waiting for test results from the Health Sciences Authority on the
              food samples. It is also analysing blood samples from one of the
              surviving cats. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority is conducting a
              post-mortem on the dead cat.</p>
              <p>Of the 13 surviving cats, one is still on a drip. The rest
              are alert, said Ms Moss. 'It's becoming more evident it's a deliberate
              and malicious act. If the intention was to clear the condominium of the
              strays, then those responsible have gone about it in a most cruel
              manner,' she added.</p>
              <p>The mystery of the sick animals has gripped the 1,093-unit
              estate and is now the talk of the town. Dog owners have stopped walking
              their pets while cat owners are keeping them indoors.</p>
              <p>A notice by the condo's management said the cats were
              'cruelly fed poisoned food' and advised residents not to let their pets
              eat food that is lying around.</p>
              <p>A housewife in her 50s, well known within the estate for
              feeding the stray cats every morning, said she was 'heartbroken'.</p>
              <p>She is among several residents who have banded together to conduct patrols to spot any suspects.</p>
