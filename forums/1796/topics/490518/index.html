              <p class="story-body__introduction">Chinese social media users are 
              buzzing with outrage at news that a "feline house" in Tianjin has been 
              keeping cats to be sold for human consumption.</p>
              <p>They have raised concerns over food hygiene and many have posted pictures of their own pets to raise awareness.</p>
              <p>The country has already come under fire for a similar cat meat scandal and its annual dog meat festival.</p>
              <p>Some activists are calling for these "terrible and prehistoric" customs to be dropped.</p>
              <p>Eating cat meat is widely regarded as taboo in China, but it is still eaten in some rural regions.</p>
              <h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Cages</h2>
              <p>On 28 October, popular 
              regional daily The Beijing News reported that local police in the 
              eastern city of Tianjin had found a "common courtyard house with more 
              than 200 cats crowded into very small cages".</p>

              <p>According to the report, "several villagers said that the 'feline 
              house' had been leased to someone from outside the area for two to three
               years".</p>
              <p>"We have often seen in the past cats being transported 
              by vehicle, but we did not know what these people were doing," one 
              villager said.</p>
              <p><img src="http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1559B/production/_86415478_huaxi-metropolis-daily-post.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="351"></p>
              <p>The news went viral after it was posted on the popular microblog Sina
               Weibo by influential papers the Yangtse Evening Post and Huaxi 
              Metropolis Daily. Both said rescue teams had confirmed that the cats 
              were to be shipped to Yunnan, Guangdong and Shandong provinces to be 
              used as food.</p>
              <p>The Huaxi Metropolis Daily's post was shared over 
              3,000 times and received thousands of comments from appalled social 
              media users.</p>
              <h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Hygiene worries</h2>
              <p>Within two 
              days, the hashtag #CatMeatUsedForHamAndKebabs had become a Sina Weibo 
              trend. Posts using the hashtag have reached more than nine million, and 
              more than 5,000 social media users have actively used the hashtag to 
              discuss the story.</p>
              <p>Users appeared to be most concerned about food hygiene standards.</p>
              <p>"I will never eat food from roadside vendors again," said Xiaocong Ban-Jiang, whose comment received more than 1,000 likes.</p>
              <p>"What
               is happening to our country, why are there always problems with food 
              and drink?" lamented Xiao Ruyi Jin Baozi in another popular post.</p>
              <p>Weibo users across the country have been uploading pictures of their own pets in protest.</p>
              <p><img src="http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/2103/production/_86415480_xiaoyuan-zide-dream.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="351"></p>
              <p>"You can't not love them; please do not hurt them. I hope you don't 
              go to street vendors or unlicensed restaurants," Xu Xiao Piao wrote.</p>
              <p>"I do not understand how some people cannot tell the difference between
               an animal companion and food," Xiaoyuan Zide Dream protested.</p>
              <h2 class="story-body__crosshead">'Terrible and prehistoric'</h2>
              <p>State media reports say two men have been detained and that "the matter is under investigation".</p>
