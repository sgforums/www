            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">October 21st 1990</span></strong><br><br>Today is my wedding anniversary. Choong Boon and the children have booked a table for dinner at Ritz Carlton. I was just choosing my attire for the special evening when the doorbell rang. Wonder who could that be?<br><br>Â“Good afternoon, madam. ThereÂ’s a package for Madam Lim Poh Choo. Could you please sign for it?Â”<br><br>A package for me? *Haha* It must be either Choong Boon or the children who send me a present for the wedding anniversary. I opened the package. Inside were a nicely sealed envelope and a few books, which looked really old and yellow. Now, why would they send me such old books? I gently opened the envelope and inside laid a letter, addressed to me.<br><br>Â“Dear Poh Choo,<br><br>It has really been a surprise to see you again along Orchard Road yesterday, after 20 years. IÂ’m glad to see that you are living so happily.<br><br>I know this must have seemed very abrupt of me to send you this package, but please forgive me, because IÂ’m migrating to the United States and IÂ’ll be flying off today. These diaries do not belong to me; they belong to my brother, Wee Teck. Perhaps your memories of him have faded as the time passes. But Poh Choo, he never did ever forget you. You were in his mind, in his heart all the while, even after you got married. It hurt him so much to see you married off with another person, but he loved you. He truly loved you so much, enough to let you go. He didnÂ’t think much of his own feelings but he felt that as long as you were happy, he was willing to sacrifice his own happiness in exchange for yours.<br><br>After you left, Wee Teck would go to the National Library on the 21st of October, every year without fail, to wait for your return. No matter rain or shine. Because he believed that one day, you will remember the pact you made to visit the library with him. He had been doing that faithfully every year. 10 years ago, Wee Teck went to the National Library, like he did every year on the 21th of October......<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">It was raining heavily that very day. </span><br>Wee Teck had stayed till the library closed at 9pm before leaving. He had a bowl of Â‘tau huayÂ’ before making his way back home, in the rain. He was walking along the road, when a drunken driver lost control of his car and knocked him down. Beside him, we found his bag and it contained these diaries.<br><br>Wee Teck was seriously injured and has been in coma since then. The actual reason of us migrating to United States is: WeÂ’ve found a doctor who diagnosed that there might be a chance that he may regain conscious. Even though itÂ’s a slim chance of him recovering, we are willing to risk it. It pains us even more to see the once lively Wee Teck being bounded to the bed and unaware of the incidents happening around him.<br><br>It never crossed my mind to ever get to meet you again. I had planned to leave these diaries behind and bury the sad memories. Perhaps it was fate, which we actually got to meet yesterday. I finally decided to send you these diaries and help Wee Teck express his feelings to you, before leaving for his treatment, that you actually mean a lot to him.<br><br>DonÂ’t be sad, Poh Choo. ItÂ’s already all in the past. And donÂ’t blame yourself for Wee TeckÂ’s predicament. It was an accident, an accident that all of us didnÂ’t want it to happen. ItÂ’s the drunken driverÂ’s fault, not yours and not Wee TeckÂ’s either. There is no fault for loving someone deeply. Right now, we only pray for Wee TeckÂ’s recovery.<br><br>I wish you a happy future ahead with your family. Till we meet again, take care. Bless you.<br><br>Best Regards,<br>Wee Teng.<br></div>

IÂ’ve always thought of him living happily with a family of his own. I didnÂ’t know after all these years; he was still waiting for me. Wee TeckÂ… Wee TeckÂ… Why were you so silly? I am not worth all the wait, the hurt and the sadness I brought upon you. I donÂ’t understand why you were so willing to give up your happiness for me?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>I picked up one of the diaries in the package and flipped to the latest entryÂ…Â…</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>October 21st 1975</strong></span><br><br>Dear Poh Choo,<br><br>Today was supposed to be our 10th anniversary; ironically this is also the 6th year since you have left me. Although these years you werenÂ’t by my side, you were inside here all the while, deeply rooted in my heart.<br><br>Every year I would come by here, to the National Library to wait for you. I will always remember that you made a deal with me that we would visit the library on our anniversary. Have you forgotten that? For IÂ’ve been waiting for you faithfully to come back one day.<br><br>The National Library has undergone a lot of upgrading. It isnÂ’t the National Library it used to be. The hawker centre is no longer there, out Â‘tau huayÂ’ stall has since moved to Selegie Road. The reference section where we used to study together has now been renovated and is now a childrenÂ’s section.<br><br>You see, Poh Choo? Everything has changed, but IÂ’m still Wee Teck; your Wee Teck.<br><br>You probably didnÂ’t realize it. But I was at your wedding and I looked at you from afar. Boy, you were the most beautiful bride IÂ’ve ever saw, much more beautiful than I imagined. It broke my heart to see you were getting married another guy. But I had so badly wanted to see you in the wedding gown. Even though the groom wasnÂ’t me, I still wish you happiness and a blissful marriage.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why did you choose to leave me, Poh Choo? What have I done wrong? Why didnÂ’t you give me another chance? I would have tried my very best to change for the better. Why break up with me on the very day I planned to propose to you? I had spotted the ring a few weeks before; I knew the ring was meant just for you. I could picture you wearing it. Mrs. TanÂ…Â… My Poh Choo would be known as Mrs. Tan Wee Teck. I was bursting with happiness just at the though of it. But the price of the ring was way beyond what I could afford. It was after much persuasion did the boss allow me to pay for the ring by installment. If only you had accepted itÂ…Â…<br><br>I had been saving for a few weeks before I could bring you to that restaurant to celebrate our 2nd anniversary. It was only when the bill was brought to me did I realize that I didnÂ’t have enough money on me. My dear, I knew youÂ’ll be angry if you knew I couldnÂ’t pay for the bill and I didnÂ’t want you to be angry over such a trivial matter. I wanted you to be happy on our anniversary. Of course I was worried about your safety. I worry about you more than anyone else in the face of this world. But still I couldnÂ’t send you home. I had to go back to the restaurant to do the dishes; otherwise we would be arrested. That night I left the restaurant at 2am, after washing all the dishes. I walked all the way home cause I didnÂ’t have a single cent left on me. I was very tired, but it was worth it. I gave you a surprise and brought you to a decent restaurant and not to the hawker centre.<br><br>The day you agreed to be my girlfriend; was the happiest moment of my life. I almost couldnÂ’t believe it! I was overjoyed. When I went home, I told my family about the wonderful news: IÂ’ve gotten myself the most wonderful girlfriend in the entire world. I was grinning myself silly, even my mother asked me if my cheeks were sore from wearing the grin the whole time. *Hahaha* I couldnÂ’t contain my happiness at all; I spent the whole night tossing on the bed not believing my luck. The girl IÂ’ve been thinking about day and night has finally agreed to be my girlfriend. I could swear I was grinning in my sleep too.<br><br>Poh Choo, it just seemed like yesterday when I saw in the library for the first time. I still remember hearing you slam your books down on the table, giving me a little dimpled smile and an apologetic look. But yet right at this moment, you are so far away from me.<br><br>No matter where you are, I sincerely wish you happiness.<br><br>Always yours,<br>Wee Teck<br><br>P/S: IÂ’ll always be waiting for you here at the National Library, under the willow tree, on the 21st of October.<br><br></div>

He had arranged to celebrate our anniversary at the National Library once again. DoesnÂ’t he realize that itÂ’s boring to keep going to the library? In fact thereÂ’s nothing over there, only books and one lousy hawker centre beside it. Nothing captivating.<br><br>This year, he has hinted heÂ’ll be giving me a surprise once again. SighÂ… I wished it would be something good this time. Last yearÂ’s anniversary was a disaster.<br><br>The rain still didnÂ’t stop when I left the office and Choong Boon offered me a lift to the National Library. I gladly accepted his offer, because I donÂ’t want to be drenched from head to toe. I knew Choong Boon was interested in me, I could sense it. He would always treat us (the company employees) out for lunch, but at the table he would be more attentive to my needs. Always asking what I wanted to eat. He would bring us to many different high class restaurants to taste the different cuisine, recommending us what is delicious. With him, everything was an eye opener. And he owning a car was definitely a bonus. He would always offer me a ride home. Well, IÂ’m grateful for that as least I donÂ’t have to drag myself back everyday after work. But the best of all was, he was the big bossÂ’ son. HmmÂ… Perhaps giving Choong Boon a chance didnÂ’t seem like such a bad ideaÂ…<br><br>Â“Choong Boon, could you please wait here for me for a little while? IÂ’ll be back soon.Â”<br>Â“Ok sure.Â”<br><br>I alighted from the car, running towards the hawker centre, in the rain, in search of Wee Teck. There I see him sitting in front of the Â‘tau huayÂ’ stall, as usual. He was fiddling with something in his hand. When he saw me approaching, he quickly stuffed it into his shirt pocket and smiled brightly at me.<br><br>Â“Happy 3rd anniversary dear!  I canÂ’t believe we have been together for so long.Â”<br>Â“Yes, perhaps itÂ’s a little too longÂ…Â…Â”<br>Â“What makes you say that? WeÂ’ve still got a long way ahead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Are you feeling alright today? Feeling very stress at work? Perhaps I could accompany you for a short break over to Malaysia?Â”<br>Â“LetÂ’s break up, Wee Teck. IÂ’m sorry.Â”<br><br>Upon saying this, I left the table. Wthout turning back, i made my way back to Choong BoonÂ’s car.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>OH MY GAWD!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
