            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">October 24th 1965</span></strong><br><br>ItÂ’s been two days since I last went to the National Library to study. For the past two days, no matter what I was doing, miraculously an image of the boy in the library would creep into my mind and often disrupting my thoughts. When I close my eyes to sleep at night, I would see his face, his intense gaze at me. Perhaps I should go to the library to study today to see if I could Â“accidentallyÂ” meet him there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I walked towards the reference section. With every step I take, my heart would seem to increase by ten beats. There he was!!! Sitting at the exact spot two days ago. It seemed as if he had never left the seat before, waiting for me to be back. *Hahaha* Guess IÂ’m thinking too much.<br><br>But anyway, I quietly slipped into the seat opposite, not wanting to disturb him. This time round, he didnÂ’t look up at all but carried on studying. Oh wellÂ… IÂ’ll just do the same too; perhaps heÂ’ll notice me later.<br><br>I was diligently studying when I heard a finger tapping on the table. I looked up and saw him. Pointing to a pen in his hand, he mouthed the word *Pen*.<br>Without much thinking, I asked him, Â“You want a pen?Â”<br>Shaking his head, he mouthed the word *No*.<br>Â“Huh? Then what do yoÂ…Â…Â…Â”<br>My question was drowned by a loud *QUIET* from the librarian. OppsÂ… IÂ’ve forgotten that weÂ’re not supposed to talk in the library. I could feel my face flushed from the embarrassment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  I quickly looked down and pretended to be very interested in my notes.<br><br>A moment later, a piece of paper was placed in front of my eyes.<br>And our conversation on paper started:<br>Â“Sorry about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  DidnÂ’t mean to let you get scolded by the librarian. You left your pen on the table the other day. Was about to return it to you just now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Â”<br>Â“Oh, itÂ’s ok. IÂ’ve forgotten I was in the library. Anyway, thanks for keeping my pen and returning it to me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Â”<br>Â“YouÂ’re welcome. ItÂ’s just a small matter. So, are u studying for your A levels too?Â”<br>Â“Yep. And right now IÂ’m struggling with Mathematics. What about you?Â”<br>Â“IÂ’m taking Mathematics too. If you need any help I could give you a hand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  By the way, my name is Wee Teck. WhatÂ’s yours?Â”<br>Â“IÂ’m Poh Choo. Thanks for offering. I think I really need LOTS of help with Mathematics.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">December 21st 1965</span></strong><br><br>AT LAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The A levels examination is OVER!!! Over~ Over~ Over~ IÂ¡Â¦m so happy that itÂ¡Â¦s finally over. I raced all the way from school to the National Library to meet Wee Teck. We had agreed to meet and celebrate together the end of our A levels examination.<br><br>I spotted Wee Teck from afar. HahaÂ¡K Actually it wasnÂ¡Â¦t difficult to spot Wee Teck at all. Being almost one head taller than most people, it was impossible to miss him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  His face lit up at the sight of me. I practically flew to him and grabbed his hands. We like two crazy person jumping, screaming and laughing outside the National Library. *Exam is over. Exam is over.* Only when other people started to cast weird stares at us, that it dawned on both of us that we have just acted insanely.<br><br>When we finally calmed down, we were breathing heavily and still holding onto each other hands. Feeling awkward, I immediately pulled my hands out of his and looked shyly down on the ground. I could feel heat slowly creeping up my cheeks. I must have looked at the ground for quite sometime, cause Wee Teck said:Â¡Â¨I didnÂ¡Â¦t know that the ground actually has the capability to hypnotize a person.Â¡Â¨<br><br>Upon hearing that, I burst out laughing and lifted my hand to slap Wee Teck on the arm. It was at this moment, he caught my hand and held it tightly in his and looked deeply into my eyes.<br><br>Â¡Â§Poh Choo, IÂ¡Â¦m not very good with words but thereÂ¡Â¦s something IÂ¡Â¦ve been wanting to tell you. During the exams period, I didnÂ¡Â¦t get to meet you at all. But images of you would float into my mind, your mesmerizing smile, the mischievous twinkle in your eyes; I even hear your voice in my sleep. The whole time I was so afraid youÂ¡Â¦ll forget about me because I know in this lifetime of mine, IÂ¡Â¦ll never be able to forget you. Will you be my girlfriend? Will you, Poh Choo?Â¡Â¨<br>Â¡Â§Ouch!Â¡Â¨<br>Â¡Â§Huh? What kind of answer is Â¡Â¥ouchÂ¡Â¦??Â¡Â¨<br>Â¡Â§Ouch, cause you are hurting my hand!Â¡Â¨<br>Â¡Â§Oh!Â¡Â¨ *Letting go off my hand* Â¡Â§IÂ¡Â¦m so sorry, Poh Choo. Are you ok?Â¡Â¨<br>Â¡Â§YesÂ¡K To both questions.Â¡Â¨<br>Â¡Â§What both questions? Are you sure you are alright?Â¡Â¨<br>Â¡Â§Yes, IÂ¡Â¦m fine. And YesÂ¡K to the first question you asked me just now.Â¡Â¨ ÂƒÂº<br>Â¡Â§The first quesÂ¡KÂ¡K REALLY?! You will? You will be my girlfriend?! I love you so much Poh Choo!Â¡Â¨<br>Â¡Â§Hahaaha, yes I will, Wee Teck. Cause I like you too.Â¡Â¨<br><br>We went to the hawker centre and celebrated the end of the A levels examinations and the beginning of our new found relationship on a bowl of our usual Â¡Â¥tau huayÂ¡Â¨.<br><br>Â¡Â§Uncle, why did you add so much sugar syrup in my Â¡Â¥tau huayÂ¡Â¦ today?Â¡Â¨<br>Â¡Â§Where got? ItÂ¡Â¦s the same lah. I always put the same amount of sugar syrup one. Hahaha, must be today got girlfriend already, thatÂ¡Â¦s why exceptionally sweet issit?Â¡Â¨<br><br></div>

The A level examinations results will be out today.  Despite Wee TeckÂ’s constant assurance since a week before, IÂ’m still as nervous as ever. Getting good results was the only ticket to university. Money wasnÂ’t enough in the family; Father had said mentioned that earlier.<br><br>Â“Ah Choo, you know we are not a well-off family. There isnÂ’t much money left for your siblingsÂ’ education if I send you to university. The only way is to get a scholarship. But from what I see, its best you stop studying and go find a job to lighten the family burden. Besides, I donÂ’t see why a girl has to study so much. In the end, youÂ’ll have to get married and have kids. You donÂ’t need a university degree to do that.Â”<br><br>Argh! How could Father say that? WhatÂ’s wrong with a girl going into university? He is such a male chauvinist! I donÂ’t plan to get married so soon anyway, let alone having children.<br><br>Miraculously, IÂ’ve gotten an A for Mathematics! But all the credit goes to my Wee Teck darling.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Without his patient coaching I would have done so well for my least favorite subject. However, my overall grades are not good enough for me to apply for a scholarship to study in university.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Probably itÂ’s fated that I wouldnÂ’t be able to carry on my education. It is just so unfair.<br><br>I was practically dragging myself to the National Library to meet Wee Teck. I stood under the willow tree, waiting for him, thinking about my future. God knows how desperately I want to get a degree, but nowÂ… with my results. ItÂ’s impossible. Guess itÂ’s time I find a job and like Father said, to help lighten the load.<br><br>Â“Hey lovely. Thinking about me?Â”<br>Â“A little. I was thinking of job hunting tomorrow. By the way, howÂ’s your result? Must be pretty good.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Â“<br>Â“Not really, but IÂ’ll make it into university though. IÂ’m sorry, my dear.Â”<br>Â“Huh? Sorry about what? ItÂ’s not your fault that I canÂ’t get into university. DonÂ’t worry, IÂ’m fine. IÂ’ll just get a job.Â”<br>Â“HmmÂ… IÂ’ll convince my parents to loan you the money set aside for my university fees. I wonÂ’t need it now since IÂ’ll still have to serve NS. IsnÂ’t that a great idea?Â”<br>Â“No, Wee Teck. I canÂ’t use the money for your education. ItÂ’s your parentsÂ’ hard earned money and I know they donÂ’t have much to spare either. Even if I really loan the money from them, I wonÂ’t be able to pay them back.Â”<br>Â“ButÂ…Â…Â”<br>Â“No butsÂ… IÂ’ll find a job as soon as possible.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">October 21st 1966</span></strong><br><br>ItÂ’s our first anniversary today. I canÂ’t believe IÂ’ve known Wee Teck for a year and to have been so lucky to meet such a wonderful guy. It just seemed like yesterday when I went to the National Library and saw my darling at the table studying. Being with Wee Teck and knowing him is the best thing which ever happened in my life.<br><br>I decided that every year on the day of our anniversary we should make it a point to visit the National Library together. After all, without the library, we wouldnÂ’t be together.<br><br>I was puzzled why Wee Teck fixed our anniversary on the 21st of October (we first met in the library) instead of 21st of December, when we first went steady.<br><br>Â“My dear Poh Choo, itÂ’s because I fell in love with you on the 21st of October and was already madly in love with you by the 21st of December.Â”<br><br>We spent the whole together at the library and had dinner at the hawker centre nearby. I understand that Wee Teck didnÂ’t get a lot of money while serving NS. But it didnÂ’t matter to me at all. As long as I was together with Wee Teck, the food didnÂ’t matter, the atmosphere didnÂ’t matter. Nothing mattered. Only Wee Teck mattered.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>October 21st 1968</strong></span><br><br>It has been raining non-stop today and itÂ’s my third anniversary with Wee Teck. He had arranged to celebrate our anniversary at the National Library once again. DoesnÂ’t he realize that itÂ’s boring to keep going to the library? In fact thereÂ’s nothing over there, only books and one lousy hawker centre beside it. Nothing captivating.<br><br>This year, he has hinted heÂ’ll be giving me a surprise once again. SighÂ… I wished it would be something good this time. Last yearÂ’s anniversary was a disaster.<br><br>The rain still didnÂ’t stop when I left the office and Choong Boon offered me a lift to the National Library. I gladly accepted his offer, because I donÂ’t want to be drenched from head to toe. I knew Choong Boon was interested in me, I could sense it. He would always treat us (the company employees) out for lunch, but at the table he would be more attentive to my needs. Always asking what I wanted to eat. He would bring us to many different high class restaurants to taste the different cuisine, recommending us what is delicious. With him, everything was an eye opener. And he owning a car was definitely a bonus. He would always offer me a ride home. Well, IÂ’m grateful for that as least I donÂ’t have to drag myself back everyday after work. But the best of all was, he was the big bossÂ’ son. HmmÂ… Perhaps giving Choong Boon a chance didnÂ’t seem like such a bad ideaÂ…<br><br>Â“Choong Boon, could you please wait here for me for a little while? IÂ’ll be back soon.Â”<br>Â“Ok sure.Â”<br><br>I alighted from the car, running towards the hawker centre, in the rain, in search of Wee Teck. There I see him sitting in front of the Â‘tau huayÂ’ stall, as usual. He was fiddling with something in his hand. When he saw me approaching, he quickly stuffed it into his shirt pocket and smiled brightly at me.<br><br>Â“Happy 3rd anniversary dear!  I canÂ’t believe we have been together for so long.Â”<br>Â“Yes, perhaps itÂ’s a little too longÂ…Â…Â”<br>Â“What makes you say that? WeÂ’ve still got a long way ahead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Are you feeling alright today? Feeling very stress at work? Perhaps I could accompany you for a short break over to Malaysia?Â”<br>Â“LetÂ’s break up, Wee Teck. IÂ’m sorry.Â”<br><br>Upon saying this, I left the table. Wthout turning back, i made my way back to Choong BoonÂ’s car.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>October 20th 1990</strong></span><br><br>ItÂ’s been years since I left Singapore, after I married Choong Boon and migrated to Australia. About a month ago, Choong Boon decided to come back to Singapore to relocate his main office here instead of Australia. He said Singapore is after all our home. Besides, weÂ’ll be closer to our family here.<br><br>WellÂ… so here I am with my family back in Singapore. Singapore has definitely changed a lot ever since we left. I could barely recognize the surroundings. Walking along Orchard Road was like a walk down memory lane.<br><br>Suddenly I saw a familiar figure walking towards meÂ… IÂ’m not sure if itÂ’s her. ItÂ’s been more than 20 years since I saw her. My gaze caught her eyes. And IÂ’m sure its Wee TengÂ… she didnÂ’t age much, still the tall, willowy Wee Teng.<br><br>Â“20 years huh, Wee Teng? ItÂ’s been 20 years since I last saw you. How have you been?Â”<br>Â“Oh my my, is that you, Poh Choo? It really has been a long time, more than 20 years. I heard you migrated to Australia many years ago.Â”<br>Â“Yes, but my family and I are back in Singapore for good. Choong Boon decided to relocate his business here. So how is Wee TecÂ…Â”<br><br>But my question was disrupted by a loud *HORN*<br>A young chap shouted from the car:Â”MOM! ItÂ’s a non-parking zone. Could you please hurry?Â”<br>Â“IÂ’m sorry Poh Choo. But I have to go nowÂ…Â…Â”<br>Â“Ok sure,Â” I said, as I quickly scribbled down my address and telephone number on a piece of paper. Â“HereÂ’s my address and number. Give me a call when you are free. Take care, Wee Teng. Bye.Â”<br><br>Seeing Wee Teng again, brought back memories of times with Wee Teck. Wee Teng looked so much like her brother, tall and both of them have those same sincere eyes. ItÂ’s been some time ever since I thought about Wee Teck, I wonder how is he doing now? HeÂ’s probably happily married, and has more than 4 children. I remembered he used to love children a lot, besides heÂ’s a natural with them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
