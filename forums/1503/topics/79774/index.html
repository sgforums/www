It's the society.. The outlook and down trend... Repeatedly mentioned that people of a certain age are often automatically selected to be out for jobs... These people can only depends on their children.. And those without children?<br><br>Just had a talk with a friend of mine who tried to commit suicide... Outlook in life is bad enough... Just a tiny 'push over' landed her where she is now... But with the kinda life we're generally leading now..? You work like a cow just to stay alive... Then you wait to die... You're not good enough you just get 'kicked out'... No wonder many have started to think that life is really aimless and meaningless... No wonder people with no firm strong mind just starts to die off...<br><br>Is this 'natural selection'? It's so saddening...</div>
