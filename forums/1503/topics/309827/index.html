              Aque lived in a deep, dark blue pond. And she was happy there. But what made her happier was the way the sunlight hit the surface of the water every single morning. They glistened and and rippled through the surface. Each time she swam to touch it, the crystals of light would shatter and dissolve into the waters.Aque knew that there was something more than just the deep, dark blue waters around her. There were those trinklets of light that were so elusive, within her reach and yet outside her grasp. Aque was certain that outside these waters, there was an entire world filled with these precious lights. She felt that only when she could see the light outside these waters would she have gained the most beautiful and meaningful thing in life.Aque told Seahorse of her wish, to leave the deep dark waters for the crystals. Seahorse never saw these crystals before, but was bought over by the beauty of it as well.<br><br>the following day, seahorse decided he had to take a peek at these gems of light. He swam and he swam to the surface. As he begun to feel faint, as he was too close to the surface, he finally saw the light rays streaming through the water. And there basking in the light was Aque. She was bathed in this aura of sunlight.<br><br>Seahorse never felt so contented in his life. Though the sight was short-lived, it was one never to be forgotten. He was glad that he could see those light rays, and that Aque fufilled her dreams of reaching the source of it.Little did he know, Aque had swam too close to the surface, for too long. The only way she could have reached the surface, was if she had died, and floated her way up.</div>
