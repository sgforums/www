            <div class='col-md body'>3 midget memories:<br><br>the stupid lil' kid is going up the escalator with his mother.On the right,from the escalator going in the opposite way, stupid lil' kid hears shouts of cheerful hellos, he sees another midget, he doesn't recognise him. The stupid lil' kid asks the mother who is that, the mother tells him its his friend... doesn't he remember? The escalator continues ascending, the jumping boisterous kid on the other side falls on the mechanical steps and starts bawling, the stupid lil' kid can't remember.<br><br>-----<br><br>the stupid lil' kid is sitting in the ballroom. theres a christmas party of sorts going on and somebody dressed as santa claus is coming in later. there are other midgets everywhere, the place is filled with christmas deco that someone has to clear up later.The stupid lil' kid is looking down at the table because the stupid lil' kid is alone -but not for long, some other brat comes and sits. The brat is with the parents, the parent fusses about its brat and then asks the stupid lil' kid, how old are you in standard pleasant condescending manner. The parent remarks to its brat, 'very small size'. The stupid lil' kid looks across the room. Later, santa claus,an old fraud starts handing out presents, the stupid lil' kid feels his package,a flat rectangle and can't imagine what it might be, but figures that its something special if its so enigmatic.<br>On the way home in the car, the stupid lil' kid opens his package and discovers a children's book of...a fairy tale with huge letters which he finishes reading in a minute.<br><br>-----<br><br>the stupid lil' kid is sitting in class. the class is dark,the projector is on and on it,is a transparency with a grammar exercise. The stupid lil' kid seems oblivious so the teacher calls him out. The kid comes back from the floating world and walks out slowly .Taking a marker from the teacher, the stupid lil kid approaches the machine and squinting at the incandescent glow he feels like he has just woken up. All eyes are on him, there is absolute silence in the classroom... he reads the question, "the class of pupils ____ reading in the library". Then answers without thought, 'is' . Like a rousing hive, the other midgets enter a droning chorus of 'nooooooo' almost before the teacher asks if the answer is correct. When the chorus fades away, the teacher delivers the grave news, the stupid lil kid standing by the projector,is correct. The stupid lil kid looks at the teacher. the teacher nods her head with an expression of obliging approval. the stupid lil' kid makes his way back to his seat right at the back feeling like he has cheated death. the lesson continues when he is seated.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He doesn't seem that stupid to me. I don't think he thinks himself as a kid which is why the others are referred to as midgets, strange squeaky midgets perhaps.<br><br>I can relate to the second tale. I remember when I was 10 or 11 when an aunt gave me this children's book with big letters and pictures.  I did finish it in a minute. It was almost insulting, did I look that stupid?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
