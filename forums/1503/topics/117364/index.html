THANK YOU.</span> </strong></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><img src="http://biomed.brown.edu/Medicine/BSOM/Button.gif"><br><span style="color: orange;"><strong>REFRESH BUTTON</strong></span><br><br><img src="http://www.john-bauer.com/movies.deadpoetssociety.jpg"><br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WELCOME TO DEAD POETS SOCIETY (SINGAPORE)</strong></span></span></span><br><br>After watching the movie Â‘Dead Poets SocietyÂ’ years ago, IÂ’ve always wanted to create my own Â‘Dead Poets SocietyÂ’, i.e. a place where poetry lover can gather and share their favourite poems and talk about their favourite poets. It is also a place where one can share his/her poems with each other.<br><br>I took up Literature during my Â‘OÂ’ level and Â‘AÂ’ level, but poetry was never my strong subject. Actually I hated it. But along the way, I slowly fell in love with the subject and there is no turning back.   Being a very emotional person, poetry helps me to express my feeling in a totally new way.   It helps me to see things differently and provides a channel to vent out my feelings, which could not be done by other means.  Personally, writing poems is a self-awareness process that helps me keep in touch with my inner self.<br><br>Poetry is really a blessing to mankind especially to introvert like me.  By saying that, I am not suggesting that one must be an introvert in order to experience the magic of poetry.  Instead one must lives to his/her fullest and is able to feel for his/her fellow beings to truly appreciate poetry.  One can be a good poet living in his/her own ivory tower, but to be a true poet (in my opinion) you have to mingle with the rest.<br><br>For me, I am neither a true or a good poet.  At most I can only considered myself a poet at heart.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Although I am not very good at writing poems, but I really enjoy reading them. So feel free to post your favourite poems or your own work here. Actually, not just poems, short stories, and other topics are most welcome.<br><br>In DPS (S), we are not that concerned with the technical details of poetry writing. As long as you are able to express yourself clearly, get your message across to your readers, you are okay. On the other hand feel free to explore the technical aspects of poetry.  Read on meter, metaphors, sonnets, etc. Explore new ways to reach new height.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Please understand that DPS (S) is not a workshop forum but purely a posting forum.</span></strong><br><br>I usually donÂ’t criticize the poems posted here.  In fact I am not really qualify to criticize your poems.  But if I think it is really bad, I will pm you directly with some suggestions or I might suggest some slight amendments in the thread.   Words are like fire, it brings light but it burns too.<br><br>A completed poem is like a baby to the poet, it is a product of efforts and love. It is a mirror of his/her inner soul.  You must treat it with respect no matter how Â‘badÂ’ you think it is.  On the other hand, since you want to share your poems with others, it is also your responsible to make sure that you convey the messages clearly.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Be thankful to the readers for taking the time and efforts to read your poems.</span></strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Do feel free to comment on the poems posted here.  Actually you are strongly encouraged to do so.</strong></span><br><br>This privilege does not belong to just the moderators, it belongs to every one of you.  To be exact, you are part of the DPS (S) team.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I believe in freedom of speech and expression, but do keep in mind such freedom comes with responsibilities.  It is very easy to offend somebody in todayÂ’s modern society; a harmless stare may even cost your life.  To make matter worse, written form of communications such as forums lack the presence of body languages, which is crucial in effective communication.  Miscommunications and misunderstandings are expected in Internet Forums.  Unless it is really very serious, do Â‘shake handsÂ’ and let it go.<br><br>However there are some things that will not be tolerated in this forum.<br><br><span style="color: red;"> <strong>They are vulgar or profane material, vulgarities, materials that intended to convey hate towards others, threats and pornographic materials, etc.</strong> </span><br><br>Please do not post them here.  Thank you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Lastly, authors of poems/stories submitted here maintain ownership and copyright of the material.  It is presumed that when a poet/writer submitted his/her poems/stories here, it is his/her own work.  If they are from other poets/writers i.e. in the case of sharing your favourite poems with the rest of us, please indicate the name of the original author in the post.<br><br>Thanks for reading such a long introduction.  Have fun and happy writing!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong><span style="color: olive;">Writer-centered poems are most welcome here.  However I am also dying to read some reader-centered poems.</span> </strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Important: If you want other to comment on your poems, please indicate it in your posting.  When you take, you need to give. So please remember to provide feedback to otherÂ’s poems too.</strong></span><span class="large"></span></div>

This is a good thing and I strongly encourage you to pick up your pen and draft your first poem.<br><br>At this stage, the focus of the poems is about Â‘selfÂ’ in the highly ambiguous term Â‘self-expressionÂ’.  These poems are mainly about Â‘this is how I feelÂ’, Â‘this is what I didÂ’, etc. i.e. about Â‘meÂ’, my experiences, my emotions and my feelings.<br><br>Such writes usually received praises from friends, family members, and colleagues.  I am not surprise if these poems also receive very positive comments in some poetry forums.  Some of my works were highly praised in other oversea poetry forums. But I am not so sure about that now.<br><br>It is absolutely fine to stop at this stage. Most of us do that.<br><br>However some of you might want to take your poetry further, i.e. to explore the Â‘expressionÂ’ portion.  To express something efficiently, you need to learn the necessary skills.  Be it learning how to cook, dance, sing, and yes, also in the craft of writing poetry.  In reality, learning the correct skills is especially important in poetry writing.<br><br>For these small group of people the shift is towards a reader-centered writing style.  I am presently working toward this direction.  I am working towards writing poems that, hopefully, are able to create experiences for you, the reader. And for me to do that, I need to take many factors into considerations, i.e. linkbreaks, meter, abstract/concrete, clichÃ©s, rhythm, grammar, spelling, etc.<br><br>I am not saying that those poems that I've written were bad poems.  But the truth is they could be improved.  For example, you wrote a love poem based on your experience.  But remember, there are millions of love poems out here.  The only thing unique about the one that you have written is because it is your experience and you don't really care what other people think about it.  But wouldn't it be great to write love poems (also based on your experience) that stand out from the rest?<br><br>For example take this poem written by me years ago.  Is it special to you? No. But it is a very special poem to me. It is for my first love.  But it is just another love poem to the readers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong>Just for You</strong><br><br><strong>Life is full of Joys and Pains,<br>In every heart a dream remain,<br>Should sad memories ever haunt your mind,<br>Always remember I'm by your side.<br><br>Believe in yourself, have Faith in God,<br>Over the mountains against all odds,<br>Every sunrise is a bright new day,<br>Yesterday's tears will never stay.</strong><br><br>You need to write poems that mean something to the readers if you want to reach a wider audiences.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is no Internet workshop forum in Singapore.  Creative writing workshop is also rare in this country. I have to teach myself poetry by reading books on poetry and from the handful of overseas critical workshop forums in the Internet.<br><br>So the question is which part of the term Â‘self-expressionÂ’ do you wish to focus on? For me, I am going back to kindergarten in poetry writing, back to basic, start all over again.  (IÂ’ve deleted all my poems)<br><br>P.S.: This is just me hor.  Please continue to feel free to post your poems here.  It is so difficult to find someone who writes poems in this country.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

You are trying to provide feedback to the author that will be useful in helping the author understand what works and what doesn't work in the poem.<br><br>2. Try to find something specific that you like in the poem - a specific image, possibly an imaginative word choice. Tell the author what it was. This is far more helpful than saying "I really like this."<br><br>3. If you find something you don't understand, ask the author what was meant. It's helpful to an author to know where his or her audience is confused.<br><br>4. If you find something specific that you don't like, identify it and tell the author why you didn't like it.<br><br>5. If you read a poem and find that it is filled with spelling and punctuation errors, don't spend time on it. The author, by not preparing the poem to be read,is showing that he or she does not value your time. Why should you think the author would value your opinion in this situation?<br><br>As you read more, you will begin to form a richer idea of what constitutes "good poetry." This, in turn, will make your comments more valuable to the authors.<br><br>You won't be able to improve your reviewing skills unless you actually write reviews.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Want to try this out on the poems posted here?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

They are stiff-necked impostors on guard duty in your writing room.  They are cynics, failures of the imagination; they envy your successes; they want you to fail.  They hope writing won't delight you, that you won't discover exciting images and details that will delight your readers.  They know Robert Frost was right: "No surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader."  Abstractions don't want you to move your readers.  Abstractions are your captors, and they work without pay, because they hate poems.  They hope you'll lose faith in yourself; they want you to quit writing, and let them sleep.<br><br>Resist abstractions, and they will flee from you.  Writers that I admire believe Pound's warning about abstractions and try to write vividly.  The best writers remember this, and they never ease up on themselves.  They work always on basics, harder than when they began.  They don't throttle back and cruise, but constantly push the envelope.  Like Twain, they try to "find the right word, not its second cousin."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://www.everypoet.org/pffa/showthread.php?t=9935" rel="nofollow">Poetry is Experience: The Writer's Responsibility</a><br>(From Poetry Free-for-all, Blurbs of Wisdom)<br><br><strong>Extract</strong><br><br>"A reader comes to a poem for one reason: she wants to experience something herself, to feel something herself.

That means that poems specifically about emotions often end up full of abstractions. Also, if the poem concentrates purely on the emotional response of the poet, often the result is a poem with nothing of the lover in it at all. A loved one is reduced to nothing but a gush of happiness on the part of the poet; all the things that make them special Â– the way their skin smells, their lilting accent, the way they take their tea, the curve of their buttocks in their scruffy jeans, their moodiness in the morning Â– has all vanished. This is what I mean by 'generalities'. All the interesting specifics are gone.

The benefit to the writer is that he or she is given a means to express feelings that need release before they become overwhelming. The event of writing provides for some degree of introspection and may act to put the current problems into a larger perspective, or even trigger action to overcome them. It's not unusual to see author's comments that say, in effect, "I had to let this out before it kills me.

Regular punctuation is a part of regular sentence structure, that is, of the expression of completed thoughts; and this expression is typical of prose, even though prose is not at all times bound by its logic. But in poems one has the opportunity not only, as in expressive prose, to depart from the syntactic norm, but to make manifest, by an intrinsic structural means, the interplay or counterpoint of process and completion--in other words, to present the dynamics of perception along with its arrival at full expression.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://ndnd.essortment.com/poetrywrite_rzlr.htm" rel="nofollow">How to write good poetry</a> by Carol Tilley-Williams<br><br><strong>Extract </strong><br><br>When a poem is brought to any public forum it immediately invites reader participation. Yet, so often I hear comments like, "but I write for myselfÂ….poetry should come from the heartÂ…if it's heartfelt it is poetryÂ…" and so on. It is difficult to argue the point that poetry should start at some place of zeal within each writer; however, the operative word here is "start." Writing down raw emotions,simply because they are genuine, does this qualify them as poetry? I believe this is merely a starting place, the seed if you will, of a poem. The verve - the true poem - is yet to come.<br></div>

The sniper is shown carefully aiming his rife but all we see of Paul is his hand stretching out to try and touch a butterfly that has come to rest. We recognize it as PaulÂ’s hand because we already know he is a butterfly collector, and, because of the sniper, watch it stretching farther in anxious suspense.  Then there is a shot, the hand jerks, slowly drops, and lies still. PaulÂ’s death is as vivid as if we had seen a full picture of him dying.<br><br>The rife, the hand, the butterfly Â– these are the kind of images the poet also uses.

Poetry may be in verse, and often does use some kind of verselike structure. Many poets, for example, have been attracted by the shape of the sonnet, which arranges rhythms and rhymes in a definite formation. But the sonnet in itself is only a verse-form; a sonnet may be poetry or it may no.<br><br>Poetry is not poetry because it is in verse; to the shape of verse it has to add qualities of imagination and emotion and of language itself.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Poems are made out of words, the right words.</strong></span><br><br>The painter Edgar Degas, not content with doing his graceful paintings of dancing girls, also wanted to write poems.  Finding the literary work difficult, he complained to his friend, the celebrated poet MallarmÃ©, that he could not seem to write well, although he was Â“full of ideas.Â” MallarmÃ©Â’s famous answer was: Â‘My dear Degas, poems are not made out of ideas; theyÂ’re made out of words.Â”<br><br>The best ideas, even though they turn into images, are of no avail as poems unless the words are right Â– just as a statue of even the noblest subject is a failure if the wood cracks or the marble shatters.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>On adjectives and adverbs</strong></span><br><br>Some parts of speech are more necessary than others. Nouns and verbs are the most important, the most existential Â– nouns referring to the forms that being can take, verbs to their activity.<br><br>Adjectives and adverbs are hangers-on, with little independent existence of their own. Used weakly, they are decorative rather than structural, hence attractive to the apprentice writer, who needs surface decoration to cover up the architectural flaws.<br><br>In his writings on style, Pound constantly warns against adjectives.  Perhaps nothing so weakens a poem as to have the nouns Â“chaperonedÂ” (as Pound said) by adjectives, or the verbs by adverbs.<br><br>What we have been saying about modifiers is a caution, not a rule. Adjectives and adverbs tend to run to fat, to be sagging appendages on the bone and muscle of poetry.  But just as we need some fat for the health and contour of the body, so we need some adjectives in poetry: for precision, for luxuriance, sometimes even for a needed of muchness.<br><br>The most useless adjectives duplicate the meaning of their nouns, or express a quality implied by it. We have no need of them in such expression as<br><br>celestial stars<br>fragrant flower<br>vernal spring<br>deep abyss<br>empty chasm<br>cold winter sun<br>flaming pyre<br>fair beauty<br>soft whispers<br>sweet perfume<br>loud strife<br>bleak waste<br>stimulating wine<br>dark forebodings<br>nobly enshrined<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Inspiration</strong></span></span><br><br>The ratio between inspiration and deliberate effort differs in different artists. Music came easily to Mozart, but not to Beethoven, who had to jot down his ideas, rework them again and again, sometimes completing a theme twenty-five years after the idea for it struck him. His way of composing compared with MozartÂ’s was stodgy and plodding, but the music that resulted was no less Â“inspired.Â”<br><br>So too with poets. Some work rapidly, some slowly. The number of flashes of inspiration that go into the process may have little to do with the quality of the poem that results.  Frost considered unfinished one poem he had begun to work on fourteen years before; he left another Â“lying around namelessÂ” for forty years because he could not find a fourth line that suited him.<br><br>It should be stressed again that our inspirations are as specialized as our minds are.  If our whole bent is toward Romance philology or football strategy, we will not come up with inspirations in the field of economic theory. Inspirations follow common-sense rules: We get only the inspirations we are qualified to receive.  And unless we have laid the groundwork by conscious planning and hard work, there is no inspiration to be hoped for.<br><br>Â“Chance,Â” said Pasteur, Â“favors the prepared mind.Â” Poets have to condition their minds to produce and handle inspirations. If they have a vocabulary of only a few hundred words, the unconscious has very little to work with.  If they have taken little notice of the world around, their minds will suffer from a poverty of images. If they have not read other poets, they will not know then they are original and when they are not Â– as if a young physicist, scorning the achievements of the past, were to spend his time reinventing the wheel.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Their own emotions!</strong></span></span><br><br>There are literary aspirants who think that the strength of their own emotions is enough to invigorate the poems they write. Â“But I felt it so strongly! So sincerely! It came from my heart!Â” they are likely to protest when the worth of their work is questioned.<br><br>Unfortunately their own feelings are beside the point.<br><br>Readers are not mind readers or heart reader; they will feel only what the words and rhythms tell them to. Genuine feeling guarantees nothing. Â“All bad art,Â” said Oscar Wilde, Â“springs from genuine feelingÂ” Â– genuine feeling, that is, which the artist does not have the skill, the technique, to put on canvas, to show in stone, or to embody in a passionate work of words.<br><br>Significant emotion, as T.S. Eliot said, is that Â“which has its life in the poem and not in the history of the poet.Â” Our expression of an emotion may be so clichÃ©d, so incoherent, so fulsome as to be wholly inadequate to what we really feel, or think we feel.<br><br>The Russian poet Bella Akhmadulina has warned us about this: When struck by what seems a brilliant inspiration, she admitted in an interview, she immediately grew distrustful of it, was careful Â“not to confuse the intensity of the feeling with the worth of what IÂ’ve written.Â”<br><br>The two are not the same, much as some apprentice writers wish they were.  Often when we are carried away by what seems the inspired quality of any work of art, we forget that only technique enabled the artist to share those raptures with us.  The dancer Rudolf Nureyev seemed  Â“wild and spontaneousÂ’Â” when dancing Â“Swan LakeÂ” with Margot Fonteyn, yet, as Miss Fonteyn tells us in her Autobiography, Â“It was paradoxical that the young boy everyone thought so wild and spontaneous in his dancing cared desperately about techniques.Â”<br><br>Technique is how we communicate passion in the arts Â– but we need hardly say that passion has to be there to begin with.<br><br></div>

I read the reviews and ordered the book for my 14 year old who loves to write poetry- thinking the reviews made it sound perfect. The content does include adult topics, sexual language, and some language. Just thought others may find this helpful to know. I sent it back, as it was not appropriate for my daughter<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The best there is...<br><br>I have read a large number of poetry textbooks, workbooks, courses, and reference books, and this book is the best I have ever read on the subject.

We seriously doubt it."<br><br>Being, at times, a very fast poet, I *gasped* when I read that assertion! (Don't ask me how I got to page 225 before I read the rest of the book but nonetheless, it stuck out to me!)<br><br>I kept at it, though, and found my way through the original assessment and into many of the glorious exercises, the truth in words that I so resonate with such as "We don't believe in writer's block. We believe there are times when you are empty and times when you are full."<br><br>The section on Metrical poetry is truly magical - I enjoyed learning about how Free-Verse as a form blossomed as well.<br><br>There are also many, many valuable resources in the appendices such as Books on Poetry and Writing, Finding Markets for Your Poetry and More Resources for Writers.<br><br>Finally, this book is chock full of exercises so that you can continue picking it up and revisit, use, revisit, use some more, revisit over and over again. Definitely worth the investment AND I am so glad I didn't toss it all because of one difference in opinion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Is that really a poem?</strong></span></span> by Gilbert Koh<br><br><strong>"The unexamined life is not worth living." - Socrates.</strong><br><br>He could very well have added that the unexamined poem is also not worth writing. I think that every poet, at one time or another, has had the following experience -<br><br>he writes, and he writes, working for hours on a new piece of writing. At the end of all that labour, he scrutinises the paper before him. Doubt creeps in, and he asks himself, "Is that really a poem?"<br><br>It's a good question, of course. And in answering it, I have my personal criteria. To me, none of my poems is a poem unless I have, in the course of writing it, scrutinised some aspect of my own beliefs, thoughts or experiences, seriously challenged and engaged myself, and walked away with some new, personal insight.<br><br>Otherwise, what I've written is probably just a collection of clever words. Like a slick new ad. Or a politician's speech. But not a poem.<br><br>If you are in the habit of writing clever words without seriously engaging yourself, well, do feel free to congratulate yourself for being clever. But don't mistake yourself for a poet. If you don't take a risk and challenge yourself, what you produce is unlikely to be a genuine poem.<br><br><strong>DP said Â…</strong><br><br>Sorry Gilbert, but can you kindly elaborate on this? I have read it several times but I am still not sure what you are trying to say here. I mean, is it necessary that a poem must always provide one with new, personal insight?<br><br><strong>Gilbert said Â…</strong><br><br>That's how I think about poems (whether I'm reading or writing them). A poem has to show me something that I wasn't aware of; or it has to show me something that I was aware of, but in a way I'd never thought of before.  If I don't discover anything new in a poem, then it doesn't work for me. It's not a poem to me.<br><br>An extreme negative example of what I mean is the abundance of teenage angst "poetry" in blogosphere. You get plenty of cheesy lines like:<br><br>"I loved you with all my soul, but you walked out of my life. My heart is forever broken into a million pieces ..."<br><br>I have no doubt that the emotion is authentic (we were all teenagers once upon a time, weren't we?). But these kinds of lines don't present anything original, insightful or perceptive. There are probably thousands of teenagers who put these same kinds of lines out onto the internet every day.<br><br>It could be cathartic for them, but it isn't poetry to me. More specifically to your question, yes, I always get some new insight out of writing my own poems (ie those works which I actually dare call "poems" ).<br><br>When I start writing a poem, I hardly ever know what the finished product is going to look like. Usually I have two or three lines floating in my head; or some visual image that I want to capture in words (eg old man walking with grandson on the beach - you know which poem I'm referring to).<br><br>As I start to put the lines down, the process which I called "self-engagement" begins quite apart from solving technical problems like flow, structure, choice of image, I have to start asking myself questions like -<br><br>do I have really have anything to say here? Why is this important? Why should I bother to write this poem?<br><br>... and depending on the subject matter, the engagement can be much more specific:<br><br>How do I feel about my father growing old? How much time has he got left? Is he afraid? How do I feel about it? What kind of father am I to my own son? Isn't it strange that one day I will be an old man too? Etc.<br><br>And the process of examining my own thoughts and feelings about the topic leads me to create what I hope can authentically be called a poem.<br><br></div>
