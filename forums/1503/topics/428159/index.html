              <p>It must be the pre-General Election fever that’s suddenly stimulated my 
              already over-active imagination to come up with this little tale. I do 
              hope it will afford some comic relief from the pre-GE angst that seems 
              to be increasing by the day!</p>
              <p>The Party is in a panic. A week before the General Elections, all the
               signs point to overwhelming support for the Opposition, and a shocking 
              loss of seats for the Party in Parliament.</p>
              <p>‘What shall we do?’ asks Minister-in-Chief. ‘We’ve never seen this sort of thing before.’</p>
              <p>‘I have an idea,’ says Assistant Minister Number One.</p>
              <p>‘We’ll instill <em>fear</em> in the people. Fear is the strongest emotion. It always works.’</p>
              <p>‘How do you propose to do that?’ asks Assistant Minister Number Two.</p>
              <p>‘Here’s how. Announce that the Party has foiled a terrorist plot to 
              destroy the society completely. Not by bombs, but by something more 
              deadly. <em>Biological</em> weapons. If the Party had not caught the 
              plotters in time, every man, woman and child would be dead, or blinded, 
              crippled and rendered sterile for life. Make the announcement just a day
               before voting day, and watch the people rush to cast gratitude votes 
              for the Party!’</p>
              <p>The meeting turns to see the reaction of Minister Advisor Supremo who
               is sitting at the far end of the table. He is shaking his head, in 
              obvious contempt of the proposal.</p>
              <p>‘With due respect to Number One, fear is NOT the most powerful emotion,’ says Number Two. ‘You know what is? <em>Greed</em>.
               Why don’t we do this. Announce tomorrow that if the Party wins, 
              everyone’s pocket will bulge with cash. From our vast reserves. Watch 
              the people’s eyes gleam with the dollar sign, listen to the clicking 
              calculators inside their heads as they decide on how much to spend on 
              upgrading their apartments or taking the family on a vacation in 
              Europe!’</p>
              <p>Minister Advisor Supremo coughs to draw attention to the look of disdain on his face that says, ‘How idiotic can you all get!’</p>
              <p>‘Fear. Greed. There’s a third emotion that is far more powerful than 
              either of these two.’ Everyone turns to look at Assistant Minister 
              Number Three who says very slowly, ‘<em>Sympathy</em>. That’s what it is.’</p>
              <p>‘Sympathy?’ echoes Number One, frowning. ‘ What do you mean?’</p>
              <p>‘Sympathy? Have you gone all soft or what?’ says Number Two with a look of disgust.</p>
              <p>‘Let’s talk seriously, we don’t have time to lose,’ says Minister-in-Chief wearily.</p>
              <p>‘Never under-rate this emotion in a crowd,’ explains Number Three 
              patiently. ‘When people are swayed by it, they are like putty in your 
              hands. They will give every single vote to the Party!’</p>
              <p>‘And, pray, how do you propose to whip up this marvellous sympathy 
              for the Party among the thousands of people who are getting ready to 
              vote for the Opposition?’</p>
              <p>‘Easy,’ says Number Three, enjoying the attention he’s getting. ‘An 
              assassination. Or rather, an assassination attempt. On no less than 
              Minister-in-Chief.’</p>
              <p>‘<em>What</em>?’</p>
              <p>‘A single shot from someone in the crowd, as Chief is doing his 
              campaign walkabout.  Screams. Pandemonium. The assassin is  caught as he
               tries to get away. Chief is on the ground bleeding profusely. Mrs Chief
               is kneeling beside his body, sobbing. The moment is captured by the TV 
              cameras and flashed all over the world. The people are in deep shock. 
              They keep asking, ‘How can this happen? How seriously hurt is Chief? 
              Will he die?’ The least they can do is vote for his party.’</p>
              <p>‘Our best marksman—do you think he is expert enough to do the job, 
              that is, wound Chief only slightly, say, in the arm or thigh? Suppose he
               misses his mark?’</p>
              <p>‘Maybe Chief can wear a bulletproof vest—it won’t show under his shirt.’</p>
              <p>‘What do you say, Chief?’</p>
              <p>‘Well, I’m ready to go along if it’s for the good of the Party. But are you sure this sympathy thing will work?’</p>
              <p>‘It’s been tried before in some countries, and apparently works quite
               well,’ says Number Three, gratified that his idea is catching on. ‘We 
              can count on the women. The tears will be streaming down their faces, 
              and they will make their men cast sympathy votes too.’</p>
              <p>Now everyone turns to look at Minister Advisor Supremo who suddenly 
              stands up. By now the look of scorn and rage on his face is fearful to 
              behold. He glares at every face turned anxiously towards him, and says, 
              ‘Can’t I make you understand after all these years of advising you? 
              Isn’t it obvious that the best thing to do is to send in the army?’</p>
