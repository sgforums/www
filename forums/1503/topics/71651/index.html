Â‘We mothers are so proud<br>Of our dead soldiers.Â’ Then her face was bowed.<br><br>Quietly the Brother Officer went out,<br>HeÂ’d told the poor old dear some gallant lies<br>That she would nourish all her days, no doubt.<br>For while he coughed and mumbled, her weak eyes<br>Had shone with gentle triumph, brimmed with joy,<br>Because heÂ’d been so brave, her glorious boy.<br><br>He thought how Â‘JackÂ’, cold-footed, useless swine<br>Had panicked down the trench that night the mine<br>Went up at Wicked Corner; how heÂ’d tried<br>To get sent home, and how, at last, he died,<br>Blown to small bits. And no one seemed to care<br>Expect that lonely woman with white hair.<br><br><strong>Siegfried Sassoon</strong><br><br>Â‘War is a painful thing to a mother when her son is killed fighting in it. But the pain is lessened when she knows that he dies a heroÂ’s death.  Her pride in him overcomes her sorrow.  In this poem, the mother receives a letter about her son, Jack, a soldier who has been killed.  The letter is from her sonÂ’s commanding officer. She is filled with pride about the heroic way her Jack has died. But that is not the truth. She has been spared the truth which would probably be more painful to her than her sonÂ’s death itself.Â’<br><br><strong>Federal Anthology of Poetry 2</strong><br><br><strong>My comments:  </strong><br><br>A mother knows her son best.  Since she is so convince that her son died a heroic death, there is a high chance that Jack was not as cowardly as he was described by the author.<br><br>I am also very uncomfortable of the very harsh words used to describe Jack.  He was called a Â‘useless swineÂ’, and was Â‘blown to small bitsÂ’ and Â‘no one seemed to careÂ’. Maybe that is the reality of war, but it seems that the author canÂ’t wait for Jack to die, Â‘and how, at last, he died,Â’<br><br>I think this author is a bit too harsh.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

I also see your point.  But although the author have the right to be angry, (for whatever reasons) but to call a dead person a swine is still a bit too harsh for me.<br><br>Same here, I also prefer the 2nd stanza.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
