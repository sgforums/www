What I'm saying is, no matter how well your situation may turn out to be, no matter how fortunate you may be, there will always be those who turn out better than you.<br><br>One day, when I was in Kanchanaburi, Thailand on a training exercise I found some graffiti on a cupboard. It was anonymously written, of course (who on earth would ever admit to defacing SAF property?). Written in a humourous vein, it talked about the chronicles of some commandos on a training exercise at Kanchanaburi.<br><br>That got me thinking.<br><br>I don't often write about humour.<br><br>I decided to write a simplistic poem in a humorous vein.<br><br>I came up with the following:<br><br>Greener On The Other Side<br><br>We jump from planes and into the air<br>We rise from the swamps and hit whatever's there<br>We smile and stand tall as we proudly say<br>We are the Commandos of the red beret<br><br>We slide down ropes from hovering choppers<br>We slice and dice 'em from light strike rovers<br>We mock them commandos as we proudly say<br>We are the Guardsmen of the khaki beret<br><br>We walk long distances in heavy battle gear<br>We just do things even when orders aren't clear<br>We curse those guardsmen, let's throw them away<br>We are the Infantry of the green beret<br><br>We blast shells into the air and smack them into the ground<br>We annihilate whoever has the misfortune of being around<br>We laugh at them all; at the sight of us they run away<br>We are the Artillery of the blue beret<br><br>We carry pink cards and they call us 'mister'.<br>We have heads full of hair; there's no need for the barber<br>We tease those NSFs who don't have the right to say<br>We are the civillians with no beret. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
