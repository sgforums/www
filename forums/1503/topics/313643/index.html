              </span></p><p><em><strong>1</strong></em><em><strong>st</strong></em><em><strong> Fall<br>Retreat</strong></em></p>
              <p>Night
              filled the skies with glorious snow whilst the ground stained variant
              shades of crimson; humans’, and the unknowns’. Heavy footsteps were
              heard while silent drippings of life left a trail of red behind; two
              beings were obviously on the run. Even though through the chilly, snowy
              weather the climate was, it barely faze the duo; they were too
              pre-occupied with one objective on their mind.</p>
              <p>“<em>Escape, as far as we can. The battle was futile; we’re on the run, from ‘that’.”</em></p>
              <p>The
              one who only had a few bruises and scratches stood a woman in her late
              twenties. She possessed long silver hair that was left loose, with its
              ends near her hips. Grey were her eyes, and as by far the amount of
              moonlight it had produced as lighting, she has a rather smooth
              complexion… and an old wound that kept ripping open on her midriff if
              left alone. Several belts bonded the grievous gash, just enough to
              prevent it from opening again. Even though she had initially wore a
              black dress over the belts, an unbuttoned overcoat that runs all the
              way to her ankles, and canvas shoes, all was left on her clothing after
              the ambush was…</p>
              <p>Her black dress now reminded her of a nightgown,
              while her brown, leather overcoat had several rips and shreds here and
              there, yet still functional to warm her body up. Her shoes were still
              intact, but the tightness it usually had, had broken down, now a more
              comfortable one. Her right hand held a katzbalger, while over her left
              arm was her only surviving comrade, who needed support to stand. Unlike
              the said woman, her companion had inflicted more damage; her arms were
              dominantly covered with scratches while some deeper gashes were spotted
              near the elbows and wrists. Not only that, her torso had, too, received
              about the same damage as to her arms. However, it was her legs that had
              taken the most harm- the petite structure stumbled even on the said
              woman’s support.</p>
              <p>“Tessa!” said the woman with silver hair with a tone of panic.</p>
              <p>“This
              is nothing,” Tessa replied with a twinge of pain in her voice,
              regarding about the wounds she had. “This is just nothing, Raquel.”</p>
              <p>Tessa,
              Raquel’s only ally left, stood about seven centimetres shorter than the
              grey eyed 1.72 metre woman. Her hair was of natural orange blonde that
              runs down all the way to her busts. Streaks of grey and maroon were her
              eyes that were often seen in a rather deadpan manner. Her clothing was
              of a brown leather shirt and long grey skirt that was of cotton while
              an overcoat about the same as Raquel was worn over, unbuttoned, and
              rather starched. Her shoes were of the same material as her comrade’s,
              but had a bit more elegance to the style. However, due to the recent
              ambush, the blonde’s clothing were much in the same condition as
              Raquel’s.</p>
              <p>The snow marked their trails, obviously a bad sign that
              they would be tracked down easily. The taller woman, knowing the
              increasing danger considering that they were in the hotspot, carried
              the petite Tessa in her arms while increasing her pace from a walk, to
              a constant jog. The soft snow beneath her footwear somehow bogged her
              speed down, as more pressure was applied onto the ground. She took
              wider steps to counter the problem; it did not help much- a rustle
              behind her was heard.</p>
              <p>Raquel kept looking on straight, not
              wanting to know what was lurking behind her. The said rustle soon
              turned to a crumple, most probably had stepped on fallen tree branches.
              Raquel’s fear kicked in; in desperation, as much as she could, she
              scrambled down the path before kicking herself away from it after
              spotting a fissure in a boulder, big enough for two of them to enter.
              The hard, rocky surface of the stone made more scratch marks onto her
              arms, but she did not care; it was her life and Tessa’s that concerned
              most.</p>
              <p>Grey eyes shut tightly while her arms held tightly towards
              her injured comrade. The crumple that she had heard earlier on had
              ceased much too long ago for her. She had expected another form of
              sound, signaling that ‘it’ had came nearer. Nothing; just an eerie
              silence that was enough to pump in dread into her mind. Raquel glanced
              at the woman she carried; her condition seemed to have worsened
              compared to the time when they escaped from the assault. Tessa’s
              breaths were heavier than usual; her blood loss might be the cause of
              it-.</p>
              <p>A hard thud was heard. Raquel jolted at the sudden noise.
              She paused while Tessa was pre-occupied with her injuries. The taller
              lady froze for a moment before she scrambled out of the fissure. A
              powerful crack ensued, this time ripping though the boulder, leaving
              simply rubble. There it was, thought Raquel. It was that… ‘thing’ that
              was after them. It was often in the shadows, revealing little of its
              features. All Raquel and Tessa knew; that the ‘beast’ was thrice as big
              as Raquel, and had maniacal strength to even rip a human body apart.
              The silver haired woman panicked, most obviously frightened by the
              sight as she scrambled away from it through the forest, weaving through
              the maze of trees to minimize falling victim from ‘that’.</p>
              <p>Constant
              thuds were heard behind her; obviously that the ‘beast’ was after them.
              They had started out the battle with forty-seven to dealt with the
              ‘beasts’ after losing some three lives while on the journey to the
              north. However, even though outnumbering the ‘beasts’ by several-fold,
              only two of three were killed, at the cost of forty-five lives. And
              both Tessa and Raquel are the remaining two that were still alive. It
              was as if they were sent on a suicide mission without notice. A hard
              thrust sent them stumbling to the ground, with the petite lass a
              distance away from the other being. A seemingly growl ensued, before
              sending a hard sweep into the taller lady’s torso. An audible gasp left
              her mouth before a trail of crimson followed suit, staining the
              innocent white snow. Raquel was barely fit to even attack, but compared
              to Tessa; the blonde was literally unable to fight at all, considering
              that she had lost her broadsword back at the ambush site.</p>
              <p>However,
              being too pre-occupied with the thought that ran though her mind, the
              silver haired lass had not realized the ‘beast’ had initiated an
              assault… to her comrade. A cold blast of wind blew into her face with
              such ferocity, as if signaling Raquel to run away, selfishly leaving
              her only ally alone, vulnerable to any assault. Her right arm shadowed
              over her eyes, allowing her to see what was in front of her, if she
              could make out the figures from the constant obstructions by the
              falling snow-. A cry rang into her ears; Tessa’s. Several forms of
              blood splattering were heard, wringing Raquel’s heart. Desperation
              kicked in; grasping her blade with haste, she dashed aimlessly through
              the heavy snowfall, initiating a clumsy overhead strike to the bigger
              being.</p>
              <p>“Leave my ally alone!” she wailed, as her eyes were blinded by the white, cold fragments of frozen water. “Leave us alone!”</p>
              <p>Even
              though she was attacking ever so aimlessly, Raquel’s attempts did
              manage to leave a wound or two onto ‘it’, making it toss the petite
              woman aside while retreating through the snowstorm. The silver haired
              woman went on with that stint for the next few moments before she
              ceased when she lost balance, and hit the ground with an audible thud.
              Her mind was filled with concern over her only ally- no, her only
              friend at this time. Without any care of standing up, she crawled her
              way towards the gasping Tessa, who seemed to be on her last legs before
              death. The blonde had inflicted heavy damage; the left side of her
              torso had skin hanging by the sides, leaving much of her wound open.
              Grey-maroon eyes gazed at Raquel blankly, as if wanting to simply her
              face before passing on. But the taller lass had other ideas; ripping a
              portion of her black dress, she bounded the petite woman’s midriff,
              reducing the amount of bleeding.</p>
              <p>With haste, she then got to her
              feet, while carrying the said lady in her arms. Still determined to
              escape from the dreaded ‘beast’, Raquel began dashing her way through
              the labyrinth of naked trees, though without a proper direction. They
              could not tell whether they were heading back South, or deeper into
              North. Raquel’s mind wandered. It was obvious; the sudden assault to
              her torso by that ‘thing’ somehow managed to affect her mind. Her
              vision was shifting, one moment she would see only bright light, while
              the next, pitch black darkness. Drool left her mouth, her body gave
              way. Raquel’s balance went offset as she careened for the downward
              sloped ground.</p>
              <p>However, landing onto such a steep decline, it
              only caused the duo to slide downwards; looking like dolls, before all
              the duo could see was just thick fog beneath them. They knew what had
              occurred…</p>
              <p>…They had just gone over the edge of a cliff…</p>
              <p>“I… don’t want to die, yet,” muttered Raquel before knocked out unconscious.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">… … …</span></p>
              <p><em>Death; is it simply just shutting one’s eyes forever?<br>Painless; wait, then why do I cry at the wounds inflicted?<br>Futile; is it really so easy to give up?<br>Hopeless; then why I do keep living?</em></p>
              <p><em>To Be Continued</em></p>

              <p><em>Few hours ago…</em></p>
              <p>“Retreat!
              Everybody who is still alive, retreat!” hollered a woman in her late
              thirties who was clad in silver armour; possibly one of the leaders.
              “We lost too much lives! Retrea-.”</p>
              <p>Her voice was cut of with a
              blood-splattering crack as her head came hitting the soft snow with a
              flimsy thud. Her body remained standing for a while before it caved in,
              collapsing to the ground, right next to ‘it’. They had managed to
              defeat two out of three of the ‘beasts’, but with so much lives lost
              right in their eyes, it was hard to believe that. Screams, wailings of
              despair rang into the night as crimson stained the innocent white
              scenery.</p>
              <p>Raquel was already backing off after inflicting
              considerable amount of damage; she had the thought of charging towards
              ‘it’, but after seeing her leader getting killed at such a whim, she
              decided against her will. Even if she had the ability to escape, she
              could not bear leaving the ones alive but severely injured bear the
              full consequence. Grey eyes spun after hearing an audible wail; she
              noticed an ally of hers, Tessa, sprawled to the ground with her
              broadsword impaled into the snow firmly.</p>
              <p>With haste while in the
              midst of all bloodshed, Raquel dashed her way towards Tessa, not
              noticing ‘it’ sending a hard back hand with its over-sized limb. A
              sudden thrust caused the silver haired woman lunging forward in mid-air
              before her face hit the snow first, stunning her for a few moments.
              That had her vulnerable as another assault in a form of a piercing stab
              came towards her in an overhead fashion. Raquel knew what would happen
              if she were not to evade it, but being stunned at the moment, her
              agility was not fully recovered at that point of time. However, what
              she had expected was getting stabbed anywhere on her body, but that was
              not the case this time round-.</p>
              <p>“Raquel, move!” another voice other than Tessa’s came through.</p>
              <p>Reacting
              quickly, the said lass kicked herself away from the situation, swiftly
              towards Tessa’s aid. Grey eyes glanced at the one who had saved her;
              she wore the same overcoat as them, but had a seemingly simple white
              cotton shirt and trousers of some kind, revealing a bit of her toned
              muscled legs while black canvas shoes were what she wore to prevent her
              legs from being numb by the snow. Her hair was of shoulder length
              haired blonde with the back sloped just right above her nape and eyes
              were of brown while her height stood a remarkable 175 centimetres.
              Raquel knew who she was, considering that she did came from her group
              as well.</p>
              <p>“Jeanette, we got to move out! Looks like we’re the only
              ones left standing! The rest are just too far for us to rescue them, if
              they’re still alive,” the silver haired woman replied with a hint of
              emergency. “This is getting out hand!”</p>
              <p>Jeanette did not reply;
              she was pre-occupied with ‘it’ that seemed determined to kill them.
              With her Zweihander, which was now blocking the attacks from ‘it’, she
              then punched the central ridge of the blade, sending a sudden thrust to
              the torso of the beast. ‘It’ retreated by the jolt before it began to
              lunge forward towards the armed blonde once again. This time round,
              Jeanette was ready to do an assault, just enough to prevent ‘it’ from
              attacking. With her left hand holding the hilt while the right held
              onto the ricasso, she charged towards ‘it’. Just moments before
              contact, her right hand changed position; now gripping onto the hilt as
              well as her right shoulder hit the right side of the cross guard. The
              thrust made a deep cut, in fact going though the torso of ‘it’, before
              she pulled it back while tilting it to the right.</p>
              <p>“Now! Even if I
              try to kill it, any of its attack is able to hack us into sizable
              chunks of meat!” yelled Jeanette, a sign that all three of them should
              escape while they can.</p>
              <p>With one arm over Tessa’s shoulder, Raquel
              paced her way quickly into the coming snowstorm while Jeanette tailed
              behind. The sudden flurry of snow managed to form such a natural wall,
              disabling it from tracing the trio’s footsteps. A howl of anger left
              its mouth, through the pearl white fangs that often made its opponents
              shudder with fright. Even though wounded, it was still able to move,
              and in hunt for the three that managed to escape from it.</p>
              <p>Raquel’s
              vision somehow blurred after sometime, as if something had hit her
              head. She glanced at Jeanette, who had her brown eyes filled with
              concern after the silver haired woman was found swaying. Raquel then
              knew what was the cause; her old wound on her midriff.</p>
              <p>“Hey, Raquel, you all right?” asked the blonde, her Zweihander slung to her back.</p>
              <p>Grey eyes dimmed a split second later, before drifting off into darkness; then a thud came through.</p>
              <p>“Raquel!”</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">… … …</span></p>
              <p>“Raquel!” a familiar voice came through; Jeanette’s. “Raquel!”</p>
              <p>Her
              eyelids opened, greeted by the sudden brightness of embers from a small
              fire. She turned away from the lighting, swearing a bit under her
              breath before getting onto a sitting position. Grey eyes wandered for a
              moment, trying to figure out where she was before noticing a concerned
              blonde just right next to her, almost face to face.</p>
              <p>“Uh…” went the silver haired woman before retreating a little; it felt uncomfortable for her.</p>
              <p>Jeanette
              paused for a moment, wondering why her ally had reacted so, until she
              realized how close she was to Raquel, not just face to face, body to
              body as well. That, too, made the blonde retreat a little, looking away
              from the other lady. That was when her voice came through.</p>
              <p>“Where’s Tessa?” asked Raquel with a tone of panic. “Did I leave her behind?”</p>
              <p>Brown
              eyes rolled, somehow eyeing to the direction where the petite lass was.
              Lying on a thin layer of leather from her overcoat was the said woman,
              with her wounds barely dressed, considering the lack of materials they
              have, and the frosty weather they have to endure. Grey eyes then looked
              back at Jeanette, somehow eager to ask an important question.</p>
              <p>“How
              are we going to get out from the North? We might be several mountains
              deep into it. And to rub on that, we really need to get Tessa medical
              aid.”</p>
              <p>“The good thing is, we’re just about a mountain’s distance
              to the nearest town; Scarla, where guards are around the clock,
              protecting it from ‘it’. The main problem is, we might be expecting
              some rough weather in the next few days. Even that ‘thing’ is after us,
              considering if ‘it’ manages to find our tracks,” the tallest female
              replied. “There’s very low chance for us to even make it out alive,
              even for a person very fit like me.”</p>
              <p>A burst of frustration
              kicked in for Raquel as she punched the hard surface of the cave;
              causing a bruise on her right fist. Her eyes glanced at the cold, stone
              ground, before looking up towards Jeanette again.</p>
              <p>“How are we going to make it, if we can survive from that blasted ‘thing’?”</p>
              <p>“That,”
              the tallest woman implied before pausing. “I cannot answer; it feels
              all too random to even evaluate on how we can pull through this one.”</p>
              <p>“Only one word can explain our situation right now,” another voice intruded; Tessa’s. “Futile.”</p>
              <p>Raquel
              and Jeanette did not utter a word soon after that. They knew, deep in
              their hearts, they did not want to accept their situation to that;
              futile. That one word was already enough to lay a heavy burden on them;
              like a prey constantly on the run, only to be caught in the end.
              However, the silver haired lay was not going to accept the fact. She
              wanted to live on after this escape. There was a lot to do for her
              after this. Grey eyes glanced at brown ones again, repeating the same
              question.</p>
              <p>“How long to Scarla?”</p>
              <p>“A mountain’s distance,” Jeanette answered with hesitance. “You’re seriously going to do it, are you?”</p>
              <p>Helping
              the willing Tessa up to her feet while with one shoulder over Raquel,
              the determined woman replied with a question, “What do you reckon?”</p>
              <p>“Have
              you ever though in that big, wooly head of yours on how crazy you are
              doing this stint. It’s like gambling for that last thread of your
              life!” the blonde implied, obviously hinting Raquel not to do so.</p>
              <p>“Which do you prefer, seeing both of us live, or seeing Tessa die? It’s your call,”</p>
              <p>That
              question thrown by that grey eyed lass had Jeanette stumped. She knew
              she would not be able to answer that question; both were equally
              important. She turned away, obviously unable to answer such a trivial
              question. Raquel gave her about another minute’s wait before moving out
              of the cave while showing a bit of disappointment to the said woman.</p>
              <p>“If
              you wish to be foolish, then decide after I leave with Tessa,” the
              woman with the Katzbalger implied, pacing her way into the thick
              snowstorm.</p>
              <p>Silence ensued in the cave, in fact only a faint
              whistle from the wind entering it was heard. Jeanette remained in that
              position before words came out from her mouth…</p>
              <p>“You’re the foolish one, Raquel. You knew… that it’ll cost your life doing so.”</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">… … …</span></p>
              <p><em>Present</em></p>
              <p>Stinging
              cold; that was what Raquel noticed when she regained consciousness. She
              moved her arms; they moved, though the cuts and bruises stung when the
              falling snow came into contact with them. She got up to a sitting
              position, before glancing behind of what had probably broken her fall
              from the cliff. Several branches was spotted lying beneath her, while
              her leather overcoat did much to the cushioning, though her back did
              start to hurt when she tried to stand up. It took her a moment or two
              to realize that she had forgotten one thing; Tessa.</p>
              <p>Grey eyes
              swiveled, searching for the injured comrade of hers. There, in a
              specific mound of snow where a limb was exposed from it. In panic, she
              scrambled towards it, and began shoving the snow away with her bare
              hands. Much of the moisture that condenses on her skin left a stinging
              effect, but she could no longer care. Tessa’s body was seen; she was
              barely breathing this time round. Carefully, Raquel pulled the petite
              lady out, tending to the wounds very much immediately. A cold palm from
              Tessa touched the cool surface of the silver haired woman’s face, as
              her mouth voiced out a few words.</p>
              <p>“Just leave me here.”</p>
              <p>“No!” the taller woman implied. “You’ll get medical attention when we get to Scarla, I’m sure we will make it!”</p>
              <p>“I mean it,” Tessa countered. “It’s about time, in fact any time before I sleep, forever; too much blood loss.”</p>
              <p>“Don’t
              you dare say that,” Raquel shot back, though holding back her upcoming
              grief; she could not accept such a fate for her comrade.</p>
              <p>The
              petite female remained silent as she found herself getting carried on
              Raquel’s arms. However, this time round, Tessa found it warm as her
              eyes gazed at the falling snow. Her ears listened to the footsteps
              Raquel made; each one crushing the snow beneath the soles. Her breaths
              got lighter each time, until a sudden jolt made by the carrier caused
              her to take deep one. The silver eyed lady swore in mere slurs. She was
              sure she heard something from the distance; behind her again. Grey eyes
              scanned to where she might be able to get away from it; another form of
              decline was seen.</p>
              <p>She knew she might take in more damage, and
              deepen some of the wounds, but she did not care. With her best feet
              forwards, she took a leap to it while in attempt to keep herself in a
              standing position, only to see herself in a sitting, sliding one. That
              had her panicking; one wrong maneuver, and she would hit the trunk of a
              naked tree. She did hit one, barely that is. The only mark that she had
              grazed it was when she let out an audible yelp. A hard crunch from the
              snow ensued. Raquel had managed to evade from the ‘thing’ that seemed
              to be lurking from behind, temporarily that is. Not taking any chances,
              she sprinted away, at least increasing the gap.</p>
              <p>However, that was
              where the said woman had thought. Back up where Raquel had leaped down
              from, the blonde in a form of Jeanette gazed on as her brown eyes
              looked at the trails her comrade had made. Not a word left her mouth;
              there was no word to describe her feelings right now. In fact, she
              could not tell how she felt this time round. Foolish? Crazy? She did
              not know. However, all Jeanette knew, at least, tail them from a
              distance. There would be a certain time where those two comrades of
              hers needed a form of protection from ‘it’.</p>
              <p>As her thought
              ceased, the blonde paced her way in search of a more proper route
              downwards, rather than injuring herself meaninglessly by sliding down
              the slope.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">… … …</span></p>
              <p><em>Determination; a counter-attack from futility,<br>Foolishness; varies between good and bad,<br>Risk taker; Raquel was one of them,<br>Worth it; is it?</em></p>
              <p><em>To Be Continued</em></p>
