            <div class='col-md body'>A man reads in the paper of a white gorilla in a zoo far away.  He decides that he just must see it.  The journey will be a long and arduous one but he simply cannot resist.  He sets out on his trip and travels by car to the docks, and catches a ship across a huge ocean.<br><br>After weeks of sea travel he arrives at the other side and takes a train to the zoo.  When he sees the white gorilla, he canÂ’t believe his eyes, it is the most beautiful thing heÂ’s even seen.  He simply must get a closer look, so he goes to the zoo manager and he begs to be allowed into the gorillaÂ’s cage.<br><br>After much arguing, the man finally persuades the manager to let him into the gorillaÂ’s cage, but before he does the manager tells the man that he must not under any circumstances touch the white gorilla.<br><br>The man agrees and is led to the cage. He tip-toes into the cage and is amazed, the gorilla is even more beautiful close up than it was from a distance. The white gorilla just sites quietly and looks at the man.<br><br>After a white, the man is getting used to being so close to the gorilla and it seems so peaceful and calm that he starts to think that there canÂ’t be any harm in touching it.  He slowly moves closer and closer to it, all the time the white gorilla just looks calmly at him.  He reaches out his arm and gently touches the gorilla.<br><br>to be continue .......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just as his arm makes contact, the gorilla jumps up and starts roaring.  The man was shocked by its reaction.  He quickly turns and runs to the exit, getting there just before the gorilla.  He leaps through the door and the keepers slam the door just in time.<br><br>The gorilla, pulls at the door and to the manÂ’s horror the bars start to bend.  The man runs out of the zoo and to the train station and jumps on the train, which as luck would have it, is just leaving.<br><br>He glances back and can see the gorilla chasing after the train, but not gaining it. The train arrives at the dock and the man quickly scampers aboard the ship.  The ship leaves and the man feel safe at last.<br><br>He relaxes and starts to enjoy the leisurely cruise back across the ocean.  What an adventure.  The day theyÂ’re due back in port, heÂ’s walking on the deck when he sees a small shape in the water trailing behind the ship.<br><br>He canÂ’t make it out so he borrows a pair of binoculars from someone and focuses it on the small shape.  To his horror, itÂ’s the white gorilla swimming behind the ship!  It must have been there all along!<br><br>To be continue .......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The ship then arrives in port and the man hurries through customs and rushes to his car.  He drives off just in time to see the gorilla climbing out of the ocean from his rear view mirror.<br><br>He drives as fast as he can to his house and runs in locking the door behind him, all the time being followed by the huge white gorilla.   When the gorilla reaches the man house, it starts pounding on the door and having seen what it did to the cage at the zoo, the man knows it wonÂ’t take very long for the it to get in.<br><br>He runs from room to room fearing for his life, trying to think of a place he can hide.  He hears the door shatter and he dives into a wardrobe and pulls the door closed behind him. Outside the gorilla is going mad trying to find the man, heÂ’s ripping things up and tearing out doors.<br><br>Finally he comes to the wardrobe the man is hiding in and rips the door off.  The gorilla sees the man, reaches out one of its massive hand, smiling and gently touches the frighten man and says:<br><br>Â‘Touch you back!!!Â’<br><br>Told you guys it is a very Â‘touchingÂ’ story right???   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
