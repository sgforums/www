On what?<br>Have I not let you into my abyss-deep cellars,<br>or peer into my darkest chamber?<br>Have I not let you take the reins on my mind's pillars<br>and cast all the others asunder?<br>Have I not jolly well fool around with you in your parlor,<br>or ride with you on the highways of meander?<br>Doubts? I doubt so...<br><br>Well, you see not what everyone here observes;<br>Your train of thoughts've gone real askew,<br>very much getting on our nerves;<br>Really, your misdeeds are not few,<br>and such treatment is not what we deserve;<br>think of how we refresh you daily like morning dew,<br>how you have had divinely exciting times in our turf<br>where everyday's joyous thrills are new...<br><br>So I see what you mean my dear advocate;<br>it's not that I'm shunning you or anything of that nature.<br>Just that things have somewhat complicate,<br>or rather simplify this mystifying, abstract picture<br>which I have painstakingly perused for so long my mate...<br>for in it lies the exceedingly crucial juncture<br>where I can find the trident key to abate<br>the raging storms that my mind's agendas so perpetually feature...<br><br>Well then, however disappointed we may be,<br>keep in mind we're always there,<br>faithfully standing by in the deepest, coldest valley<br>ever ready with our concern and care;<br>with lanterns that never burns out easily<br>to light your path and expose the craftiest snare;<br>for whatever you desire, we aim to fulfill readily,<br>for whatever you want destroyed, there's nothing we won't dare...<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Christina

lovely<br>into my hands she shoved a piece of paper<br>an ad from a journal it was, for me to ponder<br>"I know you love to write...<br>it's a small writing school<br>looking for people to groom, pretty cool"<br>"Er...oh, yep, gosh...thanks, really,"<br>was only what I could mumble<br>darn I wish I had killed myself for that fumble.<br>Well, that was just an instant of many others<br>in which I did not dare to express much either<br>call me a fool, I would not protest;<br>instead, I pretty much detest<br>myself for being such a coward,<br>never dare to take a step forward...<br>Anyway, it's all too late to say anything now<br>for no shrub can be reaped<br>from a land not plowed<br>no autumn leaves sailing in the wind<br>would ever stop and turn<br>no wet embers can once more start to burn<br>I can only keep her<br>in this secret closet in my heart<br>of which I hold not to fall apart,<br>and wish her well in her blissful marriage life<br>I wish her love , to live and thrive<br>though my fire for her I shall always keep alive...<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That

beautiful sight<br>when Spring resigns from his routine shift work<br><br>That will be the day,<br>when the rainbow no longer bends a classic arc<br>when the waters of the stream gush so erratically<br>when no leaves dance no more in the lushy greeny park<br>when there lovers loathe to cuddle so intimately<br><br>That will be the day,<br>when my heart flutters no longer at the your smile so lovely<br>when my ear tingles not a bit at your whisper<br>when my chest warms not when there your head rests so cosily<br>when my pale face flushes not as I let it your ebony

pursuit,<br>that meaningless pursuit of a so-called Elite Way;<br><br>Muahaha i go, as i bump into this chick so voluptuous,<br>all glitters of Tiffany's, her ivory arm clutching the renowned checkered bag;<br>but like a supposed-to-be masterpiece ruined by an error so preposterous<br>her other arm's around a confounded, lascivious old hag;<br><br>Muahaha i go, as i overhear these four single ladies bantering<br>of the hunks they drool over and dream about<br>of men they need not, they concur though, so firmly<br>when intense yearnings harbor in those lonely hearts, no doubt;<br><br>Muahaha i go, as i see the pompous yuppie<br>lavishly spending on designer brands and classy dinners<br>so wanting of respect with his cheapened money<br>bah, those cheapened money from his forefathers.<br><br>So there goes Tralala,<br>bouncing along<br>happily singing his Muahaha song...<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span

end<br>he looks at the eagles soaring high<br>to fly he wishes he really can<br>each step he takes, some pieces of him die<br>like the colors that fades at the rainbow end<br>how he wished of his sorrows he could cry<br>but his eyes're as dry as Sahara's sand<br>how he wished he could just drop dead and die<br>but his life's not his own, he knows his stand<br>O lonely tramp O wretched tramp<br>why does he live on so wearily<br>why does he drag his feet on anyway<br>he knows not what's it to be happy<br>he can never fathom the meaning of gay<br>he will never know of peace and harmony<br>of love and tenderness there's no need to say<br>but relentless angst and agony<br>shall always paint his skies so gray<br>woes and blues are his company<br>warmth and tenderness keep him at bay<br>the devils spite him with sarcasm and mockery<br>the angels from him with disgust shun away<br>there's no meaning in this life anymore<br>ah, anyway there may not be any before<br>like a sailor overboard who'll never see the shore<br>like a trapped child who can never find the door<br>his future will be bleak and unsure<br>there'll always be much to endure<br>so very much to
