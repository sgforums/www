gaze?<br>And as we get mesmerized,<br>Drawn into each other's world<br>Lose our focus in all else<br>The sea of people around us<br>Fades, becoming insignificant<br>Obscure backdrop<br>I see only you, and you alone...<br><br>What can I do to draw you closer?<br><br>After the first flush of attraction<br>Comes the romancing<br>Can't have enough of you<br>I just need to see you everyday<br>Weave our lives together<br>Do little everyday things together<br>Declare to the world that we're one<br>Comfortable in our unity, seemingly inseparable...<br><br>What can I do to draw you closer?<br><br>Things start to fall apart<br>And can it be that I find someone else<br>Attractive, magnetically drawn to him<br>So it's true then<br>There's no such thing as 'The One'<br>I've learnt it's possible to love another<br>At different times of our lives<br>We let in other people...<br><br>What can I do to draw you closer?<br><br>Truth is a double-edged sword<br>Wield it and see what gives<br>Whilst truth can bring one couple closer<br>The very same truth can also draw another couple apart<br>Can you handle the truth?<br>I want to be truthful but I fear<br>How will you respond?<br>It was never supposed to be this hard...<br><br>What can I do to draw you closer?<br><br>Keep you alive in my memories<br>Retrace our steps in the places we used to go<br>You and me, timeless, in that place in time<br>Revisiting our special moments again and again<br>How can it be, that the truth can create a ravine between us<br>So deep, so dark, so final<br>I see you once more, walking away<br>Drawing yet another one closer to you...<br><br><strong>Participant 2 (The man who was death): Starcrossed </strong><br><br>Starcrossed lovers they were<br>Seperated by more than a mere<br>Forces they couldn't defy<br>Neither could it petrify<br>For they were young and bold<br>Strength with the love they hold<br><br>Bitter sweet and sorrow<br>Death, pain and misery soon follows<br>The consequences takes it's toll<br>Always out of their control<br>Banished by the plague<br>The walls that are opaque<br>Just when everything turns to despair<br>Always their love was there<br><br>A rose by any other name still has thorn<br>Still it didn't stop the beginning of a new dawn<br>The death she did fake<br>The poison he did take<br>A fatal stab<br>One giant step<br><br>Fear the reaper they never did<br>Families' words they never heed<br>Capulet, Montague united in one bow<br>Kinship formed by lovers' vow<br><br><strong>Particiapnt 3 (poetic_soul): Sad Old Story </strong><br><br>It was a sad movie i watched with her<br>Which ended while the night was still young<br>So were we, so young<br>I only remembered it as<br>"the sad movie i watched with her"<br>Indeed, it ended just like the story<br>And we are no longer young<br>No longer young<br><br><strong>Participant 4 (tare): The lure of dark passion and love in a strange land... </strong><br><br><strong>the lure of dark passion</strong>  <strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">(Winning Poem)</span></span></strong><br><br>my voice reaches to you,<br>soaring through the night,<br>though my face unseen,<br>you hear it clear as daylight.<br><br>my soul longs for you,<br>the beauty in my mind,<br>to see your face,<br>and hold your body near mine.<br><br>with my voice i lure you,<br>into the darkness of the night,<br>captivating and arousing,<br>you came under my might.<br><br>our spirit unite,<br>as passion ignites,<br>no one knows me but you,<br>this ghost of the night.<br><br>from you my face withheld,<br>scarred by hatred hidden in disguise,<br>i could not bear to see myself,<br>in the reflection of your eyes.<br><br>though i desire to be with you,<br>spirit soul and mind,<br>yet destiny has its voice,<br>our bodies will be forever divide.<br><br><strong>love in a strange land... </strong><br><br>across the oceans i came,<br>to a land of elephants so tamed,<br>exotic arrays of spices,<br>filled with beauty and vices.<br><br>being brought into your presence,<br>it is almost hate at first instance,<br>your arrogance infuriates me,<br>and my openness provokes thee.<br><br>strong and powerful you may be,<br>yet stubborn and proud as can be,<br>and the occasional cruelty,<br>is what triggers me to leave.<br><br>i threaten never to return,<br>yet i saw your children as i turn,<br>with wide eyes so enchanting,<br>i was refrained from departing.<br><br>patiently i teach your children,<br>so eager to listen and learn,<br>even your many wives are curious,<br>of this lady from another custom.<br><br>daily with your family i venture,<br>into the differences and similarities in culture,<br>through them i know more of you,<br>your strengths and courage unyield.<br><br>both fascinating and captivating,<br>we draw near yet withholding,<br>as we dance at the glamourous banquet,<br>our deepest passion finally uncage...<br><br><strong>Participant 5 (KittynMeow): The Game </strong><br><br>Numbers and algebra, facts and figures,<br>aligned in formulas that defines fascination.<br>Link one to one and two plus two,<br>LifeÂ’s theories become just an equation.<br><br>Snooker and drinks, dateless and lonely,<br>At the bar a game I formed in my head.<br>Slowly and surely, with wit and cunning<br>I goaded the guys to date her friends instead.<br><br>Diligent and dedicated, loyal and true,<br>I devoted myself to the work that I do.<br>Caution and suspicion soon taught me to see,<br>a conspiracy in the game around me and you.<br><br>Words and phrases, letters and newspapers,<br>Piece by piece the connections begin.<br>Day by day as the game progresses<br>a dreaded fear grows stronger within.<br><br>Friends and family, lover and kin,<br>all but one IÂ’ve left aside.<br>Codes and secrets, thoughts and doubts,<br>alone in Charles my friend I confide.<br><br>Fast and bright, flashing and fleeting,<br>Shadows in the dark in every place I go.<br>Dangerous and daring, by night and in stealth,<br>I delivered to a lone house dossiers of the foe.<br><br>Restless and stressed, worried and worn,<br>Alicia sought to make the game desist.<br>Sudden and shocking, without a warning,<br>Point blank I fainted, unable to resist.<br><br>Images and visions, dreams and apparitions,<br>These were the reality of what IÂ’ve seen<br>Marcee and Charles, ageless and undying,<br>Diseased delusions of the game they have been.<br><br>Trembling and weak, resolute and determined,<br>I fought to regain my life and stand.<br>Eventually and successfully, the game is won,<br>And a Nobel Prize rewarded me at the end.<br><br><strong>Participant 6 (sleepycat): the room &amp; to anything that is you</strong><br><br><strong>the room </strong><br><br>1.02am<br>she smells its orange,<br>shadowed in pouring caresses;<br>of others' flooding presence,<br>of many memories whitened into yellow.<br><br>2.01am<br>she feels the yellow,<br>rusting in its throbbing gushes;<br>crushing every breath,<br>writhing each limb,<br>she twitches and trembles.<br>There,<br>on her sealed lips where her urges seal,<br>she erects<br>dreams within walls,<br>cemented.<br><br><strong>to anything that is you </strong><br><br>i hate you and all thoughts of you,<br>that lick and suck my mind;<br>that rape and burn my soul;<br>that steal, that kill, that ever destroy.<br>And yet,<br>you,<br>with your sweet fake smile;<br>with your moist sweaty palms;<br>and your thick ugly-looking glasses,<br>do touch<br>me,<br>in a place<br>where even angels miss.<br><br></div>
