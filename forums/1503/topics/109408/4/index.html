She<br>is the artist: a box of crayons<br>was placed on the side table<br>within reach from her bed.<br><br>I picked up the blood tubes,<br>checked for her number and name<br>and then walked Â–<br>ran Â–<br>walked back down to the lab.<br><br>Â“This has to be processed right awayÂ”,<br>I requested to my white coat colleagues<br>running the blood work machines,<br>Â“it belongs to a child.Â”<br><br>The supervisor picked up<br>a case sheet from a stack,<br>Â“This one is tooÂ”, she said,<br>Â“Just put hers in<br>like the rest.Â”<br></div>
