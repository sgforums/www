            <div class='col-md body'>Suggested this idea to DP some time last week and we thought why not? Other than writing poetry, one way we can help ourselves improve would be to read more poetry and attempt to interpret what the poem is trying to say. By exposing ourselves to the ideas, views and comments of one another, we can open our minds to the concepts behind poetry writing, be aware of things such as form, imagery, structure etc... that will help us in our own writing...<br><br>So I shall attempt to start this off with a poem that I had problem understanding but it still struck me deeply with some of the images and bleakness it presents.<br><br>Let's all do our own dissection of the piece and learn from one another!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The subject is a 7 year old girl going through a mental and physical torment. The poem addresses the trauma.<br><br>I find this poem rugged and jagged. There is no fixed meter nor is there any consistency in its rhymes. Moreover it is too radical to be considered a lyric.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a cry against something that is lingering or torturing this person mentally. And it's become a center of this person's world. It occupies this person's mind constantly. A scream suggests it's something extremely shocking. The environment is a harsh one no doubt -- baying of hounds, snarling jaws of ceremony -- implies mercilessness. There's no help or comfort to be found.<br><br>Reading it does conjure up feelings of something disturbing. Still I can't pinpoint exactly what it is about. The mention of a name makes me wonder about the significance of it. Does Mariam respresent something, some place, someone, or is it a real person?</div>
