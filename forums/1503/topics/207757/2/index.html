Ci or lyrics, is a literature format that is popular during the late Tang and Song Dynasty. The reason why its different from poem is that it is "filled in" to a piece of tune, which in this case is Shui Diao Ge Tou. Basically quite like today's song and music, where you have piece of music score and someone fill in the lyrics. Ci is also often known as Shi Yu, or remains of poem, which is because lyricist quite often attached certain extra words to an established poem to make it fit into a certain tune. In Singapore's textbook, if you come across a "poem like" thingy that is written by anyone in the Song Dynasty like Sudong Po, Li Yu, Li Qingzhao, Yue Fei blar blar blar, chances are, you have come across a ci or lyrics.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, i do remember about the poetess Cai Wenji who lived during the Three Kingdoms period. She played the ancient musical instrument hujia and composed her most famous piece Eighteen Laments Sung To A Hujia, which was about the suffering of the people during the Three Kingdoms period. There was also Cao Zhi, son of Cao Cao who composed the Quatrain of Seven Steps which moved his brother Cao Pi to tears and spared his life.<br><br>This is the translation of Cai Wenji's piece<br><br>Eighteen Laments Sung To A Hujia<br><br>At the time of my birth, the land was at peace,<br>But later, the Han Dynasty fell into decline.<br>Heaven is unkind, allowing wars, suffering, separation;<br>Earth is unkind, that I should have to live at such a time.<br>Weapons of war are everywhere, making the roads perilous.<br>Soldiers and people fleeing to exile, suffering together.<br>The land, billowing clouds of smoke and dust, is a prisoner of the Hu.<br>Integrity and willpower have disappeared.<br>I cannot accept the vulgar barbarous customs,<br>Humiliated and abused, to whom can I turn?<br>I sing to my hujia and qin,<br>But no one knows my anger and my grief.</div>
