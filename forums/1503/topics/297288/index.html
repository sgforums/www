            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">"Just a moment not too long ago" is a series of short stories on the various aspects of love.<br><br>Romantic love, sibling love, parental love and many others.</span><br><br>~~~~~~<br><br><img src="http://img145.imageshack.us/img145/2716/justamomentnottoolongagpf7.jpg"><br><br>He admired her fondly as she yawned, lying on the sofa. Her beautiful eyes were closed, and her face shone with simple innocence. He found himself smiling unknowingly as he looked at her face.<br><br>A sudden cool breeze blew into the living room as she cuddled herself tightly. He hurriedly walked into one of the bedrooms and retrieved a blanket quietly, before returning to the living room.<br><br>Carefully covering her body with the blanket, he planted a tender kiss on her lips before returning to his seat right beside her. He was tired and his eyes were closing. Yet he fought to keep himself awake; he wanted to make sure she was sound asleep before he slept. He gently patted her head as fond images of their past flashed through his head.<br><br>How they first met, when they first held hands, when they first kissed, they were all deeply etched in his memories.<br><br>As he swam in the pools of memories, a deep and slow breathing filled the room, and he knew she had just fallen asleep. Quietly and gently, he shifted slightly in his seat and closed his eyes as well, welcoming the drowsiness. He fell asleep shortly.<br><br>~~~~~~<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">That was a long time ago now</span>, he thought as he recalled, with pained agony. They were both young then, only fifteen years old. They were still untouched by the chaotic vibes of the society, still innocent. They had a simple love, and thought that love would always be this simple.<br><br>And then he remembered the promise they made to each other, at that very night.<br><br>It seemed like just a moment not too long ago.<br><br><img src="http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/7410/justamomentnottoolongagas0.jpg"><br><br>The man sighed, looking at the passing river taxis, his face carved with sorrow. He closed his eyes as a cool breeze blew against his face, as if it was trying to sweep his sadness away.<br><br>Then suddenly, tears began to form at the brim of his eyes, uncontrolled and determined. He blinked, taking a deep breath defiantly, yet his attempts to tame the waves of sorrows within him was as futile as his attempts to save his mother.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Useless. That is what you are, bastard. You failed to save your own mother. Your own fuc<strong></strong>king mother. She died right in front of you, and you couldn't save her? You're so useless, Zach, so useless.</span><br><br>He scolded himself as the whole incident re-acted itself in his mind. Her muffled screams, his futile attempts to pull her towards shore against the strong current, the moment he lost hold of her hand, her cold dead face when they finally pulled her to shore.<br><br>Yet they were too late. He was too late. He caused his mother's death, he was sure of it. He would carry the loss, the agony, the guilt and the pain with him for the rest of his life.<br><br>He turned, and saw a young boy happily eating ice cream with his mother. He was ten, perhaps eleven.<br><br>In the little boy he saw himself, almost a decade ago, sitting beside his mother, happy eating ice cream and talking. He did most of the talking, anyway. His mother played the listener of her child for most parts. She knew her child love to talk, and she did not want to dampen his jovial mood. She hoped he would grow up to be a fine man with a successful career, and had more than once told him her hope.<br><br>He closed his eyes and muttered softly, "I would do you proud, Mother. I will do you proud."<br><br>~~~~~~<br><br>He stood at the stage as the spotlight shone on him. Nine years had passed.<br><br>"Please give our round of applause to Mr. Lee, the Entrepreneur of the Year!"<br><br>As the thunderous wave of applause swept through the hall, he thought he heard his mother's voice again - "Boy ah, next time when you grow up, you must be a good man with a good job, okay?"<br><br>He smiled. He remembered all too well the times she said that to him.<br><br>It seemed just a moment not too long ago.</div>
