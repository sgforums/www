            <div class='col-md body'>Well, been writing this story for quite some time, and it maybe a bit... weird as a read, but do enjoy. Editing will only take place after I finish the series.<br><br>========<br><br>TOKYO BATTALIONS<br>BY: OUTLAW-2<br>Â… Â… Â…<br><br>November 2003<br><br>Within the industrial area of Tokyo, Japan, lies a major situation where even Royal ChrysanthemumÂ’s SWAT troops were unable to infiltrate. Before them was an abandoned building, which was left to crumble. The supports were almost beyond safe levels, almost towards unstable. However, the fragile structure was not their main concern. A group of rowdy motorbike gangsters whom were under the Japanese MafiaÂ’s orders had kidnapped a 14 year old daughter of a specific President of a certain company. Apparently, the president of the stated company had some run-ins with the mafia, and the secret deal they had did not go well. A ransom was forcefully requested in exchange for the girlÂ’s life, not knowing the hidden agenda the Yakuza had in mind. The mafia had handed the rowdy bikers weaponry to eliminate anyone who enters the building, even the daughterÂ’s father. The deadline was coming close, and time was running out. That was when she come into play, from The Academy.<br><br><strong>CHAPTER 1: BURNING BLUE EYES</strong><br><br>Four hours. That was the time left before the deadline. Blue eyes shone with determination as she reviewed the briefing for the mission. Her primary objective was to rescue the 14 year old girl within the allocated time of four hours. Her secondary objective was to eliminate the bikers should they use aggression. Equipped with necessary armour and weapons, she stood up in the rather stuffy auxiliary van, only to hit the ceiling of the vehicle. She swore under her breath as she got off the damned van while rubbing her forehead with the Zweihander slung to her back.<br><br>Claire Everon was the 18 year old lass' name. Standing at a height of 180 centimetres, she was the tallest female officer in The Academy. Hailing from Zurich, Switzerland, she descended from a family of swordsmanship and auto-mechanics. One such proof was the 300 year old, 1.9 metre two-handed sword she had with her.<br><br>Her long blond hair and sapphire blue eyes may picture Claire being a stereotypical Â‘dumb blondeÂ’, but she was not. In fact, no one dared to refer her into such a category. The level of aggression she used in her missions had many on their toes. To be more specific, she preferred slashing her opponents in half rather than sparing their meaningless lives.<br><br>Often, she would simply wear a standard white, long-sleeved business shirt and a pair of blue-black trousers when going around her usual traffic patrol runs. As for missions such as the current one, Claire simply donned a Kevlar vest over the business shirt. Her long, slender legs provided her much needed agility in such situations, like evading a vehicle about to run her down as an example. However, even from all those aggressive nature of hers, Claire gives off a motherly aura that somehow calmed people down. Her flawless face would pacify a wailing toddler within seconds. That was how special, and how much of a paradox Claire Everon was, even though being mocked once in a while for having small B-cup breasts for an Eurasian.<br><br>Standing before the Swiss lass was the abandoned building where the girl was held captive. She scanned the exterior of the building that was dominated with cracks and steel support bars jutting out, and the barren ground surrounding it. She spotted a glint caused by the reflection of the moon, behind a wall near the only entrance of the structure. With the SWAT officers and personnel unaware, Claire drew out an M16 rifle, and screwed on a silencer at the end of the barrel. Releasing the safety lock, she took aim, using the cross-hair of the rifle. She paused. Moments later, she squeezed the trigger, once. A bullet rushed out of the barrel, then through the silencer. In the darkness, the bullet pierced the stale air as it met its victim. Without the armed biker knowing, a bullet stabbed through his head from the side, just right above his left ear. Blotches of crimson fluid stained the rusty, protruding reinforcement steel bars and the concrete of a support pillar. Seconds passed by before the corpse collapsed in a seating position, leaning against the stated pillar as his head faced the ground lifelessly.<br><br>Â“One down,Â” Claire muttered while putting the rifle away.<br><br>Her eyes glowed with excitement. Just moments before Claire snuck into the compound; a firm hand stopped her by the left shoulder. She swung around. It was Craken Robinson, the Chief of The Academy. The 45 year old American shook his head, telling her it was not the right time to sneak in. The Swiss lass paused, and took the time to observe him. Even though Craken had aged till his hands were already wrinkled, he still retains the strength and build of a thirty year old. He sported short black-grey hair that was styled almost similar to a typical Communist official. As usual, he wore a short-sleeved off-white business shirt and straight-cut black denim jeans, while donning a military blazer that came from America. Apparently, he was wanted for treason there, for being a traitor when he was a member of the US Congress. Craken had leaked out top secret information to other government parties in America, which caused a major outbreak of violence there. He fled once his objective was achieved, and went into hiding, till he was recognized by The Academy. He was appointed as Chief of the private military organization as the one before had retired weeks ago. Till now, Craken was under protection; hence the US Congress could not do anything to arrest him, and was dropped. The label Â‘American TraitorÂ’ still remains intact to him, but Craken could not care less. He hated his country, and swore not to return forever.<br><br>Â“Wait for your temporary partner,Â” Craken replied before taking a deep breath of a lit Marlboro cigarette. Â“SheÂ’ll be here in a minute.Â”<br><br>Claire crossed her arms after tying her long, blond hair to a ponytail. Waiting patiently, the Swiss lass leaned against a metal pole supporting a stop sign. However, a split second later, rust and metal fatigue from the pole gave way. Claire stumbled over a few vulgar words before she hit the cracked, grainy asphalt. She swore under her breath as she sat up, rubbing the back of her skull.<br><br>Â“Why, thank you for cushioning my fall,Â” Clare replied sarcastically at the damned, broken up road.<br><br>She stood up while dusting her buttocks; just in case if any form of dirt was to stick onto the trousers. A mysterious shadow appeared right before her. Instinct kicked in; Claire drew out her assault knife and aimed right for the entityÂ’s chest. She paused; inches from striking. The entity yelped, probably shocked of ClaireÂ’s sudden reaction. Craken let out a sigh, knowing how Claire would react once she notices anything unusual.<br><br>Â“Claire, this is Fio Youkai. SheÂ’s half Italian, half Japanese, and will be your temporary partner for this mission,Â” Chief Craken introduced to Claire.<br><br>Being a tall lass, Claire had to tilt her head downwards to a specific angle in order to see her. There she was. FioÂ’s height was about 160 centimetres, which was twenty centimetres shorter than Claire. The half Italian, half Japanese lass sported a seemingly shoulder-length ash-brown hair when she has the olive green military cap on. Claire took a closer look. She paced a few steps towards the speechless Fio, and lifted her cap slightly. A ponytail popped out, revealing her true hair length, which ends near her bosoms. By then, ClaireÂ’s temporary partner was already blushing furiously. It was rather amusing for Claire to see FioÂ’s dress code. She simply wore a white tank top with desert coloured short sleeved military uniform worn over, and unbuttoned, and a pair of off-blue denim shorts. Also, Fio wore a pair of rimless spectacles with its circular lenses slightly larger than her round, reddish-brown eyes. However, that was not the feature Claire was interested. The Swiss lass stared at FioÂ’s bosoms. For her height, she does possess an unbelievably healthy set of breasts. Claire looked at hers, and squeezed it a bit. Miniscule, she thought, compared to FioÂ’s immense E-cup.<br><br>Â“F-Fio Youkai! Nice to meet you,Â” the half Italian yelped as her introduction.<br><br>Claire sighed, disappointed about her bust size. Turning her attention back to the mission, the Swiss lass popped a question.<br><br>Â“What weapons will you be armed with?Â”<br><br>Realising that she had changed the topic, Fio regained her courage and replied, Â“Two Colt revolvers, a Suomi M-31 sub-machine gun, and some HE grenades.Â”<br><br>Â“Drop the HE grenades for flashbangs and smoke grenades. The building is already fragile for a start,Â” the Swiss lass implied.<br><br>Fio nodded in agreement as she headed back to a sports car. Claire observed her as the half Italian opened the boot. The Swiss lass gasped in surprise. Various sorts of grenades, handguns, and revolvers could be seen. Not only that, it was the car boot of a Toyota Supra RZ, ToyotaÂ’s equivalent to a BMW M3. After swapping the HE grenades for flashbangs and smoke grenades, Fio shut the boot and paced her way back to Claire and Chief Craken. Not wasting any more time, the American traitor reminded them once again.<br><br>Â“You know the objectives to this mission. However, I will close one eye should the both of you either bend the objectives or go overboard slightly. Also, know your limits. ThatÂ’s all. Get your butt going. ItÂ’s 10pm, and you have less than 4 hours to accomplish it. Good luck.Â”<br><br>Â… Â… Â…<br><br>Begin Mission<br><br>Time LeftÂ… 3 hours 45 minutesÂ…<br><br>The environment in the murky, abandoned building was what Claire had expected. Support pillars with reinforcement steel bars sticking out were covered in rust due to the areaÂ’s high humidity percentage. The concrete flooring was dominated with a mixture of dust, cement powder, water, and grease. Thousands of electrical wire hung by the supports of the ceiling, which proved deadly should a short circuit takes place. ClaireÂ’s sports shoes squelched over the puddles with an M16 in her hands. Fio trailed behind a metre away, backing the Swiss lass up with two Colt revolvers.<br><br>Â“Say, Fio,Â” Claire called out.<br><br>Â“Yes?Â” the half Italian replied as her eyes scanned every inch of the surroundings.<br><br>Â“How did you get your breasts grow that big?Â” the Swiss lass asked monotonously.<br><br>Â“Wh-what?Â” Fio yelped before shutting her mouth with both hands.<br><br>Noticing a glint at the end of the corridor, Claire reacted. She took aim with the M16, and hammered the trigger, twice. Through the silencer, the two bullets pierced into the air. An echoing splatter of blood could be heard before the thud of a dead body sprawled to the ground took place. Claire and Fio froze. Footsteps were heard.<br><br>Â“Hurry, up the staircase,Â” the Swiss lass whispered, shoving Fio a little.<br><br>Keeping their volume down to a minimum, the duo sneaked their way up the wooden staircase. Claire cursed under her breath. It had to be made out of wood, not concrete. Since they had no other way to avoid contact with the armed bikers, the duo made their way up the stairs. FioÂ’s bulky boots made each plank creak due to immense stress. Claire broke out in cold sweat. What if the armed bikers were already waiting for them on the second floor? What if the staircase collapses? Those were such questions flooding her mind. Fio tapped ClaireÂ’s shoulder out of nowhere. She swiveled, looking at the half Italian. Before she could say anything, Fio pointed upwards, to the second floor. Claire tilt her head upwards. Two armed bikers were dozing away with Uzis slung onto their shoulders. The Swiss lass swore in German, before hand-signing Fio to back her up. Clearing the creaky staircase, the duo went up to the sleeping bikers as Claire did the unexpected.<br><br>Â“Sleeping on the job, huh? Well then, IÂ’ll let you sleep forever then,Â” was ClaireÂ’s twisted mind as she silently shot the two through the heart.<br><br>Some of the crimson fluid splattered onto FioÂ’s white tank top. For a start, it did not take her by surprise. Instead, it excited the half Italian, half Japanese lass. Her breath grew heavy as time went by, almost audible for everyone within the one metre radius. Her hands shook uncontrollably and her eyes widened. Her reddish-brown eyes glowed under the moonlight. Her calm smile turned to an unstable sneer, making her set of white canine teeth look like fangs. Claire took notice of her change in behaviour and shook Fio by the shoulder, vigourously. Fio regained her sanity as the Swiss lass warned her.<br><br>Â“Get a grip of yourself, geez.Â”<br><br>Fio paused for a moment, before answering ClaireÂ’s question about bosoms, Â“Milk. Ever since I was young, I keep consuming milk daily.Â”<br><br>The Swiss lass pondered at the reply before she shrugged, Â“I could try that.Â”<br><br>Fio smiled at that moment. Claire took notice of it and turned away. Maybe Claire was not good with people, thought the half Italian, half Japanese lass. Claire took the lead once again while Fio backed her up a metre behind. The squelching of the Swiss lassÂ’s sports shoes was getting too audible for comfort. She slowed down her pace whenever they walked over puddles of water and grease. Visibility was at its minimum as moonlight was not able to penetrate through this section of the building. Claire could barely see where she was heading. Footsteps of two people were heard. The armed bikers, she thought. She signaled Fio to hide behind a brick wall. It took a while for the half Italian to realise it. Swiftly, yet silently, she dashed towards Claire, who was already leaning against the wall. However, Fio had not notice a puddle in her tracks, and stomped on it. A loud splash was heard followed by beads of fluid trickling back into the source. Claire swore under her breath. Fio gasped, realising what she had done.<br><br>Â“Damn it, Fio!Â” the Swiss lass muttered. Â“Fio, follow me!Â”<br><br>The footsteps Claire heard earlier on turned into a run. They were after the source of the noise; us, was ClaireÂ’s thought. Moonlight began shining through the bare windows. Keeping as far from the windows as possible, Claire spotted a dark corridor. Swiftly, she did a sudden side step into the hiding area. Claire then grabbed the running Fio by the hand, and pulled her in. The Swiss lass applied more pressure as FioÂ’s face rubbed against ClaireÂ’s small breasts. The half Italian struggled, only to hear the Swiss lassÂ’s stern voice.<br><br>Â“Silence!Â” Claire whispered.<br><br>Both of them froze. Moments later, two armed bikers dashed past the dark corridor where the two lasses were hiding. The echoing footsteps began to fade by the second. Claire let out a sigh of relief and released Fio. The half Italian gasped for air, not because she was out of breath. She was blushing furiously, and breathless. Fio could feel a weird sensation when it occurred. It reminded Fio of her mother, who was in Nagasaki, doing business there. Then, she felt her hair being ruffled by Claire. Fio looked up, and noticed Clare with a plain face.<br><br>Â“That was too close. Careful next time,Â” the Swiss lass reminded.<br><br>Fio felt comfortable. It was as if her mother was right by her side. She nodded in agreement. Such a paradox was Claire, thought Fio. As the intensity drops, Claire checked her wrist watch. 11.15pm it read. They were slower then expected. She did not say a word. Instead, she clenched onto the handle of the M16 rifle. Hand-signing Fio to tail her, Claire was about to head out when the back of her left shoe hit something; a door. As it creaked open, light from the fluorescent lamp shone through. Inside, five armed bikers were taking a break from their duties with their weapons close to them. They turned to look at the two asses at the entrance of theÂ…messy room. All of them froze. Caught in the act, Claire thought. One of the armed bikers grabbed hold of the sub-machine gun, aiming right for Claire without using the crosshair. The Swiss lass took a deep breath, before issuing an order to Fio, which also applies to Claire as well.<br><br>Claire aimed with the M16, about to squeeze the trigger, Â“Screw stealth mode. Go dynamic!Â”<br><br>Â… Â… Â…<br><br>Next ChapterÂ…<br><br>The eye of a determined officer,<br>The intent of a half Italian killing,<br>The barrel of the Colt revolver,<br>The immense echo of blood splattering,<br><br>The warmth of a Swiss lass,<br>A merciless, unfeeling officer was her exterior,<br>A paradox she was,<br>A swordswoman once she wields the Zweihander.<br><br>Chapter 2Â…<br><br>SCREW STEALTH MODEÂ…<br>GO DYNAMIC!</div>
