            <div class='col-md body'>Recently a gentleman by the name of Anthony Lee Mui Yu has been contributing regularly in the Online ST forums. I have been following his writings rather closely, not because of its content, but because I do not have a clue what he is writing about, even after I have gone through the passages twice. I have included two of his articles below. The first one is taken from the ST Online forums today.<br><br>I fully acknowledge Mr. Lee's spectacular command of written English. I will also admit that and my own English linguistic skill and vocabulary is vastly inferior to Mr. Lee. However, no one ever has to read my emails 20 times to understand that I am sending out an invitation for a house warming party... At the end of the day, it boils down to the reason one writes; to impress, or to communicate?<br><br>I will probably keep all his writings for my children. When they are old enough to write essays I can show these to them as examples of how <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> to write.<br><br><blockquote>Chineseness: Culture is a continuum<br><br>'WHAT does it mean to be Chinese and Asian?' (Online forum, April 20) is Mr Wong Hoong Hooi's perennial worry of 'wannabes coalescing around a Western cultural core'.<br>A romanticised Chineseness of Confucian-Taoist intellectuals rivalling calligraphy under willows - or reality? The writer recommends education - without 'drilling our children on tradition' - 'to personalise the issue of ethnicity for the individual and empower him to make a difference in the space spanning chauvinism and deculturalisation'.<br><br>Chineseness ranges from older dialect speakers to dialect-English speakers of my generation and today's Mandarin-English savvy globe-trotters - some in China. Unifying under Mandarin evolved dialectal culture into Mandarin-speaking Chineseness that provincial China still resists.<br><br>Presuming an Adam-and-Eve genesis, I define culture as: constant adaptation that evolves societies recognisably distinct. Hence, China-Chineseness, Malaysian-Malayness and Indian-Indianness - spawning Singapore Chineseness, Malayness and Indianness. And their continua.<br><br>Switzerland had seven centuries to consolidate its proud Swiss Germanness, Frenchness and Italianness - without perfidy. Brazil took a century plus to meld a European, African and Amerindian potpourri into unapologetic Brazilianness. We are a decades-old infant starting on a Swiss-like, Brazilian-like or whatever transformation - what's the hurry?<br><br>Mr Wong disclaims commenting on 'issues of cultural integrity in the other communities'. Would he keep mum if a mounting Indian presence overarches our ethnicities? Or protest an Asianising West that 'hijacks' Chinese or Indian Asianness?<br><br>He insinuates accusations of bigotry on 'any Chinese Singaporean who incorporates race as part of his identity'. It's his diatribes against amorphous 'anglophiles' and 'westophiles' - not racial incorporation per se - that alarmed, a la white-supremacists' stridency in Western societies.<br><br>Couldn't he sense our minorities' insecurities? Switzerland would replicate tensions should a Swiss-German Mr Wong suddenly harangue his own ethnic community - a Swiss majority - for 'cultural betrayal'.<br><br>Resisting soft power inroads is like the Dutch boy's finger plugging a leaking dyke. Culture is fluidly malleable and not a zero-sum game. With 'good old days' nostalgia, Mr Wong's grandkids may presume he enjoyed a 'purer culture' like his current wistfulness harks back.<br><br>Deculturalisation is impossible as cultures transform in a continuum - quicker with globalisation to adapt - outdating atavistic comparisons. Try telling Brazilians their faceted hybrid is adulterated culture! Or deride 'unity without uniformity' Swissness - you might get an arrow in your apple.<br><br>Anthony Lee Mui Yu</blockquote><blockquote>Thomas Lee Zhi Zhi's letter, 'Condo success: What's faith got to do with it?' (Online forum, March 3) decries that Newton One's developer attributes - on signage - faith to its sales. He finds that it threatens our multi-religious orientation.<br>This is redolent of a former colleague who ascribed little successes to Him as in, 'He has blessed me in doing such-and-such' which, ad nauseam, grates.<br><br>I'm not areligious. But if I reserve coarse speech for all-guys carousing, shouldn't religious spouters save it for co-religionists? In the wrong contexts, language imposes and discomforts. It's worse if it is a gambit to proselytise.<br><br>Similarly, religious paraphernalia shouldn't obtrude. Commendably, some establishments secrete their staff's altars in the rear while some retail premises display their figurines or altars - of whatever faith - prominently.<br><br>There's a barber whose premises look like a shrine - his co-believer competitors shake their heads bemusedly each time he loses a customer to them. Is he announcing: 'For fellow-believers only'?<br><br>In secular contexts, manifesting your freedom to worship shouldn't presume on others' comfort zones. Even a home that looks like a shrine is incongruous, let alone business premises that exude worship. If religion defines your business, great! If not, don't unnerve and confuse your prospects!<br><br>Religiousness should raise empathy for those of different faiths or none. Self-misleading adherents do humanity, their faiths and co-believers a great disservice. Faiths should unite, not divide people - now especially.<br><br>Anthony Lee Mui Yu</blockquote></div>

You can't be 'following his writings rather closely' and trying to decipher him without interest in his content - it's an oxymoron. He wasn't writing a housewarming invite but something sociological about culture and Chineseness.<br><br>Have you read his letters on animal welfare, customer service or the latest on better oral English (Online Apr 27)? They were extremely readable - it depends on the topic's demands. The 400-word limit for each letter forces compact writing that 'big words' facilitate on abstract topics.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, interesting.  Technically speaking, Lee has committed one glaring error.  While his lexicon is obviously suited to more formal or academic writing, he takes some liberties with his grammar, starting sentences with "and" and "or", and "it's" instead of "it is" in writing.  There seems to be an inconsistent applicaton of standards here.<br><br>Then again, that point is academic (pardon the pun).  Prolix says, "I enjoy using words to convey precisely what other words can't".  Well and good, but that applies only upon the condition that "other words can't".  In the case of Lee's writing, the same message can be precisely conveyed in much simpler language.<br><br>This brings us to Beyond Religion's point.  There's no doubt that the Engrand is very powderful, but is the Engrand <span style="text-decoration: underline;">too</span> powderful?  Personally, I believe it is, especially if the objective is to clearly convey a message, as Prolix proposes.<br><br>Eight years of university drove me in the direction of never saying something in ten words when it could be said in five, but the objective there was to fit as much information as possible into a non-negotiable word limit.  These days, writing in that manner would not be acceptable, because my clients do not have my training - they want the message expressed as simply and as clearly as possible.  Hey, for a hundred grand a pop, I'd write it in Swahili if they wanted, but I digress.<br><br>At the risk of sounding corny, let's not miss the forest for the trees here.  The aim of language is communication, plain and simple - and Beyond Religion's simple and clear title, "Writing to be understood", could not be a more clear example of this.  Extended lexicon is garnish, or at best a condiment.  If you're writing to express a point of view, it defeats the purpose if the point is expressed in such a way that the reader would go, "Huh?".</div>

Technically speaking, Lee has committed one glaring error.  While his lexicon is obviously suited to more formal or academic writing, he takes some liberties with his grammar, starting sentences with "and" and "or", and "it's" instead of "it is" in writing.  There seems to be an inconsistent applicaton of standards here.<br><br>Then again, that point is academic (pardon the pun).  Prolix says, "I enjoy using words to convey precisely what other words can't".  Well and good, but that applies only upon the condition that "other words can't".  In the case of Lee's writing, the same message can be precisely conveyed in much simpler language.<br><br>This brings us to Beyond Religion's point.  There's no doubt that the Engrand is very powderful, but is the Engrand <span style="text-decoration: underline;">too</span> powderful?  Personally, I believe it is, especially if the objective is to clearly convey a message, as Prolix proposes.<br><br>Eight years of university drove me in the direction of never saying something in ten words when it could be said in five, but the objective there was to fit as much information as possible into a non-negotiable word limit.  These days, writing in that manner would not be acceptable, because my clients do not have my training - they want the message expressed as simply and as clearly as possible.  Hey, for a hundred grand a pop, I'd write it in Swahili if they wanted, but I digress.<br><br>At the risk of sounding corny, let's not miss the forest for the trees here.  The aim of language is communication, plain and simple - and Beyond Religion's simple and clear title, "Writing to be understood", could not be a more clear example of this.  Extended lexicon is garnish, or at best a condiment.  If you're writing to express a point of view, it defeats the purpose if the point is expressed in such a way that the reader would go, "Huh?".</div></blockquote>The ST Forum accomodates diverse writers and readers from students to professors.

If nineteen of them can provide you with a correct definition, I'll say I stand corrected.

(Online forum, April 20) reflects his constant worrying about 'wannabes coalescing around a Western cultural core'.<br><br>In his article, Mr Wong has presented an idealistic, Â“good old daysÂ” view of Â“ChinesenessÂ” instead of a realistic one.  The Mandarin-speaking, Confucian-Taoist intellectual image of Chineseness does not apply to all Chinese people - villagers in China still speak dialects instead of Mandarin, many modern Chinese mix English with Mandarin.  These Chinese donÂ’t fit Mr WongÂ’s description of Chineseness, but does this mean they are not Chinese?<br><br>Mr Wong recommends that we should educate our children and let them make up their minds about their ethnicity.  Look at how Chinese villagers still resist the governmentÂ’s efforts to unify China under a Mandarin-speaking culture Â– do you think it will work?<br><br>Culture evolves instead of staying unchanged.  For example, China-Chineseness, Malaysian-Malayness and Indian-Indianness have become Singapore Chineseness, Malayness and Indianness in Singapore.  Because cultures evolve, deculturalisation is impossible.  Also, comparing oneÂ’s culture to that of oneÂ’s ancestors does not make sense because cultures are transformed over time.<br><br>Cultural evolution also takes time.  The Swiss have taken seven centuries to incorporate their German, Italian and French communities into a Swiss culture, without betraying any of the three original cultures.  Similarly, Brazilians have blended European, African and Amerindian sub-cultures into their culture.  Both peoples are proud of their culture Â– just try telling them that their culture is diluted!  Singapore is only a few decades old and should not rush things.<br><br>Mr WongÂ’s claims he is against bigotry, but his rant about 'anglophiles' and 'westophiles' (which are vaguely defined) reflects what white supremacists say in white countries to an alarming degree.  His idea of Asianness is based on Chinese culture and excludes other Asian cultures - couldn't he sense our minorities' insecurities?  If Mr Wong was Swiss-German and attacked Swiss-Germans for Â“cultural betrayalÂ”, the accusation would create tensions between the majority Swiss-German community and the minorities.</blockquote>The above weighs in at 332 words compared to Lee's 383.  Obviously, given the subject matter, there were limits to the extent to which "Sec One level" English could be applied.<br><br>Given how each of us has a vested interest in the judgement of how well the above expresses Lee's points, I would suggest that we get the other forum members to read it and provide their verdict.[/quote]</div>
