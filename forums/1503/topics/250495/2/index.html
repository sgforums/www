Surely Bertrand Russell ("It is a waste of energy to be angry with a man who behaves badly, just as it is to be angry with a car that won't go" ) and Raymond Chandler ("Chess is as elaborate a waste of human intelligence as you can find outside an advertising agency" ) are two examples to the contrary that spring immediately to mind, and more non-Singaporean examples should quite easily be found.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Prolix:</div><div class="quote_body">Lee may prefer time debating this spent on letters - if published - with a wider audience potential.</div></blockquote>Once again, I assert that if a wider audience was what he wanted, he has done himself a great disservice with his writing style.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Prolix:</div><div class="quote_body">All I'm saying is that different folks have different - however unconventional - reasons to want their letters published.

You're the one who chose to do so, and in trying to be as smart as you think you are, you've made a dog's breakfast of things.  Now if you wish to speak of matters Freudian, your accusing me of hitting below the belt as you yourself resort to personal attacks is a classic case of projection.<br><br>You're the one who decided to step into a foreign patch only to find yourself in the middle of a minefield.  Deal with it - I'm not here to bail you out.<br><br>This is hilarious.  Weren't you the one honking about being a - what was that term? - "precisionist", and now you want to hide your sloppiness behind the aegis of "everyday applications of technical terms"?  I've shown on no uncertain terms that you're wrong.  Play amateur psychoanalyst all you want - that doesn't change the fact that you're wrong and that I've shown it.<br><br>Mind you, if another psychologist has said what you had, I would certainly not have been as restrained in my response, and had I committed the same error, I would have accepted the rebuke with good grace.  Then again, psychologists are professionally obliged to avoid being that sloppy.<br><br>How many times do I have to tell you that it is not, and never was, my intention to discuss Singaporean politics in this thread.  Let me spell it out for you once again:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]I assert that Lee's writing is inappropriate for the ST Forum.</span></strong><br><br>That's it.  Singaporean politics is per se beyond the scope of this thread so stop distracting yourself.<br><br>Stop, take a deep breath, count to ten and think about it - what's the title of this thread?  Is it "Writing to be understood" or is it "Singapore's cultural orientation"?<br><br>Get a grip, have a Ritalin, wipe that froth from your mouth and either get back on track or pack up your toys and go home.  Sheesh.[/b]</blockquote>You don't sound very rational, professional or 'psychologistic'. Your epitaph : 'You're wrong and I've shown it' - in an asylum cemetery - should appear in a Non Sequitur cartoon. Pursuing desperate debate with an 'unequal' sounds at best self-insulting if not masochistic. Like in psychosis, the self-deluding can't/won't admit it.<br><br>Have the last word - as usual, crazos can't resist temptation.</div>

You misused terms and unlike you, I donÂ’t just make vague pronouncements about whether or not you sound a particular part, I showed you exactly where you were wrong.  Your refusal to acknowledge the facts here simply raises another one of your Freudian foibles Â– denial.<br><br>Facts are facts are facts, and theyÂ’re all here on this thread to see.  Even my telling you that IÂ’ve shown how you are wrong is a fact as the evidence here shows.  If you cannot cope with my simple statement of a fact, yet another fact is simple: youÂ’re the one with the problem.<br><br>Not only are you wrong, you obviously donÂ’t practice what you preach.  For all of your platitudes about being a precisionist, I have shown that you are in fact sloppy and slipshod in use of your terms.  I make absolutely no apologies about bringing your airy aspirations down in flames Â– the facts bear out that theyÂ’re all hokum anyway.<br><br>How many posts has it been since you announced that you would ever-so-graciously let me have the last word?  Three?  If you want come back for more every time I flick you aside, whoÂ’s the masochist who canÂ’t resist temptation?<br><br>You bleat about my taking advantage of your not being professionally trained, but at the same time you want to decree that I donÂ’t sound 'psychologistic' Â– a neologism if there ever was one Â– as if pretending to be a member of the profession.  A case of narcissism, or wanting to keep your cake and eat it?<br><br>ItÂ’s very simple.  I ask no quarter and give none.  If you wish to impersonate a psychologist by talking about issues you cannot grasp, donÂ’t expect me to let it slide because I really donÂ’t care if you canÂ’t deal with being told youÂ’re wrong.  It doesnÂ’t matter if you are a psychologist or not Â– you assumed that you knew about terms such as mania and narcissism and ended up misusing them, and who you and where you came from does not change the fact that you are wrong.  That itÂ’s me instead of anyone else, psychologist or otherwise, telling you that you are wrong is of no consequence, except that perhaps you might have to put in a bit more work looking for excuses were I not a psychologist.<br><br>What hallucinogenic substance drives you to believe that I am debating you about psychological terms?  Why would I waste my time debating psychology with someone who knows nothing about the subject matter?  DonÂ’t take it as a debate Â– take it as badly-needed education for you.<br><br>Now youÂ’ve now even shown that you fail to understand the meaning of the word debate.  WhatÂ’s your excuse this time?  Is it some professional term?<br><br></div>
