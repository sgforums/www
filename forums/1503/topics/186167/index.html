            <div class='col-md body'>Hello expiringpoet,<br><br>I truly enjoy this piece.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I am sure those who are married have been through this stage, including me. (Although those not married may also shared similar experience)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Now back to the poem.<br><br>IÂ’ve read all your poems in your blog including this and I have a few questions in mind. Firstly are there any reasons for the way you break your lines? If you read the poem aloud what happen is that the flow gets too disruptive. It staggers like a drunken man. I am fine with short lines but in my opinion you need to have valid reasons for having too many one word lines in your poem.<br><br>Secondly, any reasons for the way your capitalized your words? Some poets prefer to capitalize at the beginning of every line and some at the beginning of a sentence. It is entirely up to you but you need to be consistent.<br><br>Lastly, regarding punctuation and again you need to be consistent.<br><br>As for the content of the poem, I like your choice of words.<br><br>At first impression , phrases like Â“political centreÂ”, Â“administrationÂ”, Â“IntelligenceÂ”, Â“cultural ExchangesÂ”, Â“labelledÂ” etc. clearly reflect the bureaucratic nature of the marriage where lines are clearly drawn and power struggles is the norm of the day. Moreover words like Â“intrudeÂ”, Â“fearÂ”, Â“stealÂ”, Â“violent incursionÂ” further paint a marriage in trouble.<br><br>However, maybe because of the way this poem is structured, if you read this poem aloud, it is not as dark as it seems to be.  The tone is light and even a bit cheeky. (cheeky may not be a good word but I canÂ’t help using it)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>If you intended this to be a serious poem, in my opinion you have failed because the tone is inconsistent with the word choice.  But if you intended this to be a light-hearted piece in disguise, I say well done!<br><br>Keep up the good work!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

The side that he or she may not want to share. Thus the hard words like "intrude" or "steal".<br>That two people living and sleeping together have 2 very different idealogies and principles.<br>Having said that, yes, its meant to be light-humoured in a dark way- if this makes sense at all...hmm...</div>

Try reading it aloud to get a sense of its tone and rhythm.  For a start, read up on linebreaks and caesura.<br><br><strong>Having said that, yes, its meant to be light-humoured in a dark way- if this makes sense at all...hmm...</strong><br><br>Yup it does make sense.<br><br>I think you can keep the poem as it is or maybe try to beef it up a bit.
