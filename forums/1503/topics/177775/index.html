            <div class='col-md body'>Here's the poem I'd mentioned about.

Like an<br>emollient unguent your essence worms gangrenous<br>into liverspotted skin; A half-worn lyric,<br>a half-healed thorn: you're all of them.<br>I'm afraid (say it!) that you'll never be gone.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It would explain why some people never see how their partners can be such jerks to others when they are with them, and that they sometimes start acting the same way. So I guess, it might not just be turning a blind eye!<br><br>Another clear example would be a man being very possessive and checks his partner by calling every hour, and the woman (although she complains about this at first) starts expecting him to check on her otherwise she becomes insecure. If we look to your poem for the explaination, both would be possessive, since these acts would ensure that each other is watchful of the other. Although the methods are different, they serve the same purpose.<br><br>Even if the second skin is not permanent, I think it takes a long time to fall away.</div>
