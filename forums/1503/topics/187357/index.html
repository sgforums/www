International conventions and agreements obligate the member countries and World Trade Organisation member countries (including Singapore) to grant uniform protection for copyright works as laid down in these conventions/agreements. The protection of a work by a Singapore resident would be as though the work was made by those countries' residents. The protection in most countries is also automatic in that there is no need to register in order to be conferred protection. However countries such as Canada and the US provide for registration to facilitate proof of copyright in infringement proceedings.<br><br>Singapore, under the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement, grants protection to copyright works created by nationals or residents of countries that are signatories of the Berne Convention and WTO member countries.<br><br>The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, a convention on copyright for authors' works and films that is administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).<br><br>A list of countries party to the Berne Convention may be found at the WIPO website www.wipo.int.<br>The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) (1994) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).  A list of member countries of the WTO may be found at the WTO website at www.wto.org.<br></blockquote>Further info on the TRIPS agreement, in particular the Berne Convention: <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm7_e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm7_e.htm</a><br><br>It says,<br><br><blockquote><strong>Copyright </strong><br><br>The TRIPS agreement ensures that computer programs will be protected as literary works under the Berne Convention and outlines how databases should be protected.<br><br>It also expands international copyright rules to cover rental rights. Authors of computer programs and producers of sound recordings must have the right to prohibit the commercial rental of their works to the public. A similar exclusive right applies to films where commercial rental has led to widespread copying, affecting copyright-ownersÂ’ potential earnings from their films.<br><br>The agreement says performers must also have the right to prevent unauthorized recording, reproduction and broadcast of live performances (bootlegging) for no less than 50 years. Producers of sound recordings must have the right to prevent the unauthorized reproduction of recordings for a period of 50 years.</blockquote>The creation of written content, online or otherwise, is covered as intellectual property. So all you have to do is to draft the right <strong>cease-and-desist </strong>letter.<br><br>As for safeguards... Javascript, and if you really wanna (which I'm considering but have yet to enact), write a robot script so Google won't cache it.<br><br>The reason why I'm not wild about the latter is 'cos it's harder to proof plagiarism -- as an online blogging medium, I could be accused of altering dates -- so Google Cache, in this instance, will be an independent verifier.<br><br>It's good to have a knowledge of law, sometimes. -shrug.<br><br></div>
