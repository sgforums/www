Maybe the tense is not very consistent. Need to edit that, i suppose.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Flower Bud<br><br>The rushing tide removed so quickly<br>my footprints in the sand </strong><br><br>These two lines are redundant. Why?  Because they are not connected to the rest of the poem or should I say they do not contribute to the overall structure of the poem.<br><br><strong>I took another breath as I<br>laid conscientious eye<br>upon her tiny hand. </strong><br><br>I am not too comfortable with the word Â“conscientiousÂ” here. Can you find a better word to replace it? Maybe it is just me.<br><br><strong>My baby gripped so soft yet tightly<br>the finger I laid in her palm<br>as it unfolded soft and pink<br>unfurled a flower bud in spring<br>and soothed my nervous calm. </strong><br><br>I like this strophe although I still think it needs some trimming. For example Â“grippedÂ” are closely associates with Â“tightlyÂ” thus you may need to consider rewrite this line. However Â“unfurled a flower bud in spring / and soothed my nervous calmÂ” is excellent. Love it.<br><br><strong>So insecure, so frail, so new<br>I held her hands close to my face </strong><br><br>You have Â“handÂ” in L5 and Â“handsÂ” in L12 Â– so which one is it going to be? Another problem I have i.e. Â“So insecure, so frail, so newÂ” are you referring to her hands or your face?<br><br><strong>I drew a breath of baby skin<br>like flower petals, soft and thin<br>the floral fragrance I did embrace. </strong><br><br>I like the sound and the image presented here. But Â“I did embraceÂ” is a bit forced for my liking.<br><br><strong>Each digit is a living thing<br>A part of something bigger still:<br>No, not the palm, which unites function,<br>nor the wrists, where hand is junction<br>but purity of love and will. </strong><br><br>Now you are losing me. Abstractions, clichÃ©s, etc. This is quite weak.<br><br><strong>And now as moments passed into each other<br>and consciousness floats on a cloud<br>her hands grew still within mine own<br>her curls caressed by breezes blown,<br>into a slumber Iffah curls into a floral shroud. </strong><br><br>Again the abstractions and clichÃ©s are on the loose. But the main problem is Â“floral shroud.Â” I am not sure if it is the right phrase to use here.<br><br>You seem to have some knowledge in alliteration. You have some interesting images and youÂ’ve managed to maintain the tone and mood throughout your poem. Whatever you like to hear from me or not, my advice for you is stay away from abstractions and clichÃ©s. Good luck in your writing.<br><br></div>
