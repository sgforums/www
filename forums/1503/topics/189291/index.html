            <div class='col-md body'>Most people do prefer rhyming ones. It's a matter of personal preference really, and nothing to apologise for if you prefer one kind of poetry over others. I hardly think there will be fanboys who will flame you for liking 'poems that rhyme'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>When people say they like poem that rhyme, they mean the ones that end with rhyme, but some poems have rhymes in the middle of the line, or they have slant rhymes.<br><br>&gt;&gt;"what do you guys think are the limitations of each"<br><br>IMHO, they are not guided by such things. It's the only the skill of the poet that limits each. Poems can be done with or without rhyme; some poets are better at writing certain kinds or forms of poems. I don't think there are advantages or disadvantage over one form or the other -- it's not a game system where you can compare things like whether Xbox360 is better than a PS3.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Quite frankly, I would find people calling you amateur for liking rhyming poems and being able to write limericks rather amateurish.  If you do write catchy limericks, you should share them with us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  We could always use a limerick or two around here.</div>

It is taken from one of my blog.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Two weeks ago I Â“pmÂ” Donna, one of the several moderators in PFFA regarding the differences between free verse and blank verse. I think her reply makes good sense, so I am posting it here to share with you guys. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>My question:</strong><br><br>Â“Hello Donna,<br><br>It is me again. I need to clarify something and I am not sure whom to turn to. You are the first person that comes to my mind. Hope you donÂ’t mind.<br><br>I really need to get this straight, is the following correct?<br><br>Poems,<br><br>Without meter, without rhyme = free verse<br><br>With meter, with rhyme = Most traditional forms, such as sonnets, etc<br><br>With meter, without rhyme = blank verse<br><br>Without meter, with rhyme = Bad poems<br><br>Thanks.Â”<br><br><strong>Her reply:</strong><br><br>Â“To answer your questions, here are some definitions to consider:<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Without meter, without rhyme = free verse</strong></span><br><br><strong>Free Verse</strong> Â– Poetry without any set meter; lines may break either when the unit of syntax is complete or midway through the syntactic unit (phrase, clause or sentence). [From Mary Kinzie's A Poet's Guide to Poetry]<br><br><strong>Free Verse</strong> Â– A fluid form which conforms to no set rules of traditional versification. The free in free verse refers to the freedom from fixed patterns of meter and rhyme, but writers of free verse employ familiar poetic devices such as assonance, alliteration, imagery, caesure, figures of speech etc., and their rhythmic effects are dependent on the syllabic cadences emerging from the context. The term is often used in its French language form, vers libre. [From Bob's Byway of Poetic Terms]<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>With meter, with rhyme = Most traditional forms, such as sonnets, etc</strong></span><br><br>Most traditional forms have a set metrical and rhyme pattern. The pattern is determined by the form, with some variations allowed.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>With meter, without rhyme = blank verse</strong></span><br><br><strong>Blank Verse</strong> Â– Unrhymed iambic pentameter lines (five iambs per line), with occasional--and necessary--enjambment. The "blank" denoted absence of rhyme. [From Mary Kinzie's A Poet's Guide to Poetry]<br><br><strong>Blank Verse</strong> Â– Poetry written without rhymes, but which retains a set metrical pattern, usually iambic pentameter (five iambic feet per line) in English verse. Since it is a very flexible form, the writer not being hampered in the expression of thought or syntactic structure by the need to rhyme, it is used extensively in narrative and dramatic poetry. In lyric poetry, blank verse is adaptable to lengthy descriptive and meditative poems.<br><br>Sidelight Â– Blank verse and free verse are often misunderstood or confused. A good way to remember the difference is to think of the word blank as meaning that the ends of the lines where rhymes would normally appear are "blank," i.e., devoid of rhyme; the free in free verse refers to the freedom from fixed patterns of traditional versification.[From Bob's Byway of Poetic Terms]<br><br>Now, want to confuse things by adding <strong>Free Blank Verse </strong>into the mix?<br><br><strong>Free Blank Verse</strong> Â– Verse that still exhibits the length and alternation of weak with strong syllables prominent in Blank Verse, but with significant loosening of the iambic pentameter model. [From Mary Kinzie's A Poet's Guide to Poetry]<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Without meter, with rhyme = Bad poems</strong></span><br><br>Rhyme usually goes hand in hand with meter; however, there are successful poems written using slant rhymes, internal rhymes, etc. But, yes, as a rule, most beginners tend to concentrate on the rhyme scheme without meter and sacrifice the poem to a poorly constructed rhyme scheme."<br><br>-------------------------------------------------<br><br>In a nutshell, if you want to write a rhyming poem, you have to take meter into consideration.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But don't need to worry too much lah since we are all beginners here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
