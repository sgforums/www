            <div class='col-md body'>Some days raining heavily like this can be depressing but today it is revitalizing.<br><br>I just broke up with my boyfriend. Finally after months.<br>Â‘WowÂ’ I was like thinking to myself never dreaming to initiate the break-up.<br>Â‘Ah well I was feeling moody so better to break up now than laterÂ’ I think silently.<br>Our relationship have been on and off for reason only known to us.<br><br>I was walking another way back as I deviate from my usual way home. As I passed by the traffic, I felt an indescribable feeling overcome me. Then suddenly, I went out cold.<br><br>When I awoke, I saw the dark overlying sky above me and felt water around me. I stared wondering what the heck happened. Then I heard voices coming nearer, slowly I got up wincing from aches here and there. Look like I bump here n there on the way to wherever I am anyway. Deciding to take it slowly, as it seems something unknown is happening around here. I saw bushes of greenery around chose a dense one and hide behind it. The people talking walked past by and I decided to follow them. The party consists of 3 guys and 1 female all riding seemly gentle horses except that when I look into their eyes I know they can kill if need be. Shuddering I follow at a distance for surely they will have heard me if I follow any closer.<br><br>The leader whom I at least guess to be leads the party of four, though all wore dark hooded robes I could sense an aura of power around him. The second guy talking non-stop to him beside him on first sight seems guileless but an aura of magik flow around him. A lady on the other side sits gently while looking around her with caution. Lastly the guy whom I assumed to be a sort of rear guard followed closely behind loosely. Hours later just as I begin to think they will never stop. The leader stops and announces to rest for the night. I nearly faint with relief thinking I was going to faints sooner or later. Soon the party set up tents and a fire roaring away, and scents of roasted meat waft to me. Withholding my hunger, I looked around for a suitable place to rest also. I saw a huge tree with plenty of canopy around to lie on. I climb up with little difficulty as in my world I swim a lot that sorts of strengthens my arms.<br><br>Soon nights fall, as I sit eating fruits I plucked on the way, I watch them and soon they begin to talk of their journey and what lies ahead. Although they have taken off their hood, but it was dark so I could not see their faces. The leader was talking about whatever war, which I soon tune out due to the fact that I was feeling uneasy as I sense something foreboding coming to the area in which we rest on. Ever since I come to this god know what place, I have been sensing a lots of things which I know may not be normal in my world and which is normal here, actually normal for me, for even then in my world, my ability to sense was somewhat unusual in a sense whereby anything untoward were to happened I will know, though not knowing what the matter was I somehow knew what will happen.<br><br>...to be continued...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Part 2 here  Enjoys!</strong></span><br><br>True enough the sounds of gallops were heard and shouts to surrender were heard. With misgivings and curiosity, I look at the scene below but I observe as the four fight hand-to-hand combat with the army of 30 soldiers that I count up to. Not even a few minutes have gone by, and all 30 soldiers were settled. Then they packed up and continue on their way. Just when I was about to climb down the tree, two men come out from behind a boulder on the other side, the taller guy was speaking in low tones. Luckily I could lip read.<br><br>Tall guy was saying: Â“Shackles! our ambush failed, what now Rodney?Â”<br>The shorter guy Rodney replied: Â“Relax Malino, there will be more ahead, they would always be luckyÂ”<br>Malino: Â“Fine, they are free for now, but I need to take that thing soon or else IÂ’m doomedÂ”<br>Rodney: Â“No worry, you will have itÂ”<br>Then another guy rode to their side and say to both men: Â“ Sirs, we are ready to ride to Hucklemen FortressÂ”.<br>Rodney: Â“Noted, Captain Norman, please lead the wayÂ”<br><br>A while after they left, I climb down cautiously. Picking around the dead bodies, I look in disgust at the dead bodies but knowing what will lies ahead, I need some things. Scavenging here and there, I soon found bags of gems and coins, which I assume to be the mode of payments here. Then I found some usable clothes and realise I need to change into their medieval clothes. Weapons which I could use or sell, some horses that had been frightened off but they still hang around the area. I mused since their horse could be frightened, which only stand to reason that their former master were so lousy in battle.<br><br>Within an hour, I have plucked most of which I could use, and with some horses and mares, after which I have stripped them of their colors for their whatever clan, I continue to follow the party whom left earlier on. Somehow I just know where they went. True enough after a while I saw them on the next hill. With horses I could follow discreetly and at the same time I could disguise as a horse merchant or as a wandering traveller. Now all I need was a horse wagon, luckily I know some basic carpentry from past experience, and with remnants of the battle remains, I repairs the horse wagon the dead soldiers had rode but was left by the roadside in the midst of battle. Along the way, I poked here and there and by the third night I had managed to repair and returned the horse wagon to more than its former glory. Â‘What a relief!Â’ I thought as I would not have to face the rain and sun along the way for the weather was harsh here.<br><br>Soon I saw a village, and saw them got into a sort of inn ahead. I follow at a sedate pace but along the way I manage to peek here and there as well as listening to the villagers bargaining for good prices. After hearing most of which I have to know, I went straight to the horse merchant and start haggling for a good prices, before long I walk away with a few more bags of coins, spied a few stall which sold clothes and one which buy used clothes, I discreetly sell clothes at a medium price which made the stall owner happy, and she gossip away.<br><br>Â“Traveller, you are not from around here, so be careful, as a token of your kindness, I warn you there have been robbery by bandits along the road recently, so behold your richesÂ” said the lady kindly.<br><br>Â“Thanks Milady, I appreciate your kindness, now would you kindly me provide me information of the best wares here, I would like to purchase for others towns ahead,Â” I asked in merriment.<br><br>Â“Sure look at those stall with yellow banners, best in the villages and fairy priced tooÂ” replied the lady cheerfully.<br><br>With a thank I walked around and I bump into someone, looking up I realize he was the leader I had met earlier on but I recover instantly. He apologised and walked away soon after. Â‘What a guy! But he was handsome.Â’ I thought. Soon feeling tired I retreat to the inn I saw them in.<br><br>Asking for a room, I went to the room to rest and ponder over the reasons why I was here in the first place. Other people may have screamed in despair but not me, I know myself and I can easily adapt anywhere anytime. With this in mind I analyze what had happened since the beginning, firstly I obviously come here through a portal set up by someone, and knowing it was set up purposely, obviously I was supposed to come here for a reason. But what irked me were not the set-up but the anonymous person who never thought to ask for my permission. Mentally I think of ways to torture that person.<br><br>Soon I feel hungry, I decided to go down for a meal. But before that I need to pack and clear my things for readiness to leave anytime the other four go as I felt uneasy being left alone, and beside that I saw them first since I come, so my being here may have a bit to do with them. First I packed my things bearing the ladyÂ’s warning in mind, I packed all valuables into different bags and to be hidden here and there in conspicuous places going with the mind of one if in conspicuous places, one is unlikely to look again.<br><br>When I reached the room that I assumed to be the dining area, I went in saw an empty seat beside them, and amble there. A lady come asking for my orders, not knowing what to order seeing no menu around I ask what is the special, and was told dinner was a few dishes and a mug of grog at least that is what I thought I heard. Smiling I ask for special.<br><br>While waiting the leader walk over, Â“Mistress, I apologized for the incident this morning,Â” the guy say.<br>Shaking my head, I replied: Â“Nope sir no one was hurt, no need for apologiesÂ”<br>Â“Then mistress, do care to join my friends and meÂ” the guy invited.<br>Â“SureÂ” I say.<br><br>Going over the leader introduced himself as Ryan, the lady as Meg, the talkative guy as Roy his younger brother and the last guy to be Edward.<br>Noting that they do not say their last name, I introduce myself as Ria following their example. Meg looked at me strangely, to which I smiled to her asking anything the matter. Meg stares at me for a while before asking me where I come from, ready with a story, I named a town in a remote place. She looked some more then settle for my answer grudgingly. Looking at her, I thank whatever god this world have for I had bought a map earlier on and had done my homework as to how this world lives.<br><br>After dinner, just as I was about to go up to my room, a commotion happened outside the inn, being curious and everyone going to have a look, I went to have a look only to recoil in horror.<br><br>To be Continued...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There stand 2 guys trying to force a stallion to move using a whip, shouting could be heard.<br>The stallion neighed and shakes off the 2 men before galloping to my side. All around me as bystanders run away, I stood there entranced by the beauty of the stallion. Ryan took my arm and made to escape the path of the stallion, but I shake him off and held my hands out to the stallion to smell. Being with horses for days and having no baths, my whole body would have been covered in the scents of horse. The stallion sniffs before finally licking my hands. The two men then come over to take away the stallion, but I hold them and ask for the price.<br><br>One say Â‘I want to kill him not sell himÂ’ but another take longer to reply but he finally quoted Â“2000 goldsÂ”, I knew it was daylight robbery but stillÂ…<br>Then Roy says: Â“Hey man, that was too muchÂ”<br>Holding out a hand I stopped Roy, twinkling my eyes. I turned around and begin to haggle which by now I surmised to be a favourite pastime hobby for this age.<br>Finally with smiles on their faces which of course as they walk away with 1500 golds. Ryan then scolded or rather nagged that I spend too much on just a horse. But I smiled beguilingly which stopped Ryan and he just sighed.<br><br>Turning around, I look critically at the stallion before pronouncing he needs a bath. The four then proceeds to show me to the barn. All five of us have fun washing the stallion. Finally I looked at him and think, the stallion looked at me in the eye, I stare entranced by the beautiful yet hurt soul of the stallion. The stallion was as dark as night, a temper as fierce as its courage. A star-shaped blaze stands out on his forehead.<br><br>Â“Midnight Sky you shall be named,Â” I say after which a feeling of rightness lingered in the background. My four friends looked at me and Midnight bemused by what is happening.<br><br>Â“Well! Ria would you like to join us on the trip to Aero Town,Â” asked Meg.<br>Looking at them I saw the rest agreeing, and so I replied Â“Sure, I need company anywayÂ”<br><br>After putting Midnight in his stall for the night, I went to bed dreaming. I awoke once after a dream over which I mused over for a while before I realize I got to rest. Back to the dream I tossed around.<br><br>The next morning, with the wagon and 2 other horses side-by-side with Midnight, they look shocked and finally Meg asked if I need to bring three horses?<br><br>I replied: Â“Of course not, I was going to sell another horse today, but still I will be keeping one to pull the wagon, to place things,Â”<br>Â“Well! What a relief I thought you gonna bring both, hey can I have a nap inside sometime,Â” exclaimed Roy looking inside the wagon.<br>Â“Why not,Â” I say.<br><br>After selling off another horse, five of us continued on the journey.<br><br>With an unknown feeling since we left the village, I looked back and spied something shining among the bushes, sensing nothing dangerous, I pretend not to have seen whoever was there. At the same time I wonder about the dream last night. In the dream I was searching for something, and I could sense others searching for the same thing. At the time when others chased me I awoke by then. Analyzing the dream I realize I am nearer to my destiny whatever it is.<br><br>After a while, Ryan called for a stopover for the night. I saw a stream earlier on and ask Meg if she want to have a bath who readily agrees to the idea.<br><br>As we bath we talk, Meg asked me questions to which I cleverly evade. Then all of a sudden, huge monsters appeared at least they appear to be to me. Without further words, we mutually grab our clothes and run to our camp only to find our way blocked by one extremely huge monster blocking us. Meg suddenly say some words that I could not understand but next I saw the monster being burned alive. Then we run but it was too late, we were surrounded. Thinking quickly for our life depends on it, I mentally calculate how high the lowest branch is. Next moment I run straight for the tree shouting for Meg to follow me. With a high jump I caught the lowest branch and swing myself up before swinging down to grab MegÂ’s hand and swing up. Quickly I motioned for Meg to walk fast and to our camp where we saw the other three guys surrounded by monsters. I looked at Meg and place a finger to my lip which Meg understood and nodded. Soon enough the monsters left taking Ryan, Roy and Edward with them.<br><br>Meg made to follow but I stopped Meg.<br><br>Â“Meg, stay calm,Â” I say coolly.<br>Â“Of course you can stay calm, you are not close to them,Â” Meg nearly screamed hysterically.<br>Â“Meg!Â” I say warningly.<br><br>While Meg just sits down, I gather our entire thing packed up, put out the fire and soon ready to leave. Looking at Meg still sitting on the ground, I gently drag Meg into the wagon. Sitting in front of the wagon to which I have hitch all six horses together to which I was surprised the monster had not took them away too. Thinking of what happened, I did not notice Meg sneaking away on her mare, to which I noticed too late as she rode away. Sighing I drove faster.<br><br>A while later I come to a bustling town which I assume to be Aero Town. Entering the village I saw colorful banners, asking around I soon find out there were to be a tournament that day. I follow the crowd who was going to the town square with a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu and a feeling that something were to happened, but with no other alternative I have no choice but to join in the crowd.<br><br>There were games with prizes which I try my hands at and win some. Finally the time come for the tournament to start.<br><br>Â“People, behold the ruler of Camboline, the tournament today were organized by his honored lady for all to rejoice in,Â” say the man in front loudly.<br><br>Â“Bang!Â” the tournament has started.<br><br>I look on disinterestedly but I continued to look for my friends who I have come to care for through the journey we had gone through.<br><br>Soon it was almost the end, and then the guy who announced earlier on announced something.<br><br>Â“Behold all you here!Â” Â“We have here three guys who are traitor to Camboline!Â”<br>The crowd becomes quiet.<br><br>Hearing this I look up and saw Ryan, Roy and Edward clapped in iron. No sight of Meg so far to which I look worried but soon forgot as I realize what will happened next. They were to be executed.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Cont'd</span></span>   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â“Hold, His Majesty have ask to release the three traitor and to have them fight three of our best mans as a trialÂ” shouted the man.<br><br>It is then I realized what would happen, it has all happened before, it is no wonder as I have dreamt about this just the night before. With this knowledge I looked around for Meg but could find not even a hair of her.<br><br>Despairing but calm and collected I look on to their duel.<br><br>Edward was the first to fight, his opponent was as grumpy as Edward but I could see that Edward was more calmer and more silently than his opponent named Jero judging from the names the crowd called him. At first Jero was getting the upper hand with his nimbleness but Edward with everlasting stamina outlasts Jero and won the first round.<br><br>Roy was next, I have to give him credit as well after he managed to get out of his opponentÂ’s agile swordplay combined with magik at work. Roy won the second round as well on a marginal score.<br><br>Lastly was Ryan, he was to duel with the KingsÂ’ champion, Dexter. As I looked at the two facing each other, I noticed Meg on the other side looking at them as well.<br><br>Well! All are here as I spied Rodney and Malino by their MajestiesÂ’ side grinning evilly. I could not stand the sights of them but I have to see what is happening before I could do anything.<br><br>As I looked back I saw both men with injuries on themselves and as I watched both were equally matched both in skills and strategies. Then to my horror Ryan fell backward and Dexter followed with a slash to RyanÂ’sÂ’ body when Meg throw a fireball which Dexter deflects without difficultly, and then chaos ensues as everyone run from the highly dangerous battle about to happened right there on the tournament square.<br><br>Soon I found myself standing by the side alone. And my four friends surrounded by soldiers.<br><br>Dexter called to disperse the soldiers, which I could see obeys the champion willingly and immediately which more than accounts for the championsÂ’ leadership.<br><br>Ryan requested for an audience with the king and queen and was granted access immediately.<br><br>Â“King Aden, may I ask who say we are traitor when in fact we are loyal to Your MajestyÂ” Ryan say respectfully.<br><br>Â“It was us, you traitors, if I had not told the king you would have still carry on selling information to King Fiono,Â” say Malino distastefully.<br><br>Â‘What the hellÂ’, I thought rather it should be the both of you who are traitors.<br><br>King Aden listened as I observed and as he speak I know at once this one here is just and fair along with his gentle queen by his side.<br><br>But before King Aden could pronounce RyanÂ’s and his companionsÂ’ fate, what happened next no one could have know. Shrieks were heard in the air as numerous birds fly down for the king. Both Dexter and Ryan being the nearest to the king fight the birds with their swords. I saw Meg struggling with Malino when a pearl-like crystal dropped out onto the ground rolling to where I stand. Unwillingly I picked up the crystal, and time ceased to exist for me as I held the crystal in my hand.<br><br>Â“Catch the girl and hand the crystal to me!Â” screamed Rodney.<br><br>As I hold the crystal longer, a sense of warmth flows in me, and a white light shroud me covering me in holy light and I wove my first magic in this world. For all see me as an ordinary girl but in truth I am not what I seems to be.<br><br>All too soon, the battle end as time freeze for both Rodney and Malino at least and all the Birds above too.<br><br>Amazed but mindfully of the recent battle, King Aden asked all present to rest before having a talk again.<br><br>I were shown to a suite whereby I bath in peace. After I feel fully cleansed only then do I dressed myself and just in time too for a knock at the door. I opened and in came Ryan followed by Roy, Edward and Meg walk into the room with grim faces. Sighing I know I was in for a long afternoon. Might as well sit comfortable as I walk toward the bed. Ryan made the first move.<br><br>Â“Who are you?Â” asked Ryan<br><br>cont'd    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
