            <div class='col-md body'>hi preya, absent from here for some time!<br><br>okay, your poem is a bit too abstract for me, but i detect a tone of disillusion in your writing. Actually, i think you started the poem well, the 1st stanza is attention grabbing, esp the part about "Cupping the stars and hoping that they plummet". It leads the reader to think why u are angry.<br>i like the part comparing stars to santa's traffic lights, it's a good analogy (why doesn't DP like it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br>it looks like u are disillusioned with religion, your 2nd &amp; 3rd stanzas suggest, but i'm not sure. i am also not sure about "the shamed moon".<br>Overall, i think it's a good effort <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you for your thoughtful critique, DeadPoet! I always appreciate it!<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by DeadPoet:<br><strong>[b]Someday, IÂ’m just going to<br>say I give<br>up<br>And throw my hands<br>into the air<br>Cupping the stars and hoping that they<br>plummet </strong><br><br>What is the difference between Â“Someday, IÂ’m just going to say I give up Â…Â” and Â“Someday, IÂ’m going to give up Â…Â”? I like what you are doing here.</blockquote>The difference is slight; whether it's just words, or actual giving up. I think I'd prefer the phrase 'say I give up' because there's less certainty in it, and it sounds more weak and unsure. Which, I think, fits in better with the whole 'someday I'll do this and someday I'll be that'. The whole poem kinda sounds like a really weak threat, don't you think? Like those threats people make, saying they'll commit suicide or hurt themselves and so on.<br><br>Hm, I don't actually know. Honestly, I wasn't thinking about that choice of phrasing whilst writing this.<br><br><blockquote><strong>What a very mean thing to think<br>Santa claus wonÂ’t be very happy<br>to find that you wished his<br>traffic lights dead<br>YouÂ’ll regret this<br>as soon as the first snow<br>falls<br>and the death of silent night<br>brings presents for everyone<br>but you </strong><br><br>Should be Â“ClausÂ” right? I donÂ’t really like the idea of comparing stars with traffic lights but in this case, since Santa is driving, it will do. Can you find another word to replace Â“deathÂ”?</blockquote>Whoops. Yes, it should be. Why don't you really like the idea of comparing stars to traffic lights? And why should the word 'death' be replaced? I'd like to know how you see it, because I'm looking at this from a rather biased point of view.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>Someday, IÂ’m just going to<br>pray to the sky and the roads<br>And not to God<br>because they are here<br>deciding my fate<br>and He is Above<br>Me<br>Up there behind the clouds<br>Hiding<br>behind the shamed moon </strong><br><br>Why Â“MeÂ” with a capital M? Why are the sky and the roads deciding your fate? Why Â“shamed moonÂ”? </blockquote>Well, when we talk about God, we use 'He', capital H. The using of 'Me' is like saying, I'm the master of my own fate, sort of thing. And a very strong sense of the speaker being a little self-centred, as well.<br><br>As in, the sky and the roads are more pertinent to your fate than God, because you can see the roads and skies, and they directly affect you, as opposed to God, who is, in physical life, a non-existant entity.<br><br>I'm not sure about the 'shamed moon', myself. Because she's hiding God away? Shamed = hiding, so maybe it's just a way of saying it's a dark night with no moon, or the moon is hidden by the clouds? As a reader, it's up to you to interpret it.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The difference is slight; whether it's just words, or actual giving up. I think I'd prefer the phrase 'say I give up' because there's less certainty in it, and it sounds more weak and unsure. Which, I think, fits in better with the whole 'someday I'll do this and someday I'll be that'. The whole poem kinda sounds like a really weak threat, don't you think? Like those threats people make, saying they'll commit suicide or hurt themselves and so on.</strong><br><br>Exactly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>Whoops. Yes, it should be. Why don't you really like the idea of comparing stars to traffic lights? And why should the word 'death' be replaced? I'd like to know how you see it, because I'm looking at this from a rather biased point of view.</strong><br><br>I really donÂ’t see any strong similarities between stars and traffic lights. There are no primary connections. As a metaphor, imo you have a really weak one. Sort of like a mixed metaphor to me. Instead of traffic lights why not guiding lights or something similar? Just a suggestion.<br><br>As for the word Â“deathÂ”, again same problem, I donÂ’t see how it is related to silent night. You may want to tighten up stanza 2. It has great potential and I am confident it can be further improved.<br><br><strong>Well, when we talk about God, we use 'He', capital H. The using of 'Me' is like saying, I'm the master of my own fate, sort of thing. And a very strong sense of the speaker being a little self-centred, as well. </strong><br><br>I understand where you are coming from, but for some readers they might think you are comparing yourself with God, which is not your intention.<br><br><strong>As in, the sky and the roads are more pertinent to your fate than God, because you can see the roads and skies, and they directly affect you, as opposed to God, who is, in physical life, a non-existant entity. </strong><br><br>Again I know what you are doing here. I am fine with the word Â“roadsÂ” but not Â“skyÂ”. When you mentioned the word Â“prayÂ” in L19 as in Â“pray to the sky Â…Â” I canÂ’t help but associated it with God. Maybe it is just me.<br><br>Like IÂ’ve said earlier I really like it a lot.
