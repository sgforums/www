            <div class='col-md body'>Delonic Devil, I agree with DP that the piece doesn't read like poetry, as I can't find the rhythm or pattern. I think you can also elaborate on what "fun activities" those people are engaged in to enhance the images and feelings for this piece.<br>Just a couple of ideas here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><strong>Shifting from one picture from another<br>Of friends playing on the beach</strong><br><br>What are they playing? Is it a crowd playing or just a small group of friends.  How do you know they are having fun? Are they laughing carefree or are they having a competition? What are they doing that makes you think they are enhancing their relationship with each other?<br><br><strong>Or sun tanning at a trendy place-which I do not know </strong><br><br>A trendy place which you do not know or of those people that you do not know? It is not very clear.<br><br>I think you got a good idea here, just needs a few more details.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> [/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i like the idea .. reminded me of the times i go ard with a cam [more than a decade ago]! hahahaa....<br><br>perhaps add in another couple of stanza to bring out more details / visuals? and yah it sounded too much like a prose rather than a poem... read more abt wat make a poem, wat makes a <span style="font-style: italic;">good</span> poem etc.... esp. sites like PFFA <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Adjectives such as "long", "fun" and "happy" are so over-used that they've ceased to be meaningful.<br><br>If you can, try to search for a word to breathes precision to elevate the quality your prose.<br><br>To better illustrate what I mean, I've taken the liberty to edit your poem (forgive my temerity! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br><blockquote>Shuttling from one frame to the next,<br>I slip into players playing on the beach,<br>I slip under lotion while they loll at trendy tanning shacks.<br><br>Through the eye of the camera I stop time.<br>As these passers-by mingle in a lingering high<br>I hide a world behind the camera,<br>observing the obscure changes of life.</blockquote>Notice how I've reduced the prosiac quality of the original into a more poetic form using techniques such as <strong>alliteration, assonance, allusion, metaphors, onomatopoeia, personification, reduction and repetition.</strong><br><br>If you need an explanation of these techniques, or if you want to know where exactly these techniques were applied in my recreative piece, let me know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've a poem that deals with photography (and language) as a subject matter. It's posted here, but for the sake of comparison (and relevancy) I'm gonna enclose it here as well.<br><br><blockquote><br><br><strong>if babel teeth and babel tongue</strong><br><br>if babel teeth and babel tongue<br>weaves a wire rope sling<br>of loosely stranded vowels:<br>we could a syntax have<br>without parentheses,<br>a mere mutter to invoke<br>comprehension.

When water moves, it carries with it a series of discombobulated images, not unlike how exposed film retains its captured images even when it is rewound.<br><br>2. <strong>Onomatopoiea</strong> in the juxtaposition of "your long slow tones" against "my staccato speech". Reac it aloud and you'd know what I mean.<br><br>3. <strong>"babel teeth and babel tongue"</strong> layered on top of a "double exposure": this augments the strength of the <strong>conceit</strong> as both imagery complements each other. They both convey noise and disharmony.<br><br>(Note: a conceit is an extended metapher/imagery commonly used to examine an idea from a unique standpoint)<br><br>4. "sweet memoirs of a sunkissed negative": <strong>alliteration</strong> ("sweet/"sunkissed"), the idea of something irrevocably lost ("memoirs/sunkissed negative") and as a result,<strong>a sense of irony</strong> is created.<br><br></div>
