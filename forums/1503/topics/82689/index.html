I will not go into details of the plays because most of you would have fallen asleep before proceeding to the next scene.  In order to truly enjoy the richness of the plays it is advisable to read the full text.  However such an attempt will surly bore those who have no love for Shakespeare to tears.  (Maybe even to madness) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Taking this into consideration, I decided not to post the full text in the series. If you are interested, you can easily read the full text from the Internet, or get them from the libraries.  You can also grab a copy of the modern translation from any good bookshops.<br><br>My main intention is to explore the various ways in which the plays might be relevant to our personal experiences.  To do this I will need you to be creative, to be imaginative and be able to put yourself into the characters? shoes.  I need you to feel the pain, the anger, the love, etc of the characters.  My advice is not to judge the characters base on your first impression.  Try to understand what they are going through before passing any judgements.  In short, I need you to play the role of Kings, Queens, young lovers, fools, etc; I need you to be human.<br><br>I will first summarize the scenes, follow by my own interpretations.  <span style="color: red;"><strong>Most importantly, I will attempt to relate the events with our own experiences in the form of question(s). </strong>  </span>For those who are familiar with Shakespeare, please feel free to criticize my interpretations for I am looking forward to a healthy debate.  You can also add in your opinions to enrich the discussion, I will really appreciate your contributions.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Also please answer the questions posted (in blue) as my intentions is to set you thinking about matters that you may have taken for granted.</strong></span>  I will try my best to be as brief as possible.  For those who have never read Shakespeare before, I will suggest you read the summary before proceeding to my interpretations.  Try reading it like a story, have fun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Themes about friendships, marriages, justices, etc are abundant in Shakespeare's plays.   I strongly encourage anyone that is doing psychology to read them.  They are gems waiting to be discovered if you are willing to give it a try. Turn the stones into gems. You will realize that they have so much to offer.<br><br>I have chosen one of his last plays, i.e. <span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THE WINTER'S TALE </strong></span></span> for my first Interactive series.  Not many people are aware about this play. We are more familiar with his famous plays like Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, King Lear, etc.  I don't think Hollywood will be interested to make a movie out of it.  I am actually taking a great risk in choosing an 'unknown' play to start off my Interactive series.  But I feel that we must give these 'unknown' plays an opportunity to be recognized and appreciated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Most importantly I need your contributions, after all the key word here is<span class="large"> <strong><span style="color: blue;">'INTERACTIVE'</span></strong>.</span><br><br>Well, hold on tight and let the journey begins...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

Through their short conversation, we learn that the Leontes, King of Sicilia and <strong>Polixenes, King of Bohemian </strong>were childhood friends.  Both kings were raised together, although now their responsibilities as kings keep them apart. Both courtiers also agree that <strong>Prince Mamillius of Sicilia </strong>(son of Leontes) shows great promises.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DP's Interpretation: </strong></span><br><br>There are a few things we can learn from this scene.  Firstly, the past/present status of friendship between the two kings.  Secondly, the future of Sicilia in the form of Prince Mamillius and lastly, the character of Camillo who seems to be a faithful and patriotic courtier full of love for his position, his king and queen.  He is not just an advisor to Leontes, but also his trusted friend.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interactive Time:</strong></span><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Do you have any childhood friends? </span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">When is the last time you contact each other? </span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Do you find that as times passes, once you start joining the work force, having b/g friends or family, etc. you started to drift further and further from each other? </span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">What do you think is the main reason for drifting apart?

            <div class='col-md body'>No response from my audiences?  Sigh Â… so sad.  But I canÂ’t wait for nine months (like Polixenes) for my next post.  The play must goes on Â… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>----------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Summary Art 1, Scene 2:</strong></span><br><br>Enter Leontes, <strong>Hermione</strong> (Wife of Leontes, Queen of Sicilia) Mamillius, Polixenes, Camillo, and Attendants.  (Now where the heck is Archidamus? Shakespeare is famous for making people disappear without giving any valid reasons)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>At this point, Polixenes had enough fun and decided it is time to go home. Leontes however tries to get him to stay for another week but without any success. So he asks his wife Hermione to convince Polixenes, which she accomplishes splendidly.  Unfortunately this really pisses Leontes off.  (It is like how come I ask cannot u ask can! Something fishy must be going on) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>To worsen the matter, unknown to others, Leontes is insanely jealous of Polixenes and Hermione.  Although he has no hard evidence on which to base his suspicions, he is convince that they are secretly committing adultery behind his back.<br><br>He excuses his wife and best friend from his presence while he continues his strange, angry conversation with his uncomprehending son, Mamillius.

            <div class='col-md body'>When Leontes see Camillo, he excuses Mamillius (The young prince must be feeling really relief) and questions Camillo who is also unaware of the king's suspicions. (The fact is that although nobody thinks Polixenes and Hermione are having an affair except Leontes. He also thinks that everyone know this and is gossiping behind his back)<br><br>Leontes convinces that Camillo is either stupid or playing dumb and grows increasingly irate. When he finally tells Camillo of what he suspects, the advisor is horrified and does not believe it. Leontes grows increasingly furious, and Camillo, seeing the king's conviction, decided to play smart and pretend to give in. (Good move)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>At Leontes' expressed desire to see Polixenes dead of poison, he volunteers to carry out the task. His condition is that Leontes must keep the queen in her present status, and do nothing to stain her honor. The king agrees, and Camillo affirms again that he will poison Polixenes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After the king leaves, Camillo is at a loss, should he remain loyal to his king or should he carry out the dreadful task and end the life of poor Polixenes?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He resolves not to do it. Just then Polixenes enters, disturbed by his most recent brush with Leontes. He asks Camillo about the change in the king's manner but Camillo refuses to give a straightforward answer.<br><br>However when Polixenes continues to entreat him, Camillo not only tells him the truth, he also agrees to help Polixenes and all his men to escape.  Now that he has betrayed his king, Camillo requests to serve at Polixenes' court which Polixenes agrees.

            <div class='col-md body'>After finished reading this scene, many questions come into my mind.  Firstly how is it possible for a king to stay in another country for nine whole months?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This seems pretty irresponsible to me.  Nine months are a long time to be away from the throne.  There is simply too much risk involved.   The only logical reason for such an irresponsible act is for Shakespeare to justify LeontesÂ’ jealousy, i.e. HermioneÂ’s pregnancy (She will be giving birth very soon)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Secondly, how can one become so jealous in such a short time?   According to many critics Leontes fears are uncalled for.  This I disagree.  Although not mentioned in the play, I believe that somewhere along the nine months, some incidents might have trigger off LeontesÂ’s suspicious.<br><br>But Leontes is unable to find any concrete proofs.  I believe that is why he wants Polixenes to stay for another week hoping to gather evidences against him.  As times passes and still unable to gather any concrete evidences, out of anger and desperate, he decided to kill Polixenes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Imagine, you are very sure that your the other half is having an affair with your best friend.<br><br>What will you do?

            <div class='col-md body'>The idea of your best friend having an affair with your spouse or girl/boy friend is applicable even in todayÂ’s context.  We are constantly reminded by various media, for example, movies, newspapers, magazines, etc of the possibilities of being betrayed by our closest friends.

            <div class='col-md body'>A common theme in Shakespeare is the conflict between marriage and friendship.  It seems that these two cannot co-exist peacefully.  Polixenes tells Hermione that they were so innocence before knew women and duties of marriage.  However once occupied with the responsibilities of marriage, their friendship are affected.<br><br>Well our friend Leontes seems to be running away from his responsibilities as husband, father and king.  Maybe his unfounded jealousy is a way to for him to escape from all these responsibilities. He fails to understand that a king's duties as husband and father are inseparable from his duties as head of state.  Failure in any one of the roles will affect the others.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Do you find yourself getting easily irritated or angry when you are under tremendously stress, especially when trying to run away from responsibilities?</span></strong><br><br>Put yourself in his shoes...<br><br>You were once a care-free young lad. And gradually, you become a king, a husband and a father.  Unless you are very good at coping with stress, or else at certain stage you may feel burnt out.  I am not suggesting Leontes is right in taking this particular course of action, but we need to give him a chance to be heard.</div>
