              <p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A peek into the future / my dream</span><br><br>It has been so long since I've experienced such a strong sense of emotion. Of late only happiness and some anger if I permits it to grow... So long since I last really felt 'upset'. So very long even since I last cried. Little do I expect it to come in my dream... Knowing always been that my dream is make up of my daily visual experience... Like the last time I ever cried so hard in my dream.. It's SO REAL that even after one has woke up from it, it's just so hard not to believe it's real... Have I really dreamt because I've peeked into the future...? Have I dreamt because I need to know...? The need to know what would be going on in my future? Or a need to know that I'm still able to feel....? A need to cry because I've long lost this part of my emotions...?<br><br>I woke with this 3rd attempt at my already broken down lap top. Not daring to turn on the lights... Afraiding that everything would just go away too quickly... On this dark groomy moring... Raining day it has been, mosquito attacking me... Yet I dare not bring on the light to face it. Reality, too quickly it shall wash away everything within me... Just days before my birthday, a perfect gift for me....?</span><br><br>I was in a building. One which I afterwards tried to recall, seems to be of significant green. Large balcony like those of Vivocity facing the sea... Spiral staircase by the side leading up this tall building... Try very hard though as to dismiss it. I couldn't help but to think all these just parts of formulations of my daily lives..<br><br>I was with a lady who doesn't really look like who she is today. A baby of ours. I've later thought the reason why she didn't look like who she is today is because this is naturally somewhere in the future... She looked somewhere in her early 40s... The baby felt young. If not, I've hardly got to see the baby anytime before... Very unfamilar to me.<br><br>Then there was this accident and the building collapsed. Is this purely a dream? I recall of the recent earthquake episodes in Indonesia. Is this what it just is? Make up of my daily memories and anticipation?<br><br>Alot of us went 'down'. It was a strange journey which happened too quickly. We went on a strange trip through a few obstacles.. Some just lost themselves along the way.. While a couple of us who see it through to the end of the journey came to this tricky wooden slab trick floating above the dark water just before our final destination....<br><br>Our arrival. Then each of us were asked by turn of what we wish to request for. A chance to go back to the existing land where we came from? Or a chance for reincarnation? We then pour personal item we use quickly into a swirling small dark pond of water.... Before a dark figure in hood. Some of us (like myself) do not have personal item with us, so it just squeeze a green color paste out of what seems like a colgate toothpaste.<br><br>My turn. Then it happened. Many before me had opted not to go back to their existing world. Is it just too sad for them to go back? Or they just wish to try something new? I thought I've lived my life long enough to get bored of it too? Perhaps I should really try living a new me and a completely new life of its own...? As people made funny cries for a 'good life', 'healthy life' or 'millionaire life'... It sounded more and more like they're the ones who are dreaming.... By the time it's my turn... I thought of her. And I would really wish to go back to her in this existing world. To see who's baby she might be carrying with her. I asked of the others. "Don't you just wish to see your loved one(s) anymore?"<br><br>I opted to return. The swirl absorbed the green paste the mysterious figure put in for me... What seems like minutes but quickly, I was told I would be reincarnated into a different life. Someone 'ugly'. (Well, after I've checked.. Not really that ugly?) Someone strong and powerful. (Physically and politically) I was told then that I would be 'introduced' to myself. Saw myself got into a fight with another big guy. Strange thing is that I seems to be looking from a 3rd person's view and the 1st party perspective at the same time. 'I' got into a nasty fight. But soon enough a bunch of guys in suits walked over and took the guy away for an even more nasty beating... They then brought him to see their 'head'. Who was smiling at me by the time which... I was following quite closely behind their trail... Just to walk to an open stair on the beach to collect a copy of the newspaper...<br><br>Then I was brought back before the dark figure behind the swirling pond.... That's when I was told to reflect on my own life. And told I don't deserve to get back into it. Might as well live a new life. Where I pleaded with it and started to cry.... So very much just because of her....<br><br>The next moment I just found myself teleported onto a train.... Where I sat crying... Wondering what would she have opted for? And would I ever get to see her again.... She appeared shortly just behind me on the train. Explained that she has opted to 'go on' to the next life.... I told her 'but....' She then quickly just vanished....<br><br>I arrived in a room. We were given an 'identity card' much bigger than expected. We were then told to quickly look for signs of clues given from that 'card' from within the room, move along and follow the hints and instructions... At least I didn't wanted to as this wasn't my option. But things happened too quickly that I didn't seems to have much of a choice. My 'spirit' felt weak as if I was disappearing. I just had to act fast...<br><br>I quickly followed a few clues through and got sort of hypnotised.... The next thing I know, I found myself of the bed. Next to the girl who is now one of the closest to me. Uncontrollably, I just started to cry..... So much... Only this time unlike in my dream, it was real... She looked at me a little dazed... Tried to comfort me.... I couldn't speak a word but to cry... Wondering and confused as to which part of it is really a dream.... So very glad yet shocked to find that I've actually been given a chance to 'come back'.... From what I thought was impossible but a straight journey away from all this....<br><br>I hugged her close, not willing to let go.... What I've wanted so much to come back for.... She kept asking me not to cry.... Although I've later explained and she assured me that it's only a dream...<br><br>And I've figured too many things from within it were just like parts and parcels of visual memories from within my own life.... It could have easily explained why I can piece up and experienced such a dream... One thing I couldn't quite figured is.... Why that 'format'? Why that particular content which I'm totally stranger to and have no previous experience of....? And it just all seems to much of a 'coincidence'....<br><br>Somehow I just couldn't help but to think that some of our dreams are here to deliver a message or 2.... And that they previously didn't appear simply because they lack the 'bridge' / language or building blocks for that to happen......</p>

              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> A Long Journey to..... Today.....</span></em></p>
              <p>Intoxicating.... But alcohols do not numb my senses... They do not purify my soul and bring me where I wish to be.... So far is our heaven that we've just travelled one big circle just to find ourselves lost within it... Back to where we were. Leaving we bewildered. To laugh or to cry?</p>
              <p>So long was that stretch of road... I did not realised how far I have travelled... To get me here today. I couldn't remember where I have passed and what monsters I have thrown behind me... Yet of the equally long road spread out wide in front of me... I do not see all possibilities... Though beautiful it may seems... Often just leading to a dead end in the valley...</p>
              <p>I do not wish to place... Myself where I see me... Nor on a spot of complete darkness... Not knowing how long I've been rotting... I want to choose a spot. A spot where all spotlights are on me. Comfortably smoothing warm... And there, I wish I could just rest my feet.....</p>
              <p>But then motions... It's these which brought me where I am today... Though tired at times.. The journey just shouldn't end there... And the spotlights.... And people clapping around you.... So bright... You just couldn't tell them apart....</p>
              <p>Today. I just felt like putting on a disappearing act. No need to answer the questions. Nor write in my book. Today shall be a blank page on my diary. A very silent day.</p>
              <p>Today, I've wish for so many things... Yet it's from today which I've learnt.... There're just so many things which I simply can't control... Do not seek for them no longer...</p>
              <p>Let them come.... Let them go.....</p>

The toxin which is slowly tearing us apart... As I've long seen and predicted it would happen.... But what's the use....? Foolishness.... You still opted for it just to regret on your decision......</em></p>
              <p><em>I hold the book in my hand.... Pages of it tells me stories of sweet wantings... The rest of it are just burnt and torn pages.... Seemingly, they are to conspire something... Yet, of unknown pieces they're made of..... Chapters of all too familar memories slowly rising up into the air.... Do not take them away from me....? But please tell me what should I do? If I don't let go of them and erase them off my head.....? The thought of these acts alone is already too heavy a burden for my mind to hold....</em></p>
              <p><em>Cracks in my head just like cracks in my spirit..... Slowly it tortures my body just like it's torturing yours.... Why does death always seems a better option from time to time.....? As it thickens in the air, every breath just seems so suffocating....</em></p>

Maybe I'm just sitting there and keep writing about it.... The pages just get longer and longer till I'm all lost in it......?</em></p>
              <p><em>Why... tell me so many things when you've chosen to swallow the poison? Yet of all the ass I've always seems to be, I'm actually the one left with the least choices.... I just sat and watched others burnt up my options until it just numbs me..... At 1st I thought it was a terrifying experience... Later I realised that maybe I'm just back in hell....? I just watched as they burnt my skin into charcoals and ashes.... Leaving my broken spirit behind to suffer the aftermath of it.....</em></p>
              <p><em>I love you..... Don't say it when you don't mean it they say. But so what even if you mean it? What difference would it mean? What help would it do....? I stood by you telling 'I love you's from the bottom of my heart, watching you as you continue to dig your grave....</em></p>
              <p><em>Finally, you've found my buried book. For years, I've decided to keep it buried. Only years later, decided to share it with you.... Now, you slowly handed the book over to me. Move in to lie down on your own grave. Closed your eyes peacefully... Waiting as I filled in my last words in this chapter.... Carefully choosing my words... Reciting them out slowly to you as I do.....</em></p>

              <p><em>Stop. Not that it's gonna happen... Very quiet, yet so distracting... Very silent yet so confusing.... Breathing, breathing.... Waiting for everything to stop.</em></p>

              <p><em>Just went to a movie with a friend. The name of the movie is 'doubt'. Like the controversy within the movie... Like the suspicions... Doubts.</em></p>
              <p><em>"Don't worry, we'll know the outcome when the movie ends." My friend commented.</em></p>
              <p><em>"How convenient?" I replied.</em></p>
              <p><em>In life, the truth might often not be so defined. Perhaps not even at the 'end of the story'. People just presume that it's the 'end of the story' and stick to their own version of belief...</em></p>
              <p><em>Unfortunately or fortunately, the 'truth' wasn't out in the end. A movie which lives up to its name and leave you with much to ponder and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in doubt</span>.....</em></p>
              <p><em>We particularly like the analogy of 'pillow &amp; feathers' as gossip. It reminds me of my own life and how people with much reservations in the beliefs of what they've heard, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unreservingly</span> accuse you of something? Perhaps it's their selfishness? Because at the end of the day, the knife won't be the one poking at them? Their nature? Their irresponsible fun-loving? The fact that they just wanna convince people of what they wanna believe, just like the sister in this movie....? And the fact that our principal told her teacher, the latter's believing in her own version of truth for the simplicity of it... Without really knowing that she's believing in her own version of it all because of her own stubbornness and perhaps with irony... 'Simplicity' as well....?</em></p>
              <p><em>My life is full of 'pillows'.... And with the amount of 'feathers' created by them, people just tends to believe more.... Simply because most people believe what they see and hear without thinking over what they see and hear... Not like they need to care most of the time? And so, those people watching the 'feathers' would destroy their own 'pillows' and create more of their own 'feathers'.... 'Unintentional' perhaps some might say? I do not know... All I know for now is there're 'feathers' all around us... And most of the time, people are just selfish or blind?</em></p>
