So many moments often together by the sea...?<br><br>How I wish we have more time to brush our shoulders...? Less time carried away by a folding plane.... Less time wondering about each other when we're distance apart.... Less time wondering about each other when we're just next to each other......<br><br>Dark sky...

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Library</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Evening. The 2nd time I passed by the same girl with the lovely blue eyes. Or was it the 3rd? There she was, sitting by her store steps....<br><br>She looked at me. Opened her mouth and spoke with a cute lovely British accent.<br><br>"I saw you walking down here yesterday." I admitted to her that I did.<br><br>"You own this store?" She nodded.<br><br>Strange to see a girl as young as her owning a book store and having such an interest as a start in life?<br><br>I explained that I lived in a hotel somewhere further up. This spot she's at happens to be in between where my conference is held and where I stay in a hotel.<br><br>I smiled &amp; bid her goodbye.<br><br>Back in hotel. I remember when I 1st saw that book shop among the streets of bars and pubs. The books outside of it. $1, $1.50. Reminds me of a sad story.... Of how value of books could drop just like the values of humans... And it probably doesn't bother too many people perhaps than the store keeper....? Of how the valuable efforts could have so easily gone down the drain... Wasted...?<br><br>I thought I could revisit her again tomorrow? And if fate really has it that I would see her the 3rd time at the pravement, I would simply love to chat.... Afterall, how often would I come all the way across the globe to bump into someone at the far end like this?<br><br>Next day. No longer seen is her in her wind-breaker and hood over the head. I loitered for a while outside the store which happens to be separated into two. I peeked in and pretty much saw nothing.<br><br>I decided to walk in.<br><br>Greeted by books... Yellow and old... A few number which seems more 'freshly baked'... An old man who gave me a warm smile. Signs with cute messages all over the shop....<br><br>This is like a little cementry. I thought to myself. remembering the 'dead' books of values $1 and $1.50 now lying outside of the store....<br><br>I went through their contents as I've so long never really feel and touch a book. Suddenly it's like I'm communicating  with the deads again.... I felt so deeply embraced and surrounded.... So quiet it was, yet so many 'mumbles' &amp; 'whispers' I seemed to be hearing....<br><br>I finally saw this girl who's head turned back against me. Speaking to her dad? Seems like this could be a family business? Something so simple but yet so out of place....? I suddenly felt the passion within that gentle old man. His love for books &amp; their company....<br><br>In the end I still didn't get to see that blonde girl in her face again. But I think I saw who was her younger sis instead? Very quiet &amp; attractive girl with that equally lovely blue eyes....<br><br>I soon left with sosmehow a little regret and disappointment? Yet some things in life I guess are just meant for brushing by...? Not all are given a chance for us to cherish while they could always be around us...? Would I have entered the shop if she haven't been sitting outside...? Would I have if she haven't spoke to me? Met a family of 'librarians' &amp; be inspired by them....?<br><br>Such a small quiet shop... Yet so deep &amp; lovely in its own ways.....<br><br>PS. I went into the shop again the day before I flew off. I finally saw that blonde girl. She was at her desk at the far end. She turned and gave me a quick look. But I guess she couldn't recognise me as I wasn't in my coat that day...</span></div>

Is that it to life...?<br><br>Angels, don't talk to me. Devils... Don't whisper to me in my ears... People... Speak out loud to me. Don't talk behind my back. I won't blame you for who you are.

You just can't figure what they're about...<br><br>Thinking of where you should be heading towards... No sense of direction. No hint of connection. You watch the TV as it plays quietly on TV mobile. When you might have felt a little disturbed, it doesn't seems to bother much of anyone else at all.<br><br>In yourself falls into silence again. So quiet. Barely talk. Utter a few words people can hardly understand. Then they look at you for hint of what's going on your mind... Yet you know. You don't wanna be understood. You continue. Irritates people.<br><br>The errors in this world. Mistakes. Silence broadens that gap. When you know it's wrong. Something is wrong. Yet you hear nothing from them. You speak. The wall absorbs it in silence. You feel anger and frustrations.<br><br>So neat, it's empty. So quiet, it's void. You can hear people's breathing from a mile. You can hear their heartbeat. You can hear their confused and frustrated thoughts. Buried deep within. So quiet.<br><br>You can hardly hear yourself.</div>

He can count and predict things as they SLOWLY arrives. He could look at the world and yet nothing and no one would pose a challenge or a threat to himself.<br><br>His world holds no surprise. He can eat cornflakes or porridge for breakfast as per he likes. He can watch TV or DVD as per he please.<br><br>Being a very clever him, he has found a solution to his 'problem'. He then challenges himself to a duel. To a feat beyond himself. To 'cut' half of himself and cast it away in scatters. To watch what great effects 'he' could have over the world. And to challenge himself to stop the 'effects' from out of hands.<br><br>But his task is tiring indeed. A hero he soon became, a slayer to his own mischief and shadows. His spirit inspired people worldwide just like his shadows have influenced them. Existing within the struggles and balance between 2 unique 'frequencies'. Which vibrates the SLOW silent picture that he has been watching, into CHAOS APART.<br><br>In which his final destiny would be to keep them still again. And watch them till he is BORED.</div>
