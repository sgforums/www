There are many.<br>My typewriter sits on a cherry mantle, abandoned<br>and orphaned without its master, while silence<br>cuts the air, a well-honed razor tendered and oiled.<br>How would you describe empty? A hollow, a hole carved<br>from soap, imploding dreams that dissipate into water,<br>an escapade skiding across thin ice on rusty blades,<br>Every morning, I wake up to birdsong flooding the light,<br>and I reach for a cigarette to douse dying hopes.<br>Sometimes, I strip the ribbon like a fugitive wife<br>ripping imaginary intestines from the man she loved,<br>stuffing promises down stockinged skin strung up to dry.<br>To the faceless doctors that visit every weekend,<br>I say I am your ideal subject, for I have made<br>my vocation to shred my soul and grow in confidence<br>so you could write your theses and grow in fame.<br>A fair exchange, most assuredly. Yet they rape the mind<br>for shrapnel that splinter the spirit, for angles that augment<br>parallax universes, pierce unknown constellations of hurt.<br><br>-- March 2006, revised.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This post could very well be construed as an anachronism -- a droll diatribe on plagiary that no longer bears relevance to contemporary times, oft characterised as an age drawn together in a deftly spun web void of annonymity, personal or otherwise.<br><br>But here is a mouthpiece sterling, and I must use it well, if only to trumpet a cornucopia of thoughts so nebulous, so strange, so excruciatingly impatient, that they must assent, or choke.<br><br>I don't know where to begin.<br><br>Perhaps, then, the definition of plagiary -- a practice of dishonesty claiming original authorship of material of which one has not actually created (Wikipedia). Its Latin roots denote it as "kidnapper". I suspect I need not delve into its ramifications -- it rings loud and clear.<br><br>I've been plagiarised before. As I recall, that incident -- just some months ago -- was quite a fiasco, and I'd documented it as objectively as I could. Even still, the sheen of anger and disappointment was a flavour that lingers long after the fact.<br><br>As a writer, words are frustrating, exhilarating, intriguing entities -- alone, they gleam with a myriad possibilities. Strung together, they bear your unique stamp. They crystallise your history, your character, your voice in a world where perspective too often does not matter in the court of popular opinion.<br><br>And as a writer, you take great pains to craft, whittle each superfluous filament away to create an entity that had the potential to endure. Each ensuing work therefore is a representation of the invisible thought process that makes us human, however fallible.<br><br>It doesn't matter if a piece of work is formally published, or merely bulletinised on the cyberhighway. Theft is theft.<br><br>So when someone misappropriates a piece of writing, and falsfully claims it as her own.... it's hard not to get personal. It's hard even to dismiss it as a case of citational amnesia -- pinches of salt notwithstanding. I could be making a mountain out of a molehill, but could you fault me, when this hurt is still.... so very visceral?<br><br>Worse yet is the implication of plagiary: that the pursuit of knowledge and meaning has ground to a halt, and relegated to a tool for show.<br><br>### END ###[/b]</blockquote>i like this very much. brilliant!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
