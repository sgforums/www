He becomes<br>its protector Â– he stops washing, till dirt<br>shines on the bones behind his ears<br>over his brain, and his hands blaze like<br>dark badges of love. He will not<br>flush the toilet, putting the life of the<br>water first, until the bowl<br>crusts with gold like the heartÂ’s riches and his<br>room stinks, and when I sneak in and<br>flush he almost weeps, holds his<br>hands a foot apart in the air and<br>says do I know there is only about<br>this much water left! He befriends it, he<br>sits by its bedside as if it is a dying<br>friend, a small figure of water<br>gleaming on the sheets. He keeps a tiny<br>jar to brush his teeth in, till green<br>bugs bathe in its scum, but talk about<br>germs and heÂ’s willing to sacrifice his health<br>to put the life of the water first, its<br>helplessness breaks his heart, the way it<br>waits at all the faucets in the city for the<br>cocks to be turned, and then it cannot<br>help itself, it has to spill<br>to the last drop. Weeks go by and<br>our son is glazed with grime, and every<br>cell of dirt upon his body is a<br>molecule of water saved and he<br>loves those tiny molecules<br>translucent as his own flesh in the spring, this<br>thin vivid liquid boy who has<br>given his heart to water, element<br>so much like a nine-year-old Â– you can<br>cut it, channel it, see through it and<br>watch it, then, a fifty-foot<br>tidal wave, approaching your house<br>and picking up speed as it comes.<br><br><strong>By Sharon Olds</strong><br><br>------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Afterthought</strong><br><br>I knew it.<br><br>They are coming back to haunt me Â– the souls of those ants and grasshoppers I had tortured and killed when I was a kid.

            <div class='col-md body'>Bad news! I've decided to post my old poems here. Back in those days I thought clichÃ©s and abstractions were cool &amp; great. I thought as long as it rhymes, it is a poem. I thought all I need to do is to write a prose, breaks it into pieces and you have a poem. No sweat. Those were happy days.<br><br>Frankly, I am not really proud of them as poetry but I am sure proud of them as part of my learning process. Basically my poems can be classified into three categories; The Early Years (1990 Â– 1991), The Return (2004 Â– March 2005), and The Awakening (After March 2005).<br><br>So get your vomit-bag ready, sit tight and off we go!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Early Years (1990 Â– 1991)<br><br>Warning: This poem is full of clichÃ©s and abstractions. Do not try this at home.<br><br>The poem #01<br><br><strong>Just for you</strong><br><br>Life is full of Joys and Pains,<br>In every heart a dream remain,<br>Should sad memories ever your mind,<br>Always remember I'm by your side.<br><br>Believe in yourself, have Faith in God,<br>Over the mountains against all odds,<br>Every sunrise is a bright new day,<br>Yesterday's tears will never stay.<br><br><strong>The story behind this poem</strong><br><br>This is my first attempt at poetry. It is written for a very special girl, sorry wrong guess, not my wife. I was crazy about this girl during my pre-university days. She was like a goddess to me and I was like well a mere mortal. So IÂ’ve decided to Â“immortalizeÂ” her. What was I thinking? Nothing much I guess, just madly in love with her. Crazy young man back then.<br><br>(Word of Wisdom: Do not tell your wife/girlfriend you have a blog especially if you've decided to post poems dedicated to other girls. Not good for your health/ear, not good at all)<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Posted in Rest In Peace on Sunday, May 29, 2005</strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A short story taken from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Magic of Metaphor </span>by Nick Owen.<br><br>One day there was an earthquake that shook the entire Zen temple. Parts of it even collapsed. Many of the monks were terrified. When the earthquake stopped the teacher said, Â“Now you have had the opportunity to see how Zen man behaves in a crisis situation. You may have noticed that I did not panic. I was quite aware of what was happening and what to do. I led you all to the kitchen, the strongest part of the temple. It was a good decision, because you see we have all survived without any injuries. However, despite my self-control and composure, I did feel a little bit tense, which you may have deduced from the fact that I drank a large glass of water, something I never do under ordinary circumstances.Â”<br><br>One of the monks smiled, but didnÂ’t say anything.<br><br>Â“What are you laughing at?Â” asked the teacher.<br><br>Â“That wasnÂ’t water,Â” the monk replied, Â“it was a large glass of soy sauce.Â”<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Posted in Rest In Peace on Monday, October 17, 2005</strong></span></div>

Phew.<br><br>Seriously, is it possible to mass breed infected aedes mosquitoes and used them as biological weapon? Just look at the figures, one mosquito needs only a drop of water to produce hundred of eggs. One bite from this miniature vampire transmits thousands of dengue viruses in your blood. And most frightening of all, one in fifty dengue cases may be fatal. Based on the latest figure i.e. 9, 000 cases, 180 Singaporean might be dying. In fact, eight people had dead since this year from the epidemic. The whole nation might soon come to a standstill! Gosh!<br><br>Terrorists breeding mosquitoes in Singapore? Nay impossible.<br><br><img src="http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b45/deadpoet13/blog/5bfdd5c5.jpg"><br>One mean flying blood-sucking son-of-a-b<strong></strong>itch at work!<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Posted in Rest In Peace on September 14, 2005.</strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We all seek the meaning of life, don't we?<br><br>Philosophers across the ages has cracked their poor heads over this. What is life? What is the meaning of life? Are we just meaningless specks in the wide universe?<br><br>Unfortunately, yes. We're born into this world with a void in purpose. We're like a blank cheque, with the Creator of Life's (not necessarily God) signature.<br><br>It is up to us, to fill our own value of our life.<br><br>What is your life's purpose? Waste your life away in arcades, in violence? Or inspire thousands and save lives? It's entirely your call.<br><br>No one can live your life, except yourself. Like Jack Neo's "Just Follow Law", have you been so distracted in your life, that you forget about the minor details? Like kinship? Friendship? Love? There are more things to life, than money.<br><br>Indeed, if you find satisfaction in what you're doing, you'll never feel bored. I love writing. Despite having to write many articles at times, I'm happy. I love to write. I update my blog almost daily, despite me being very busy, or otherwise. You can say I'm just idling around.<br><br>But I've found the purpose of my life. Show people snapshots of the world. Write to inspire, and to inform.<br><br>Do you know how much the impact of a photograph can be? A photograph of a modernised urban city, can give hope to a poor girl in a rural, third-world country. It can give her the spark to ignite her flame, to work hard, and to improve herself. A photograph captures memories. It captures emotions.<br><br>I can write. I don't think I write very well, but at least I can write fluently. And I want to use this, to tell others - Don't give up on yourself, even when you find yourself talentless.<br><br>Life is not about how much talent you have. Life is about how you choose to live it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Life is the noblest gift ever given. It's a gift which surprises and rewards know no boundaries.</span><br><br>http://hexakosioihexekontahexa-phobia.blogspot.com/</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Posted in Age of Insanity on Friday, November 25, 2005</strong><br><br><strong>Your First Hunch is Your Best Hunch</strong><br><br>Is it really true that Â‘your first hunch is your best hunch?Â’ According to a study by Stoffer, Davis, and Brown (1977) this may not be the case. By examining the studentsÂ’ answer sheets for evidence of changes such as erasures or crossing out the initial answers here is what they discovered,<br><br>From wrong answer to wrong answer --&gt; 15%<br><br>From right answer to wrong answer --&gt; 22%<br><br>From wrong answer to right answer --&gt; 63%<br><br>Amazing! So when your teacher asks you to go through your answers again if you have the time, she knows what she is talking about.<br><br><strong>Afterthought</strong><br><br>This study was conducted back in 1977, i.e. almost 29 years ago. If we were to conduct the same study again, would we come to the same conclusions? I do not have the answers to this question but one thing is for sure, as humans we are generally unsatisfied with our first choice. We change our jobs for better prospects, better salaries, higher positions, etc. Our next girlfriend/boyfriend must be better looking, smarter, richer, etc. than the previous one. We must constantly reach for higher grounds, better living conditions, bigger TVs, bigger cars, etc.<br><br>Is your next choice really going to be a better one? Will your next revision improves your poem? Will you really be more successful in your next job? How do you measure success? How do you know there wonÂ’t be a better person coming along your way after this one? When will it end?<br><br>I know I am not making much sense here but let me tell you a secret (well now it is not a secret anymore); yesterday I turned down an opportunity to be promoted two grades above my current grade. Yes, a double promotion and I turned it down. Sounds crazy? Maybe. I have my reasons but I am not going to explain them here. I know what I am doing but to be on the safe side, will you pray for me?<br><br><strong>Afterthought II</strong><br><br>I have a friend, okay, had a friend whose philosophy towards life is very simple Â– always go for the better option. Whenever a better girl comes along he will dump his current girlfriend and go after the new one. When he completed his National Service, the same pattern repeated: always go for the better option. He bragged that he never remain in the same job for more than two years.<br><br>I have no idea where he is now, what he is doing, or whether if he is married or still single. Maybe he is right in his quest to constantly seek for better things in life. But sometimes it is good to settle down, take a look around you and be grateful of what you have. There is always a better choice, but are you sure it is the right one for you?<br></div>
