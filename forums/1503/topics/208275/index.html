Pathetic excuse yes, but you can't blame everything on my mood, can ya?<br><br>2nd question: I've only just started showing off my poems to people so it's kinda awkward and well . . . heh.<br><br>3rd question: I'm talking about my feelings towards the whole and my remorse. I did not feel a need to elaborate why the whole class was unhappy.<br><br>4th Question: Are there? Didn't realise. . .<br><br>5th Question: Seriously, none of my poems ever rhymed before, I really wanted to try some sort of rhyming. In the end, didn't work, I guess.<br><br>6th Question: I meant that I tried to make peace but it only got worse. Thanks for your comments.</div>
