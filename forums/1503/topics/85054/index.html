TROY is one good example of a story taken out of the myths.<br><br>So how well do you know your greek characters?? kekeke  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Guess who are these?<br><br>1) "I was married to Menelaus in ancient Greek times. He got a little upset when I eloped with Paris and accidentally started the Trojan war. Some poets like to say that I had a 'face that launched a thousand ships'!"<br><br>2) "I was a terrible Gorgon who was slain by none other than Perseus. He chopped my head off while I slept. It had to be because of my hair. All those snakes are hard to tame!"<br><br>3) "I'm the nymph she condemned to speak only in the words of others."<br><br>4) "I made a deal with Dionysus so that everything I touched turned to gold. Sadly, I realized I made a mistake when my poor daughter turned to gold also."<br><br>5) What is the name of the three headed dragon-tailed dog that guards the gates of the underworld?<br><br>6) She withdrew her gifts of fertility upon hearing the news of the abduction of her daughter by Hades. Who is she?<br><br>7) He had to prove his might in a superhuman challenge. His destiny carried him to Daedalus' labyrinth where he had to face the deadly Minotaur. Who is he?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Being plunged in the river Styx when he was born, he became invulnerable except for one tiny part of his body.

Who is his wife?<br><br>10) He was so much in love with his wife, Eurydice, that when she died, he followed her into the Underworld. The god of the Underworld let him take her back under the condition that he doesn't look back at her on their journey out of the Underworld. Who is he?<br></div>

Largely uncredited was British archaeologist Frank Calvert, who suggested that Schliemann should dig at a place called Hisarlik - the site now recognized as ancient Troy.<br><br>The remains of seven cities were found on the site, each on top of the other, showing that Troy had been rebuilt many times.  The city that Schliemann initially proclaimed to be Homer's Troy was on the second level.  Later research proved this could not be the case, and now most scholars believe that the sixth city provides the most likely background for the story of the Trojan War.  Traditional dates for the fall of Troy range from about 1250 to 1183 BC, fitting well with the dates of destructions of these cities.  Excavations were resumed as recently as 1988, with the belief there was much yet to be discovered.<br><br></div>

I only remember her fleeing from Sirius, the fat girl sure can run though.</strong><br><br>10) Who made the howling noise that stopped Lupin (in werewolf form) from attacking Harry?<br><br><strong>Hermione, the smart-aleck girl in HP who got a Time Turner.</strong><br><br><strong>So, any prize for trying eh?  Perhaps a signed copy of Jane Austen's 'Fluff and Fluffiness'?<br><br>Book or Movie better?  Book<br>Favourite HP character? Moaning Myrtle</strong></div>
