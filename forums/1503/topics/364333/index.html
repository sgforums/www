              <p><em>I think of old folks.. Especially those with that lovely happy faces.. Healthy. I wonder how do they manage to keep that on them? I mean to have lived in such a ugly world for so many years... What's their secret...? Are they delusional...? Or are they simply contented? Are they happy because they're finally leaving this god-forsaken place? Infested by ugliness created mainly by humans...? If human is really a prototype of god.... Then I would really live to wonder how would god be like....?</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>I think the truth is this world is so ugly that after a while people just do not wish to know the truth about things anymore... Or to add to the mess, the fact that they would have no time between their busy and tiring schedules... Or that they're just too lazy, too limited in capacity to think, to sort out... That 'truth'...?</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>How convenient it would be...? To simply believe in what you wish to believe in, without even needing to use your brain... How dark is this world really...? Yet how many would really bother to know...? Afterall, it'll be just like smoking toxics into your lungs... Information. How much can you really process...?</em></p>

              <p><em>How is it that even a Devil could not even live to bear the human kind? Is it so the reason that god has chosen to forsake so many....? Why is life never really the way it seems to be....?</em></p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hi, I'm a Devil.</span></p>
              <p>I think I'm not human. No. I know I'm not. Sometimes it's funny how I might pretend to be one. It's fun... Really. Enjoying the emotions and life of a human.. Laughters, fear, sadness... Excitement. So much that sometimes I just forget I'm not - a human.</p>
              <p>A Devil who really doesn't belong. Doesn't mix around with the people. No matter how well I can deceive others.. Deceive myself. Surely it's not that hard to tell?</p>
              <p>I feel weird. The way I look at things, look at this world... And nowadays, it's getting more obvious. I think nobody would be able to explain to me. Probably because no one would be looking at the world the way I'm looking at it now. So full of the colours I love... Yet so dull.</p>
              <p>I cannot explain to people the so many things. Neither would they be able to understand. Accept. Recognise.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>Because they're humans.</p>
              <p>It seems there're so many things that humans do which really do not need explanations. It seems the closer you get to the truth, the darker the room would be.</p>
              <p>Just like that very end of the tunnel.</p>
              <p>The sunny's shining bright because you're outside of the tunnel. The truth is, we live in the tunnel.</p>
              <p>All of us.</p>
              <p>The only to get connected is to get disconnected.</p>
              <p>See you outside the tunnel?</p>
              <p><em>Hope the air would be fresh out there.</em></p>
