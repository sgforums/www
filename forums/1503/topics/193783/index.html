Or 'but it was the soul of/Us) I.../...t proudly proclaim/s'. Again, shallow-fication (pardon the imaginary word). the speaker thinks 'I', changes it in afterthought to 'it'. so 'Us) I proudly proclaim' becomes 'Us) It proudly proclaims' through the speaker's denial.<br><br>actually, i should probably be talking about what this poem is about first. it should be about trying to ignore the existance of friendships made during the camp, after the camp, so that one doesnt feel pain when said friendships are lost eventually. so it's a little on denial, i suppose.<br><br>back to the complaints. punctuation? i don't quite get what you mean. could you elaborate?<br><br>capitalisation. I capitalise not at the beginning of every line, but every line of thought. As for the 'We' and 'Us', and 'Endless Moments'. It is meant to make it special, it means something more to the speaker, instead of just a 'we' and 'us'. but perhaps you do have a point here.<br><br>ok, i agree to the 'overmuch' point. in hindsight, i have absolutly no idea why i wrote that.<br><br>as for the title. it means that the speaker does remember, the friendships and the joy, and is trying not to in order to feel less of the pain when friendships are lost after they have deepened. forgetting seems more voluntary, unremembering less so, thus the title.<br><br>and yes, this is a very experimental way of writing for it, so i do apologise if i'm terribly unskilled at it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Um, I'm going to be harsh, but it's not targeted at you but rather the poem, alright?<br><br>Your poem strives too hard to break the conventions of language -- awkward linebreaks, atrocious punctuation, and non-uniform capitalization. There's more, but these three elements are most prevalent.<br><br>Your title, "unremembering" has the potential to intrigue the reader (it suggest the unravelling process of forgetting), but the context does not support it.<br><br>How so?<br><br><strong>"In this world of overmuch relationships and lost/ faces and names"</strong> -- what do you mean by "overmuch"? It's not a word, and even if it's a neologism (a invented word) it fails because I can't derive a plausible definition from the verse.<br><br>In other words, bad english.<br><br>Another example - "Within those five days/ and Endless Moments" -- what's the deal with the capitals? Are you suggesting these are elevated entities? Like the characters in a morality play? If so, why didn't you elaborate on it?<br><br>Likewise for the royal "We" and "the soul of Us".<br><br>I'm not going to even ask what's the deal behind the alternating font sizes.<br><br>Reading this poem is infuriating because you, as the poet, is <span style="font-style: italic;">telling</span> me how I should react to your poem. It's rather self-absorbed and pompous, and has the opposite effect of what you're trying to achieve.<br><br>But most glaringly, I don't sense a focus in your poem. What are you trying to say? Was your camp worth going or not? The messages are way too conflicting.<br><br></div>

Sentimental piece, i do like the interesting last stanza and the feelings behind the poem, but i must agree with PB that its a bit distracting how the poem has been formatted, as well as the punctuations.</div>
