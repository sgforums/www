If you expect other to comment on your poems, you need to comment on the poems posted here too.<br><br>2) Do understand that comments are not meant to be personal so avoid personal attacks. We all have different ideas on what constituted a good poem so if you donÂ’t agree with the comments, move on. DonÂ’t hang on to them.<br><br>3) We all have different expectations. For example I expect dsnake1Â’s poems to be of certain quality. Thus I may provide more details or sound harsher when I am commenting on his poems. I think most of the moderators in DPS (S) work this way.<br><br>As for attracting those who are not interested in poetry to come and try appreciating it. Although this is not going to be easy but I think one way is via poetry reading session.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
