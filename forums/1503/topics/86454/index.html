            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Asfi_Kay, thanks for sharing your poems with us.  I really like the last two poems that youÂ’ve posted here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>Crimson Fog </strong>was really well written, I tried writing war poems before and it was a disaster.  For someone who has not seen real combat (I hope there will never been war in Singapore), this poem is very realistic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>As for <strong>Purple Prose</strong>, it truly describes how most of us feel.  Just wondering, but I thought Â‘purple proseÂ’ is something we should avoid? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hee hee, I am sorry I did not read your comments before reading the poem.  When I started reading <strong>Â‘HusbandÂ’</strong>, I read from a womanÂ’s perspective. So when I came to the last line <strong>Â‘You had a husbandÂ’</strong>, I got a surprise, I thought you purposely insert a twist in your poem.  Then I read the comments and I realize it was my mistakes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Actually you can leave out the comments for this poem and let your readers decide if the narrator is a man or a woman.  That should be interesting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>When I wrote Â‘After GraduationÂ’, I had exactly the same feeling. Where the heck is everyone?  Why am I so lonely all of a sudden?  Your poem <strong>'Do you remember me?'</strong> really brought back some old memoriesÂ…<br><br>And by the way <strong>Â‘Q&amp;AÂ’ </strong>was indeed really philosophical...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
