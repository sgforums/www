It's humorous, it has originality and it uses creative images. Apart from all that, it offers some interesting insights into social expectations and behaviour. The protagonist is crude, rude, fat and loud - yet there is a sense of joy, abundance and freedom about her. Ironically, the people around her think that she is a little crazy - it is as if it is a crazy thing to be joyful, abundant and free.<br><br>I have something to say about the other entries in general. There seems to be a strong preference for rhyming verse. That feels a little outdated to me, but still okay. The problem is that the rhyming is not skilful. Many of the poems sound forced and artificial, as if the writer is choosing a particular word just so that it rhymes with the last word of the preceding line. Sorry - that's not poetry. "The cat is fat. It chased a rat. Round and round a mat. And that was that." That rhymes too. But that's not a poem. Please give the reader somethinig more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

It was both a celebration of self and a gently self-deprecating piece of autobiography  -  be it real or fictional.    It had a pleasing sense of humour throughout and I enjoyed the irony of being "happy as a plankton."  Most importantly, I came out of it feeling that the writer had entertained me, shared something of him/herself with me and made me ask questions about human nature in general.<br><br><strong>His second choice &amp; comments</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Poem #11, Piece of Meat by InnoHippo<br><br>I enjoyed the fact that it worked on more than one level.  The underlying sexual metaphor gave the poem both humour and depth.  On a critical note, I found that the new-born child image in the first stanza jarred somewhat and seemed out of keeping with the rest of the poem.  However, I do accept that this is a personal view.  "Intoxicate me up" also grated with me, but it could well be a vernacular phrase with which I am unfamiliar.  Overall, I was left with the feeling that the poet had enjoyed writing it and had done so in a confident and unique way.<br><br><strong>His third choice &amp; comments</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Poem #13, Someday by preya<br><br>Once again, it was the sense of a personal voice which drew me to this poem.<br><br>I certainly identified with the sense of frustration and helplessness.  I loved the image of "the shamed moon" though I must admit that I felt that the Santa Claus imagery in the second stanza was not a good choice and rather undercut what followed.  That said, I enjoyed the overall effect, particularly the final line: "Someday, I'm just going to ... " which the reader is left to finish; perhaps pondering on those failed promises and ambitions which we all have.<br><br>I would point out that, in my opinion, the chosen three stood out from the rest and I had considerable difficulty in arriving at my final "medal" order.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Vance Roberts has also kindly commented on the other poems.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Poem #1, As I Fall Deeper Into The Mist by QNH1010</strong><br><br>I liked the thought behind this one.  It was, however, let down by the obtrusive but irregular rhyme.  Again, I would have suggested either a much more definite structure, or free verse.<br><br>"Them" in line three jarred with me.  Does it refer to life,   in which case it should be singular, or does it refer to the shadows.  I felt that it needed a re-think to clarify the point.  The final couplet was a nice idea but, for me, the shorter lines seemed to undercut, or trivialise, the validity of the serious point which was being made.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Poem #2, A B C D for Thy Self by MoonIce</strong><br><br>I liked the idea of the simple things being sufficient  but, yet again, it lacked structure.  The constant repetition of "Keeping ... within" was overplayed.  Had it just been used in the opening and closing stanzas then I think it would have had more power.  Repetition is fine in the right context, such as a villanelle, but here I felt that it weakened the writer's premise.  The final line deserved to make more of an impact than it actually did.  Combining it with a revamped repetitive method as suggested above could have helped with that.<br><br>The misuse of the apostrophe should have been checked and remedied before submission.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Poem #4, The Two of Us by Keii</strong><br><br>Poor scansion gets in the way here and stops the poem flowing.  There is not clear metrical pattern and line length appears almost random.  Again, I would suggest that a writer either adopts a clear structure and maintains it, or chooses to let sense and/or layout rule and keeps to a free verse format.<br><br>I felt that this poem stated the "facts" of a relationship but gave the reader no emotional touchstones.  If I had been allowed to share a secret  -  flowers, a ring, a meeting-place  -  then I would have felt an attachment to one or both of the characters.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><strong> Poem #5, Twisted by Koo Wai Mun</strong><br><br>This is another example of a poem that would probably work better if read aloud.  Vagaries of scansion are more obvious on the page.  I had the feeling that it was written as a challenge, a task, rather than because the writer had something specific to say. The use of only one rhyme became wearing.<br><br>What does line two actually mean?  The "clay" image in line three was good but line two seemed simply to be there to keep the pattern going.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Poem #6, For the Love of Pho by expiringpoet</strong><br><br>This was an amusing idea but it was let down by poor structure and lack of detail.  Someone eating a food they love gives lots of scope for comic detail:  lips smacking, dribbling and general carefree table manners could all have been given more description to good effect.  I think that the confessional aspect could have been built up rather more at the opening to give more of a sense of bathos when the reader realises the true nature of the "sin."<br><br>I also found that the rhyme was mis-handled.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Poem #7, He Sits Alone Staring by airgrinder</strong><br><br>This entry had so much potential.  We could have been made to feel much more (or less if the writer preferred) sympathy for the old man.  Instead we were left with a sense of disjointedness and missed opportunity and have to struggle to form the narrative.<br><br>The attempts at onomatopoeia in the opening stanzas were encouraging but unfortunate.  Sadly, the resemblance of "pis" to the word "piss" took away the value of the first instance and in stanza two I simply felt that doors do not go "Clink Clank Boom!"  If these sounds were actually a reference to the computer games, then a clearer structure was needed to clarify the point.<br><br>There was also some confusion of tenses.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Poem #8, Food For Thought by preya</strong><br><br>In many ways I liked this.  The sense of personification of "food for thought"  was a sound idea and I enjoyed the feeling of malevolence which came across well but, as with so many of the other entries, I felt that structure needed a lot more thought.  The first stanza in particular was quite impenetrable.  The use of "poetic" language is not sufficient.  A poet's aim should be communication.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Poem #9, Utmost Supremacy by binarynwitz</strong><br><br>Once more, I felt that the chosen form obscured any meaning.  The overpowering rhyme in the first stanza, together with the poor grammar in line two, put me off almost before I had begun.  The formal, imperious tone also seemed, to me, to be a mistake and I was left with the feeling that the writer was thinking too much about "writing a poem" and not enough about what he/she really wanted to say.  I confess that I did not really know what the intention was.  There was clearly some sincerity in here but that alone is not enough.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Poem #10, Anorexic Satiation by Koo Wai Mun</strong><br><br>I found that the chosen form overwhelmed any real meaning.  It would probably be more effective if read aloud but did not really work in this context.  A phrase such as "this odious bane" seemed to me to demonstrate only an adherence to rhyme and added little to, in fact probably confused, the meaning.  The rather high-sounding, declamatory tone also served to obscure rather than clarify.  If the writer wished to make a point about the sense of paradox in eating disorders (or to use them as a metaphor for some other human condition) then a more straightforward approach would have paid dividends.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Poem #12, A Bowl of Humble Maggi Mee by expiringpoet</strong><br><br>This had a gentle sense of humour which I enjoyed but I felt that there was no real depth to it.  The idea of pleasure <strong>now</strong> being preferable can have much validity but I felt that the poem failed to explore this.  I also felt that the use of rhyme and half-rhyme was obtrusive and detracted from the content; ditto the metrical structure.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Overall View by Vance Roberts </strong></span><br><br>Entrants should be congratulated on their ideas and willingness to "have a go" but there were particular weaknesses which were common to many of the poems.  The following is a brief, and probably slightly confused, attempt to summarise the most common failings.<br><br>1) Even when writing in a second language, lapses in grammar and punctuation are irritating for a reader.  The writer must re-read a work very carefully before submitting it.  Typographical errors and technical slips can be eradicated before submission.  Minor mistakes may be overlooked in more personal situations such as a blog, or when showing a friend a rough draft, but they cannot be accepted in more formal situations such as a competition.<br><br>2) It is difficult to draw up hard and fast rules on style and structure but, in this instance, many entries were let down by poor choices of, or adherence to, a particular style or format.  In many cases, rhyme was over-used at the expense of the underlying meaning.  In some cases, a structure was set up but then incorrectly used.  For example:  if a writer sets out using a ten-syllable line but then continually "misses" this target by a syllable or two, it becomes irritating for the reader unless there is a clear reason for the changes  -  perhaps an attempt to show the erratic feelings of the character or narrator.<br><br>The same is also true of rhyme.  Half-rhyme and/or absence of rhyme can be very effective but a reader needs to sense that there is purpose behind the writer's changes.  Rhyme also tends to trivialise subject matter if used badly.  As an extreme example, imagine writing a limerick about the death of a loved one.  It wouldn't work because the format is too well known as a comedic one.  The wisest option is often to choose a recognised form such as a sonnet or to adopt a more personal "voice" and keep to free verse.  Obviously all of these "rules" can be broken deliberately to very good effect but, as is so often the case, a sound knowledge of the rules is a great help before setting out to ignore them.<br><br>3) Think carefully about scansion.  Very rhythmic styles, such as those often labelled as "Rap," will work much better when being read aloud in a more improvised way but they can seem stilted when set down formally.  There is also the related point that a Rapper or a singer can stretch syllables and place stresses where he/she wishes.  A poet, in a formal, written piece, is expected to let the structure guide the reader.<br><br>4) Technical devices such as simile, metaphor, oxymoron and the rest will not automatically make a poem great but a writer should consider their inclusion, or exclusion, carefully and be able to say why they have or have not made use of them.  The same idea applies to the use of adjectives and adverbs or to the decision to use a colloquial "voice" rather than a formal one.<br><br>5)  In poetry there are no "right" answers but an individual writer needs to ask him/herself the right questions  -  the ones which best pertain to his/her own wishes and objectives -  before starting the poem.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
