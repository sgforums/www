yearn to find,<br>Are often beyond my reach,<br>To describe the tears I hold,<br>To allow my soul to preach....<br><br>I have a sudden urging,<br>To see things I've never known,<br>The maiden flight of a Firefly,<br>Or when a field is sown.....<br><br>I hope to feel the summer,<br>Transformed to drops of Summer Rain,<br>I like to see the colours,<br>On the wick of a dancing flame.....<br><br>Without you by my side,<br>All truth has turned to lies,<br>Just like the way your back is turned,<br>Beyond the comprehension of my cries......<br><br>This hand that felt your warmth,<br>Now feels the coldness of a pen,<br>In translating the things I feel,<br>Into the writings from my hand.....<br><br>I spend my life pursuing<br>This dream that was supposed to last,<br>But no man has ever won the wind,<br>No matter how quick and fast.....<br><br>I try to live life better,<br>With the memories I have in store,<br>But every moment bears your name,<br>And in my dreams I have lots more....<br><br>So I gave up on the struggles,<br>Gave in to all the fights,<br>As I tried hard to go and slumber,<br>To live through another night.....<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong># 002: Life </strong><br><br>Life is full of laughter<br>But can even taste bitter<br>Why must we live on earth<br>Even though we know that life is a burden<br><br>Life is a way of challenge<br>That you want things to succeed<br>But do you think this is life<br>That you are battling...<br><br>Life is nothing towards me<br>As I can eventually find happiness<br>Having friends beside you<br>Is indeed nothing that be compared with<br><br>Life is like time<br>Where we will grow each day<br>Never will the time stop<br>Till the last breath takes you away<br><br>Life is actually a treasure<br>Where the value no one knows<br>Treasure yourself now<br>Like god treasures you<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong># 003: A passionate kiss</strong><br><br>His face was forgotten but the touch is lingering so long<br>It is soft on the lips yet the feelings were so strong<br>His name was washed away by the sands of time<br>But why do I still feel it after a long time?<br><br>I burnt away all the photos he left behind<br>Threw away the memories in my mind<br>Yet whenever I put my fingers on my lips<br>A part of him remains on my lips.<br><br>He was not inside the phone album on my shelf<br>When or how we met, I'm not sure myself<br>However the tears wouldn't hold back<br>Haunted by the kiss he gave back.<br><br>It was a passionate kiss<br>A part of him I couldn't miss<br>Why does it remain on my lips for so long<br>When he is already gone?<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong># 004: my house Â…. </strong><br><br>theres a hole in the roof<br>where the rain comes in,<br>the moment i close my eyes,<br>my head begins to spin.<br><br>there are windows out high<br>that stops the blazing sun,<br>where tears flow out,<br>to water the flowers out front..<br><br>theres a crack in the wall,<br>where the cold wind blows,<br>the scars it has left,<br>on my body does show...<br><br>theres a path to the garden<br>where i have close the door,<br>after you have walked out,<br>i am not expecting anybody anymore......<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong># 005: Midnight Dance In the Garden </strong><br><br>Tossed and turned<br>I couldn't fall<br>prey to My Sandman's<br>tricks<br><br>I wandered to the garden<br>below<br>Starlight showered<br>on the canopy of the forest nearby<br>and the flowers in the garden<br>climbed up the air<br>to bathe in the stars' nightly song<br>In total wonderment<br>I blinked my eyes<br>and saw you there.<br><br>With a gentle smile<br>that you casually indulged in<br>I saw the starlight<br>twinkling in your eyes<br>No---wait!<br>That's your own twinkle<br>It came from within<br>And the flowers changed their direction<br><br>You inched towards me<br>with your right hand inviting<br>Was it my heart you were reaching for?<br><br>Looking at me for approval<br>your defenses collapsed<br>and you became a little boy<br>seeking approval<br>to hold my hand<br><br>Palms joined<br>and your veins parallel to mine<br>sometimes crossing, too<br>We danced to the song<br>of the Stars<br>The symphony was playing<br>in the background<br>The symphony<br>that belonged to Insect Kingdom<br><br>That night we forgot<br>about the ills of the world<br>and we danced away the troubles<br>in the Stars' warm blankets<br><br>I was up in the air<br>and you were there with me too<br>I thought I saw a firefly or two<br>but no---<br>it was your eyes,<br>beckoning to me.<br>I laughed.<br>You called it a princess' laugh<br>I laughed again.<br>...<br>...<br>...<br>...<br>...<br>...<br>...<br>I woke up with a fairy next to me the next day.<br><br></div>
