IÂ’ve buried her deep inside my heart, my memory.  But occasionally I do dreamt about her, but as times passes such dreams are getting fewer and fewer.  It is only when I accidentally bumped into her, memories of the past began to reappear to haunt me.<br>DP: But if you have really gotten over her, these memories should no longer haunt you.<br>AT: You have a point there. So maybe, a small part of me is still fighting back, still refusing to accept the reality.<br>DP: HmmÂ… it seems that one can never really forgets about his/her first love.<br>AT: I am glad you understand.<br>DP: But not forgetting doesnÂ’t mean you must continue to hang on to it.  You must move on.  Nothing in this world is constant, maybe expect changes.  See this in a different perspective, see this as just a chapter in your Book of Life.  See this as part of growing up.  Most importantly, you are now married; you have a new role to play with new responsibilities. I think you know what I mean.<br>AT: I know.<br>DP: Let's stop here, I need to check my other posts.<br>AT: Sure, you go ahead and do what you must do.<br>DP: Okay. See you.<br>AT: See you.<br></div>

You can choose to be or not to be happy.<br>AT: I know.  But if you put it to practice, it is not that easy.<br>DP: Did you try?<br>AT: Yes, IÂ’ve tried my best.<br>DP: So you are going to divorce?<br>AT: I am not sure yet.<br>DP: This is sad.<br>AT: I know. But sometimes you have to do what is necessary.<br>DP: I donÂ’t like the idea of divorce.<br>AT: Neither do I.  Anyway, we are still trying to save our marriage.<br>DP: You do that my friend, you do that.<br>AT: I will. I just hope we will have a happy ending.<br>DP: That will depends on both of you.<br>AT: A happy ending does not mean we remain as husband and wife. Maybe both of us will be happier if we go separate ways.<br>DP: Try to work things out brother.<br>AT: I will, but it needs two hands to clap.<br>DP: Anyway good luck.<br>AT: Thanks.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AT: 3:22am, canÂ’t sleep.<br>AT: Super bored.<br>DP: WhatÂ’s up?<br>AT: Do know how long I can take it.<br>DP: Your marriage?<br>AT: No, my work.<br>DP: What about it?<br>AT: I think it is time to move on. Need to get a better job.<br>DP: DonÂ’t like your present one?<br>AT: Something like that.<br>DP: No job in this world is perfect you know.<br>AT: But that doesnÂ’t mean I must stop looking for better prospect.<br>DP: You are still doing your part-time degree, am I right?<br>AT: Yes, this year final year.<br>DP: In that case, I suggest you hold on to your present job until you graduate.<br>AT: Sigh, that will be another 10 more months.<br>DP: You can do it one.  Beside you havenÂ’t found any new job yet right?<br>AT: I donÂ’t know what exactly I want. ThatÂ’s the main problem.<br>DP: What do you like?<br>AT: Talking to people, helping them, anything that deals with people.<br>DP: Too vague.<br>AT: Not sure lah.  Maybe a social worker? PsychologistÂ’s assistant? I donÂ’t know.<br>DP: Take your time, do some research, talk to people.<br>AT: I guess that is the only thing I can do now.<br>DP: HowÂ’s your relationship with your wife?<br>AT: What do you think? I am not asleep but talking to you at 3:35am in the morning.<br>DP: Both of you still sleep on the same bed right?<br>AT: Yes.<br>DP: Think positive.<br>AT: I will try.  We have to work something out soon.<br>DP: Funny thing, you want to help people, be a social worker, yet you canÂ’t help yourself.<br>AT: I know, very ironic right?<br>DP: Life itself is ironic.<br>AT: I know what you mean, the moment we were born we are actually moving towards the arms of Death.<br>DP: Yup. Black and White, Sun and Moon, Evil and Good, Life and Death, Love and Hate.  If you accept the first half, you must prepare to accept the other half.<br>AT: Life and Death Â…Â…Â…Awake and Sleep.........<br>DP: Try to get some sleep.<br>AT: If Life is to be awake, then to sleep is to die.<br>DP: What are you talking about??? You think too much liao.<br>AT: Hahaha, I am going crazy liao.<br>AT: Okay going to die now.<br>DP: Crazy fool, sigh.........<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AT: Hey DP, this is something new, you look sad.<br>DP: Not really lah, just a little bit disappointed.<br>AT: What is it about?<br>DP: I wrote a poem to your colleague.<br>AT: Okay, you told about that before.<br>DP: It was my first poem after 12 years.<br>AT: Okay, and then?<br>DP: She doesnÂ’t appreciate it.<br>DP: She was supposed to post her comments to let me know how she feels about it.<br>AT: ErÂ….. she didnÂ’t?<br>DP: None, not even an sms to tell me how she feels about it.<br>AT: Maybe she is busy, you know we are all very busy nowadays, especially the ISO rubbish is just around the corner.<br>DP: I know, but I still feel a bit let down.<br>AT: You are not in love with her are you?<br>DP: Of course not! We are just friend.<br>AT: You are married you know.<br>DP: Correction, YOU are married, not me.  I am still single and available.<br>AT: Yeah yeah yeah, whatever you say.<br>DP: Look, she is only a friend, I have no other motives.<br>AT: Okay, maybe youÂ’ve pissed her off somewhere in the poem?<br>DP: Like what?<br>AT: I donÂ’t know, you wrote it, why ask me?<br>DP: HmmmÂ…Â….<br>AT: Maybe she thinks that you were being busybody.<br>DP: MaybeÂ…Â….<br>AT: Or she thinks that you have nothing better to do.<br>AT: Or she thinks that you are making fun of her.<br>AT: Or she thinks that Â…Â…..<br>DP: Okay, okay, I get your point.<br>AT: Hahaha!<br>DP: Idiot.  So now how?<br>AT: What how? Forget it lah! What can you do? Write her another poem?<br>DP: I am not that stupid okay!<br>AT: Think she will be reading this now?<br>DP: Most likely not.  Anyway I donÂ’t care liao.<br>AT: You know something?<br>DP: What?<br>AT: I am really enjoying this, hahaha.<br>DP: Idiot.<br>AT: By the way, the title of the poem also sounds funny.<br>DP: KNS.<br>AT: Bye bye.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AT: Hello DP.<br>DP: Hey AT, long time no see.<br>AT: Been busy with works, as usual.<br>DP: I am curious, what kind of person are you?<br>AT: Me? Why do you want to know?<br>DP: I hate this question.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>AT: Okay, okay.  HmmÂ… I think I am a boring person.<br>DP: Why do you say that?<br>AT: I hate games, donÂ’t talk much, you know, the quiet type.<br>DP: But your job required you to talk to people right?<br>AT: Yeah thatÂ’s true but after work I tend to keep my mouth shut if I can help it.<br>DP: What about with your friends?<br>AT: Of course with my friends different story lah, I do open up a bit with them.  But my idea of having a good time is just keeping quiet and enjoying each other's company.<br>DP: You are really weird you know that.<br>AT: I am actually a friendly person lah.  You need to know me better mah.<br>DP: Okay what other weird habits you have?<br>AT: Like for example I donÂ’t like playing games, I prefer to have my meals alone at work, etc.<br>DP: So, you donÂ’t have lunch/dinner with your colleagues?<br>AT: No.  Only occasionally I dine with them.  To me meal time is personal time.<br>DP: What about having coffee?<br>AT: Oh, that is different.  Coffee I don't mind.<br>DP: You are quite anti-social hor?<br>AT: A bit lah.  ThatÂ’s why my friends ask me how can you be studying Psychology when you are so anti-social? Well, why not?<br>DP: Indeed you are really a boring guy.<br>AT: It takes time to know me.  Usually people donÂ’t have the time to do so.<br>DP: Either they like you or hate you?<br>AT: Something like that.  ThatÂ’s why I only have a few friends and those, IÂ’ve know them for 12 Â– 15 years liao.<br>DP: But first impression is very important you know?<br>AT: What to do. I usually give others a not so friendly first impression.  A one to one date with me is a nightmare for the other party.<br>DP: Er Â… why is that so?<br>AT: Because there will be many silent moments.   I prefer to observe rather than talk.  That is why I usually meet people in a group, seldom one to one.<br>DP: Silence is golden mah.<br>AT: But not when you are meeting people.  Actually I am not feeling bored lah, just nothing to say.<br>DP: Oic.<br>AT: To be frank, I am enjoy just simply by looking at other people doing the talking.<br>DP: HmmÂ…so no outings for you!<br>AT: Not at the moment lah.  Maybe next year. Even so, I will prefer a small group like 3-5 persons?<br>DP: Okay I will keep that in mind.<br><br></div>
