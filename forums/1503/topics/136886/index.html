U are trying to write as open-form poetry, where u don't restrict the lines to any length or shape. But don't forget the traditional forms like ballads, or haikus.<br>Ur poem expresses the pain and anguish U feel. Let me guess, u like this girl but ppl close to u, (ur family?) are dead set against it? Guessing only.<br><br><strong>"tries to escape from the ties<br>ties which keep him by<br>by the rusted pole<br>which is found deep within my soul"</strong><br><br>I think U have a natural flair for writing. Experiment, dun give it up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
