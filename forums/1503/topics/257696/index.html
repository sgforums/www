            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Diabolical Affection<br>By: Outlaw-2</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hands; grasping, squeezing a handle drenched in crimson,<br>A leer; wide enough to be of this dement,<br>Eyes; arched and warped to a mind-blowing pierce,<br>Mind; was there one in the first place?</span><br><br>Damp, dark, intense. Standing from the rest was a figure, hands each holding to what it seems to be sickles. In my hands was what it seemed a short sword, too, drenched in blood, both mine and others that lay limp on the ground with gashes. Noticing my presence, she aimed one of her sickles at me, with a mindless grin that somehow interest me.<br><br>"How about it?" was her harsh voice before a leer formed on her lips; stunning.<br><br>I could not bother giving a reply. This intensity was enough to answer her senseless question; a firm yes! Excitement overcame fear as I charged towards the brunette with ferocity as the blade gleamed through the night. A horrendous clang was heard before a scar formed on her left arm. She never flinched. Instead, she was stimulated by that fact; a masochist in the flesh.<br><br>"Not enough to satisfy me," she purred in someway.<br><br>A hurl from the left sickle came towards me with its blood trying to blind me. A hasty swipe from the blade left a lingering metallic clang as its reverberation stung my ears. A hard boot was made, sending her hurtling to what it seems a knock-down desk. A crunch was heard before a splatter ensued. I paced my way towards her. There she was, taking deep breaths; probably from exhaustion. Beautiful, I thought. Never was there a lass of this dement, yet stunningly charming with her abilities. I can never believe that this massacre was her doing, but I had witnessed it, and shared the same mindset.<br><br>"I'm tired, darling," she hissed with passion.<br><br>"Mind as well, my little devil," I replied with a sarcastic tone.<br><br>"My, my, you really turn me on," was her response before coming up to her feet as her right arms aimed to what it seems another classroom. "How about it, another round?"<br><br>"Very much I like it, dear,"<br><br>Lips soon connected to each other as arms wrapped around the both of us without warning. Her warmth sent me pushing her to a nearby wall, in attempt to make her my prey. Dropping her guard, crimson eyes stared into mine with fascination. The lust was unbearable, but it had to wait. We could hear our mere 'lambs' squirming to the back of the class next door, knowing that their death was next.<br><br>Maybe, I realised how much fun it was doing such a taboo. We knew, our deaths meant a one-way trip to the Underworld, but we do not care about that matter. We knew what would happen to us should we find ourselves defeated. Following this simple rule...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If one dies, another follows suit.</span><br><br>...Then from the looks of it, I might as well enjoy this moment with this hallucinating lass I call her my love.<br><br>________________________________________________<br><br>OOC: This prose can really give you tons of views about what they were doing. Give your thoughts on how you view it.</div>
