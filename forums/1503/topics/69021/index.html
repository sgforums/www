            <div class='col-md body'>These are the movies worth watching for us, who deeply appreciate arts or like international acclaimed arts movies, I dont mean blockbusters.<br><br>a) Mrs Brown starring Dame Jude Dench.<br><br>She acted as Queen Victoria, who have a close companion called Mr John Brown when she was still in mourning over the death of Prince Albert. Their companionship was so close, she was nicknamed Mrs Brown for this movie I guess. A must see, as this relationship was played out as close, but not lover like, also acted by an acclaimed British actress Jude Dench and for people steep in British history and culture. Btw, anyone who have the VCD for this movie, I am willing to buy at high price.<br><br>b) Il Mare. Korean Movie<br><br>This movie is beautiful. Set in Korea, its about a lady who moved into a house, once owned by an architect who passed away. She discover her mailbox is the channel for communication between the architect who is in the past and her in the present. It started a love relationship between both of them, and over the space of time. Wonderful, and heart wrenching, as the lady discovered she is the cause of his death, and struggle to write back to tell him to stay away from the scene of death where he will meet his accident.<br><br>c) A Beautiful Mind. By Russell Crowe<br><br>Many of my friends find this movie strange and boring. But it is actually a well played out movie about a man dealing with schiznophrenia (did i spell rite?) and with the support of his wife, struggles to climb back to reality ,and sanity. Talk about strong bond between them.<br><br>d) Wasabi. International acclaimed yet again French Japanese movie. Acted by Jean Reno and Ryoko Hirosue. Directed by Luc Besson.<br><br>Simply about a French cop who is a former spy. Discovered he had a daughter 20 years after his Japanese girlfirend who left him passed away. He flew to Japan to attend his funeral and to meet his daughter, and also to discover his dead girlfriend has connections with the Yakuza.Many things happened, and the daughter build great bond with the father. This movie is damn hilarious.<br><br>Well thats all, anymore I will post.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I liked Battle Royale...<br>perhaps one of the sharpest and wittiest political satire of Japanese society.... on the surface, the violence seemed excessive but the message was to the point... illustrating the sad degeneration of Japanese society and politics.<br><br>Same goes for Bounce! Ko Gals... another Japanese film that pointed out the reality of youth delinquency in Tokyo city and how degeneration of social mores contribute to the growing no. of youths, particularly high school gals going astray.....<br><br>Can't wait to get my hands on Ratty's VCD of A Clockwork Orange.... kekeke</div>
