The main thing that stands before and against many things.<br><br>Envy is the jealousy of things they do not possess. Even after getting it, no sense of happiness is found.<br><br>Anger is reasoning thrown out of the window. Clouding judgement and reverse compassion. Pain and hatred is all that fuels it.<br><br>Greed is the covetous of things. They can have the whole world and it is still not enough.<br><br>Sloth is the enemy of purpose. Unwilling to do what is to be done, even if the end result is pure goodness.<br><br>Lust is the perversion of sex. A wonderful gift being defiled by the mind of perversion.<br><br>Gluttony is the unstoppable force of indulgement. Be it food, game or work. Non-stop involvement in anythingresults in the negligence of others.<br><br>We all possess these seven great sins. How we place the importance of it and make aware of these seven determine how we handle all cases.<br><br>Lost? Confused? Helpless? Yes indeed......</div>
