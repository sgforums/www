            <div class='col-md body'>A SONG OF UNENDING SORROW<br><br>China's Emperor, craving beauty that might shake an empire,<br>Was on the throne for many years, searching, never finding,<br>Till a little child of the Yang clan, hardly even grown,<br>Bred in an inner chamber, with no one knowing her,<br>But with graces granted by heaven and not to be concealed,<br>At last one day was chosen for the imperial household.<br>If she but turned her head and smiled, there were cast a hundred spells,<br>And the powder and paint of the Six Palaces faded into nothing.<br>...It was early spring. They bathed her in the FlowerPure Pool,<br>Which warmed and smoothed the creamy-tinted crystal of her skin,<br>And, because of her languor, a maid was lifting her<br>When first the Emperor noticed her and chose her for his bride.<br>The cloud of her hair, petal of her cheek, gold ripples of her crown when she moved,<br>Were sheltered on spring evenings by warm hibiscus curtains;<br>But nights of spring were short and the sun arose too soon,<br>And the Emperor, from that time forth, forsook his early hearings<br>And lavished all his time on her with feasts and revelry,<br>His mistress of the spring, his despot of the night.<br>There were other ladies in his court, three thousand of rare beauty,<br>But his favours to three thousand were concentered in one body.<br>By the time she was dressed in her Golden Chamber, it would be almost evening;<br>And when tables were cleared in the Tower of Jade, she would loiter, slow with wine.<br>Her sisters and her brothers all were given titles;<br>And, because she so illumined and glorified her clan,<br>She brought to every father, every mother through the empire,<br>Happiness when a girl was born rather than a boy.<br>...High rose Li Palace, entering blue clouds,<br>And far and wide the breezes carried magical notes<br>Of soft song and slow dance, of string and bamboo music.<br>The Emperor's eyes could never gaze on her enough-<br>Till war-drums, booming from Yuyang, shocked the whole earth<br>And broke the tunes of The Rainbow Skirt and the Feathered Coat.<br>The Forbidden City, the nine-tiered palace, loomed in the dust<br>From thousands of horses and chariots headed southwest.<br>The imperial flag opened the way, now moving and now pausing- -<br>But thirty miles from the capital, beyond the western gate,<br>The men of the army stopped, not one of them would stir<br>Till under their horses' hoofs they might trample those moth- eyebrows....<br>Flowery hairpins fell to the ground, no one picked them up,<br>And a green and white jade hair-tassel and a yellowgold hair- bird.<br>The Emperor could not save her, he could only cover his face.<br>And later when he turned to look, the place of blood and tears<br>Was hidden in a yellow dust blown by a cold wind.<br>... At the cleft of the Dagger-Tower Trail they crisscrossed through a cloud-line<br>Under Omei Mountain. The last few came.<br>Flags and banners lost their colour in the fading sunlight....<br>But as waters of Shu are always green and its mountains always blue,<br>So changeless was His Majesty's love and deeper than the days.<br>He stared at the desolate moon from his temporary palace.<br>He heard bell-notes in the evening rain, cutting at his breast.<br>And when heaven and earth resumed their round and the dragon car faced home,<br>The Emperor clung to the spot and would not turn away<br>From the soil along the Mawei slope, under which was buried<br>That memory, that anguish. Where was her jade-white face?<br>Ruler and lords, when eyes would meet, wept upon their coats<br>As they rode, with loose rein, slowly eastward, back to the capital.<br>...The pools, the gardens, the palace, all were just as before,<br>The Lake Taiye hibiscus, the Weiyang Palace willows;<br>But a petal was like her face and a willow-leaf her eyebrow --<br>And what could he do but cry whenever he looked at them?<br>...Peach-trees and plum-trees blossomed, in the winds of spring;<br>Lakka-foliage fell to the ground, after autumn rains;<br>The Western and Southern Palaces were littered with late grasses,<br>And the steps were mounded with red leaves that no one swept away.<br>Her Pear-Garden Players became white-haired<br>And the eunuchs thin-eyebrowed in her Court of PepperTrees;<br>Over the throne flew fire-flies, while he brooded in the twilight.<br>He would lengthen the lamp-wick to its end and still could never sleep.<br>Bell and drum would slowly toll the dragging nighthours<br>And the River of Stars grow sharp in the sky, just before dawn,<br>And the porcelain mandarin-ducks on the roof grow thick with morning frost<br>And his covers of kingfisher-blue feel lonelier and colder<br>With the distance between life and death year after year;<br>And yet no beloved spirit ever visited his dreams.<br>...At Lingqiong lived a Taoist priest who was a guest of heaven,<br>Able to summon spirits by his concentrated mind.<br>And people were so moved by the Emperor's constant brooding<br>That they besought the Taoist priest to see if he could find her.<br>He opened his way in space and clove the ether like lightning,<br>Up to heaven, under the earth, looking everywhere.<br>Above, he searched the Green Void, below, the Yellow Spring;<br>But he failed, in either place, to find the one he looked for.<br>And then he heard accounts of an enchanted isle at sea,<br>A part of the intangible and incorporeal world,<br>With pavilions and fine towers in the five-coloured air,<br>And of exquisite immortals moving to and fro,<br>And of one among them-whom they called The Ever True-<br>With a face of snow and flowers resembling hers he sought.<br>So he went to the West Hall's gate of gold and knocked at the jasper door<br>And asked a girl, called Morsel-of-Jade, to tell The Doubly- Perfect.<br>And the lady, at news of an envoy from the Emperor of China,<br>Was startled out of dreams in her nine-flowered, canopy.<br>She pushed aside her pillow, dressed, shook away sleep,<br>And opened the pearly shade and then the silver screen.<br>Her cloudy hair-dress hung on one side because of her great haste,<br>And her flower-cap was loose when she came along the terrace,<br>While a light wind filled her cloak and fluttered with her motion<br>As though she danced The Rainbow Skirt and the Feathered Coat.<br>And the tear-drops drifting down her sad white face<br>Were like a rain in spring on the blossom of the pear.<br>But love glowed deep within her eyes when she bade him thank her liege,<br>Whose form and voice had been strange to her ever since their parting --<br>Since happiness had ended at the Court of the Bright Sun,<br>And moons and dawns had become long in Fairy-Mountain Palace.<br>But when she turned her face and looked down toward the earth<br>And tried to see the capital, there were only fog and dust.<br>So she took out, with emotion, the pledges he had given<br>And, through his envoy, sent him back a shell box and gold hairpin,<br>But kept one branch of the hairpin and one side of the box,<br>Breaking the gold of the hairpin, breaking the shell of the box;<br>"Our souls belong together," she said, " like this gold and this shell --<br>Somewhere, sometime, on earth or in heaven, we shall surely<br>And she sent him, by his messenger, a sentence reminding him<br>Of vows which had been known only to their two hearts:<br>"On the seventh day of the Seventh-month, in the Palace of Long Life,<br>We told each other secretly in the quiet midnight world<br>That we wished to fly in heaven, two birds with the wings of one,<br>And to grow together on the earth, two branches of one tree."<br>Earth endures, heaven endures; some time both shall end,<br>While this unending sorrow goes on and on for ever.</div>
