            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DeadPoet:</strong><br><br>My dear friend,<br><br>I will try to post some articles regarding your questions if I can find the time. Actually I have already done that in the past but I have not kept them updated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>For a start I strongly recommend you to read the following three books, especially <span style="font-style: italic;">The PoetÂ’s Companion </span>because it is really helpful for beginners like us. (DonÂ’t be lazy okay)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>And if you are into serious reading <span style="font-style: italic;">Best Words, Best Order </span>is a good buy. You can find the first edition in the library but you need to order the second edition from US.<br><br>1) <span style="font-style: italic;">Western Wind, An Introduction to Poetry</span>, Fourth Edition, by John Frederick Nims &amp; David Mason<br><br>2) <span style="font-style: italic;">The PoetÂ’s Companion, A Guide to the Pleasures of Writing Poetry </span>by Kim Addonizio &amp; Dorianne Laux<br><br>3) <span style="font-style: italic;">Best Words, Best Order, Essays on Poetry</span>, Second Edition, by Stephen Dobyns<br><br>But first let me briefly answer your questions,<br><br><strong>Must we follow such styles to make our poems acceptable and meaningful..? </strong><br><br>No. But if you are writing a sonnet, then of course you have to follow the structure of a sonnet. (By the way there are few kind of sonnets) Occasionally established poets do experiment with writing sonnets in different styles and successfully pulled it off.<br><br>In my opinion, your poem needs to mean something to you. (If not, you shouldnÂ’t even write it in the first place) Then, your task, as a poet is to fine-tune it so that it will mean something to your readers. Ideally, both your readers and you should have the same interpretation, but again, that is not always true because we have to take your readersÂ’ background into consideration for example their personal experiences, cultures, educational level, etc.<br><br>That is also one of the reasons why some poets such as William Wordsworth, Sharon Olds, and Gilbert Koh prefer not to use words that are too difficult. (You don't need a degree to understand their poems) Instead, they focus on other poetry-writing tools such as image, sounds, tone, etc.<br><br><strong>Would we be like writing without even knowing what we're writing if we don't...? </strong><br><br>I am not sure what you meant by this question. Are you referring to flow-writing? Unless you are in a trance you should know what you are writing right? Having say that most poets started off with an image, a phrase, etc without knowing how the poem will end.  That is the exciting part. Are you referring to that?<br><br><strong>I also remember DP telling me before that my poems are too abstract... I somehow agree with him on that, but I certainly like my poems to be more abstract than otherwise.. Is it a bad thing? </strong><br><br>No. It is not 100% a bad thing. The trick is to have a good balance between abstract terms and concrete images.  The main problem with abstracts is they do not involve your senses. You canÂ’t touch, smell, hear, etc. them. Too many of them and youÂ’ll have a boring piece. Same with concrete images, too many of them in a poem (especially the long one) and your brain will be overload.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>(And you are right, your poems are too abstract. But if you are happy with them who care what other think right? It is your poems.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>But I do really wish to know if there're so much more to poetry-writing..? </strong><br><br>More than you can imagine my friend. Check out those books.<br><br><strong>And if they're really necessary to make poems meaningful...? </strong><br><br>Refer to my earlier answer.<br><br>LetÂ’s put it this way. Before you start writing, you need to ask yourself these two questions<br><br>1) What do you want to achieve with your poems?<br>2) Who are your readers?<br><br>With them in mind, you decide your path.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>Thanks in advance for any constructive comments... </strong><br><br>You are most welcome.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>peebrain:</strong><br><br>Well... I've been known to write a couple of sonnets and villanelles when I want to give my poems a little structure or discipline.<br><br>Think of forms as a base to set the tone of the poem. For instance, sonnets tend to lend an old fogey sheen to the piece, and hence gives the poem more weight. And if you write in strict iambic pentameter and rhyme schemes, you'll realize that although it's much harder to write, the payoff is infinitely more rewarding.<br><br>I like free verse -- but I think it's very prone to abuse. And because there's no rules to it, people tend to forget to apply common literary techniques in their writing -- simple things like repetition, alliteration, allusion and metaphor are poetic tools that should be used in any form of poetry.<br><br>Personally, for anyone to call themselves a poet, they must have a working knowledge of the most common forms -- Sonnet, tercets, haiku, villanelle -- even though they do not have to specialize in any.<br><br>This is what differentiates a poet from someone who throws words around.<br><br>I don't prescribe reading "how-to" books, really. Instead, just read more poetry from the various ages.<br><br>For older poems, read Donne, Shakespeare, Bacon, Byron and Dickinson for a feel of what sonnets and tercets are like.<br><br>For more contemporary poems, Yeats, Hughes, Sexton, Plath, cummings, Riche, Dylan are pretty good.<br><br>Carol Joyce Oats, Sophie Hannah, Ted Kooser, Sharon Olds are poets that gives traditional forms the modern treatment.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>expiringpoet:</strong><br><br>Hi DP,<br><br>very insightful advise...but i'm having a problem with the situation you're describing above i.e. how poems starts off with an image and the poet not knowing how it'll end. This is basically how i write too..and while its true that its exciting, i find it to be a double edged sword as well becos the message behind the poem may run off course - becos there is no "set" structure for how the message should run. I'm not sure now if its good practise to write down what i want to say in the 1st stanza, 2nd ..and so forth - to ensure that the message will be tighter. Again, i wonder if by doing this, the creative process will become stilted and constrained by the form.

You can always come back to it later. Do not force the message into your poem. Let the poem decides your message. In my opinion, if the end product is not your original message, you are not ready to tackle it yet.<br><br><strong>I'm not sure now if its good practise to write down what i want to say in the 1st stanza, 2nd ..and so forth - to ensure that the message will be tighter.</strong><br><br>ThatÂ’s entirely up to you my friend. If you are comfortable with writing down what you want to say and allocate them according to different stanzas, so be it. But it doesnÂ’t work for me, most of the time I donÂ’t even know how many stanzas my poem will have.<br><br>I am not too sure what you meant by Â“to ensure that the message will be tighter.Â” Do you mean the poem will be tighter?<br><br><strong>Again, i wonder if by doing this, the creative process will become stilted and constrained by the form. </strong><br><br>I think peebrain has answered your question regarding this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>dsnake1:</strong><br><br>To write poetry, i think one must not forget the roots.<br><br>By this i am refering to the traditional forms of poetry : the sonnet, ballad, haiku etc. These forms are structured, they have a certain number of lines and rhyme schemes.<br><br>Why write traditional poetry? Because it is still relevant today, it builds discipline into your writing, it will improve your craft.<br><br>Contemporary poetry is often associated with free verse. People believe you can do anything with free verse. Which is true to an extent because it allows you to do nearly anything with the language. But there are still rules in free verse ( i like to call it open form poetry). You don't restrict the lines, or shape . You may not notice it, but if you write in free verse, you start to impose rules on your poem and yourself.<br><br>The trick to writing good poetry is to read good poetry. Read the traditional poets and the comtemporary ones. The selection by peebrain is very good.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

[/b]</blockquote>Expiringpoet,<br><br>You have raised very pertinent questions that I <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> try to addresss to the best of my ability.<br><br>Creativity is not about letting loose the wild horses -- but <strong>how you rein them in to do your bidding.</strong><br><br>Deadpoet and Dsnake mentioned <strong>how common it is for a poet to write about a specific image in mind, and not knowing how the rest of the poem will take shape.</strong><br><br>I beg to differ.<br><br>It is true that a lot of my poems have their origins in a specific idea in mind -- say, writer's block or solitude or existential angst -- and it usually starts with one verse, for instance, "In dreaming I take my waking slow"<br><br>This verse is the start of the <span style="color: red;"><strong>poet's examination of the human condition</strong></span>. From there, I think of how to link this insular line to a greater whole of sorts -- how to give the poem <span style="font-style: italic;">meaning</span> using this verse as a trigger.<br><br>I could use the line, "<span style="font-style: italic;">In dreaming I take my waking slow"</span> to illuminate the attractions of dreaming -- how the fantastical world could be more spiritually illuminating than our harsh reality.<br><br>As <strong>for traditional forms: they do not stifle creativity </strong>-- instead they force you to break your thoughts into coherent slices, to be assembled and appreciated by the reader.<br><br>And as a modern poet, part of the challenge is to use these traditional devices as creatively as you can, within the boundaries of structure and reason.<br><br>I've written a <strong>villanelle</strong> to explain what I mean.<br><br><blockquote><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Dreams We Break (A Villanelle)</strong></span><br><br>In dreams we break, and are torn asunder,<br>shunned while velvet nights shudder and rage,<br>so we wake to escape, our spirits bolder.<br><br>Cahiers, written by a nameless author,<br>though modest, defile with each stained page,<br>in dreams we break, and are torn asunder.<br><br>Exuent a fear impossible to master,<br>a dark light prances and torments the stage,<br>while we wake to escape, our spirits older.<br><br>Cursed is this contract, to place an actor<br>confessing her lines, even moved to persuade<br>as we dream and break, and are torn asunder.<br><br>A minstrel sings of Tristan and Isolde,<br>lovers crossed and doomed by curious fate,<br>unlike them we wake and escape, our spirits lighter.<br><br>Jostled 'tween two worlds, yet courage is steered<br>by checks and balances, a bittersweet adage:<br>although in dreams we break, and are torn asunder,<br>we shall wake to escape, our spirits bolder.<br><br></blockquote><strong>When I wrote this poem, I had only one image </strong>-- of two opposing worlds, one in dreaming, and one in waking.<br><br>That's how a villanelle is usually constructed -- you start with a couplet ("In dreams we break, and are torn asunder/ So we wake to escape, our spirits bolder") and then insert a tertiary line to form a tercet.<br><br><strong>Each line of the couplet is repeated in an alternating fashion, and the challenge lies in the <span style="color: red;">poet's ability to use fitting rhymes and images to SUPPORT the precis of the poem</span>.</strong><br><br>That's why I've stuck to imagery associated with Theater and history -- actors, Tristan and Isolde,... etc. In order to tie in with the beauty of fiction inherent in dreaming. It's tempting to cook up rubbish rhymes so as to get the stanza over and done with -- but that's hardly the point of writing poetry.<br><br>I've also deviated from the standard villanelle -- I didn't stick strictly to the repetition of couplet -- along the way, I made slight changes to the couplet to reinforce my message.<br><br>Which is why the poem begins with:<br><br><blockquote>In dreams we wake and are torn asunder,<br>So we wake to escape our spirits bolder,</blockquote>and ends up like this:<br><br><blockquote>although in dreams we break, and are torn asunder,<br>we shall wake to escape, our spirits bolder.</blockquote>You'll see that Sylvia Plath, Elizabeth Bishop, Dyland and Sophie Hannah make creative adjustments to traditional forms. Use them to your advantage -- they're your tools!<br><br>Also, bear in mind I had no idea how I was going to finish the poem, or even come up with three other stanzas. <span style="color: red;"><strong>But this is where creativity will come to save you, and discipline will force you to reexamine your writing, and make every word count.</strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DeadPoet:</strong><br><br>To add on peebrainÂ’s comment,<br><br>I agree with her that for a poem to work or to be called a poem at all you need to include in your writing some of the elements mentioned above. However for beginners like me, for a start, you can choose to focus on a couple of them such as imagery and metaphors. As you progress, feel free to explore the other areas.<br><br>Regarding scansion, it is not an easy technique to master and IMO the toughest of all. Again my suggestion is go ahead and read about scansion but for the time being put it aside first. Start with the basic stuff like line breaks, imagery, etc. Get used to them; keep practicing till theyÂ’ve became part of your writing style. And when you think you are ready, proceed to the next level.<br><br>And slightly different view from peebrain, I think poetry is both an art form and a pass-time, they co-exist.<br></div>

Sorry I've been just lurking.<br><br>In any art form, if you want to improve and perfect your craft, it certainly takes work.

IMHO.<br><br>I haven't been able to write anything in form, I'm just starting to learn how to scan. But I'm just terribly slow. Then, someday I'm gonna try writing in form. I think poetry in form is incredibly elegant and beautiful, if done well.<br><br>I'll just add my 2c's with regards to poetry instruction books -- they might not teach you all there is about writing poetry; they are certainly not school english text books, but they will give you some things to think about and suggest ways to improve, and help you to learn how to appreciate poetry of all flavors and the tools used in writing one.<br><br>Thanks for sharing your thoughts, everyone.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I've written essays and stories and articles for almost ten years, and it is only in recent years that I could honestly say I'm a writer, and I write for love and for survival.<br><br>When one claims to be a writer/photographer/poet, others will naturally assume that you have the necessary skill sets and toolkits to qualify as one. That includes a knowledge of forms, styles, print requirements, editing skills, critical review that is beyond pedestrian.<br><br>If you think you have the above, feel free to call yourself a poet. But before you do this, ask yourself the following:<br><br>1. Can my work withstand critical scrutiny? Is it worthy of analysis?<br><br>2. Have you made clear your emotions, your reactions in the piece? Is it clearly communicated to the target audience? A poet can be indifferent, but clarity of expression is key.<br><br>3. Why did I choose a particular word in the poem? Why have I chosen that voice? Where is its significance? Why are you moved to record to scene and structure the resulting work as such?<br><br>4. Does my work have depth? Does it offer room for interpretation, however vastly different from your own? Is there an exchange between the poet and reader?<br><br>5. Will I have the courage to revise, draft after draft, a written piece that doesn't work?<br><br>6. Most importantly -- do you love the sound of words tumbling from your tongue, the tinkling rhythms created as a result? Can you rip apart your feelings into base factors, reconstruct them into a unique reality that no other can emulate? Could you then use the sparest words to encapsulate the crux of your experience?<br><br>Wordsworth once said, "Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility." I'll go on to say that a poet derives his inspiration from the anguish and exuberance of <span style="font-style: italic;">living</span>, the examination of the human condition.<br><br>Writing is a skill driven by motivation, and refined by critical thought.  A poet's job is more excruciating by far, because he distill thoughts and emotions into an eloquent frame supported only by words so precise in their arrangement, that any substitute will be for the poorer.<br><br>I guess, at the end of this tedious exposition, my point is -- so long as you can justify your position and stance upon your poem is written, so long as others can glean visceral value from your words, your clarity and ambuguity in tandem, feel free to call yourself a poet.<br><br>Wait, you wouldn't have to. Others will certainly refer to you as one.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DeadPoet:</strong><br><br>This is from my blog. I hope it will answer your question.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I have not really given it any serious thoughts until recently. But frankly, how do you distinguish between poetry and prose? Take the following piece for example,<br><br><strong>When lives are at stake,<br>would you risk<br>not reporting it?<br>If you see anything<br>or anyone suspicious,<br>inform our staff<br>or call 999.<br>And donÂ’t leave<br>your belongings unattended.<br>We all have a part to play<br>in keeping Singapore<br>Safe.</strong><br><br>Do you consider it a poem? It is actually a copy of the notice put up at various MRT stations to remind commuters to stay alert. I chopped it up and arranged it to look like a poem. Okay, okay, this is not really a good example.<br><br>But what about this?<br><br><strong>And then comes Spring.<br>The sun is bright,<br>the water sparkles,<br>and the lobsters are active again,<br>swimming about, eating<br>like kings, and vying<br>for a place in your<br>Butter-browned top-sliced<br>frankfurter bun.</strong><br><br>Would you categorize it as poetry? Better than the previous one right? In fact it is a passage taken from one of the articles in <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“It mustÂ’ve been something I ateÂ”</span> by Jeffrey Steingarten. Again, IÂ’ve chopped it up and try to pass it off as a poem.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Basically, there are two things I look out for in a piece of writing before I decide whether it is a poetry or prose. Firstly is the existence of poetic devices such as meter, rhyme, imagery, metaphor, compression, etc. Secondly is its overall effect on me. I need to be delighted, to be surprised, and if you could stun me with it, the better; I will not hesitate to give you an A Plus.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>To quote Emily Dicknson,<br><br><strong>Â“If I read a book [and] it makes my whole body so cold no fire ever can warm me I know that is poetry. If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry. These are the only way[s] I know it. Is there any other way?Â”</strong><br><br>To illustrate the second point, two poems immediately come into my mind. Coincidentally both are very short poems. One is a haiku by Taniguchi Buson -<br><br><strong>The piercing chill I feel:<br>my dead wife's comb, in our bedroom,<br>under my heel . . .</strong><br><br>And the other poem is <strong>Accident</strong> by Gilbert Koh, a local poet I greatly respect.<br><br>He once told me,<br><br><strong>Â“A poem has to show me something that I wasn't aware of; or it has to show me something that I was aware of, but in a way I'd never thought of before. If I don't discover anything new in a poem, then it doesn't work for me. It's not a poem to me.Â”</strong><br><br>I have no problem with that. But what if instead of a poem, it is a prose that Â“show me something that I wasn't aware of; or it has to show me something that I was aware of, but in a way I'd never thought of before. If I don't discover anything new Â…Â” can I still consider it a poem? In fact many articles written by Mr Wang in his blog "Did Mister Wang Say So?" meet the above requirements, but they are definitely not poetry.<br><br>Maybe as suggested by Gilbert,<br><br><strong>Â“And if it is a good piece, does it really matter whether it is more correctly classified as prose or poetry?Â”</strong><br><br>Well sorry Gilbert, but it does matters to me because I am the stubborn type.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Although the boundary between poetry and prose remind obscure but there is still hope; as Joan Houlihan in her reply to Fred Moramarco said<br><br><strong>Â“While I agree that it is basically impossible to successfully and fully define a poem, I maintain that it is possible to define a non-poem Â– by its lack of poetic conventions.Â”</strong><br><br>In my opinion, if you write a prose using poetic devices, if you insist, you can call it a prose poem. On the other hand, if you write a poem in the manners as if you are writing a prose, it will remain a prose, nothing but a prose.<br></div>

Chu Chi is a place in the former South Vietnam famous for its tunnels dug by the guerrilla armies fighting against the Americans in the Vietnam War. The rats allude to the Vietcong hiding in those tunnel complexes. Metal locusts refer to american air power. The VC are like ghosts because they are very elusive. At one time Chu  Chi was one of the most bombed areas on earth.<br><br>Hope this little history lesson helps in the imaging.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>&gt;&gt;I have also the world's most logical mind.  heheh, i like that.</div></blockquote>I guess for your case, it depends on how familiar the reader is with Vietnam war?? When I read it, I got the idea of Vietcong scurrying here and there through their massive network of underground tunnels... but i guess if a reader doesn't know you're referring to the Vietnam war, then it's kinda tough putting it in context?</div>
