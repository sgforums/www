            <div class='col-md body'>Well...<br><br>think of lyrics as a subset of poetry -- traditionally, they're usually in the form of a ballad, with a typical rhyme scheme of ABABCDCD. An contemporary example -- Collin Raye's Love Me.<br><br>In modern times though, lyrics have taken a more pastoral perspective -- it's become more intimate, more layman, more free and easy -- with music taking precedence more often these days.<br><br>Think of the riffs and hooks and refrains as a poetic device, save for the fact that they've become more pedestrian, and cliche. It's usualy about me, me and me.<br><br>Whereas for poetry, the subject matter is usually more universal, using analogies, metaphors and devices like that to draw parallels between our individual existence, and ultimately, bring about an enlightening of being.</div>

What I have is a burning passion (I know, I know it is a clichÃ©) for poetry.  I am not sure why but I just love poetry and I want so much to find out more about it.<br><br>But donÂ’t worry we are all learning in DPS (S), well most f us, and I am in the process of putting up a thread on poetic tools sort of like <a href="http://www.everypoet.org/pffa/forumdisplay.php?f=34" rel="nofollow">Blurbs of Wisdom</a> in PFFA.
