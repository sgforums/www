            <div class='col-md body'>Before I start I have to be honest with you, this is not one of your better poems. As a friend, I am not going to hold back, so here goes Â–<br><br><strong>Kindergarten </strong><br><br>The title says it all, nothing interesting about it.<br><br><strong>Mothers stand with open umbrellas in the rain, </strong><br><br>Forgive me but I am really amused by this line. IsnÂ’t it obvious that if it is raining, you need to open your umbrella? And isnÂ’t it also obvious that most likely these mothers will be standing rather than sitting around in the rain with open umbrellas?<br><br><strong>watching their babies through the shutter windows. </strong><br><br>Imo, Â“watchingÂ” is rather weak and passive. If you are trying to portray the anxieties of the mothers, I suggest the whole sentence should be rewritten.<br><br><strong>Say goodbye, wave a little bye-bye, blow a little kiss </strong><br><br>Too many repetition of Â“byeÂ” here.<br><br><strong>before the teachers shut the windows and break out </strong><br><br>I like this line, especially the ending. But may I suggest breaking the line at Â“breakÂ”, help to keep the readers in suspense.<br><br><strong>the crayons. I don't remember my first day except<br>that I cried; shamelessly; and why shouldn't I: </strong><br><br>Slightly too wordy for me.  Sorry but I donÂ’t really like it.<br><br><strong>to be taken away from my lovely mother and made </strong><br><br>I am not crazy about Â“lovely motherÂ”. Maybe it is just me.<br><br><strong>to sit in a room full of strange children and hags </strong><br><br>Same problem with open umbrellas in the rain. I mean you either sit or stand in the room right? I am also confused regarding the emotions of the narrator as a child. Was he/she feeling anxious, curious, indifferent, angry, etc?<br><br><strong>who wear dresses with too many flower prints and<br>demand obedience. Who does this to their love ones?</strong><br><br>Weak ending. I am afraid the question doesnÂ’t do much for me.<br><br>I know you can do better than this as I've read your other poems.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
