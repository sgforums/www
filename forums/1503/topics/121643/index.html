            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there, I'm new here and chanced upon this forum. I enjoy reading and writing poetry and frequently blog them down. Sometimes I write some prose as well. The poetry and prose here are all parts of my personal experiences and record emotions, thoughts and events that happened in my life last year. They can be divided into a couple of categories, and perhaps you can piece parts of my life story in 2004 together if you take the time to read through the compilation.<br><br>A couple of poems have esoteric references and styles which you might not be able to grasp. I apologize for such events.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Poetry</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Stepping in the Puddles...of past regret and sorrows...</span></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The rain falls,<br>The rain falls,<br>The rain pours.<br><br>The lonely traveller treks on the road<br>Like a train,<br>Doomed to its tracks.<br>Alone, one-way.<br>There is no sun no shadow no ending.<br><br>The rain falls,<br>The rain falls,<br>The rain halts.<br><br>Lonely puddles reflecting the rainbow.<br>There is a shadow now; there is a hope.<br><br>Colours in life,<br>Pot of gold.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Lighthouse</span><br><br>There was a child<br>Whose life<br>Was grown in rife.<br><br>Deriving warmth only<br>From Blood in Veins<br>Which chained him like Reins.<br><br>People found just ice<br>In him but he could<br>Find Nothing.<br><br>Then came a searing Flame<br>Which melt the Ice<br>And Body purified.<br><br>People found in him<br>Beacon of Light.<br>Still the boy found Nothing.<br><br>Run, row, ride<br>He cannot<br>Fight.<br><br>The Tide of Fate<br>Will not abate,<br>Cannot be sate.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lamentation: of God after Dinner</span></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">My tongue it hurts O so much I feele,<br>Sometimes bitter, acrid, pungent but never sweet<br>As thy life slides downe myne gut;<br>What was Ambrosia is now rot<br>Which my belly-worlde, in it gall burne<br>And you harbinger of sin, decay and<br>Addiction, as Innocence is lulled to you;<br>Rat to poison, moth to fire,<br>Why thence dost thou tremble when thou bringst<br>Quaking to the now gall'ess worlde<br>Which desires salvation through doome;<br>You indictment of Hope and Messiah of the deluded Despaired,<br>Make my gullible worlde I created, wave of fooles,<br>To put false faith and terrible trust leading to<br>Them temulent, always blind;<br>And you my childe-creation so effective<br>That I too sometimes fail<br>To detect thy Potency<br>Which through age brings life,<br>And I realize that thou is not<br>Created from hapless bunch of grapes,<br>But from the fallen Nine Sunnes.</span><br><br>*The fallen Nine Sunnes refers to the Chinese legend of skilled archer Hou Yi, who shot down 9 out of the 10 suns from the sky.

I generally pen my thoughts down in my blog in incoherent but meaningful manners. Unfortunately, the don't really constitute as prose. Nonetheless, here are 2 pieces of prose which I found decent enough to be displayed.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Misery stems from my mother. She seems to nurture it dutifully, allowing it to sprout and take root on firmer grounds. She flits around my life like a light-footed snake; oh she is a special serpent (more special than the one found in the Garden), she has two feet where others have none. Come hither, dear friends and let us explore these chasmal jaws which house the tenacious fangs (blest with the ability to regenerate) which produce (like clock-work) more than just surplus toxin, but also enough malice, spite and bitterness that would make a nefarious malador of contempt towards my mortality. There is no antivenin for this venom. I could imagine how scientists tremble at the potency of this vile creature and its medical and scientific significance. But looking in retrospect, scientists would never have dreamt that such a beast could ever have walked this earth. She is the stuff of nightmares. Afterall, science only deals with the empirical and rules out the paranormal.</span><br><br>*This was just a little extract I wrote after a big fight*<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Suddenly feeling disgusted at the state of the cathedral, he went back towards his bed, in hopes of looking for comfort and perhaps even shelter from the disease called age which plagued the entire structure. He found none as he found himself staring at his rectangular bed framed by four fragile-looking bedposts mirroring the rectangular hole on the brickwall besides his bed. It was framed by four other bricks, anxious to follow in the footsteps of their missing consort; rest was no longer comforting to him. He shifted his attention back to the cold sky which was shut and wished that its doors would yield to the rain once more and open. He did not want to see the diseased gargoyles nor the ailing structure. The rain could blind him temporarily from all that. More rain would not make a difference to how fast the cathedral sunk into the soft mud; the monolithic structure was crushing itself down by its own weight, contributed by time, desire and the moss. The rain would not obey his wish, neither would the dream of a spire. So he closed his eyes, blinding himself from what he chose not to see.<br><br>He saw himself preaching, high up and speaking from the pulpit. But he was not in any of the churches in the city. He was up in the spire, a new spire which shone with lustre. A spire where the wood was varnished till it glowed like luminous marble and where the marble dazzled to mirror his reflection. The bricks were unadulterated of the lecherous lichens and moss and the gargoyles for once, actually looked healthy and happy despite their task of eternal damnation to safeguard this marvellous structure. His sermon echoed down the spire, just as the spire echoed perfection down to its foundation. Yet, there was something not quite right about the entire affair. It was peculiarly quiet, lacking the familiar ambience of a disgruntled yet ostensibly patient crowd. The people who so often complained. Were they all dead from the plague of reality? The tranquility was shattered as the familiar wind, which he had grown accustomed yet not agreeable with, howled into his ears, forcing his eyes open. The sudden outburst shocked him as it shocked his vision of those pristine walls which held the spire he so dearly wanted. The rude interruption did more than just shock him and his spire, but also the bricks by his bed. Eagerly, another brick fell onto the cold, stern floor, happy that its wish was finally granted. Joceline wished that the imminent decay of the cathedral would be as imminent as the construction of the additional spire. But it was only a wish. It was a long time since God last fulfilled one.</span><br><br>*This was a piece of creative writing done to emulate a writer's style. The writer in question is William Golding, and the novel in question is The Spire. Obviously, it was an exam question for one of my A level literature prelims.*<br><br>Thank you all for your time, if you even read them...<br></div>
