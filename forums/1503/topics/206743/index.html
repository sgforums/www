            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose this is very familiar to all Englishmen...this poem by William Blake formed the lyrics of that national hymn, 'Jerusalem' by Elgar. It was apparently used in the movie 'Chariots of Fire' as well...<br><br>And did those feet in ancient time<br>Walk upon EnglandÂ’s mountains green?<br>And was the Holy Lamb of God<br>On EnglandÂ’s pleasant pastures seen?<br>And did the countenance divine<br>Shine forth upon our clouded hills?<br>And was Jerusalem builded here<br>Among these dark satanic mills?<br><br>Bring me my bow of burning gold!<br>Bring me my arrows of desire!<br>Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!<br>Bring me my chariot of fire!<br>I will not cease from mental fight,<br>Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,<br>Till we have built Jerusalem<br>In EnglandÂ’s green and pleasant land.<br></div>
