It is okay to be blunt.  But if you think you might offend the other party, you can always pm him/her instead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Well I will be reading this poem over a nice cup of hot coffee in the next few days.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>From a different angle:</strong><br><br>The author first describe a physical part of the body i.e. the legs and the brain in the first stanza line 7 and line 8.  He then moves away from this physical aspect to something more abstract in the second stanza i.e. the mind, line 6.  What is interesting here is that the author links his mind and not the brain to a corpse thus linking an abstract concept to something physical.<br><br>In the third stanza the author brings us to the next level, the domain of spiritual world i.e. the soul.  Again he gives it a physical touch by describing it as a <strong>Â‘wounded soulÂ’</strong>.  Only in the last stanza does the author breaks away from the physical aspect of the pain he is feeling, a realm where soul burns and phoenix/ Devil roam.<br><br>But to our surprise we are abruptly brought down to earth by the last two lines. (Ouch!)  The introduction of the character Â‘firemanÂ’ seems very out of place.  Who is this fireman?  I believe he is the authorÂ’s <strong>conscious determination </strong> whose main function is to to suppress the pain. We are brought back to reality, back where we first started in the opening stanza.  The journey is now complete (Though a bit rush I must say) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>There is also the risk that our friend may not be able to suppress this feeling forever.  Fortunately he has a choice.  Whether he chooses to contain or to be consumed by the flame is entirely up to him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
