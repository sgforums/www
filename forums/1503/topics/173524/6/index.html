            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><strong>By DriftingGuy posted on 26 October 2006</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Fisherman (A Short Story)</strong><br><br>There was once a fisherman who lived his life knowing only how to fish. Every morning he will get up early in the morning just so that he can have more hours to fish before he sleeps.<br><br>He desired having fish so much, he dreamt about it every single day. In his waking hours, all he can think about is fish, fish and more fish. His favorite fish is white pomfret which he dreams about almost every night<br><br>However, every time he casts his fishing rod, he only manages to get thrown out rubbish or at best a few shrimps.<br><br>He tried everything possible, from getting a better fishing rod, reading up on better fishing locations or better fishing times and yet to no avail.<br><br>This went on for quite some time. As time goes by, his desire slowly waned. He realised that there must be more to life than just fishes. Finally, after failing to fish for the last time, he stopped.<br><br>The fisherman decided try out other things. He learnt to ride a bicycle. He travelled around to places he was too busy to visit while he was fishing. He tried hiking, reading, mountain climbing and a whole host of other activities which he never tried before. He enjoyed doing all these things and when he tire of them, he discovered that there were always new things he havent tried.<br><br>Fishing was still his primary love. Yet as time passes, it became just an interest. And then, a distant memory.<br><br>Some time later, the fisherman decided to learn sailing as he has grown affection for the sun, the sand and the sea. He bought a sail boat and steered his boat northwards towards the shimmering sea.<br><br>After hours of cruising through the emerald waters and after that enjoying the sunset, the fisherman went back. As he left the gangway, he noticed a net caught by a hook onto the stern of his boat. With great effort, he removed the net and threw it on the floor. Within the net lies a great multitude of shrimps, groupers, bass and of course white pomfrets.<br></div>

The stupid lil' kid asks the mother who is that, the mother tells him its his friend... doesn't he remember? The escalator continues ascending, the jumping boisterous kid on the other side falls on the mechanical steps and starts bawling, the stupid lil' kid can't remember.<br><br>-----<br><br>the stupid lil' kid is sitting in the ballroom. theres a christmas party of sorts going on and somebody dressed as santa claus is coming in later. there are other midgets everywhere, the place is filled with christmas deco that someone has to clear up later.The stupid lil' kid is looking down at the table because the stupid lil' kid is alone -but not for long, some other brat comes and sits. The brat is with the parents, the parent fusses about its brat and then asks the stupid lil' kid, how old are you in standard pleasant condescending manner. The parent remarks to its brat, 'very small size'. The stupid lil' kid looks across the room. Later, santa claus,an old fraud starts handing out presents, the stupid lil' kid feels his package,a flat rectangle and can't imagine what it might be, but figures that its something special if its so enigmatic.<br>On the way home in the car, the stupid lil' kid opens his package and discovers a children's book of...a fairy tale with huge letters which he finishes reading in a minute.<br><br>-----<br><br>the stupid lil' kid is sitting in class. the class is dark,the projector is on and on it,is a transparency with a grammar exercise. The stupid lil' kid seems oblivious so the teacher calls him out. The kid comes back from the floating world and walks out slowly .Taking a marker from the teacher, the stupid lil kid approaches the machine and squinting at the incandescent glow he feels like he has just woken up. All eyes are on him, there is absolute silence in the classroom... he reads the question, "the class of pupils ____ reading in the library". Then answers without thought, 'is' . Like a rousing hive, the other midgets enter a droning chorus of 'nooooooo' almost before the teacher asks if the answer is correct. When the chorus fades away, the teacher delivers the grave news, the stupid lil kid standing by the projector,is correct. The stupid lil kid looks at the teacher. the teacher nods her head with an expression of obliging approval. the stupid lil' kid makes his way back to his seat right at the back feeling like he has cheated death. the lesson continues when he is seated.<br></div>
