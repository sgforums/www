            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Everyone!<br><br>Let me gush about how excited i was to find so many talents in this forum.  i am indeed humbled by the depth by which each poem was expressed. I have an interest to write, but being not very well schooled, my pieces look rather juvenile against the "chiem" works of everyone here.  I really hope all the "si fus" here would help me polish some of my work. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Idolize</span></strong><br><br>I see you through rose-tinted glasses,<br>You're perfect, without any flaws,<br>My devotion to you is boundless,<br>Defy Physics and any human laws.<br><br>Your every word is convincing,<br>To me, it becomes the Truth.<br>I really don't mind sacrifying,<br>My faith in you, no one else can move.<br><br>Possessed?

And contrary to an earlier response, I don't find the piece juvenile -- unpolished, maybe, but certainly not childish.<br><br>The ending lines (I really don't care what others think of me/As long as I'm still in your favour) actually remind me of Wendy Cope in its simplicity and truth.<br><br>Kudos.<br><br>Just a few bugbears, however.<br><br><strong>Title</strong>: Why "Idolize"? If the title is a verb, I'll expect the poem to be one that is full of movement and action, but yours is more of a meditation than anything else. So personally, for one-word titles, I'll go for nouns.<br><br><strong>Language and grammar</strong> -- Why capitalize "Truth"? Are we meant to read it as an independent entity? If so, the suceeding verse doesn't support that view. And if it's just... truth in the most general sense, you don't need the capitals.<br><br><strong>Grammar </strong>-- sacrifice (in place of "sacrifying" ), defies (in place of "defy" -- not only wil it be grammatically correct, it enhances the consonnance between "defies" and "physics".<br><br><strong>Usage of "really"</strong> -- is it <span style="font-style: italic;">reallllllly</span> necessary? Read it out loud, and omit the "really's". You'd be surprised how much more decisive the poem sounds.<br><br>These aside, I think it's pretty complete.... except....<br><br>What do you mean the poem also lends a "voice" to the wife of the religious guy? If you're trying to depict the irrationality of the Stockholm effect, or that of <span style="font-style: italic;">folie a deux</span>, then your piece doesn't work.<br><br>This is my opinion: Next time, leave out the elaboration/embellishment. It's better to let your poem stand on its own merit. And let the critics deduce the subtext on their own.<br><br>In this case, the excessive elaboration (voice/religious/rape/brutality) systematically destroyed my appreciation for the poem. -shrug</div>

That is why a big percentage of writers kill themselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Repeating DP's point here but reading more poetry helps. Pick up an anthology that includes modern and contemporary writers to have an idea of the current poetry trends and to find what you enjoy. Then read some more, emulate the styles you like, write, experiment and just have fun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
