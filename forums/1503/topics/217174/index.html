            <div class='col-md body'>I got so bored I wrote a short story... no flamm pls <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>There was once a fisherman who lived his life knowing only how to fish. Every morning he will get up early in the morning just so that he can have more hours to fish before he sleeps.<br><br>He desired having fish so much, he dreamt about it every single day. In his waking hours, all he can think about is fish, fish and more fish. His favorite fish is white pomfret which he dreams about almost every night<br><br>However, every time he casts his fishing rod, he only manages to get thrown out rubbish or at best a few shrimps.<br><br>He tried everything possible, from getting a better fishing rod, reading up on better fishing locations or better fishing times and yet to no avail.<br><br>This went on for quite some time. As time goes by, his desire slowly waned. He realised that there must be more to life than just fishes. Finally, after failing to fish for the last time, he stopped.<br><br>The fisherman decided try out other things. He learnt to ride a bicycle. He travelled around to places he was too busy to visit while he was fishing. He tried hiking, reading, mountain climbing and a whole host of other activities which he never tried before. He enjoyed doing all these things and when he tire of them, he  discovered that there were always new things he havent tried.<br><br>Fishing was still his primary love. Yet as time passes, it became just an interest. And then, a distant memory.<br><br>Some time later, the fisherman decided to learn sailing as he has grown affection for the sun, the sand and the sea. He bought a sail boat and steered his boat northwards towards the shimmering sea.<br><br>After hours of cruising through the emerald waters and after that enjoying the sunset, the fisherman went back. As he left the gangway, he noticed a net caught by a hook onto the stern of his boat. With great effort, he removed the net and threw it on the floor. Within the net lies a great multitude of shrimps, groupers, bass and of course white pomfrets.</div>
