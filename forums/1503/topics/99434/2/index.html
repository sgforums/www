Never so clear... Never so understood... Never really seen.... The me....<br><br>The me which people admire.... The me which people look upon.... The me who chases after my life... Myself... And my dreams... The me which is not too big. Just one size which is okie....<br><br>The me as a predator... The me as a lover.... The me inert... The me inspirational.... The me who missed myself.. Look at others... Fall. Walk past me. Outrun me. The me who has been casted all the way behind on the race track. Stood there watching the others run. Squat down by the track. And admire the beautiful flower.<br><br>The me... Weird... The me which often make no sense. Give nonsense. Utter some words which people don't understand.<br><br>The me... Teacher say... I'm stupid. Teacher say I'm lazy. Teachers who doesn't know me. Teacher, I asked them - why do we have to be this way. They never say.<br><br>The me who's cold inside. Cold outside. And looks at the cold world. Understand that it's mine. Where I belong.<br><br>The me who looks at you. You look at me. Yet we both don't say a thing.<br><br>The me, you can't read through my mind. The me, you can't drill through my head. But as you're reading this... Hope you'll understand... At least a bit...?</span></div>

I look at it. So silent. So strange? It feeds on battery. The energy I charged it with. It seems so full of 'strength', yet it does basically nothing much. It doesn't smile at me. It doesn't talk to me.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Hey, there's a call for you."</span> Press the button. <span style="font-style: italic;">"Whey?"</span><br><br>Sometimes it tells me silent stories. Sms. I stare it. It stares back at me as I read. It seems to have seen so much more of me than others do. It know my secrets. It know my lies. It know the world in which I hide.<br><br>I always carry it with me. Occasionally check if it's okie (got message for me or not?). Sometimes I wonder what if it has a mind of its own? What if it can tell me lies? Would it be as tired as I am? Well... At least it doesn't have to walk?<br><br>Could it be a deaf? The way I speak so closely to it. Sometimes yell at it... Must be a real poor thing...? <span style="font-style: italic;">"Hey, your saliva's spilling on my face..." </span>That's what it seems?<br><br>I wish it has hair, so that I can at least comb for it? But all I can do is put on the 'danglings' and expect it to look neat. The day it lies by my side. The night it lies by my bed. The moment it lights up for me. It often has a different story to tell.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Are you okay? You look upset?"</span> It doesn't reply me back. Maybe it's just tired? Maybe sleepy? Motionless. Wonder if it shares my happiness when I encounter them? If it can talk of its own, wonder what would it say to me...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"You wanna chat buddy...?"</span></div>

Yes, <span style="font-style: italic;">can't get my eyes off you...</span><br><br>It's strange how 2 people barely knowing each other can get so close together.... Be with one another.... And develops like that... Its even stranger as their relationship develops.. They can just as suddenly revert back into total strangers to each other... How things originally so simple... Can turn out so differently.... Just becuase "I can't get my eeys off you...."<br><br>As she messaged me once again... Asking how have I been... Do I still miss her as much...

Would love to tell her some white lies.... Add on to the chance of us being back together again, but I just couldn't bring myself into hurting her any further.... My words that would hurt her for now... Than to hurt her even more deeply in the future.... As both of us probably knows that things would never be the same again.... Yes, I'll have to admit.... I've hurt her enough....<br><br>These days... Though I've always wanted to message her... Ask her out for coffee.... But I've never really pick up enough courage to face her again... Yes, I love her... Strangers we once were, but today we're just too close....<br><br>I understand that she may never forgive me... I understand that I may never deserves it.... This is the strange thing about people you meet each day... People you barely know.... People which sometimes you think a bit more about.... You'll never really know what would become of them tomorrow.....<br><br>"Love to have coffee one day?" - <span style="font-style: italic;">Yes. I would love to....</span> But I've never brought up enough courage to ask.... The problem with us people is.... <span style="font-style: italic;">Sometimes we're just thinking so much..... Yet doing so little.....<br><br>"Hello stranger...."</span><br><br>"Hi....?" The problem with me is... <span style="font-style: italic;">Sometimes I just can't bring myself to see so much anymore....</span></div>

Maybe because I'm just <span style="font-style: italic;">someone else</span>...?<br><br>The helplessness... The struggles... I took a sip from my drink and munched on my pop-corn... While the guy in the movie just cried... "Someone should have done that long ago already... " I heard someone from a few seats across my row said.....<br><br>"Could it be, nobody has ever noticed him....?"<br><br>I continued to watch the screen as scenes passed by... Everyone's watching very closely....<br><br>This guy's encounters were a bit familar to me... Reminds me of someone....<br><br>I continued to think... "Is that someone already dead....?"<br><br>My drink... I'm thirsty....<br><br>"Someone odd to shoot that mastermind...." said a lady frustratedly...<br><br>Someone else added... "Yeah..."<br><br>I watched as the guy on the screen cried helplessly once again.... Someone passed a piece of tissue paper to someone besides him.... I think it's his girlfriend.....<br><br>The guy was standing on the edge of the building... No one moved a bit and stared....<br><br>"Oh no...." Someone cried... The body just flew himself off the building... I munched my pop-corn... Trying to finish my drink as I knew it was coming to the end of the show...<br><br>Soon enough the light was on once again in the threatre.<br><br>Everyone was moving out of the place.<br><br>"So sad..." Someone said.<br><br>"Yeah..." I thought. "Reminds me of someone?"</div>

For 'intelligence'? Or perhaps... Not much of any of the above...?<br><br>When someone cry. When someone want. When someone 'demand'? Someone you help today. Someone you fear tomorrow? Someone you pulled up. At the same times pushing many others down...? Or severely damning another unfairly?<br><br>The world is round... You need help. We need help.<br><br>Without God's 'don't know'; Devils' 'don't understand'. Human is often lost in between... Sometimes they seems to see... Seems to know... Seems to understand...? But...

Battle is strong... Victory is on hand....<br><br>"Sir, do we proceed...?"<br><br>"Sir...?"<br><br>We smiled at each other... Generals... Victory... How delighted that this day has finally come.. Soldiers, spirits is high...<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"We're winning!! TEAR THEM DOWN!!!"</span></span><br><br>Army rushes.. No efforts...

It's an AMBUSH!!"<br><br>He kept in silence. Knewing it was always from the beginning.. Everything is going according to plan.<br><br>"Help!!" Slashed a young boy before his very eyes. Could grow up to be a great foe in potential. He doesn't take any chances...<br><br>"Help!!" DIE.. DIE... Show no mercy to an enemy as no mercy would be shown to you... But... They are afterall so helpless....?<br><br>His desires won over him... Victory is too sweet to be sacrificed.. He turned numb. Iron fist. Strength and his power... His ability to execute. Before him, countless times.. Decisions have to be made. He chose the simplest.. The route towards his goal and victory....<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Great men were lost... Dreaded enemy has took a strayed cunning move... Creeped upon us like thieves...."</span><br><br>Angry faces lit up the blood field. Enemy is everywhere. Sometimes you just can't even recognise one...<br><br>He looks into the sky. Pleaded guilty. But then... This is a battlefield... Who isn't..? Assurance which isn't firm enough... Helpless screams echoed through his head... Tiring day it was.. He needs to sleep. The fatigue is killing him...<br><br>Sleep. Next day. 1st ray of light. So BRIGHT. Lights up everywhere. Furnitures, stores, people... Screaming.. He didn't counted this. Bad. He ran. All directions. Stay calm he said. Heart pounding.. But mind must act.<br><br>Racing on horses, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Follow me!"</span><br><br>Grasses were cut. He felt weak. Sour?<br><br>Victory. The only word which ran through his mind.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Is everyone ok?"</span><br><br>"Yes sir!"<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Make sure that no one's injuried."</span><br><br>"Yes sir!"<br><br>Always a caring general. Well-respected by his men.<br><br>Do NOT give up. He thought to himself. Took the men and ready for a surprise visit.<br><br>No one could have expected. No one even himself.<br><br>SLAYER. Took heads after heads. Everyone taken unprepared.<br><br>"46!"<br><br>"Was it..??" "Damn! I lost count again!"<br><br>Blood that drips... From fresh to dawn. The color of death. The smell...<br><br>"Sir, we are ready to...."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"SILENCE!!"</span><br><br>VICTORY. The RED CARPET. He steps down from his horses. Gathering the rest of the helpless ones... He passed. Through the gates. Gathered by his smiling friends.<br><br>"Cheers!"<br><br>One offered him a cup of the 'victory' in taste.<br><br>He smiled. Took over. Held the cup high up in the air.<br><br>The sword came down. His arm is severed. Bleeding. Weak. Too soon....?<br><br>He looks around a bit... Turned cold... Heard laughters...<br><br>Silence.<br><br>It's dark. But victory is in hand?</div>

We laid down... But still heard no one wept... We understood right these moments of silence that many things were never what we thought we had...<br><br>In silence, I understood your feelings.. Which I thought I knew all that I had... Are pictures of me and you once lived by a life like poetries.. Of all the things that I've planned and said...<br><br>This moment... It's too far deep in silence... Make me fear... The day which I expect... Would come too soon for us and nail us down for eternity... But what about the dreams we shared when we slept...?<br><br>Too quickly, I've created my own fear... Too quickly, the hands I held on would be slipped... When I know how much I just want it, but at the same time can't hide it.. But to face this day which both of us were prepared...<br><br>Meanings... Do we always have to suffer in silence..? Sharing... Is that the reason why we truly cared...? When we knew this day we've created and simply what we've hated... Yet we can't deny the passions we had.....<br><br>Silence.. By your bed I looked in silence... Moments... Of the days we longed to have... And even if this meant the last kiss I've send you, or never again shall I visit you.. Remember I've told you what I've said....<br><br>This moment... Would be the one that we'll be sharing... This day... No matter what time it should set... As long as I know you're here by my side and you understand I have your heart in mine, no you need not... Simply need not cry...<br><br>For each and every day... With or without me by your side....</div>
