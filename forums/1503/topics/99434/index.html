Gathered at the foot of a mountain. We met, we exchanged... Often so much, we begin to wonder if we've crossed the path...? Knowing each other.... The familarity... Have we stopped...?<br><br>The place that placed us together... So close... Yet tomorrow we might just wake up to reality... Only to realise that you're no longer there... All our memories... All our dreams.... All of our thoughts... Yesterday?<br><br>Living in a world of reality blue... Where lights on the stage would be shut off one by one... Until we feel that we're no longer there... Moments... Memories... One corner... Today... I look at the world.... Blue...? Would you still be here tomorrow...?</span></div>

The hall just seems to warm up a little....<br><br>There you stood... Now it's empty... Took off...? I continue to walk.... Every corner of the airport... As I usually did before your arrivals.... As if I'm looking for somethin....?<br><br>I imagined your smile... At different corners.... You would just blink at me.... I would just stand down there.... We would just exchange look for moments... So long.... You are there again....<br><br>I stoodby at the departure.... I stood at the arrivals... I've even been to the cafe... But I just kept walking alone.... Not that I would expect a miracle to happen.... I'm just wondering how you've been..?<br><br>Maybe one day I should just fly over? Just to see how you've been...? Everybody seems so busy at the airport.... Are they waiting for something...? And I'm walking... Am I waiting for something....? Am I looking for something.....?</span></div>

Would I be forgiven...? Could it be 'reversed'....? What difference would it make...?<br><br>Tears... Actions... Breath... Words.... So gentle.... Yet the IMPACT....? SO GREAT...? Can you FEEL it...?

As the grief and guilt hit me...</span><br><br>SAD.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Constantly you looked away... I knew you were crying...  I felt so very wrong... What have I done to you...? After all that you've done for me...?<br><br>I cried... Streaming... Never thought a devil could cry...<br><br>I hugged you even closer... You pushed me away... I kept saying 'sorry'... Though I knew it just won't help much... "I'm sorry... Forgive me..." Though I knew I don't deserves to be forgiven... "I'll sorry... Forgive me..." Though I knew you won't forgive me... "I'm sorry... Please take care of your weak health... I really don't want your condition to get any worse for me..." You said you wished you were dead... "I'm sorry.... So sorry...." Repeating I can no longer control my tears....<br><br>You looked me and said "Forget it. I don't wanna see you again..."<br><br>"I'm sorry.... I don't deserves to be forgiven... Please take care of yourself..."<br><br>My heart sank. Looked at you... What have I done to you...?<br><br>You gently touched my face... And wiped my tears off... "Please don't do it again ok?"<br><br>"I'm sorry...."<br><br>"I'm just feeling upset right now... I'll call you again when I'm feeling better...? Then we can meet up again...?" You smiled.<br><br>"Yes... I'm sorry..." I looked at you...</span><br><br>We parted that day....<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As soon as I'm home, I smsed you... Telling you where I would like to bring you on our next meet up... And how I really wish to make up to you... Telling you again not to agitate yourself and get your medical condition worse...<br><br>You didn't reply me. I knew you were probably still angry with me and did not want to reply me...<br><br>Don't worry... I'll wait....<br><br>3 years have passed since I last heard from you... No sms. No call... However you getting along now... I wish you are fine.... I'm truly sorry to have hurt you like that....<br><br>......<br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a previous work written by me which I kinda like... With much inspirations too...? So I think I'll put it down here...  &lt;<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A <span style="color: green;">patch of grass</span>~</span></strong><br><br>One of the most cosy and relaxing thing in my life... A patch of grass... The one which I can sink myself into... Laid back against it looking into the sky... Feel so relaxed and drowsy... May it be the day where I could listen to the birds sing and the wind's breeze... Cosy, I feel so much at ease and at home... Just like a child in a mother's arms... Mother nature, the mum of all... She'll talk to me in a language so silent... Yet too busy to listen to at all my other times... She'll smile at me with her warm gentle sunlight.. Makes me realise that there're still blood flowing inside of me and it's still warm... Her touch... Sensations up my skin.. Like she's caressing me within.... I don't feel alive anymore... Yet so very much alive... Just me and this moment... Mum and me... Does it matter if one day I would to die? At least I've seen her smile... And how wonderful life it is... Without the artifacts.....<br><br>The night would send chill down my mind... Like a mum stroking its child to sleep... She'll tell me stories I've long forgotten... She's so patient... Though she've said and told me before... She'll just repeat her stories and make me understand things... Not a moment too anxious... And insects would be listening to us... Joining in to the harmony... No matter how small you may be. She told her children. One day people might just notice you? Listen... Listen to the night... Listen to the voices... Everyone has something to share.. Their voices might be weak... But if only so beautiful their nature is.... I closed my eyes... I think... Some day I would wanna be just like you mum... So beautiful....</span></div>

I wonder when would I get to see you again...? Of all the words that I've said, I really didn't mean to.... Didn't mean to hurt you so badly... Yes... I was angry... We exchanged pains... And words... Words that can never be taken back... Your decision... My world... Yours... Different...?<br><br>Like 2 individuals standing so closely together &amp; yet separated by 2 different glass spheres... You looked at me... I tried to touch you... My fingers against the glass... What if we don't have these glass spheres around us...? Would we just fall...?<br><br>Night comes &amp; we were both very tired... Things are just very simple... Just thin glasses apart &amp; yet we're trapped within 2 empty spheres... Why do we have to stick to this corner of the sphere? Why do we have to stay so close together...? Yet... What we see, we just couldn't taste or feel... What we desire... We're just like 2 emotionless people, making gestures at each other... Couldn't hear a thing of what the other has to say... Perhaps we're in different spheres..? That's why? Things just couldn't be simplier than that....<br><br>I run my fingers on the glass... Watching you as you strip naked... But that's not what I really want... Don't you see...? Your beauty draws me near... But I only wanna run my fingers through your hair &amp; touch your face....</span></div>
