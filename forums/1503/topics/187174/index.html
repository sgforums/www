When she starts a lesson, she would not dive straight into the textbooks. Once , she played a Beatles' song, "Eleanor Rigby", and then we discussed the lyrics of the song, about a lonely old lady.

Altho i must say i hate Cordelia for being too weak <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>Ok, for me, the interest is always there for poetry, but studying literature in NUS kinda killed it for me. I hated, repeat, HATED cramming and speeding thru a hundred readings just to pass exams. It was pretty traumatic lah. Plus it didnt help that poetry is more academic, something you just get thru on your own, whether you understand it or not. Readings, readings , readings...guess you get the picture. I think my friends did a better job than lecturers in making poetry fun. There is one particular friend who writes beautiful poetry that can make you gasp and cry, full of sharp stark imagery. However, she was a bit suicidal..i guess it goes with the territory.<br>My earliest favourite poetry was when i was 13 and we had to read Chinua Achebe. You know the poem that starts with:<br><br>Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br>The falcon cannot hear the falconer<br>Things fall apart<br>The centre cannot hold<br>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world<br><br>or something like that lah. well, this is i guess the first moment i fell in love with poetry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
