Maybe he had earlier confessed?<br><br>All thanks to you, my life has become such a mess.<br><br>It was then, I asked myself.<br>How was it that I could hold back my tears?<br>How was it that I could conceal it all from my peers?<br>After all these years,<br>losing someone precious is still one of my many fears.<br><br>Come what may,<br>"I had loved you" is all IÂ’m left to say.<br>but after what I saw, I know that there's definitely no way.<br>absolutely no way I could make known how I've always felt.<br>how it was so true that your words made my heart melt.<br><br>But you're never going to know this.<br><br>I've always thought love is what makes people blind.<br>blind to the extent that they lose control, or even their mind.<br>but now I know,<br>cupid's arrows never did undermine my logical thinking.<br>I am solely to be blamed for my folly to continue assuming.<br><br>Assuming that things will work out for the better in the end.<br>Assuming that to you, I was more than just a friend.<br><br>You want to know something?<br>You had sparked my interest to write poems again.<br>I only did it for you, never for the sake of fame.<br>Just as you are the one who started it all,<br>you're also the one who'll end it all.<br><br>This last poem is for you.<br><br>You, and only you.<br><br>Yuhan<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey darkprince88,<br><br>I really like Day Dream! It looks promising! If you continue to improve on it, you may have a gem at hand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Well not to worry, it is okay to have different perceptions of poetry. ThatÂ’s why it so interesting.  Some write for fun, some want to be published, some just want to share with others or express their emotions in poetic way.  Different people write for different reasons.<br><br>The important thing is you need to have the correct attitude. Without the correct mindset, you wonÂ’t go much further.<br><br>By the way, take KittyÂ’s advice and read the Blurb of Wisdom.  It is not the bible of poetry writing but close enough. DonÂ’t rush, take your time, digest them, and reflect upon your own poems.  If you agree with them, great, if you donÂ’t it is also okay.  I donÂ’t agree with EVERYTHING they said, although 99.9% of them. HeeHee.<br><br>Read more poems especially contemporary poetry.  If you can, start with local poets. Frankly I think you are doing fine.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i liked the idea and emotions behind 'last poem'. it's unique, a new take to the whole love-poem thing.<br><br>it's a bit too long, and i think that some of the lines sound rather awkward ("Maybe he had earlier confessed? ", "I am solely to be blamed for my folly to continue assuming. " )<br><br>some of the phrases were excellent though ("My heart feels so empty without you filling the crowd. /Honestly, / I had seen it coming. / But upon knowing the truth, I just kept running. / Away and away and away... " ). i especially liked the ending; it fit wonderfully.<br><br>as for your other poems, 'whenever' seems rather long as well (or maybe i just dont have long attention span ^^). again, some of the prases can be improved on ("whenever you expel that particular scent," , "i am like 'oh my god!'. " ).<br><br>i like your ending for 'whenever' as well ("And, / if you ever love me, / when? " ). again, it fits.<br><br>'what if' was too short, but i think it has potential.<br><br>'daydream' doesn't flow too well, i think. you were describing a daydream, and then you were talking about 'her', and then about destiny. i'm not sure where the daydream fits in, or if it's really important in putting across any ideas.<br><br>in most of your poems, it sometimes feels like you're straining for rhyme. the words you use for the sake of rhyming don't fit too well, sometimes.<br><br>but overall, i like the idea and inspiration behind your poems. keep on writing!<br><br></div>
