            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...i got this story thru an e-mail...then i modified it a bit...tink it is a very sweet and innocent story...but sad also lor...<br>****************************************************************<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Stupid Little Girl</span></strong><br><br>Once upon a time, there was a stupid little girl. This girl fell in love for the first time with a boy, who just happened to be her best friend. The stupid little girl tried to hide her feelings from her friend, the little girl did not have many friends and she worried that if she let the boy know how she felt it would hurt their friendship. The little girl kept all of her feelings safely inside of her and did not tell a soul.<br><br>The little girl stood on the side lines, hoping to be noticed as the boy went out with scads of other girls. The boy never noticed her. Weeks past and nothing changed, she was still a stupid little girl. She grew very sad, and even though she still had a close friendship with the boy, she longed for more.<br><br>One night a ball was being held in the King's honor. The stupid little girl attended the ball even though she knew the boy would be there with his date, a very beautiful girl who is also known for her charming manner. On arrival at the ball, the little girl saw the boy with the pretty girl, her heart sank. Even though she knew they would be there together she had no clue how it would hurt her. The stupid girl tried to dance with the others at the ball, but she couldn't help looking over at the boy, who was holding the girl in his arms. Everyone was saying how they looked like the perfect couple. The girl danced gracefully with the boy, who looked into her eyes lovingly all the time. The stupid little girl had never felt so much pain until this very moment. She wished on all the stars in the sky, that she could be the one he was holding. Tears started to run down her pink cheeks and her heart slowly started to crumble.<br><br>The boy noticed the stupid girl crying and asked her why. Through her tears she managed to tell him how she felt about him. Realizing what she had done and being very embarrassed what she had told him she ran away from the ball. She vowed that she would never speak to the boy again.<br><br>The next day the girl felt bad about what she had said to the boy, after all he was her best friend. The stupid little girl sent the boy a telegram telling him that she still wished to be friends with him. They started being better friends and the little girl didn't feel so stupid anymore. She was very happy that things were working out, and she started to feel better.<br><br>The little girl had nearly forgotten about beautiful girl until one day when she was walking through the village streets. The little girl was on her way to the dress shop when she noticed the boy and the girl walking towards her. How can I compete with her?the stupid girl thought sadly to herself. She looks like an angel who just flew down from heaven. She wanted to hide, but instead the stupid little girl tried her best and held her head up high as she passed by the boy and his pretty girlfriend. When they were out of her sight, the stupid little girl wiped a lone tear from her cheek. She was hurting but she wasn't about to let anyone know.<br><br>That day after returning home from the dress shop, the stupid little girl promised herself that she would never allow any boy, even the prince to hurt her the way her friend had. She tried to block all of her feelings, but she couldn't. It was like being under a spell, she couldn't shake it. She couldn't break away from the horrid spell and she very much wanted to. She did not want to hurt anymore. She promised herself that she would be strong and will not let her emotions control her anymore.<br><br>The days went on, the stupid little girl and the boy remained friends. The little girl's heart crumbled a little more every time they were together, she was living in a fantasy world and could only see the bad things in life. The boy was very happy with the beautiful girl and he saw everything as being good. The boy never realized that the girl was hurting, or that her heart was broken. The stupid little girl's heart grew smaller and smaller, it broke into a million pieces and the little girl was no longer able to love or feel anything. She could see no good on life and that was her problem. The boy grew up and was very happy. Day by day the boy remembered less and less of the stupid little girl he once knew. He saw the good in life and left the bad behind him, he was a good man he married and raised a wonderful family. He lived happily ever after.<br><br>What happened to the stupid little girl? She tried to let go of the past but somehow she couldn't. When she passed away, they took hold of her belongings and as they opened her pouch, they saw that it still holds the only picture the stupid girl has taken with the boy when they were still young, many years ago.<br><br>The End<br></div>
