I will try to post jokes that everyone can enjoy in the future.<br><br><strong>On Classical Conditioning </strong><br><br>An MIT student spent an entire summer going to the Harvard football field every day wearing a black and white striped shirt, walking up and down the field for ten or fifteen minutes throwing birdseed all over the field, blowing a whistle and then walking off the field.<br><br>At the end of the summer, it came time for the first Harvard home football game, the referee walked onto the field and blew the whistle, and the game had to be delayed for a half hour to wait for the birds to get off of the field. The guy wrote his thesis on this and graduated.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>What did the sign on Pavlov's lab door say?<br><br><strong>Please knock. DON'T ring the bell.</strong><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Stress Managment: A Visualization </strong><br><br>Picture yourself near a stream.<br><br>Birds are singing in the crisp, cool mountain air.<br><br>Nothing can bother you here.<br><br>No one knows this secret place.<br><br>You are in total seclusion from that place called the world.<br><br>The soothing sound of a gentle waterfall fills the air with a cascade of serenity.<br>The water is clear.<br><br>You can easily make out the face of the person whose head you're holding under the water.<br><br>There now, feeling better?<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A psychiatrist was conducting a group therapy session with four young mothers and their small children. "You all have obsessions," he observed.<br><br>To the first mother he said, "You are obsessed with eating. You even named your daughter Candy."<br><br>He turned to the second mom. "Your obsession is money. Again, it manifests itself in your child's name, Penny."<br><br>He turned to the third mom. "Your obsession is alcohol and your child's name is Brandy."<br><br>At this point, the fourth mother got up, took her little boy by the hand and whispered, "Come on, Dick, let's go home."<br></div>

He says, "It seems I can't make any friends. Can you help me, you fat slob?"<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Two psychologists meet at their twentieth college reunion. One of them looks like he just graduated, while the other psychologist looks old, worried and withered.<br><br>The older looking one asks the other, "What's your secret?

            <div class='col-md body'>Joe has been seeing a psychoanalyst for four years for treatment of the fear that he had monsters under his bed. It had been years since he had gotten a good night's sleep. Furthermore, his progress was very poor, and he knew it. So, one day he stops seeing the psychoanalyst and decides to try something different.<br><br>A few weeks later, Joe's former psychoanalyst meets his old client in the supermarket, and is surprised to find him looking well-rested, energetic, and cheerful.<br><br>"Doc!" Joe says, "It's amazing! I'm cured!"<br><br>"That's great news!" the psychoanalyst says. "you seem to be doing much better. How?"<br><br>"I went to see another doctor," Joe says enthusiastically, "and he cured me in just ONE session!"<br><br>"One?!" the psychoanalyst asks incredulously.<br><br>"Yeah," continues Joe, "my new doctor is a behaviorist.";<br><br>"A behaviorist?"; the psychoanalyst asks. "How did he cure you in one session?"<br><br>"Oh, easy," says Joe. "He told me to cut the legs off of my bed."<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I am a set of curtains!<br>Pull yourself together, man!<br><br>Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I'm a bell.<br>Well, just go home and if the feeling persists, give me a ring.<br><br>Doctor, doctor, people tell me I'm a wheelbarrow.<br>Don't let people push you around.<br><br>Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I'm invisible.<br>Who said that?!<br><br>Doctor, doctor, nobody understands me.<br>What do you mean by that?<br><br>Doctor, doctor, People keep ignoring me!<br>Next!<br><br>Doctor, doctor, No one believes a word I say.<br>Tell me the truth now, what's your REAL problem?<br><br>Doctor, doctor, I feel like a pack of cards.<br>I'll deal with you later.<br><br>Doctor, doctor, people keep telling me I'm ugly!<br>Lay on the couch, face down.<br><br>Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I'm a spoon.<br>Sit there and don't stir.<br><br>Doctor, doctor, I'm manic-depressive.<br>Calm down.

He had only one major publication.<br><br>2. It was in Hebrew.<br><br>3. It had no references.<br><br>4. It wasn't published in a refereed journal.<br><br>5. Some even doubt he wrote it by himself.<br><br>6. It may be true that he created the world, but what has he done since then?<br><br>7. His cooperative efforts have been quite limited.<br><br>8. The scientific community has had a hard time replicating his results.<br><br>9. He never applied to the ethics board for permission to use human subjects.<br><br>10. When one experiment went awry he tried to cover it by drowning his subjects.<br><br>11. When subjects didn't behave as predicted, he deleted them from the sample.<br><br>12. He rarely came to class, just told students to read the book.<br><br>13. Some say he had his son teach the class.<br><br>14. He expelled his first two students for learning.<br><br>15. Although there were only 10 requirements, most of his students failed his tests.<br><br>16. His office hours were infrequent and usually held on a mountain top.<br><br>17. No record of working well with colleagues.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This guy lives near a mental hospital. Everyday on his way to the bus stop, he has to pass along the tall walls of the hospital.<br><br>One morning, on his way to work, he heard the psychos behind the wall chanting, "Seven! Seven! Seven!" The guy thought to himself, "Crazy nuts!"<br><br>Later that afternoon on the way home, he again passed the sanitarium. And again he heard the loonies counting, "Seven! Seven! Seven!" Now thoroughly intrigued, he went around the tall walls to look for somewhere he could peek in. He found a big boulder just beside the fence and he climbed it. And he stuck his head over the wall and looked down...<br><br>BAM!!<br><br>A loony waiting just behind the other side of the wall hit him with a big baseball bat. Down he went from the boulder and fell to the ground unconscious. And the nuts resumed their chanting, "Eight! Eight! Eight!"<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Two psychiatrists were walking down a hall.<br><br>One turned to the other and said, "Hello."<br><br>The other one thought, "I wonder what he meant by that."<br></div>

It is very common among losers."<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The psychology instructor had just finished a lecture on mental health and was giving an oral test.<br><br>Speaking specifically about manic depression, she asked, "How would you diagnose a patient who walks back and forth screaming at the top of his lungs one minute, then sits in a chair weeping uncontrollably the next?"<br><br>A young man in the rear raised his hand and answered, "A basketball coach?"<br></div>

Now tell me, you say that you have only seen your husband's face once during sex; that seems somewhat unusual. How did it occur that you saw his face that one time?"<br><br>"He was looking through the window at us."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A noted psychiatrist was a guest at a party. His hostess naturally broached the subject in which the doctor was most at ease.<br><br>"Would you mind telling me, Doctor", she asked, "how you detect whether or not an individual is mentally challenged who appears to be completely normal?"<br><br>"Nothing is easier," he replied. "You ask them a simple question which everyone should answer with no trouble. If they hesitate, that puts you on the track."<br><br>"What sort of question?"<br><br>"Well, you might ask them, 'Captain Cook made three trips around the world and died during one of them. Which one?'"<br><br>The woman thought a moment, then said with a nervous laugh, "You wouldn't happen to have another example, would you? I must confess I don't know much about history."<br><br></div>
