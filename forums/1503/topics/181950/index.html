            <div class='col-md body'>preya, welcome back!<br><br>Ok , i think this piece is about people in general, and you do not have a good impression of them. They are portray more as backstabbers and evil people.<br>I detected a dark and bleak tone in this piece, with use of strong words like razors, tripwires. There are some strong images here, but maybe the poem needs some reworking to smoothen it out.<br><br>The last stanza, from Little Red Riding Hood, is so appropriate. A wolf in human clothing, summing up your poem.<br><br>"deaf taxi drivers", heheh! came across some myself.<br><br>correct me if i'm wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for the critique. and dont worry, youre right. i guess it does seem a little rough; there's a lack of flow which i didnt notice before. thanks for pointing it out! i'll work on it</div>

I laugh when I read them).<br><br>So kudos there.<br><br>However, let's go alllll the way if you want to be taken seriously. You've achieved it with a promising subject matter -- but in terms of structure, language and tone there's still a lot to work on.<br><br>For instance,<br><br><blockquote>till you fall and<br>bleed<br>into a bowl where they collect this sort of stuff<br>and then they'll leave you like a<br>grownup's rag dollie<br><span style="font-style: italic;">somewhere in the mist of<br>lost time</span></blockquote>What exactly are you referring to when you wrote, <span style="font-style: italic;">"they collect this sort of stuff"</span>? <strong>Be precise</strong>.<br><br>Unlike prose, where you can get away with poorly articulated ideas, <strong>every single word</strong> in a poem has to have a point -- because there is already a very scant word allowance for a typical poem, so every word that the reader reads goes a long way in consolidating the image, in painting a purpose so vividly it stays with the reader for a longer while yet.<br><br>So don't kill your work with careless phrases like that. It's just shoddy writing.<br><br>Same goes with linebreaks. The rhythm of this poem highly unnatural, because it is interrupted by improbable breaks. For example, in the same stanza above, you wrote: "till you fall and/ bleed/ into a bowl..."<br><br>The caesura that was inserted after "fall and" would work much better if you structure it something the lines of<br><br><blockquote>"'till you fall<br>and bleed into a bowl"</blockquote>as then, you would have created a sense of gripping anticipation that mirrors the action of falling. Besides, the "all" sound of the word "fall" already suggests a sudden dip in tone and suggestion. Use that to your advantage.<br><br>Stringing the words "bleed into a bowl" together in the same verse will also enhance the alliteration, and help the poem to read better.<br><br>Here's a tip: <strong>read your poem aloud.</strong> A poem, in its basest sense, is meant to read aloud to an audience. So even if you're experimenting with cadences and sounds, always try to maintain a natural flow of oral language throughout.<br><br>Gosh I'm kinda longwinded. Minor stuff, but equally important: there are a number of copyediting issues in your poem as well. Try to proofread your poem in the future, before you post.<br><br>Sorry if my tone appears harsh. Can't help it, I write for a living so copyediting errors get my goat. <span style="font-style: italic;">Majorly.</span>[/b]</div>
