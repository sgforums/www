            <div class='col-md body'><strong>--** A Lost Valentine **--<br>~~{Prologue}~~</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Everybody knows Valentine Â’s Day falls on the 14th of February. Nobody ever needs to tell you it's a special day, even though the government doesn't recognize it as a holiday. Yet strange thing is, everybody seems to indulge into the very existence of this day.<br><br>For this very day gives the feeling of acceptance by the very special someone deep in our heart. Someone whom we openly pour our emotions, and showered with love. The joy of receiving a Valentine's Day card is unexplainable with excitement bursting through the veins. What if the card you received is lateÂ…<br>after 10 years.?</span><br><br><strong>Chapter 2<br><br>[ The Letter from the past ] </strong><br><br>Â“Good evening, this is the evening news from Singapore. Over to local headlines, 99 couples gathered at the registrar of marriage to embark on this very special day of love as they took their vowed witness by their family &amp; friendsÂ… Prices of roses is sky rocketing to an intriguing $25 per stalk......Â”<br><br>Â“Argh.. boring news and all these crazy people out there who don't have better things to do..Â”<br><br>Ken moaned as he begin his rounds of channel surfing.<br><br>Â“So what if today's Valentine's Day?, so what if I don't have anyone to accompany me go out? So what if I think guys going out on Valentine's Day is a sissy thing.Â”<br>Seems like the whole world is in love, maybe not. Not today, not in this tiny place where IÂ’m don't seems to belong in.<br><br>Thoughts wondered through the thin air as Ken laid the living room.<br>Â“Dad &amp; Mom are having their 3rd honeymoon, how enterprising. I ought to go out and have a breather tooÂ” Ken thought as he head into the showers.<br>It is a good day today, maybe the heavens didn't want to sink the hearts of truly, madly, deeply beloved couple who live today like it was the last day of their life.<br><br>As Ken walked past his letterbox, something tingled in his body to open up.<br><br>"No way, there's going to be a letter for me on this day" Ken sighed.<br>As Ken opened the letterbox, something yellowish caught his attention within the pile of advertisment &amp; brochure. Not only the letter caught his eyes, the stamps used was also made Ken most particular.<br><br>It was a 15 cent yellow flowered stamp.<br><br>"That's strange, thought the price for local mails is coming to 30cents already?"<br><br>Ken looked at the letter once more... the chop on the stamp was 1997 instead of 2007<br><br>A Letter dated 10 years ago? To me on a Valentine's Day?<br>Is it a joke or something? How can this be happening to me?<br><br>Ken re-examine the stamp once more. There were no mistakes, the stamp chop was indeed from year 1997. The mailman couldn't be wrong, even if they do, they won't have made such a huge mistake as such.<br><br>Adrenaline rushed through his body as Ken opened the letter.<br>Out of the envelope came a yellowish folded letter. He wondered where the letter had been all along these years as he slowly can carefully unfold the letter.<br><br>Ken have never seen the handwriting beforeÂ… but the neatly arranged paragraph and words spacing was one of the nicest he had ever saw in his life.<br><br>Only a computer would have such nice writing..<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Hi Ken.. or maybe I should call you Pig head with a pea brain,<br><br>You wonÂ’t have guessed that you will receive a ValentineÂ’s day letter will you?<br>Yeah right, not in this life that is.<br><br>YouÂ’ll never noticed about the girls around you.<br>Maybe you were gay and like guys more.<br>Maybe you think nobody will like you..<br>Maybe you think all the good girl out there have already been taken up?<br><br>Guess what? You are wrong all along!<br>IÂ’m a good girl,<br>not only consider myself pleasant looking but also having personalities.!<br><br>Most importantly, IÂ’m always around you, through good times &amp; bad.<br><br>I was there on your first day of school.<br>I was there when you failed your 1st mid-year exams.<br>I was there when you went to the chapel and cried.<br>I was there when you enjoyed the camping trip.<br>I was there when you got punished by the vice principal to apologize on stage.<br>I was there when you lost in your basketball &amp; table tennis.<br><br>I was thereÂ… always did.. always will..<br><br>Being a secret admirer is indeed torturing as I canÂ’t bear the looks of your happiness with other girls &amp; yet I canÂ’t stand seeing you all alone.<br><br>On this 14th Feb 1997 ValentineÂ’s Day, IÂ’ve pluck up all the courage that I never think I could to tell you this.<br><br>I like you, Ken, I really doÂ…<br>But I canÂ’t bear the sight of looking at you when telling you this.. therefore I choose this letter to be my confider, my representative.<br><br>If you accept me, please come to the school gate tonight at 9.00pm.<br>I will wait for youÂ….<br>Just like IÂ’ve always been<br><br>If I never see you, it will mean that you do not intend to accept me, therefore I will carry on my life without you.<br>Just like IÂ’ve always been.<br><br>Luv,<br><br>S(43)M,<br>12th Feb 1997 "</span><br><br>Who in the world is SM43 ? Why did she know so much about me?<br>It should be one of the girls back at school.. but how to find her now?<br><br>Ken just canÂ’t stop thinking about all the possible names that might be her..<br><br>Belinda? Pamela? Sharon? Karen? Shirley?<br><br>Wait.. whatÂ’s with the sign off name Â…. Â“S43MÂ”<br>It doesnÂ’t make sense to be a name..<br><br>Â‘SÂ’ is the christen name with Â‘MÂ’ as surname?<br>If thatÂ’s the caseÂ…. Who in the world will that person be???<br><br>Samantha Ma? Sally Mok?<br>OhÂ… wait, maybe she was a mixed?<br>Sophie Maniz Lee<br><br>WhatÂ’s with the Â“43Â” ? Â… is that some kind of class register or something..<br><br>With all the possible indications that Ken have, there was no way that he could ever find the mail sender, even if he didÂ… he wonÂ’t know what to tell herÂ…<br><br>Tell her that the mail was only delivered today? 14th Feb 2007Â… 10 years after it was sent out? How illogical can this be and how many people will actually believe him?<br><br>Â“hey Janice, its me Ken! How's life been good for you?Â”<br><br>Ken seek for help as he called one of his ex-classmate, Janice.<br>Janice was like a Â“brotherÂ” to him as she was less feminine than the rest of the girls and it was all along rumored that she was a lesbian. ...<br><br><strong>[ To be cont.. ]</strong></div>

Which Ken?Â”<br>Â“eh.. the one whom you regard as a brother during secondary school times?Â”<br>Â“Oh.. Ken Kuan... from sec 4H..Â”<br>Â“yups! You are right... you didn't forget me yeah ?Â”<br>Â“No.. i didn't.. but I guess you've forgotten the time....Â”<br>Ken looked at his clock, its almost midnight already....<br>Â“hey.. i'm really sorry to bother you at this moment, cos i'm too excited at this moment...Â”<br>Â“about what? What does it got to do with me?Â” Janice seemed hostile.<br><br>Â“I guess its abit too vague to tell you everything over the phone at this moment and with you only half awake.. can we meet up tomorrow?Â”<br>Â“okie, please give me a call after work okie? Promise you'll pick me up..Â”<br>Â“okie, let's confirm the time tomorrow okie?Â”<br>Â“okie Ken.. goodnight...Â”<br>Â“just one more thing Janice...Â”<br>Â“yeah what now?!Â”<br>Â“Before the clock strikes twelve.. just wanna wish you a happy valentine's day....hope it isn't too late...Â”<br>Â“Its too late brother!... but happy valentine's day to you too...Â”<br><br>Ken put down the phone.. The clock had just struck twelve as the house was filled with the sounds of coo-coo. The time was 00:01 15th February 2007.<br>It had been a unbelievable valentine's day this year... maybe he will get lucky if he finds his sercert admirer, maybe next year's valentine's day, he will not be alone... anymore...<br><br>Everything seems to be going in his way during his work as Ken easily past through tons of documents and put his plans into place.<br>Sooner enough, knocking off never seems so early in his life.<br><br>Ken received a sms, it was from Janice...<br>Â“Hey bro, when are you picking me up?<br>My workplace is at Suntec by the way .Â”<br>Â“06.30pm if you're okie...Â” Ken replied.<br>Â“okie, see you thereÂ”<br><br>Ken arrived just in time after fighting through the gates of gantries with a whole parade of cars at the waiting lobby. He didn't see Janice anywhere in sight as he alight to have a better view.<br>There was still no sight of Janice anywhere..<br><br>Ken got a little pissed and just about to call her when he heard a familiar voice behind him.<br>Â“Ken Kuan Kuan Kuan KuanÂ” each Â“KuanÂ” with a different tone in hanyu pinying.<br>Nobody in the world would have called him that... except Janice.<br>Ken almost dropped his phone when he turned back.<br><br>The nerdy specs is gone,<br>The short spikey hair have grown...<br>Jeans have traded for skirt...<br>Canvas for heels...<br><br>Five years isn't a long time to forget someone but to see the same person in a totally different style is almost unbelievable.<br>Â“Eh... Janice?Â”<br>Â“Abuthen or you were hoping for some chicks to pick you up?<br>Wait long long arh...!!Â”<br>Â“Goodness.. at least the character is still the same...Â”<br>Â“What were you saying??? I only talk this way infront of you okie? Nobody in my office will have a chance in their lifetime to see me behaving this wayÂ”<br>Â“Let's talk over dinner okie?Â”<br><br>Ken drove his car away with a smile. It looks as if he have rediscover an old friend... someone whom he can always count on... and what a blessing in disguise that she have become so different.<br><br><strong>Chapter 4<br>[ A part of Lost Memory ]</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It seems funny that some friends can lose contact over and over again without realizing how long. Maybe itÂ’s the daily routine that made us behave this way. When we were young, it was always Â“friendÂ” first. We could do anything any day for a friend. As we grow older, Â“friendsÂ” seem a distant word as we spend time for family, sometimes colleagues after work. Have you ever know someone all your life? Someone who studied in the same school throughout your education lifespan? If you doÂ…<br><br>[When was the last time the group of you sits down and enjoys a cup of coffee &amp; talk over the moon? ]</span><br><br>"So... how's life been going for you, Janice? I mean, look at you. A totally different person. What happen? You were abducted by Aliens or something?"<br><br>Ken bubbled with excitement.<br><br>"If that's your way of complimenting that IÂ’m pretty then I will accept it without any guilt!"<br>Janice replied while taking a sip of coffee.<br><br>"We've all changed, Ken.... you, me and everyone around us... its whether you realized it or not that five years have pastÂ…"<br><br>There was a moment of silence from Ken.<br><br>"Looks like we've never stayed in contact after that incidentÂ…so how are you these years Janice?"<br><br>Ken tried not to look into JaniceÂ’s eyes, maybe he was still guilty about the incident that happened 5 years ago when they were still in University together.<br><br>Â“Its ok Ken, although I wish I could literally kill you during those times when Daphne kept insisting that we had something together and calling me a Â‘slutÂ’.<br>Thinking back, guess I was a bit too childish to get angry over such comments also. Â”<br><br>Â“Â…. IÂ’m sorryÂ…Â”<br><br>Ken guessed that was the only words that were appropriate at the moment.<br><br>Â”Â…for ?Â”<br><br>Â”For what Daphne did, she shouldnÂ’t have raised her hand towards you..Â”<br><br>Â“Its ok Ken, like what IÂ’ve said, I was a bit childish to agitate her too. Looking back, it seems only like yesterday that we sat down and talked about thisÂ… Argh~~.. ItÂ’s been 5 years alreadyÂ… Â“<br><br>Janice stretched herself.<br><br>Â“What doesnÂ’t kill you will make you stronger right Ken? Anyway Daphne is going to be my Â‘Da SaoÂ’ soon so I guess I have to start respecting her.Â”<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t think you need to.. anyway Daph and I didnÂ’t last as long as you would expect, we broke up 3 years agoÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“What?~!?~?Â” Janice almost choked on her pasta.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s very enterprising.. then what are you meeting me for? I thought you would want to pass me your wedding invitation.??Â”<br><br>Â“OhÂ… yeah I almost forgot my real intention too. Are you still in contact with the girls back during Secondary school?Â”<br><br>Â“Anyone in particular?Â”<br><br>Â“Anyone with the Christian name that starts with Â‘SÂ’ and Surname with Â‘MÂ’? Or vice versa?Â”<br><br>Â“WahÂ… why you need that for?Â”<br><br>Â“Well, you wonÂ’t understand even if I would to tell you, you wonÂ’t believe even if I would to show you, you wonÂ’t accept if I would to explain to youÂ”<br><br>Â“OkÂ… ok.. stop confusing meÂ… Let me thinkÂ…ThereÂ’s Sally MokÂ… Samantha Ma, Melody Su, Mabel Soo and Sophie Maniz Lee. If you include her middle nameÂ… Â”<br><br>Ken went into deep thoughtsÂ…Â…<br><br>Â“Other than the 3 which I thought, thereÂ’s Melody SeeÂ… and Mabel SooÂ… wait a minute, whoÂ’s Mabel Soo???Â”<br><br>Â“Hey Janice, whoÂ’s Mabel Soo??? Why I donÂ’t any impression of her?Â”<br><br>Â“What you mean you donÂ’t know her? SheÂ’s my best buddy ok? And come to think of it, you almost ruined her life during our school days!!Â”<br><br>Janice burst out laughing.. ignoring the attention that she got from the whole restaurant.<br><br>Â“Of course you donÂ’t know Mabel Soo.. but guess you wonÂ’t forget her chinese nameÂ…Â”<br>Â“Please stop irritating me Janice and tell me who is sheÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“Her chinese name is Liao Liao. And you always called her Â“Su Liao LiaoÂ” Â– Â“Lose EverythingÂ” in translationÂ…remember now?Â”<br><br>A bolt of static could have struck KenÂ’s brain as he felt some numbness in himÂ…<br><br>Could it be her?

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chapter 5<br>[ A Lost Name ]</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Everyone have nicknames, as much as we want to deny it, we all have.<br>Some are nice, some are not.<br>Some are meant to be forgotten, some are meant to be remembered.<br>A nickname makes a person easier to be remembered because of the affections that we all put in when calling him or her.<br><br>A nickname can be anything that associates with him/her.<br><br>Whether is it a phase, an object, a cartoon character or simply some unbelievable names that only you can think of.<br><br>[ Do you still remember your own nickname &amp; when was the last time you were called that way? ]</span><br><br>Â“ Hey SooÂ… why did your mother called you Â‘Liao LiaoÂ’? Is her dialect hokkien?Â”<br><br>Â“ I donÂ’t know Ken, I donÂ’t suppose so. IÂ’m donÂ’t understand hokkien myself.<br>Why did you asked?<br><br>Â“ Because I wonÂ’t be calling my daughter that name in future! DonÂ’t you know Su Liao Liao means Â‘Lose everythingÂ’ in hokkien?Â”<br><br>Ken giggled and trying very hard to control his laughter during class.<br><br>Â“ Its not funny, Ken.. you better apologize to Liao Liao!Â”<br>Janice kicked his chair from the back almost making him fell.<br><br>Liao Liao wasnÂ’t angry at all, instead she replied.<br><br>Â“ Whether what my name represents or signifies is not important. Most importantly this name is mine and mine to own and its name by my grandmother whom I will always remember.Â”<br><br>Liao Liao said as she smiled at Ken.<br>It was one of the sweetest smile he had ever saw in his life. The warmness can be felt through the heart.<br><br>Â“Ok, then I will call you Su Liao Liao from now onwards! You better donÂ’t start losing things ok? Â” Ken replied with a winked.<br><br>And so it goes, every time Ken had an opportunity to tease her he will gladly make his meal out of her. Whether its in the sports meet, during exams, doing projects.<br>Soo will always smile backÂ… until one day..<br><br>Â“Hey Soo, are you joining us at DerrickÂ’s place? I think we might be playing some poker.. wah.. bring you there I sure win.. because you will surely lose everythingÂ… So Liao Liao.. hahahaÂ”<br><br>Soo stopped her walked, turned the opposite direction and walk away.<br><br>Janice sensed something wrong with her.. and ran after her while throwing her bag to Ken.<br><br>Â“Ken , You stupid Jerk ! You go to DerrickÂ’s place yourself.. and take my bag with youÂ”<br><br>For the first time, Ken felt some sense of guilt in him after teasing her so long.<br><br>Â“She was always fine with it right? What make her react this way today?Â”<br><br>From that day onwards, Liao Liao didnÂ’t talked to Ken anymore.. everytime he wanted to apologize but she would turned away until the day when they graduated. LiaoLiao went to UK for her studies.. and Ken never saw her again..<br><br>Â“KenÂ… KenÂ…!! Snap!! Snap!!Â” Janice brought herself to his ears..<br>Â“Ken Kuan!! Why are you in a daze!!!!!Â”<br><br>Â“OhhhÂ… sorry.. I was thinking about somethingÂ” Ken recovered from his thoughts.<br><br>Â“Janice, can I asked you a question?Â”<br><br>Â“Shoot!Â”<br><br>Â“Why did LiaoLiao avoid me from that day on? WeÂ’ve never talked since.. Did I really hurt her so much?Â”<br><br>Â“Argh.. you this pig head!Â” Janice screwed her fingers on his head.<br><br>Â“Who would want to talk to someone who tease her almost everyday in school? You think its really funny? You may think so but have you ever spare a thought for the opposite?Â”<br><br>Â“Well.. she took it fine for the first.. so I guess she was alright with it mahÂ…Â” Ken expressing his guilt again.<br><br>Â“I always wanted to apologize to her.. but she wonÂ’t let me have the chance..Â”<br><br>Â“ Well.. since its been so long, I might as well tell you. Remember she ever told you how she got her name right? Well her grandmother died the day before we went to DerrickÂ’s place. She didnÂ’t have a chance to say goodbye to her as she was in Malaysia.Â”<br><br>Â“When she heard you teasing her, her thoughts for her grandma rushed her emotions. She cried for a long time that day.. I was there comforting her all along. You know, IÂ’ve never seem anyone cried so hard in my lifeÂ… She must have loved her grandma very very muchÂ”<br><br>Â“Then why she wonÂ’t talk to me?Â”<br><br>Â“Because everytime she sees you, she will think of her grandmother. She avoided you because she donÂ’t want anyone to see her cry in school.Â”<br><br>Â“Ken, thereÂ’s one more thing I want to tell youÂ…all alongÂ…Â….Â”<br><br>Â“WhatÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“ Mabel had a crush on you before.. she told me during one of the girls night out at my place. She said you are always cheerful and full of crazy ideas to make fun of others. I believe she liked you since the day you start talking with her. Â”<br><br>Â“ Â…Â…Â…. Really?Â”<br><br>Â“ I donÂ’t know when she liked you.. but you know, girls have sixth senses mah. From the way she react to you.. I would believe so.. Oh.. comeon.. who in the world can stand you and your stupidity!!!Â”<br><br>Â“Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…. I donÂ’t knowÂ…Â…Â….how is she now?Â”<br><br>Â“ Oh SheÂ’s doing very well now, a personal banker..Â”<br>Janice grabbed her final bite.<br><br>Â“ Hey its getting late.. Ken.. I need my beauty sleepÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“ Ok JaniceÂ… by the way, are you free this Sunday?Â”<br><br>Â“Think so, whatÂ’s up?Â”<br><br>Â“I want to bring you to a place.. somewhere I didnÂ’t go for a long long timeÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“Ok.. but you gotta pick me up again ok?Â”<br><br>Â“Done dealÂ…Â”<br><br>After Ken sent Janice back home, he sat alone in his car and let his thoughts ran wild.<br><br>Turning the radio on, it was playing an old song.. It was Heaven Knows by Rick Price..<br><br>Â“Mabel always liked that songÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“She liked me all along and I didnÂ’t realized it?Â….<br>&amp; She chose to confide in that letter?<br>&amp; She ignored me because I didnÂ’t go to the school gates?Â”<br><br>Â“How can this beÂ….?Â”<br><br><strong>[ To be cont ]</strong></div>

A place lost over time, and is lost within your memories space.<br><br>It could be somewhere you used to go everyday. It could be the route to school.<br><br>The route to school for some is a short journey but for others is quite a walking distance as they do not have the same luxury of having people fetching them.<br><br>Do you still walk back the route to school?<br>Are the shops still the same?<br>Are there people whom you will see everyday still there?<br>Take a walk down the memory lane of yours when you walked the same route once more. What has changed? What has remained?<br><br>Maybe nothing had changed, but yourself.</span><br><br>Â“*YawnÂ…* YesÂ….HellÂ…oÂ…Â”<br>Janice picked herself up from the irritating ring tone from her mobile.<br><br>Â“You still at home?~?~!?~?! Â”<br>An unbelievable voice of astonishment exclaimed over the speaker.<br><br>Â“Yeah.. Wassup? ItÂ’s a Sunday you know.. if not at home then go to work..?Â… Â”<br><br>Â“Hey Ms Ja Â“ not soÂ” NiceÂ… We are supposed to go out todayÂ…. DidnÂ’t you recall our appointment??Â”<br><br>Â“Ken.. is that you? KEN!!! OhÂ… shesssshÂ… Sorry Sorry.. I guess I was totally knocked out clubbing yesterday. Where are you??Â”<br><br>Â“IÂ’m down stairs.. Â… since 9am..and you got about thirty-seventh time missed callÂ”<br><br>Janice looked at her clock.. it was 10am already.<br><br>Â“Arghh Sorry.. Hey why donÂ’t you come up to my place first? Its at 9th floor #09-464Â” Janice suggested.<br><br>Â“I need to dress up mah, you know girls.. it will always take a long time for them to dress upÂ”<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t worry, I will definitely come up and please donÂ’t spend too much effort in your dress up. It wonÂ’t make a difference!Â”<br><br>Â“Shit you jerk!Â”<br>Â“Hey KenÂ… sorry lahÂ… donÂ’t be angry ok?Â”<br>Janice trying her very best to be nice for once while opening the door.<br><br>Â“You go ahead and dress up, IÂ’ll make myself at homeÂ…Â”<br>Ken said as he plunged onto the sofa like his own.<br><br>Something caught KenÂ’s attention among the shelves. There were arrays of photos of Janice being neatly arranged on display. There were photos of Janice in almost every year in her life.<br><br>As Ken browsed through the photos, he saw a familiar face among the photos. It was Mabel &amp; Janice and the photo was taken right outside the school gate with a<br><br>Â“To my dearest, Happy ValentineÂ’s Day !Â” scribbling of words on the photo.<br><br>The dated displayed below the photo was 14th Feb 1997.<br><br>As Ken continued to browse through the photos , there was another photo of both of them. It was taken not long ago.<br><br>Mabel too had changed, looking more feminine than before. Her smile is still the same and can really melt your heart.<br><br>Â“Boo!Â” Janice sneaked behind Ken nearly made he screamed.<br><br>Â“What are you looking at? Pretty me?Â”<br><br>Â“Nope, I was wondering when did the Aliens abducted you and transform you. Guess they did it not long agoÂ”<br><br>Â“LetÂ’s go out.. IÂ’m hungry liao..and you havenÂ’t tell me where we goingÂ” Janice pleaded.<br><br>Â“Ok, letÂ’s go, letÂ’s goÂ”<br><br>Ken drove through the Tampines town and finally he parked along the roadside.<br><br>Â“Get down, Janice.. LetÂ’s walk..Â” Ken said as he undo his safety belt.<br><br>Â“Huh? Where are we going? Why have to walkÂ…Â” Janice complained as always.<br><br>After alighting from the car, they walk through some housing estate and found a coffeeshop.<br><br>Â“Hey itÂ’s the coffeeshop we used to go for breakfast !!Â” Janice excitedly expressed.<br><br>Â“Now I know where we are going.. you want to go back to our old school?Â”<br><br>Â“Yeah, itÂ’s been so long you knowÂ…since I last walk this route to schoolÂ”<br><br>Â“Me too Ken, but at least I still comes back every year..Â”<br><br>Â“Why you come back for?Â”<br><br>Â“Why must you ask everything?Â” Janice getting annoyed.<br><br>After breakfast, they walked the same route which both of them took during their secondary school days. They walked past a few shops, some selling magazines, and a hair salon that Janice did perm her hair once and made herself the laughing stock of the school for almost a month.<br><br>Ken realized that not many things have changed, even after 10years..<br><br>As they reach the school gate entrance, Ken suddenly realized that the school was no longer functioning.<br><br>Â“Did our school closed down?Â” Ken turned to Janice..<br><br>Â“You mean you didnÂ’t know? Where were you? In Mars?Â”<br><br>Ken stood at the gate for a moment, staring aimlessly at the locked gate.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s been a long time, LetÂ’s go inÂ…Â”<br><br><strong>[To be Cont]</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chapter 7<br>[ The Class of 1997 ]</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Have you ever asked yourself whether you like to go to school?<br>Maybe to most people, School is something that you never look forward but always looked back to.<br><br>Secondary school is definitely one of the best times that can happen to anyone.<br><br>It was the age of discovery, the age when boy girl relationship begins to etch and form. Secondary school was a place for the transition of adulthood where many of you will have your first kiss or hug and most importantly staying out late.<br><br>It was a time when you donÂ’t really have to study as much as the remaining portion of your life.

IÂ’m wearing skirt ok?Â” Janice protested.<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t worry, thereÂ’s no one here on Sunday mornings, besides nobody is interested in looking at your white colored panty.Â”<br><br>Â“Ken!!! You pervert. Since when did you..Â” Janice wanted to kick him but Ken had already climbed up the gate.<br><br>Janice leaned against the side gate trying to figure out how to climb in. To her surprise, the side gate was not locked.<br><br>Â“Ha! Ha! Ha! You stupid foolÂ” Janice said as she entered the school and hurried to find Ken.<br><br>Â“This is the assembly area right? A place where everyone will gather and listen to the principalÂ’s daily motivation talk.Â”<br><br>Ken looked at the carpark.<br><br>Â“Yup! You were always sleeping in the morning thenÂ…Â”<br><br>Janice recalled.<br><br>Both of them walked into the school compound.<br><br>Everything was old &amp; distorted. The garden that once flourished with Sunflowers had gone. The classrooms, the canteen and the sports hall looked haunted enough.<br><br>Â“LetÂ’s go to our Class 4HÂ” Ken said as he begin climbing the stairs.<br><br>Â“Janice, so when did our school closed down?Â”<br><br>Â“About 4 years ago due to insufficient enrolment for the newer batch. There was even a big reunion &amp; class gathering, I called you remember?Â”<br><br>Â“Did you..? And what did I sayÂ”<br><br>Â“You said gatherings are meaningless and hung up on me!Â”<br><br>Â“Did I do that?Â”<br><br>Â”Yes you did! You always do that especially to meÂ”<br><br>When they opened up the classroom, it was filled with dusk but amazingly it was still quite neat.<br><br>Â“HmmÂ… so surprise that after the school close down, the classroom is still so tidy.Â”<br><br>Â“Its because we come back once every year to clean it. After the school closed, the next consecutive years a few of us volunteered to come back with Mrs Siu to help move out the furnitures and tidy up.Â”<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s why I tell you I come back every year!Â”<br><br>Â“Oh.. You have nothing better to do huh?Â”<br><br>Ken reverted as he walked slowly towards his own table.<br><br>Everyone would recognize the table he/she sits during class.<br>No thanks to all the vandalism that was created during their time.<br>Each drawing or phases craved on the table have their own meaning.<br><br>Ken noticed some tables that was not neatly arranged at the back. He walked up to have a closer look. He was browsing the different wordings that was craved.<br><br>Something caught his attention. A phrase that was written on one of the table.<br><br>Â“Do I really like him?, Will he like me? Will we be together?Â”<br>S(43)M<br><br>Â“S(43)M!!! S(43)M is really in my class?Â”<br><br>Ken tried to look for more clues and he found a tortoise like figure on the edge of the table.<br><br>Â“Make no mistake , this is MabelÂ’s table! So Mabel is S(43)MÂ… after allÂ”<br><br>Nobody would make out the tortoise except Ken as it was really badly drawn. The tortoise liked craving was did by Ken during one of the breaks to add to the misery of all teasing.<br><br>Â“All the clues is pointing to Mabel as the one, except her confirming it.. Unless I bring this up to her if not weÂ’ll never knowÂ”<br><br>Ken realized Janice was standing at the other corner of the classroom motionlessly.<br><br>Â“Ooi Janice, what you doing there?Â”<br><br>Â“Nothing much.. just pretty much looking at my table &amp; staring into blank spaceÂ”<br><br>Â“Want to go for lunch? Ken realized it was already 3pm.<br><br>Â“Oh.. IÂ’m beginning to feel hungry again! LetÂ’s goÂ”<br><br>As both of them left, the table that Janice stood too have some scribbling on it..<br><br>Â“Happy ValentineÂ’s Day to MyselfÂ”<br><br>S(43)M.1997<br><br>After lunch, as Ken drove Janice home, Janice remained silent all the way until her phone rang.<br><br>Â“HelloÂ…. Is it? Really??? YouÂ’re back finally!! I missed you so muchÂ”<br><br>Ken tried to hear the conversation but couldnÂ’t make out much.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m actually with Ken right now, when you wanna come out?Â”<br><br>Ken looked at Janice surprised that his name was mention.<br><br>Â“Hang.. onÂ”<br><br>Janice looked back at Ken.<br><br>Â“Its Mabel, sheÂ’s back from her US stint !!Â”<br><br>Â“MabelÂ’s back huhÂ…Â”<br><br>Ken thought to himself..<br><br>Â“Maybe things will be clearer this timeÂ…Â”<br><br><strong>[To be Cont]</strong></div>

I should be grateful that she once didÂ…Â”<br><br>Ken finally dialed the numbers.<br><br>The voice he heard remain as sweet as her smile.<br><br>Â“HelloÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“Hi.. is this Mabel?Â” Ken trying to subdued his nerves.<br><br>Â“Yes.. speaking.. you are?Â”<br>Â“Hey.. ermÂ… itÂ’s me..

From UK to US..Â”<br><br>Â“You want come out for coffee?Â”<br><br>Â“Now?Â” Mabel looked at her watch. It was about 9pm.<br><br>Â“If you donÂ’t mind.Â” Ken softened his voice.<br><br>Â“Ok, see you at East Coast McDonaldÂ’s? IÂ’ve been wanting to go there ever since I return.Â” Mabel replied.<br><br>As Ken drove towards East Coast, his heart sank as the destination gets nearer. Thoughts begin to wonder.<br><br>What am I going to say?<br>Should I tell her that IÂ’ve only received her letter today?<br>Do I really like her in the first place?<br><br>Mabel was already at the cafÃ©. She smiled when she saw Ken.<br>Everything could have changed but not the smile.<br>Not the smile that once caught the heart of Ken.<br><br>Ken sat down and they begin talking like old friends. It seems that 10 years is indeed too long for a catch up. Mabel have left for UK to study Banking and was found a job in UK followed by a stint of 5 years in US. On &amp; off she will fly back to Singapore for her gatherings.<br><br>And so they talked. It was like the old times, when Mabel would always listen to Ken talking.

YesÂ… but how did you know itÂ’s me?Â”<br><br>Before Mabel could react, Ken shot another question at her.<br><br>Â“Do you ever liked me before?Â” Ken finally asked.<br><br>Â“Â…Â…Â…Â…Â” Mabel stopped walking.<br><br>Â“IÂ….Â” Mabel tried very hard but words didnÂ’t seems to come straight out from her.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know Ken.. maybe I didÂ… its been 10 years already. Even if I did during that time, all may be forgotten now.Â”<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s ok Mabel, I know itÂ’s a bit silly to ask this question to you suddenly right nowÂ”<br><br>Â“Silly? So what if I do like you now? Will we be together now?Â”<br>Mabel turned to Ken with her eyes beginning to turn teary.<br><br>Ken was shot in the heart. He wasnÂ’t expecting this.<br><br>Â“Mabel, I know you liked me all along. But I canÂ’t tell whether is it Love between us.<br>I guess IÂ’ve always treat you more like a younger sisÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“Then maybe I shouldnÂ’t have come backÂ…Â” Mabel broke down.<br><br>It was the second time that Ken had made her cry.<br><br>To think getting your secret revealed by your best friend was painful enough.<br>To be rejected by someone whom youÂ’ve liked for the past 10 years was even a greater pain to bear.<br><br>Mabel hugged Ken and just let it all out within her..<br><br>She was glad she finally said it out. Even though it didnÂ’t meant anything to her now.<br><br>She just hugged Ken until her tears had dried up.<br><br>Â“Mabel, We are still good friends right?Â”<br>Â“YesÂ… weÂ’ll always be good friendsÂ… foreverÂ”<br><br>They just sat at the beach throughout the night as Mabel slept on the arms of Ken.<br><br>Dawn has broke.<br><br>Everything looks clearer in the mist of dawn as the sun rose.<br><br>Â”Everything is clearer nowÂ…Â”<br><br>Ken looked at Mabel.<br><br>Â“At least now I know who I really likedÂ…Â”<br><br><strong>Chapter 9<br><br>[ A Lost Chance ]</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Have you ever regret of saying or doing something that you shouldnÂ’t?<br>How did you felt when the guilt rushed among you?<br><br>Everyone would have done or said something that they shouldnÂ’t.

I donÂ’t know when will I see you again.. promise me you take care of yourself ok?Â”<br>Janice hugged Mabel again.<br><br>Â“Take care, MabelÂ” Ken said.<br><br>Â“You better take care of Janice when IÂ’m gone ok? If not I will take the earliest flight back to kick you!Â”<br>Mabel joked.<br><br>Soon after the goodbyes and sending off, Mabel had went onboard.<br><br>Â“Want to get a drink somewhere?Â” Ken suggested.<br><br>Â“Sure, why not? But its gonna be on you!Â”<br><br>Â“Janice, you damn cheapo! You are earning more than me you know, you should be giving me the treat!!Â”<br>Ken knocked her head.<br><br>They reached a cafÃ© near JaniceÂ’s place.<br>As they were whining about each otherÂ’s job and rotten bosses.<br><br>Ken broke the ice.<br><br>Â“Janice, why is it that IÂ’ve never hear you mention about dating other people?Â”<br><br>Janice blushed.<br><br>Â“Because IÂ’m a lesbian..Â”<br><br>Â“Lesbians also dates mah.. only they date females instead of males.<br>But IÂ’ve never hear you mention about your girlfriends beforeÂ”<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t talk about me lah, thereÂ’s nothing interesting in me.Â” Janice revoked.<br><br>Â“Why I never hear you talking about your dates too?Â”<br><br>Â“Because I never had any!Â”<br><br>Â“DidnÂ’t you &amp; Mabel got something?Â”<br><br>Â“NopeÂ… never, we are just good friendsÂ”<br><br>Â“Ken, or are you gay?Â” Janice burst out laughing.<br><br>Â“Nope, its because IÂ’m still waiting for the chance to tell that someone that I liked herÂ”<br><br>Â“Then when you going to tellÂ… ?Â”<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t knowÂ… maybe tonightÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“I like you JaniceÂ… Â“ Ken held JaniceÂ’s hand.<br><br>All her laughter and smile broke into pieces as this was one of the last thing she would be able to imagine.<br><br>Â“Ken.. stop it.. its not funnyÂ” Janice tried to loosen her hand.<br><br>Â“No IÂ’m seriousÂ… this time..Â” Ken looked into her eyes.<br><br>Â“Why me? Why not Mabel? She liked you all along..Â”<br><br>Â“Why you? Why not you? Why is it that it have to be somebody else? Why canÂ’t we be together?Â”<br><br>Â“Its impossible Ken, we cannot be together..Â”<br>Janice broke freeÂ… and dashed out of the cafÃ© heading home.<br><br>Ken was left all alone.<br><br>There was something tingling in his heart.<br>Somehow he can felt the pain that was piercing through.<br><br>Maybe the pain was as much as how Mabel felt that night.<br>The feeling of rejection.<br><br>The only chance that he had was gone.<br>Ken tried calling Janice but she would not pick up.<br><br>2 weeks have past, there was still no response from her even though Ken have constantly tried to contact Janice.<br><br>Ken had turn to the last resort as he gone up to her flat.<br><br>An old woman opened the door.<br><br>Â“Auntie, are you JaniceÂ’s mother?Â”<br><br>Â“Yes.. who are you?Â” The woman looked at Ken.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m Ken.. you remember? JaniceÂ’s classmate during secondary school. You always cooked dinner for us whenever we come over to studyÂ”<br><br>Â“Oh.. so you are KenÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“Yes.. Auntie.. is Janice around?Â”<br><br>Â“Nope.. sheÂ’s not aroundÂ” JaniceÂ’s mother spoke as she was closing the door to him.<br><br>Â“Then when will she return? ItÂ’s ok, please let her know I will wait downstairs for her.Â”<br><br>Â“Ken?Â” She reopened the door.<br><br>Â“You mean you didnÂ’t know? Janice never told you her Hotel is sending her to Australia for further studies and attachment. She had left 2 nights ago. Â”<br><br>There was the last words before the door was closed once more.<br><br>Â“All is lost..Â”<br><br>Ken thought as he walked slowly down to his car.<br><br>Â“When will I ever see her again?Â”<br><br>There were tears in his eyes as he think back about the times he had share with Janice.<br><br>Maybe Janice was the one after all.<br>She was the one whoÂ’ve accompanied him throughout all the good &amp; bad times in his life.<br><br>Â“SheÂ’s gone nowÂ… why do I have to wait until today to find out that she is the one that I really loved?Â”<br><br><strong><br>[To be Cont]</strong></div>
