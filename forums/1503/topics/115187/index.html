            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, I'm new here. Pretty pleasantly surprised to find this thread. For me, poetry is one great outlet for all my feelings and thoughts, and sure glad to see many of you share the same sentiment... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>One of mine...<br><br>My Advocates' Complains<br><br>Tell me something my man<br>what is it with you these days;<br>you have doubts more than the grains of sand,<br>more than the hellish scorching glints of ray,<br>more than the mortals on this rotting land 5<br>or the autumn leaves that withers away;<br>more than all the crows in my orchestra band,<br>more than the elves in the Enchanted Woods far, faraway...<br><br>Doubts? On what?<br>Have I not let you into my abyss-deep cellars, 10<br>or peer into my darkest chamber?<br>Have I not let you take the reins on my mind's pillars<br>and cast all the others asunder?<br>Have I not jolly well fool around with you in your parlor,<br>or ride with you on the highways of meander? 15<br>Doubts? I doubt so...<br><br>Well, you see not what everyone here observes;<br>Your train of thoughts've gone real askew,<br>very much getting on our nerves;<br>Really, your misdeeds are not few, 20<br>and such treatment is not what we deserve;<br>think of how we refresh you daily like morning dew,<br>how you have had divinely exciting times in our turf<br>where everyday's joyous thrills are new...<br><br>So I see what you mean my dear advocate; 25<br>it's not that I'm shunning you or anything of that nature.<br>Just that things have somewhat complicate,<br>or rather simplify this mystifying, abstract picture<br>which I have painstakingly perused for so long my mate...<br>for in it lies the exceedingly crucial juncture 30<br>where I can find the trident key to abate<br>the raging storms that my mind's agendas so perpetually feature...<br><br>Well then, however disappointed we may be,<br>keep in mind we're always there,<br>faithfully standing by in the deepest, coldest valley 35<br>ever ready with our concern and care;<br>with lanterns that never burns out easily<br>to light your path and expose the craftiest snare;<br>for whatever you desire, we aim to fulfill readily,<br>for whatever you want destroyed, there's nothing we won't dare... 40<br><br>Lots of love,<br>Your Faithful Advocate(s)<br><br>Notes on poem: <a href="http://sammy9958.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://sammy9958.blogspot.com</a></div>
