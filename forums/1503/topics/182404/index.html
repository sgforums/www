Many people said they do.<br>the  cleaver tied with red string is thrown on the floor after the deceased is supposed to have left, the louder the noise it made , the better to ward off evil<br>or any other ghosts that lingers.<br><br>"sucked on the marrow of melting wax" : nice way of expressing candles used in such ceremonies.<br><br>wondered if the ang moh understand such beliefs? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OT : This reminded me of the time when my granny passed away, and a few days later, I had a few vivid dreams where I saw her and my late granddad, they were sitting around the television, the sun was shining and she could walk around (was in a  wheelchair for the last part of her life). They looked like how I loved to remember them as, in their 70s, still with vigour.When I walked into the living room, both of them turned to me, and gave me a nodding smile and through the bright sunlight, I somehow knew that they found each other in the afterlife, and are in a better place.<br><br>Gawd.I miss them a lot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>OT Off.</div>
