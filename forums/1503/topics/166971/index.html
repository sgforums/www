            <div class='col-md body'>yes,<br><br>a story of a woman with high emotional side. Somehow it's like a mirror to everyone, in our life, we will be in the same situation and how do we react to the problems and how do we handle and solve them.<br><br>It's a real story and it's a pity that she end dis way. Maybe if she handle it differently, the results might totally be different. I guess how her talent are recognised, how her focus changed and how she lost herself......... She gave up playing the game of being alive.<br></div>

You can write about your childhood, your first love, your children, etc. Most poets do that.<br><br>If you are a poet, donÂ’t marry another poet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Plath, who committed suicide at age 31, typified the short lives of other notable poets like John Keats, who died of tuberculosis at 26, or Hart Crane, who ended his life at 33.<br><br>James C. Kaufman, Ph.D., of California State University at San Bernardino, writing in a recent issue of the journal Death Studies, combed through biographical reference works to find birth and death dates for 1,987 poets, playwrights, novelists and non-fiction writers from North America, China, Turkey and Eastern Europe. He then sorted the results by region, gender and literary specialty.<br><br>On average, non-fiction writers lived 67.9 years, novelists lived 66.0 years and playwrights 63.4 years. Poets averaged only 62.2 years. The rankings were similar for both male and female writers, although the women in each category outlived the men.<br><br>Â“Both male and female poets had the shortest life spans of all four types of writers, and poets had the shortest life spans in three of the four cultures,Â” Kaufman says. Only in Eastern Europe did poets squeak past playwrights by a few months, and that difference was not statistically significant.<br><br>What accounts for these variations in longevity? Kaufman advances several possible reasons. Poets may die younger because they are more likely to suffer from mental illness, especially depression, which is a risk factor for suicide.<br><br>Â“Poetry may appeal to people who are more likely to be self-destructive,Â” he says.<br><br>Â“I think Professor Kaufman is way off course,Â” says former U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins, who so far has lived five months longer than the average poet. Â“The assumed association of poets with mental disorders and depression is a romantic holdover.Â”<br><br>Collins has his own hypothesis. Â“If poets really do die sooner than other writers Â— and notice itÂ’s not that much sooner Â— they do so because of the nature of poetry,Â” says Collins, a professor at Lehman College, City University of New York, in an e-mail interview. Â“Because poems are briefer (to say the least) than novels, books of non-fiction and plays, the poet frequently is returned to zero. He faces the blank page on an almost daily basis. Thus the poet experiences more literary stress than writers in other genres. And we know the connection between stress and mortality.Â”<br><br>Â“The fact that a Sylvia Plath or Anne Sexton may die young doesnÂ’t necessarily mean an Introduction to Poetry class should carry a warning that poems may be hazardous to oneÂ’s health,Â” Kaufman says. The research, however, may stimulate poets and mental health professionals find ways to lessen the occasional negative impact of writing poetry, he says.<br><br>Other researchers have said that poets who ultimately commit suicide may leave clues in their writings.<br><br>In poems written throughout their careers, suicidal poets used significantly more first-person singular self-references (Â“I,Â” Â“me,Â” Â“myÂ”) and fewer first-person plural words than non-suicidal poets did, researchers Shannon W. Stirman and James W. Pennebaker wrote in 2001. They also tended to decrease their use of communication words (such as Â“talk,Â” Â“shareÂ” and Â“listenÂ”) over time, while non-suicidal poets displayed an opposing trend. For more information about the Stirman and Pennebaker study, see http://www.cfah.org/hbns/newsrelease/signs7-24-01.cfm.<br><br>Kaufman points out that poetry is lonely work. Non-fiction writers interact with sources or editors and playwrights deal with actors and directors, implying healthy contact with other human beings. Poets (at least in legend) scribble alone in unheated garrets, susceptible to both loneliness and infection.<br><br>Or perhaps the statistics mask the reality that poets produce more of their lifetime output when young, compared to other writers. Thus, they become notable enough to show up in reference books despite early deaths.<br><br>One poet, A. E. Housman, who died at 77, wrote immortally in Â“To an Athlete Dying YoungÂ” that there is some advantage to such a fate:<br><br>Â“ Smart lad, to slip betimes away<br>From fields where glory does not stay,<br>And early though the laurel grows<br>It withers quicker than the rose.Â”<br><br></div>
