            <div class='col-md body'>Hey good attempt here.<br><br>Opinion differs from person to person, so here is mine.<br><br>The first thing i noticed about your poetry is that, it is too direct. not that it is a bad thing but one good factor which makes others think about your poetry is the use if metaphors. If you can use metaphors instead of being so direct, it will create more imagery and make the target audience think more.<br><br>I dont get the issue you are trying to address here. It might be just me, i dont know.<br><br>One thing about me is that, i am a very technical person. I cant find any distinct style in your poem. Some people might want to follow older writings, like haiku, sonnet, ballet. Others might want to devise their own style from the older writings. This, again might be very subjective, as i am an arts student.<br><br>You are trying too hard to rhyme, till it doesnt sound really right. Try using assonance instead of trying to rhyme all the way, it might also make ur poem more interesting.<br><br>I am not sure if what i sense was rhythm. Try making your rhythm stronger, unless you have a specific target audience in mind, or some people might not catch your poem at all. It might just be because "Resentment"couldn't sense your rhythm, that is why he said its boring. I think due to this, it affects the meter of the poem as well.<br><br>Sorry but this is just my 2 cents, and pardon me for being too technical.</div>

But well, i am taught in school that, to write a good poetry, apart from the imagery, your own feelings, we would have to master the different techniques and styles.<br><br>The important reason is that, once an art piece is avaliable to the public, you cant expect everybody to read it the same way as you, which is why we need different techniques to ensure as much audiences read it the way u want them too.<br><br>If you have no techniques, how do you expect critics to critic it? Poetry is very different from other art forms, it depends alot on imagery and techniques.</div>

Criticism makes one better.<br><br>I once read from a poetry book, the best critics does not come from a critic himself, nor plain audience themselves. Its a combination of both. You would need people with at least the basic knowledge to ensure you can express yourself the way you want, and audiences, as they would be the ultimate readers once your poetry is out to the public.<br><br>Look Shakespeare, he took the conventional sonnet and changed the style, revolutionizing sonnets.<br><br>Arts is a combination of randomness (your own thoughts, the style you incorporate and much more) and fixed/planned things (such as the style which you hope to follow, then change and many other things).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Missqi makes a good point.
