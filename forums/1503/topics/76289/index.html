            <div class='col-md body'>A man sat by the coffin of his wife, in black and bitter care.  And as he sat, he saw passing beyond the coffin a troop of bright and lovely shapes, with clear eyes and faces full of rosy light.<br>Â‘Who are you, fair creatures?Â’ asked the man.<br><br>And they answered: Â‘<span style="color: red;">We are the words you might have spoken to her but you didnÂ’t.Â’  </span><br><br>Â‘Oh, stay with me!Â’ cried the man. Â‘My wife is dead and how I missed her, please stay for I am alone.Â’<br><br>But they answered: Â‘Nay; we cannot stay, for we have no being, but are only light that never shone.Â’ And they passed on and were gone.<br><br>And still the man sat by the coffin. And as he sat, he saw rising up between him and the coffin, a band of pale and terrible forms, with bloodless lips and hollow eyes of fire.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>The man shuddered. Â’What are you, dreadful shapes?Â’ he asked. And they answered: <span style="color: red;">Â‘We are the words she heard from you.Â’</span><br><br>Then the man cried aloud in anguish: Â‘Depart from me, and leave me with my dead! Better solitude than such companyÂ’<br><br>But they, sitting down in silence, fixed their eyes upon him, and they stayed with him forever.<br><br>Words can really hurt.  Do remember the next time you talk to your friends, family members, spouse, etc, please say something nice.<br><br>When they are no longer with you, it will be too late.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>
