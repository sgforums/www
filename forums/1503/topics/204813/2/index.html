I am most excited to see you here!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>You were great on that day, too bad you didnÂ’t read the whole story. I am actually looking forward to purchase the book from BooksActually. But according to Kenny, they still havenÂ’t gotten a reply from the publisher yet. I might have to get it at some other bookstores.<br><br>You know something, I was just telling expiringpoet about your group the other day. Although I will be most delighted to join your groupÂ’s meeting at the Earshot cafÃ©, but unfortunately not in the near future due to some personal commitments.<br><br>By the way you have a very interesting blog. Love your poem Â“Death of a Moon.Â” So will you be attending the coming reading at BooksActually?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The title of the book published by Penguin is "India Smiles". You can find the details at their website:<br><a href="http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/Books/BookDetail.asp?ID=6323" rel="nofollow">http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/Books/BookDetail.asp?ID=6323</a><br><br>It was actually based on a global online contest organised by a very popular Indian portal, called Sulekha in 2005. There were as many as five thousand entries from all over the world. The first shortlist of sixty was formed based on feedback from over a million readers around the world. The final list of twenty six that made it to the publication was chosen by a distinguished panel of judges. My story, "The Man Who Married a Tree" was one among the 26. Last week I received a copy of the book. It is not out in Singapore yet, but I believe it would soon, since Penguin has the World Rights.<br><br>You can find the list of selected entries at :<br><a href="http://www.sulekha.com/penguin/finallist.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sulekha.com/penguin/finallist.htm</a><br><br>And thanks to you too, Bluesky<br><br>Cheers and happy writing,<br><br>Hari</div>
