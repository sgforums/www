            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for posting this poem ShrodingersCat. It was a delightful piece to read.<br><br>Here are some of my comments, but you donÂ’t have to take it seriously.<br><br><strong>You gave me a flower today<br>plucked from the plant whose name<br>i can never remember<br>growing in the terra cotta pot<br>hanging by the kitchen window </strong><br><br>Good opening, but imo the last two lines are unnecessary.<br><br><strong>You stood next to me<br>flower in your hands<br>silly smile on your face<br>as you wait for me to notice you<br>- tousled hair haloed by the<br>light from the flourescent lamp<br>that was getting rusty<br>and we couldn't be bothered anyway </strong><br><br>Why Â“next to me?Â” Will it be better if it is Â“in front of me?Â” Do you think it would be better if you break this strophe into two? Just a suggestion. By the way, I really like L5 &amp; L6, good image.<br><br><strong>A split second passed by<br>when I wanted to tell you how much<br>I love your artless ways </strong><br><br>Imo, these three lines are unnecessary. Dropping them will heighten the impact of the poemÂ’s last three lines.<br><br><strong>You thrust the flower towards me<br>with your soapy fingers<br>and I took it gently,<br>fragile little thing it was,<br>warm rosy blush on a dying stalk<br>and kissed it, </strong><br><br>This might sound like a silly question but why Â“soapy fingers?Â”<br><br><strong>and knew, despite my thoughtless ways<br>you know how much I love you<br>anyway </strong><br><br>Nice ending.<br><br>Thanks for the read ShrodingersCat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
