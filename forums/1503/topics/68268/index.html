            <div class='col-md body'>You must feel with the poem, picture yourself as the poet whom wrote it, what is he/she trying to say, why did he/she said it, etc.<br><br>Actually <strong>to know the poem, you must know the poet. </strong><br><br>So if you are really interested to know more, you must read up his/her biography.  It sounds like a lot of hard works, but trust me it is worth it.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
