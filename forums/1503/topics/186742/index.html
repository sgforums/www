            <div class='col-md body'>The previous topic was closed, but I'd already composed a reply to Expiring Poet so I thought I'll create a new topic to faciliate this.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by expiringpoet:<br><strong>peebrain - i understand what you're saying on the form and structure...am inspired by ur words about how the structure and form elavates the written word. I'm also trying to understand how one can detract from the standard form and still be said to be following the structure. Example i have is the haiku, which is supposed to be 17 syllables (?) and in stanzas of 5,7,5, if i remember correctly. But i also noticed that writers take liberties with the form, so is it still considered a haiku?<br><br>Again, when i think about the form, i get super stressed! Anyway, tks for yr advise.<br><br></strong></blockquote><strong>Hmm how do I explain this?<br><br>Deviations to the form usually means [b]tweaking the standard requirements </strong>to enhance your message.<br><br>For instance, the sonnet. Typically, it has the most rigid structure --  abab, cdcd, efef, gg (that's Shakespearean, I think) in iambic meter -- and if you read Bacon and Shakespeare, the trend is to make each verse complete on its own.<br><br>Very seldom you see the use of enjambement (run-on lines) in sonnets. However, poets like Sophie Hannah use enjambement to great effect -- and still keeps very strictly to the rhyme scheme.<br><br>As for the haiku question -- are you sure the writers weren't writing senryu instead?<br><br>Because haiku is always 5,7,5 -- as it is a style originating from Japan, and the rhythm created from the 5,7,5 structure is the reason why haikus have a beautiful tone and cadence.<br><br>Unless of course, the extra syllable is meant to be omitted when read out aloud. Do you happen to have the example in question?</div>

Chu Chi is a place in the former South Vietnam famous for its tunnels dug by the guerrilla armies fighting against the Americans in the Vietnam War.

If I've written a few poems, does that make me a poet?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Well... this question is in the same vein of "I've a camera, I've taken photograhs, so I'm a photographer" as well as "I've written stuff, so that makes me a writer".<br><br>In my experience, writing poems does not a poet make. I've written essays and stories and articles for almost ten years, and it is only in recent years that I could honestly say I'm a writer, and I write for love and for survival.<br><br>When one claims to be a writer/photographer/poet, others will naturally assume that you have the necessary skill sets and toolkits to qualify as one. That includes a knowledge of forms, styles, print requirements, editing skills, critical review that is beyond pedestrian.<br><br>If you think you have the above, feel free to call yourself a poet. But before you do this, ask yourself the following:<br><br>1. Can my work withstand critical scrutiny? Is it worthy of analysis?<br><br>2. Have you made clear your emotions, your reactions in the piece? Is it clearly communicated to the target audience? A poet can be indifferent, but clarity of expression is key.<br><br>3. Why did I choose a particular word in the poem? Why have I chosen that voice? Where is its significance? Why are you moved to record to scene and structure the resulting work as such?<br><br>4. Does my work have depth? Does it offer room for interpretation, however vastly different from your own? Is there an exchange between the poet and reader?<br><br>5. Will I have the courage to revise, draft after draft, a written piece that doesn't work?<br><br>6. Most importantly -- do you love the sound of words tumbling from your tongue, the tinkling rhythms created as a result? Can you rip apart your feelings into base factors, reconstruct them into a unique reality that no other can emulate? Could you then use the sparest words to encapsulate the crux of your experience?<br><br>Wordsworth once said, "Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility." I'll go on to say that a poet derives his inspiration from the anguish and exuberance of <span style="font-style: italic;">living</span>, the examination of the human condition.<br><br>Writing is a skill driven by motivation, and refined by critical thought.  A poet's job is more excruciating by far, because he distill thoughts and emotions into an eloquent frame supported only by words so precise in their arrangement, that any substitute will be for the poorer.<br><br>I guess, at the end of this tedious exposition, my point is -- so long as you can justify your position and stance upon your poem is written, so long as others can glean visceral value from your words, your clarity and ambuguity in tandem, feel free to call yourself a poet.<br><br>Wait, you wouldn't have to. Others will certainly refer to you as one.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is from my blog. I hope it will answer your question.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I have not really given it any serious thoughts until recently. But frankly, how do you distinguish between poetry and prose? Take the following piece for example,<br><br><strong>When lives are at stake,<br>would you risk<br>not reporting it?<br>If you see anything<br>or anyone suspicious,<br>inform our staff<br>or call 999.<br>And donÂ’t leave<br>your belongings unattended.<br>We all have a part to play<br>in keeping Singapore<br>Safe.</strong><br><br>Do you consider it a poem? It is actually a copy of the notice put up at various MRT stations to remind commuters to stay alert. I chopped it up and arranged it to look like a poem. Okay, okay, this is not really a good example.<br><br>But what about this?<br><br><strong>And then comes Spring.<br>The sun is bright,<br>the water sparkles,<br>and the lobsters are active again,<br>swimming about, eating<br>like kings, and vying<br>for a place in your<br>Butter-browned top-sliced<br>frankfurter bun.</strong><br><br>Would you categorize it as poetry? Better than the previous one right? In fact it is a passage taken from one of the articles in <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“It mustÂ’ve been something I ateÂ”</span> by Jeffrey Steingarten. Again, IÂ’ve chopped it up and try to pass it off as a poem.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Basically, there are two things I look out for in a piece of writing before I decide whether it is a poetry or prose. Firstly is the existence of poetic devices such as meter, rhyme, imagery, metaphor, compression, etc. Secondly is its overall effect on me. I need to be delighted, to be surprised, and if you could stun me with it, the better; I will not hesitate to give you an A Plus.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>To quote Emily Dicknson,<br><br><strong>Â“If I read a book [and] it makes my whole body so cold no fire ever can warm me I know that is poetry. If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry. These are the only way[s] I know it. Is there any other way?Â”</strong><br><br>To illustrate the second point, two poems immediately come into my mind. Coincidentally both are very short poems. One is a haiku by Taniguchi Buson -<br><br><strong>The piercing chill I feel:<br>my dead wife's comb, in our bedroom,<br>under my heel . . .</strong><br><br>And the other poem is <strong>Accident</strong> by Gilbert Koh, a local poet I greatly respect.<br><br>He once told me,<br><br><strong>Â“A poem has to show me something that I wasn't aware of; or it has to show me something that I was aware of, but in a way I'd never thought of before. If I don't discover anything new in a poem, then it doesn't work for me. It's not a poem to me.Â”</strong><br><br>I have no problem with that. But what if instead of a poem, it is a prose that Â“show me something that I wasn't aware of; or it has to show me something that I was aware of, but in a way I'd never thought of before. If I don't discover anything new Â…Â” can I still consider it a poem? In fact many articles written by Mr Wang in his blog "Did Mister Wang Say So?" meet the above requirements, but they are definitely not poetry.<br><br>Maybe as suggested by Gilbert,<br><br><strong>Â“And if it is a good piece, does it really matter whether it is more correctly classified as prose or poetry?Â”</strong><br><br>Well sorry Gilbert, but it does matters to me because I am the stubborn type.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Although the boundary between poetry and prose remind obscure but there is still hope; as Joan Houlihan in her reply to Fred Moramarco said<br><br><strong>Â“While I agree that it is basically impossible to successfully and fully define a poem, I maintain that it is possible to define a non-poem Â– by its lack of poetic conventions.Â”</strong><br><br>In my opinion, if you write a prose using poetic devices, if you insist, you can call it a prose poem. On the other hand, if you write a poem in the manners as if you are writing a prose, it will remain a prose, nothing but a prose.<br></div>
