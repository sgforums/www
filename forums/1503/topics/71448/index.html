            <div class='col-md body'>You should have listened before you even dare,<br>Now look at the stir and the people who stare,<br>Don't start saying that your decisions are final<br>And that your own emotions is the only vital.<br><br>How could you say force when there isn't resistance<br>what they've said they've spoken needs no persistence<br>Cause deep within you is the fire to win<br>and that losing or failing is as good as sin.<br><br>In times to come, I hope it is now<br>You'll learn that no one will be happy, no one will bow<br>to such whims and fancies that it takes 'em by surprise<br>when they see your farce stripped by disguise.<br><br>Think again and think it through<br>There's so much solutions, ways that will do<br>Apart from this road, you've taken thus far<br>Take off that mask, that face smeared with tar.<br><br>Sometimes it's wise to look at what animals seem,<br>Of minute ants, so tireless working as a team<br>And when one man down, could the rest survive?<br>Will they just wither and cease to thrive.<br><br>So don't blame them for their anger, resentment or fear<br>They once depended on your talent, your creations, your tear.<br>The tears that will drip to the floor so bare<br>When you see them laugh without a care.<br><br>Yet, I understand your cause of emotion<br>It's so hard to work without much of a caution<br>And when things all come to a bout<br>I will find it hard if someone scream and shout.<br><br>His intention is precise, it's very clear<br>His desire to win, in his heart he holds dear<br>So when ideals clash and conflicts arise<br>He can't just stand and watch with angered eyes.<br><br>He chose to boss and push us humans around<br>It was then you knew that argument abound<br>So what did you do? Did you play the game?<br>Did you went along like a tiger, tame?<br><br>And as for you, I've mentioned much<br>With words I've adviced with elbows I've nudged<br>That someday you will feel the bout of your words<br>Then you'll know how it feels to be dirt.<br><br>No one likes to be pushed aside,<br>Ordered with harshness, demands with vice<br>And that's the one lesson you should learn<br>To always always look back and turn<br><br>I'm siding neither side in this<br>Cause I see the silver admist the riot of peace<br>It's hard I know, to compromise<br>It's easier to fight and say your goodbyes.<br><br>But now I'm telling this trio, so listen good,<br>Life is not without it's up and down mood<br>It's the variation that matters, the way it is seen<br>That determines your attitude from the places you've been<br><br>Take a sit on this ride of life<br>And stop treating this like a fatal dive<br>Where one solution stops and refuses to bother<br>Always remember that we all need one another<br><br>When it comes to playing this game of chance,<br>This shall not be your last dance<br>[/b]</div>
