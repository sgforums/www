An elaboration of this poem could easily be googled and found.<br><br>Simply put, this is a love poem -- of which the persona is probably someone who has nothing else to offer but his hopes and dreams.<br><br>The first stanza is clear enough -- he wishes for heaven's "embroidered cloths" to place at his beloved's feet. "Embroidered cloths" here means the stars and skies, and could be a metaphor for the best material trappings, but I personally prefer to think of it as being symbolic of the world, is "everything", the Alpha and the Omega, the be-all and end-all of things. All these he wishes he could offer to her, as an expression of his enduring, encompassing love, rich and full in his sincerity to please her and worship her.<br><br>It's as straightforward as the childish vows and promises we are too likely to commit in the throes of puppy love, eg "Oh I wish I can pluck the stars from the skies and adorn your hair." Sounds familiar?<br><br>The lines alluding to "night, light and the half-light" continues the celestial imagery established prior, and also signifies the person's seamless love for his sweetheart. The variation in colour, turning from dark to light to in-between, could also be representative of enduring love --  a love that is rich and textured and not at all superficial.<br><br>But alas, alack -- the persona is only human. He recognises that in spite of his intentions, he is unfortunately bound by limitations. He says, "I being poor, have only my dreams" -- and it is these dreams and hopes that he could offer his love. Like the heavens (just think "the sky's the limit") his dreams are infinite, and equally precious.<br><br>As such, he cautions his love to recognise the worth of what he's offered, and prays that she'd "tread softly"  -- i.e. not to take the relationship lightly, because he sure doesn't -- for she "treads upon my dreams".<br><br>Of couse, I could elaborate at length, but I've only 15 minutes to spare -- hopefully this gives you a better insight on Yeat's lovely stuff.</div>
