Absolutely not.<br><br>A reader comes to a poem for one reason: she wants to experience something herself, to feel something herself. She doesn't care what the writer has experienced or felt; she wants those things for herself. That's why successful poetry is reader-centered, not writer-centered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most established poets would tell you that a good poem should be reader-centered and if you ask me the same question a year ago you will get the same answer from me.  Please donÂ’t get me wrong I am not suggesting we should all start writing those I-know-what-I-am-talking-about-but-too-bad-if-you-donÂ’t-get-it poems.<br><br>Firstly as suggested by Bluesky_Liz in her reply and I quote,<br><br><strong>Â“If you have a specific audience in mind to address to, and the poem you write is understood by your target audience, then one would probably count that as a success.Â”</strong><br><br>Yes, your audiences. Who are your target audiences? Are they your friends, your teachers, your loved ones, members of a poetry-writing workshop, or maybe you are writing just for yourself?<br><br>The next question you need to consider is why do you want to write that particular poem in the first place? Is it because you are bored, or maybe you are angry with someone, or you want to submit it for a competition?<br><br>You know I really love cooking.<br><br>And personally I think cooking and poetry writing share many similarities. If I am cooking for myself of course I will cook something I like. Who cares what my friends like? I am not asking for their opinions so why should they care? On the other hand if I am cooking for other people I will have to take their tastes into consideration. For example if I am cooking for my dad, I would never use garlic in my cooking because I know he hates garlic.<br><br>Having said that, it is also important for me to create my own distinct taste. I want my friends/loved ones to be able to tell my dishes apart from the rest.  Something in the mushroom stew tells them I cooked it and nobody else.<br><br>So how do you create a dish with your signatures all over it and yet able to be appreciated by your target audiences? The trick here is to strike a balance - too much salts or spices and you spoiled the whole dish. You need to strike a balance in your writing too.<br><br>And just like cooking, before you start experimenting with different spices or herbs you need to get your basic right. You need to understand the nature of each ingredient and its effect on the dish as a whole. You also need to know the different methods of cooking.<br><br>Poets are creators Â– we create. To be able to create is a gift but to do it right you need to have the correct skills. Thus regardless if you are from the writer-centered camp or reader-centered camp, it is important for you to familiarize yourself with the various writing tools out there.<br><br>Most importantly you need to practice, and practice, and practice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>In a Nutshell:</strong><br><br>Before you start writing, ask yourself these questions,<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Who are your target audiences?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Why do you want to write this particular poem?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> How are you going to get your message across to your target audiences? (Remember, whether you like it or not poetry writing is a form of communication, even if you choose only to communicate with yourself.)<br><br>I hope I am not too long-winded.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you wanna get your poem published, it better be reader-centered. I mean, hopefully through your poems you wanna make a difference in someone else. You can't just write to express your own thoughts and expect people to read it too. We all write poetry but how many of us actually enjoy reading others' poetry? That's what I'm guilty of. I write poetry but I find it a torture reading other peoples' poetry cause it just doesn't connect with me enough. Maybe that's why poetry doesn't sell in Singapore=/</div>

I mean, hopefully through your poems you wanna make a difference in someone else. You can't just write to express your own thoughts and expect people to read it too. We all write poetry but how many of us actually enjoy reading others' poetry? That's what I'm guilty of. I write poetry but I find it a torture reading other peoples' poetry cause it just doesn't connect with me enough. Maybe that's why poetry doesn't sell in Singapore=/</div></blockquote>Well I respectfully disagree. Poetry is intensely personal, and the skill of the poet manifests through how thorougly he engages his readers, how he draws the readers into his personal whirlpool of introspection and help them derive empathy, understanding and knowledge through his words.<br><br>Gimme a list of "reader-centered" poets, will you? I think you'd be hardpressed to find a list of enduring poets who does just that.<br><br>In contrast, just look at Bishop, Shakespeare, Plath, Sexton -- these people write about their sphere of experience, they write about the human condition -- the rites of passage that each of us will go through, albeit on our own unique journeys.</div>
