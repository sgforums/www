A patch of grass... The one which I can sink myself into... Laid back against it looking into the sky... Feel so relaxed and drowsy... May it be the day where I could listen to the birds sing and the wind's breeze... Cosy, I feel so much at ease and at home... Just like a child in a mother's arms... Mother nature, the mum of all... She'll talk to me in a language so silent... Yet too busy to listen to at all my other times... She'll smile at me with her warm gentle sunlight.. Makes me realise that there're still blood flowing inside of me and it's still warm... Her touch... Sensations up my skin.. Like she's caressing me within.... I don't feel alive anymore... Yet so very much alive... Just me and this moment... Mum and me... Does it matter if one day I would to die? At least I've seen her smile... And how wonderful life it is... Without the artifacts.....<br><br>The night would send chill down my mind... Like a mum stroking its child to sleep... She'll tell me stories I've long forgotten... She's so patient... Though she've said and told me before... She'll just repeat her stories and make me understand things... Not a moment too anxious... And insects would be listening to us... Joining in to the harmony... No matter how small you may be. She told her children. One day people might just notice you? Listen... Listen to the night... Listen to the voices... Everyone has something to share.. Their voices might be weak... But if only so beautiful their nature is.... I closed my eyes... I think... Some day I would wanna be just like you mum... So beautiful....</span></div>
