            <div class='col-md body'>Arcum Leonard<br>The Child<br><br>There are many questions that were left unanswered all my life, some of which I could never have an answer to. I had came across men, rich, poor and the powerful. Many asked me the same question when they see old Cormack Pertia sitting in the tavern. They want to know about Cormack Pertia the mercenary, Cormack Pertia the legend, but few cared to ask about Cormack Pertia the scavenger, the man without his right arm. Yes, they had asked about the adventures leading to it. A frightful experience with one of the mightiest.<br><br>It was early spring that year when I came across the village. It was shabby but it housed many villagers. There were roughly three hundred folks living in the village and these folks were a little well off, due to the regular merchant and their production of a grey garment textile called Helk which was favoured by many adventurers to common leather.<br><br>They needed protection, and being a famous mercenary leader of the Pertia Red Wolves, I was given the assignment of protecting them from raiders. There were thirty four of us, so we were more a mercenary squad than a company. The fellows were hardened trackers, and we survived more than fifteen assignments and had scars more than cracks on a frontier fortress. They promised a hundred gold pieces if we managed to drive the raiders away, a bonus of fifty if we managed to prevent the raiders from coming in.<br><br>The village elder then mentioned about a child that we must promise to keep in our ranks. I was not keen on the idea, but the elder said that it did not matter if the child died in our ranks during the attack. I did not understand why they put a toddler to risk on the encampment where the raiders will attack, but I never question their decisions since there was no need to assign any man to protect him, the villagers would not mind if the kid died.<br><br>Old Harcum, may Carstina guide him in his afterlife, had a fondness for kids. He was always telling us about how the brats were full of mischief so he insisted on taking care of the child. I opposed the decision but the man would not listen so I told him to be more careful with himself, not to sacrifice himself to defend the child.<br><br>The child sat on boulder when Old Harcum was miserably trying to relate his heroics to the kid. More than often the child of merely ten years of age, seemed to know what, where and when to do certain things. He never asked a question and never spoke a word with Harcum and the rest. Everytime I looked at him, he would return with a gaze. It always seemed that he knew he was watched.<br><br>Old Harcum tried to pester the child for his name but he would not answer. The villagers, would shake their heads when Harcum asked them about the child. After one day, Old Harcum either grew tired of the kid or maybe it was mutual, the kid sat alone. The barricades were up and the men I came with were already lying around, waiting for the bandits.<br><br>The night, often long and dark, was always a mercenary's friend but that night was not. It was cold and the moon was full. An old superstition amongst warriors were that anyone whose reflection that was shone on a weapon on the full moon would soon be torn asunder and brought to the Goddess Carstina's judgement hall. Retribution would be paid in kind, and all overdue punishment were meted out in there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">continued from the previous</span><br><br>The gong sounded and everyone cursed. Mounted riders, wielding long tridents, charged at us. Nearly ten were fell with arrows dripping with poison. Raiders then swarmed in. There were many of them that they outnumbered us six to one. My sword swinged from left to right and right to left, cleaving many wounded and leaving more of these robbers dead.<br><br>I heard a scream. It was Darpesh, may Carstina show mercy on him. I turned and see him falling, a bolt stucked on the forehead from a crossbow. He took one more raider while he was falling. The enemy kept flooding in. Axes, maces, swords, pikes were after us. I thrust my sword down, breaking the spear, and stabbed one more in the neck with the broken spear.<br><br>There was another scream. A head was felled and Tillo, may Carstina forgive his crimes, was screaming madly. Tears streamed down his cheek as he went berserked, slashing three down before a pike was jabbed straight into his stomach. Like a madman in his rage, he rampaged through the enemy ranks and took down two more before more spears fell him.<br><br>I could not number how many I took with my sword, but I could remember that I was surrounded badly. A weird hissing sound caught my attention and I saw the grotesque face of Pertus, may Carstina take pity on him. The handsome warrior from Pertia Red Wolves had a deep wound from the left cheek to the jaw and blood was splurting out, the cut was so deep that you could see the gap. My heart sank and I wondered how many more of my men would be taken from me on this accursed night.<br><br>If you wondered if I had lost my right arm that night, I would be ashamed to tell you that I lived unharmed from that night. My men flanked from my left and right and battled with the cruel odds. We were circled and I cannot remember how the rest were put to rest. Old Harcum was missing and so was the child when I tried to rally my men.<br><br>We cursed and fought, we hacked and slashed. The hands of Carstina slowly creeped in and dragged the Pertia Red Wolves to where all of living belong. The stench of blood filled the encampment. The raiders died but more came. There were less than twenty of us in the battle and more were dying by the moment. I did not know who was beside me, but the axe cleaved him down and my right was open.<br><br>I rushed forward to the assailant and ran my sword into his chest. I turned and cleaved down another man. The path before was opened and I saw Old Harcum clutching to his stomach from a deep wound. I parried an attack and rushed to him, as the man whispered his final words.<br><br>"Take good care of him," he said, pointing to the boy standing next to him.<br><br>I said nothing but nodded, looking back at the boy, I shouted to him, "Follow me if you value your life!"<br><br>The child replied as if he was saying it beside me softly, "No, if you value your life, follow me."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">continued from the previous</span><br><br>The child walked forward silently into the middle of the battle as if he was invisible. His dark hair swaying by the wind and I saw he was wearing a tattered robe. That was the first time I really observed the Child and he was not returning my gaze. Maybe he knew then. I was still holding to my sword but I was not fighting. Then I saw something.<br><br>The child's hand was burning like a torch. The flame darted from his index finger as he pointed at our enemies. One by one, they were torched by the fire from the child's finger. Hell was loosened, the enemies cursed and charged at the child. Arrows flew but was burnt by the sparks around him. Those who went near were torched and their screams filled my skull with their voices.<br><br>The fire ceased but that was not the end. Weapons that were originally on the ground floated around him as he stretched both hands forward with palms down. The weapons flew and struck our enemies one by one as if it was being thrown. The weapons danced and attacked the bandits. Fear spreaded into the enemies' ranks and gripped theirs hearts. The bandits were escaping.<br><br>A powerful gale blew and tossed them back. The sounds of bone cracking was obvious when they fell against the ground after being thrown back by the gust of wind. Some were tossed up in the air as if they weighed like feathers. Still they ran, when more were drawn back by the powerful storm. Then the sandstorm came.<br><br>The sand was raining on the men and the men were being scratched by the sand as if they were rubbing their bodies against the ground. Their skin, scrapped by the sand and the wounds became bigger and wider. Then the blizzard came. Ice, like arrows pierced and tormented the men. Some died while most had their limbs and body injured by the frozen arrow. The child saw and closed his eyes.<br><br>Holding his hands up and the child summoned a big mist above him, forming a cloud. He clapped and lightning struck the escaping enemies. The thunder roared and the ground shook. All of us trembled as we tried to regain our footing. Everyone, including us, were on our limbs, falling to the powerful shaking of the earth.<br><br>Cracks appeared from the ground and roots branched out dragging and tearing them into pieces. Arms and legs were peeled from the torso by the roots like paper torn by a child. The cracks that appeared swallowed the corpses of the men and buried them deeply. And soon, everything was silent, and the remaining twelve of us were praying and crying. I did not cry, not because I was brave, but I was so terrified that tears evaded me.<br><br>I was trembling non-stop, my hands and body shaking and I was panting hard. I felt nauseous, and lied on the ground, shaking uncontrollably. The child looked at me, then looked into my eyes. It seemed like he was telling me that everything was fine. The pace of my heart beating slowed and I opened my eyes widely. My hands neatly by the side and I picked myself up, my sword, in its sheath.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">continued from the previous</span><br><br>The sun was always a beauty. What a pity when it had to leave so early after it had been there. I could still clearly remember the child's face. Innocence described his look and there was usually more behind the cover of a book. The magic of youth, the beautiful beam that shone the night like a burning sun, the beautiful sun. His eyes bore the flame of the sun, watching over the lands of Axila.<br><br>The child had this aura around him, his dominance could be felt even from a distance. The child walked on the earth like the world was beneath his feet, he moved like the world of Axila had revolved solely around him. The ground was trembling under his weight, and the air was concentrated around him. Arcum Leonard was the child's name. Arcum Leonard followed me after I dismissed Pertia Red Wolves. I hardly questioned him and he hardly answered my questions. His replies were short, smart and to the point.<br><br>"Who are you?" I asked him.<br><br>"Arcum Leonard."<br><br>"Why did the villagers abandon you?" I asked him. There was no answer.<br><br>"Where did you learn your magic from?" I asked him. There was no answer.<br><br>"Where are your parents?" I asked.<br><br>"Dead."<br><br>"How did they die?" I asked. There was no answer.<br><br>"Do you have any relatives?" I asked. There was no answer.<br><br>Few words were exchanged between us for days since the encounter. The child had kept things to himself. I was keen to have my questions answered but I could not find an opportunity to speak seriously to him. That little information I had about the child only made me wonder if it was his ability to use magic that made the villagers pay me, as if I was the scapegoat to take the jinx out of their village.<br><br>The stars resembled the eyes as they stared into the evildoings of people. As a person grew older, the stars started to disappear from their skies one by one, as he commited more and more sins. Night had already fallen when we reached Grandieur's Meet, a tavern in the city called Alaban, along a small street called Alaban's Tail.<br><br>Alaban was a city under the tyranny of Kalemartyr Ozolen, the sixth Ozolen king of the Pasilen Kingdom. It was situated north of Pasilen lands besides the edges of Stilwal mountain range. Pasilen was a big, respected country south in the Eastern lands and further south would be the lands of Frolan Kingdom, a slightly smaller country. I was brought up in Frolan but I was actually borned into Pasilen and thus, my affection for the cities in the mighty tyranny.<br><br>Grandieur's Meet was home to many wandering souls. Ale was the soulmate of many soldiers who grew weary of fighting. Blood had sometimes replaced ale for some who had been without ale for long durations. Those who had too much blood, could not find ale useful, was gradually made a killing machine. These people probably turned to hideous crimes when ales in taverns could not help them. It was only through dying when those pitiful souls could find solace and peace.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">continued from the previous</span><br><br>"Grace on the house! A regular!" the tavernkeeper shouted at my arrival. The stout, friendly, old pal had placed many mugs of ale on my table but I had yet to ask him his name. No drunkards would remember anything after drinking, no sober man would ask a guy's name in a tavern. The only common thing was to demand for more ale after the mugs were emptied. However, I did not come for ale that night.<br><br>"Is Ovalice in the house?" I questioned the tavernkeeper. Ovalice was the waitress that tended to my thirst. Actually she was more than a waitress, having a nickname of 'Calamity Eva'. Eva was the name she used when she was working in shady professions. Being quick on her daggers, she silenced enough men with it. She was also the bouncer, taking on the troublemakers in the tavern. Business had never been bad since the pretty Ovalice came around.<br><br>Ovalice was probably the prettiest woman in Axila. Her hair was black, beautiful, straight, jet black hair that danced in the wind. She had those beautiful eyelashes and her eye sparkled with life. Charming was the word for her eyes. The most wonderful poets will find it hard to describe a woman more beautiful than her. She had those eyes, emerald green eyes, which depicted the lands of Axila.<br><br>Her complexion was extremely soft and tender, had the uncanny texture of a baby's. Her lips were pinkish red, and made men want to kiss her. Those in the tavern had either tried, or were afraid to try. Those who did nearly got themselves killed by the daggers. Her eyes though green, were round, and her neatly chiselled chin was the envy of the women everywhere she went. She was simply gorgeous and was perhaps the most attractive beauty ever to step foot on Axila.<br><br>Beautiful Ovalice glared at me then took a glance on the child. "So you had a child conceived all along?" she said. Her eyes had fire, different from those of Arcum's. I wanted to talk back but as she turned around, she continued, "Or are you used to babysit for those wh0res? If you got nothing important, leave me alone. I hate people who bring kids to the house."<br><br>"You can work your fingers to the one on your thigh," Arcum jolted back fiercely. His snapping remark was an attention grabber, causing people to raise their eyebrows on our table, especially the regular ones who knew her. She turned back and looked at me accusingly. Arcum then placed a familiar dagger on the table.<br><br>"Remember this is the house, pimp," she was telling me.<br><br>"I didn't tell him anything about that," I defended myself.<br><br>"Then who, which filthy rumour monger, told him that?" she angrily asked, trying to hide the fact she had a dagger stashed inside her skirt all along. Then she leaned over my back and whispered into my ears, "See you around the back." She then picked up the dagger quickly under her plate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">continued from the previous</span><br><br>I never liked the black room. It was not called the black room for nothing. Dealings between shady groups, black murder, and almost anything that was shady was done there. Ovalice was standing near the table, her arms crossed and her dagger on her right hand.<br><br>"Why are you here?" Ovalice asked.<br><br>"Alice, firstly, I need you to help me contact Narendas Gilben," I said.<br><br>"And?"<br><br>"I was wondering if you could help me."<br><br>"With what? Bed warming? Go find Jena if you need a pretty lass to occupy the space on your bed."<br><br>"Listen, I was drunk that time," I answered.<br><br>"When were you sober?"<br><br>"I did not mean it."<br><br>"Get lost, Cormack. No, get the hell out of here, Mackey."<br><br>I moved near her and I could feel the cold steel of the dagger right beneath my chin. "Then pass for me the message."<br><br>"Done. Scram now, Mackey, I don't wanna see you back any sooner." And so we head back inside the tavern.<br><br>-----<br><br>Arcum Leonard was sitting with a stranger. The stranger was obviously a weird looking fellow in a white robe with the holes patched with jet black cloth. He wore an odd looking pink pointed hat with animals painted on it. He had a scabbard fitting for a two handed claymore and it was almost empty if not for the weird looking staff sticking out for more than two feet long. He wore only one glove on his right hand, a blue glove, with the ring finger torned and showing his sharp long nails. He was chatting incessantly while Arcum was quietly sipping water.<br><br>A big brute approached the stranger and laughed at his ridiculous fashion and called him a madman. The stranger suddenly rose, and bit the nose of the tall big brute. The big fellow fell back, holding his face in pain and screamed. He shouted and cursed, listed his arm and driving his fist down while the stranger tripped and dodged the attack.<br><br>Arcum Leonard was silent, unfazed by the commotion. The big brute chased the stranger within the tavern while the stranger crawled between table legs quickly and jumped over chairs. Ovalice, who was about to take her dagger to the brute and was stopped and cornered by two men with swords. The tavernkeeper, who was about to take his crossbow out was quickly disarmed of the crossbow by three men with daggers on his back, neck and stomach.<br><br>Two men with big swords stood at the door while a few crossbows were levelled at the jumping stranger and bolts were loaded. I slowly moved my hands to the sword and I felt someone was behind me. I was tapped on the back of my skull with a crossbow and I was quickly disarmed. Arcum was sitting while the big brute was chasing the stranger around Arcum's table.<br><br>The big brute had his hands high and caught air while the stranger crawled between his legs and ran. Suddenly, the bolt was unleashed and the staff was unsheathed, it was a swordstaff. The blade was copper red and had very fine edges. The bolt was sliced into two by a flicker of the eyes. The stranger was fast, no, he was very fast.<br><br>"Why did you do that?" the stranger asked.<br><br>"Mystic, leave us," Arcum said coldly.<br><br>Several bolts were fired but the stranger easily dodged them and sheathed his sword. He walked and the two men by the door attacked him. They missed the stranger, not because he was fast, but it was because their blades were shattered before hitting him. The stranger shoved them aside and disappeared.<br><br>A hunter moved close to Arcum and stared at him and shouted, "All you fools, go out and get him!" He took a chair and sat opposite Arcum while the rest chased the stranger's shadows. "Tell me, why did you know the madman?"<br><br>Arcum sipped silently from the cup and did not answer. The hunter looked at the child and then left the seat, heading out to meet his accomplices. The entire tavern was empty. The tavern keeper, Ovalice, Arcum and me were left.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">continued from the previous</span><br><br>"Yes, I've got a job but you're bringing a kid and a woman?" Narendas Gilben looked at me and shook his head, "No, you don't have an army, you don't come. We're fighting daemons not some small goblins and you bring a woman and a kid there?"<br><br>"The Pertia Red Wolves has been disbanded, and."<br><br>"And you're bringing women and kids to war! Are you out of your mind? Narendas Gilben cut me off, "The lady got a reputation but she can never fight a war with daggers. Which army brings kids and women to war? My rowdy bunch won't treat her nice and the kid's going to be thrown into the river next. I don't mind if you're tagging alone, brother, but we're fighting a war and you bring kids and women?"<br><br>"They can take care of themselves. Just consider three soldiers pay for the three of us to be in."<br><br>"You're worth five soldiers, my friend, but why are you bringing them along?"<br><br>"We're fighting daemons, so we need them."<br><br>"I don't care, but I won't give you guards for those two. And you gotta worry if the men get aroused."<br><br>"We'll see about it then."<br><br>The marsh was horrible. Once a reputed captain of a mercenary squad, I became a soldier on Narendas' side. Arcum had little difficult covering the distances while Ovalice was complaining about the murky waters. We had been travelling two days without sleep in search for a dry land to pitch our tents and the special mission was more a suicide mission. The main forces were dispatched to fight the front and only three mercenary squads were entering the battle in stealth through the marsh.<br><br>We waded through the water. Fallen logs, dead undergrowth and floating carcass were common as the armies could not bury the dead. The stench was worse than the sewers.<br><br>Narendas Gilben's men numbered to a big company of three hundred sixty and we were only three in the big company. Even though he was reluctant to let the child and the lady join, he had told his men that if anyone was found disturbing them, he would personally kill them.<br><br>The sky darkened and we finally reached the grassland on the third night. Narendas Gilben invited us to join his commander's tent as we did not bring much equipment. The night was chilling and we were soon falling asleep. A soft small hand patted me on my cheek, I stirred and saw Arcum.<br><br>"They know we are here," he said softly.<br><br>"Who?"<br><br>"The Baacs. Those daemons had already caught our scent when the wind blew westwards. They are coming, and there are five hundred of them."<br><br>"Five hundred!" I shouted and everyone in the commander tent was awakened.<br><br>"What's the problem?" Narendas Gilben asked.<br><br>"Arcum says five hundred daemons are heading our way."<br><br>"The boy is a psychic? I didn't hear the alarm," Narendas Gilben said.<br><br>"They moved in stealth. In another twenty minutes, the daemons will be here," Arcum said.<br><br>"Twenty! You sure kid?" Narendas was alarmed.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Sergeant! Gather the men to arms, sound the alarm, get in formation!" Narendas Gilben turned to Arcum, "If you're lying kid, I will stick your head on a pike."<br><br>The gong was sounded. The men gathered and were readied in ten minutes. In another five minutes, the scouts sounded the bell. Soon, there were screaming and shouting by the scouts about a horde of daemons coming the way. They were prepared at least and they formed the lines, ready to defend.<br><br>Arrows flew and many daemons were struck down before the men drew steel. Swords clashed and they fought bravely. A bolt of lightning struck a daemon from Arcum's hand. Narendas Gilben stared and looked at the child as if he was a savior, their talisman to victory. Daemons were an extremely fast and vicious race that fought ridiculously well. It was obvious that we're fighting on the losing side.<br><br>The hardened mercenaries were scattered easily under the might of the daemons, but the soldiers fought bravely and defended against the onslaught. I slashed and killed one of the daemons and soon another came and injured me on my left shoulder. Fiercely, I thrusted my sword and rapidly traded blows with the daemon.<br><br>A thunderous sound boomed in the back and I knew Arcum had taken another few daemons down. Another daemon circled behind me while I was fighting and clawed my back, cleaving fierce wounds on my back. Ovalice appeared and jabbed her dagger into the skull of the daemon behind me, killing it.<br><br>I turned and swung my sword, catching the daemon on its eyes and it moaned in pain. Holding my sword up, I decapitated the beast and ended its suffering. A familiar figure appeared again. The strange pink pointed hat weird man appeared, slashing and fighting the daemons easily. He was amazingly efficient with his swordstaff and fought like a daemon.<br><br>Fire rained down from the skies on the daemon as Arcum moved. The daemons had all lost their interest in us. They were charging at the weird man and the child. The child held one hand up and a strong gale tore the daemons into shreds. And then I saw the pink pointed hat flew away, revealing the long silvery hair and pointed ears.<br><br>The stranger must be an angel, a Wyxie, sent to defeat the daemons. Yet the stranger was weird as he fought like a master swordsman, not as a sorceror like all angels were known for. Then a very beautiful daemon appeared. He was holding a blade, a black, jet black blade with a red handle. The daemons all retreated and bowed before this daemon as he approached the swordsman.<br><br>Arcum sat down, as if it was not his concern and quick blows were exchanged between the two. The daemon's moves were quick, deadly, and accurate while the swordsman blows were weird, awkward and irregular. It was like a poet competiting with a madman. The swordsman was winning in a weird awkward style. A beautiful art was being challenged by random paints poured onto a sheet of white paper. The awful sword display was an alternative art, a display of a change within a change and uniqueness.<br><br>Then the stranger parried all the blows. The exchanges were rapid and strange. The weird man was toying with the daemon and many times, the stranger exposed the daemon's guard with his parries. Then with a strong parry, the black blade was parried away from the daemon's hand. Then the weird man stopped and picked up his hat.<br><br>The daemon picked up his blade and was silent. "Mystic, why did you not kill me?"<br><br>"There was no need to. You had already lost, Kuri Ragewind. Even if the demon prince, Layrayday is here, he can't defeat me either." Then he turned and pointed his sword at the child. "Now, your turn. Let me know why that weakling Carstina called you 'The Fated Child'. I would want to see how well you fare against me."<br><br>"Weakling?" I thought, "he called a Goddess weakling?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">continued from the previous</span><br><br>Arcum Leonard, Chapter 2<br>The Three Trials<br><br>"Mystic Mesmer," I thought to myself, "the Greater God of Randomness."<br><br>"You've already decided that I was no match for Kuri Ragewind," Arcum answered, "then what is the point of fighting me?"<br><br>Mystic nodded and smiled as if he was appreciating the words. "Human child, I'm starting to like you but the Greater Gods would not have another Layrayday to disturb the peace in the heavens. They have sought that anyone that could be identified as a threat will be eliminated. And you're one of those Carstina had identified as a threat. I will like to think differently, but looking at the great scale of damage you can unleash with your magical prowess, it makes me wonder if there is a place for you."<br><br>"You've already decided on that too," Arcum interrupted.<br><br>Mystic laughed loudly, "Never was I so fond of a human like I do now!" Then he stopped laughing, "Tell me child, if you're worthy of my vote of confidence in the Greater Realm."<br><br>"You've also decided on that," Arcum answered as if he was repeating himself again and again.<br><br>"Then you shall go through the three trials I had in mind to win my vote in the Greater Realm," Mystic said seriously then added, "The gods all say, it is I who govern Luck. All of these come from randomness, unpredictability, and opportunities. So tell me young one, what is Randomness?"<br><br>"Randomness is unpredictability due to insufficient rules that were in existence. Randomness is the inability to calculate all possibilities and control the eventual outcome. Randomness is the inability to deduce the eventual outcome, the inability to harness results due to environmental influence, the inability to predict an incoming result. Randomness is a flaw within all of living."<br><br>"Amazing, even those who worshipped the God of Luck won't be able to answer that as well as you do. You've done well for the first trial." Mystic turned and looked at me, "Human, you and your lady friend must follow the child." He disappeared after his last words were whispered into the wind.<br><br>-----<br><br>Narendas Gilben calculated the losses, eighty six men were dead, and another sixty two were dying. Thirty one were seriously wounded and the rest had suffered cuts and injuries. Narendas Gilben himself was not spared from the injuries either. He had lost two finger, the index and the middle finger while trying to defend himself from a killing blow.<br><br>Ovalice suffered a few wounds on her right arm, while I was slightly grazed on my back. Arcum Leonard suffered no injuries but for the first time I saw the boy was exhausted. He drank the water from the skin greedily as he looked at me.<br><br>I realized no one except Ovalice and I actually heard the conversation. I asked Narendas to pardon us for a slight leave with the small boy. Narendas was not willing to let us go, and in fact he offered twenty times what he offered earlier to keep the boy in company. I shook my head and told Narendas that money was no longer our concern. Then he offered to pay half of what we were promised but I refused politely.<br><br>The boy for the first time initiated a conversation with me. "Listen," Arcum said, "we need to infiltrate the enemy camp to break them. The human forces will not stand against the might of the daemons. We were fortunate enough to lose only a hundred and seventy men against the death of fifty seven daemons. We will not survive if not for the timely intervention of Mystic Mesmer."<br><br>"Why should both of us follow you?" Ovalice questioned though she knew the reason.<br><br>Ignoring her question, Arcum continued, "I am Arcum Leonard. I am of flesh and blood like you. The Baacs are also of flesh and blood, but their blood is different and their flesh is stronger. I don't need to explain that they are far superior in basic warfare than human. And both of you will only follow me and my orders. That will keep you alive, at least."<br><br>I nodded as I listened.</div>
