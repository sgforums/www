            <div class='col-md body'><strong>History of my muse and I<br><br>1.<br><br>I remember the cold air<br>on your face<br>as you looked out<br>and watched the raindrops<br>fall like gems on a velvet cloth.<br>I sat with you<br>but you cried. </strong><br><br>Sorry my friend but I donÂ’t really get Â“the cold air on your faceÂ” image. I think Â“looked out andÂ” is unnecessary, i.e.<br><br><strong>Â“on your face<br>as you watched the raindropsÂ”</strong><br><br>I like Â“gems on a velvet cloth.Â” Although it is a bit clichÃ© but I am comfortable with it. I donÂ’t understand the last two lines.  Why did she cry, because you sat with her?<br><br><strong>My fingers in your moist palm<br>entwined like fireflies.<br>You held on tight<br>but I felt no pain<br>and I was content<br>just being here. </strong><br><br>I really like this strophe, but fingers with fireflies? Hmm...<br><br><strong>The sky was grey<br>when we walked down<br>and bought us some ice-cream<br>but you smiled a little<br>and I was glad. </strong><br><br>I keep having this funny image of the sky buying ice-cream for the two of you whenever I read this. Maybe instead of Â“usÂ” change it to Â“ourselves?Â”<br><br><strong>We cradled the tub of vanilla,<br>you licked and I looked<br>and the setting sun<br>gleamed in your eyes<br>whom I worshipped.<br>But I still saw a<br>solitary<br>tear. </strong><br><br>Sorry my friend, I donÂ’t get this either. It sounds really Â… unnatural?<br><br><strong>Somehow I woke<br>with the phone in my hand<br>and your soft voice<br>in my ear.<br>I turned in a sea<br>of grey masques<br>and you had a plaid.<br>Cute. </strong><br><br>L5, should it be Â“into?Â”<br><br><strong>Many afternoons<br>I would stare at the clock<br>2 meters above me<br>as you silently pored<br>over the politics of<br>Siam and her Kings.<br>Then we would go<br>and get more<br>ice-cream. </strong><br><br>Interesting strophe.<br><br><strong>2.<br><br>Somehow, we never<br>got out of your clouds<br>till the day<br>you huddled against me<br>with the silent Boeings<br>as witnesses to you.<br>and I cradled you<br>in muted silence </strong><br><br>Consider dropping Â“to youÂ” and Â“muted.Â”<br><br><strong>We soared beyond<br>the muted sky<br>upon wings made of wax<br>and I fell like Icarus<br>why didn't you catch me<br>why did you let me slide?<br>My angel flew<br>and I slumped. </strong><br><br>Personally this is the weakest strophe in the poem.<br><br><strong>I heard the bad news<br>surrounded by fish;<br>and one bus stand<br>out there in the South<br>still bears my scar<br>of immovable faith and love.<br>And I saw the clouds<br>looming. </strong><br><br>Should it be Â“fishesÂ” and Â“bus-stand?Â”  How is this strophe related with the previous one? Where is the connection? What was the bad news?<br><br>But I do like<br><br><strong>Â“And I saw the clouds<br>looming.Â”</strong><br><br><strong>The thunderstorm's party<br>wrecked me clean<br>like a scouring brush<br>leaving me with<br>one-thirds of a coconut's<br>hairy husk<br>and no juice. </strong><br><br>Interesting image, but I just don't see how it contributes to the poem.<br><br><strong>I sallied forth to my crusade<br>but the walls of your heart<br>repulsed me a la Saladin<br>at Al Quds.<br>But inside<br>you were pure of soul. </strong><br><br>Consider dropping the last two lines.<br><br><strong>I came out of my tunnel<br>one dandy day<br>and I saw you.<br>No more wings.<br>But I think I could<br>make us a pair<br>to fly above those<br>grey clouds above the<br>old school<br>where<br>we used to<br>dream.</strong><br><br>The main problem I have with this poem is that I donÂ’t see any connections between the different strophes.  Personally after the fourth strophe, I find myself struggling to keep it together.  Maybe it is just me, but I think you are trying to do too many things at the same time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
