I showed it to someone and his comments was that the break in the 2nd and 3rd stanza made the poem feel disconnected and he thought i was talking about 2 different people instead of the pimp alone. Just wondering if anyone else felt this way?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The poem seems to lose focus in the last stanza where the subject seems to have abruptly changed.

It's a little confusing with some of the lines beginning with capital and some are not.<br><br>eg:<br><br>So I stumbled into an area<br>Rank with stench &lt;-- capitalised here<br>of sweat, seductive &lt;-- not capitalised<br>sex and squalor<br><br>A plump old pimp sings to me:<br>Hey Mister! look see;<br>Pretty girls so young, &lt;-- capitalised<br>donÂ’t worry, donÂ’t worryÂ…&lt;-- not capitalised<br><br>-- It's difficult for me to understand exactly what 'betraying body' is.

Usually this reference is used when people are lured to a single object, not multiple ones like a group of ladies. Pied Piper lured persons to a place or thing, not to another person or groups of persons. Just IMHO.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

But there is a struggle between the logic of the mind, and the impulses and desires of the body. The body wants to experience what the mind knows to be bad.<br>This was what i wanted to portray.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Bluesky_Liz:<br>-- I feel that Pied Piper reference is not suitable.

How this compares with the traditional sexual relationship with a wife or a girlfriend. But as i wrote, the poem took a different turn. Perhaps i should have stuck to the original aim, then this wouldnt turn out so awry! Yikes!</div>
