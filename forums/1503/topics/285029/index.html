            <div class='col-md body'>We will talking about females being the deadlier species in Club 30's and was reminded of this poem  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Just thought it would be nice to share with you guys<br><br><strong>The Female of the Species </strong><br><span class="small"><strong>Rudyard Kipling, 1911 </strong></span><br><br>When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride,<br>He shouts to scare the monster, who will often turn aside.<br>But the she-bear thus accosted rends the peasant tooth and nail.<br>For the female of the species is more deadly than the male.<br><br>When Nag the basking cobra hears the careless foot of man,<br>He will sometimes wriggle sideways and avoid it if he can.<br>But his mate makes no such motion where she camps beside the trail.<br>For the female of the species is more deadly than the male.<br><br>When the early Jesuit fathers preached to Hurons and Choctaws,<br>They prayed to be delivered from the vengeance of the squaws.<br>'Twas the women, not the warriors, turned those stark enthusiasts pale.<br>For the female of the species is more deadly than the male.<br><br>Man's timid heart is bursting with the things he must not say,<br>For the Woman that God gave him isn't his to give away;<br>But when hunter meets with husbands, each confirms the other's tale --<br>The female of the species is more deadly than the male.<br><br>Man, a bear in most relations-worm and savage otherwise, --<br>Man propounds negotiations, Man accepts the compromise.<br>Very rarely will he squarely push the logic of a fact<br>To its ultimate conclusion in unmitigated act.<br><br>Fear, or foolishness, impels him, ere he lay the wicked low,<br>To concede some form of trial even to his fiercest foe.<br>Mirth obscene diverts his anger --- Doubt and Pity oft perplex<br>Him in dealing with an issue --  to the scandal of The Sex!<br><br>But the Woman that God gave him, every fibre of her frame<br>Proves her launched for one sole issue, armed and engined for the same,<br>And to serve that single issue, lest the generations fail,<br>The female of the species must be deadlier than the male.<br><br>She who faces Death by torture for each life beneath her b<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>reast<br>May not deal in doubt or pity -- must not swerve for fact or jest.<br>These be purely male diversions -- not in these her honour dwells.<br>She the Other Law we live by, is that Law and nothing else.<br><br>She can bring no more to living than the powers that make her great<br>As the Mother of the Infant and the Mistress of the Mate.<br>And when Babe and Man are lacking and she strides unchained to claim<br>Her right as femme (and baron), her equipment is the same.<br><br>She is wedded to convictions -- in default of grosser ties;<br>Her contentions are her children, Heaven help him who denies! --<br>He will meet no suave discussion, but the instant, white-hot, wild,<br>Wakened female of the species warring as for spouse and child.<br><br>Unprovoked and awful charges --  even so the she-bear fights,<br>Speech that drips, corrodes, and poisons -- even so the cobra bites,<br>Scientific vivisection of one nerve till it is raw<br>And the victim writhes in anguish -- like the Jesuit with the squaw!<br><br>So it cames that Man, the coward, when he gathers to confer<br>With his fellow-braves in council, dare nat leave a place for her<br>Where, at war with Life and Conscience, he uplifts his erring hands<br>To some God of Abstract Justice -- which no woman understands.<br><br>And Man knows it! Knows, moreover, that the Woman that God gave him<br>Must command but may not govern -- shall enthral but not enslave him.<br>And She knows, because She warns him, and Her instincts never fail,<br>That the Female of Her Species is more deadly than the Male.<br></div>
