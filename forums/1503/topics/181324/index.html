            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that it's no use forcing a poem to rhyme.<br><br>Just two suggestions:<br><br>- complete the first draft without worrying about what works or doesn't (since you don't have to show it anyone), just write everything that you want to say. That would help clear the mind of clutter. Having it all down on paper will help you to see what you have and help you decide what you want to do, then go on from there.<br><br>- read poems that are related to what you want to write about, or poems that appeal to you. It'll help you get some more ideas.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Ok, that's an astute observation, but how so? If you can work this idea into the last stanza, the poem will be more complete.<br><br>Likewise, what is the promise that the flame remembers to keep? It isn't illuminated in the suceeding stanzas.<br><br>As for grammar and punctuation... generally, unless the lackof/wanton usage of either element is deliberate, I'd advise you to stick to standard puncutation, as it interferes with the reading.<br><br>On the technical side, I find that the first stanza can do with a little more polish -- for instance, personally I find that the introduction of "the wind is strong and relentless" particuarly jarring. Perhaps you can focus on constructing the flame as a separate, living entity and build up on its reactions to the other elements in the active voice, instead of introducing truncated statements that lead to nowhere.<br><br></div>
