            <div class='col-md body'>For those who are too lazy to click the link.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: blue;">Poetry is Experience: The Writer's Responsibility </span></strong></span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Why does a reader come to a poem in the first place? Is it because she wants to know about the poet? Is it because she wants to know what the poet feels about something? Is it because she wants the poet to lecture her about something? Absolutely not.<br><br>A reader comes to a poem for one reason: she wants to experience something herself, to feel something herself. She doesn't care what the writer has experienced or felt; she wants those things for herself. That's why successful poetry is reader-centered, not writer-centered.<br><br>And how do we experience things? Fundamentally, through the senses. We see the shape of dogwood blossoms, we hear the sound of rain on leaves, we smell fresh cow dung. Our experiences are rooted in specific, concrete, immediate sense perceptions.<br><br>And that is precisely the function to poetry: to create experiences for the reader. The only way it can do so is through focused, detailed sensory perceptions--images. It's not an accident that the word "image" is the root of "imagination"; poetry is that use of language which allows the reader to have an experience in her imagination.<br><br>For that reason, abstraction frequently is the enemy of successful poetry because abstractions are not things we ever directly experience. Abstractions are generalizations drawn from experience and, as such, are at least one remove away from direct experience. We never actually experience "beauty"; we see a rose, a seashell, a face, which we identify as "beautiful," but that identification is a process of generalization based on similarities both of sense perception and of emotive response to those sense perceptions. Only the immediate, the concrete, the tangible produce both the sense perception and the accompanying emotive response; the generalized and abstracted conceptualizations themselves lack the capacity to do so.<br><br>Poetry often deals with generalizations and abstractions; successful poems, however, are those which do so in concrete, specific terms which allow the reader to experience something. It's of little use to the reader to be told the writer has experienced 'enlightenment' for instance. So what? The reader doesn't care about the writer; she wants to experience it herself. That's why a poem would have to present the experience of "enlightenment' in direct sensory terms, not generalized abstractions.<br><br>Certainly, very good writers use generalizations and abstractions, but they almost inevitably do so in concrete, imagistic terms. Pope's Essay on Man deals with the abstract conceptions of a particular form of universal order, but the poem is a great one in part because Pope is able to express the abstract conceptions by means of a wealth of specific, perceptible images. For example, when Pope says<br><br>"Hope springs eternal in the human b.reast:<br>Man never is, but always to be blest"<br><br>he follows with a concrete illustration:<br><br>"Lo! the poor Indian, whose untutored mind<br>Sees God in clouds, or hears Him in the wind;<br>His soul proud Science never taught to stray<br>Far as the solar walk, or milky way;<br>Yet simple Nature to his hope has given,<br>Behind the colud-topped hill, an humbler heaven;<br>Some safer world in depth of woods embraced,<br>Some happier island in the watery waste,<br>Where slaves once more their native land behold,<br>No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold!<br>To be, contents his natural desire,<br>He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire;<br>But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,<br>His faithful dog shall bear him company.<br><br>The abstract conception is realized (in the sense of made tangible and perceptible) in specific, concrete terms.<br><br>Shakespeare does the same thing with the abstract conception of "love" in "Sonnet 116," where love, among other things, becomes concretized as the North Star, always visible and providing a reliable guide: "It is the star to ev'ry wand'ring bark." Similarly, Keats, in recognizing that he is unlikely to live long enough to achieve those things he wishes and that they therefore have no value to him, describes this recognition not in abstract terms but in a concrete image:<br><br>"--then on the shore<br>Of the wide world I stand alone, and think<br>Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink."<br><br>Keats portrays himself standing on a desolate beach staring out into the vast ocean where "Love and Fame"--implicitly described as ships--sink and are lost forever. These concrete images communicate far more than any quantity of pure abstractions ever could.<br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>Beginning writers almost universally lack the skill to deal adequately with abstractions and are therefore told to avoid them until they have acquired considerable experience. Focus instead on communicating with the reader through focused, concrete images because these are what allows the reader to have the imaginative experience that is what poetry is all about. </strong></span><br><br>In other words, ask not what the reader can do for you, but what you can do for the reader.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Usually a beginner writer, in this case a poet, started off by wanting to share his/her emotions/experiences with the reader via his/her poems.  This is a good thing and I strongly encourage you to pick up your pen and draft your first poem.<br><br>At this stage, the focus of the poems is about Â‘selfÂ’ in the highly ambiguous term Â‘self-expressionÂ’.  These poems are mainly about Â‘this is how I feelÂ’, Â‘this is what I didÂ’, etc. i.e. about Â‘meÂ’, my experiences, my emotions and my feelings. Such writes usually received praises from friends, family members, and colleagues.  I am not surprise if these poems also receive very positive comments in some poetry forums.  Some of my works were even highly praised in other oversea poetry forums.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  But I am not so sure about that now.<br><br>Most of us stop at this stage. In fact, it is absolutely fine to stop here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>However some of you might want to take one-step further, i.e. to explore the Â‘expressionÂ’ portion.  To express something efficiently, you need to learn the necessary skills.  It may be learning how to cook, dance, sing, and yes, also in the craft of poetry writing.  In reality, learning the correct skills is especially important in poetry writing.<br><br>For these small group of people the shift is towards a reader-centered writing style.  I am presently working toward this direction.  I am working towards writing poems that, hopefully, are able to create experiences for you, the reader. And for me to do that, I need to take many factors into considerations, i.e. linkbreaks, meter, abstract/concrete, clichÃ©s, rhythm, grammar, spelling, etc.<br><br>I am not saying that those poems that I've written were bad poems.  But the truth is they could be improved.  For example, you've just writen a love poem based on your experience.  But remember, there are millions of love poems out here.  The only thing unique about the one that you have written is because it is based on your experience.  Beside, you don't really care what other people think about the write.  But wouldn't it be great to write love poems (also based on your experience) that stand out from the rest? Love poems that after years from now your children, grandchildren while reading them are about to feel what you've been exactly?<br><br>Unfortunately, there is no Internet workshop forum in Singapore.  Creative writing workshop is also rare in this country. I have to teach myself poetry by reading books on poetry and from the handful critical workshop forums in the Internet.<br><br>So the question is which part of the term Â‘self-expressionÂ’ do you wish to focus on?<br><br>For me, I am going back to kindergarten in poetry writing, back to basic, start all over again.  (IÂ’ve deleted all my poems)<br><br>P.S.: This is just me hor.  Please continue to feel free to post your poems here.  It is so difficult to find someone who writes poems in this country.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
