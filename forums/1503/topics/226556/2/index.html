The police could not find anything else, except for a 5 of diamond beside her, and a game of unfinished solitare on the table. The newspaper also stated 4 other similar cases that happened that week.<br><br>His line of sight shifted from the articles, to the wall clock, and then to his unfinished game of solitare. suddenly, the hand phone on the table rang, at this very momont, a young lad burst into the room.<br><br>he raised an eyebrow and told the young lad, "lets go, they will be here anytime." With that, they left the room, ignoring the hand phone. Due to the fact that the phone was in vibration mode, it shifted from its original position, revealing a 6 of diamond card.

            <div class='col-md body'>He lay in a field with his eyes to that azure sky, thick undergrowth bordered it's edges, a ridge on the side bordering the road.<br><br>It was a place someone had been murdered, many years ago.And now, he has come seeking death- his own.<br><br>he lay in the field, watching that impossibly blue sky, on a fair day. What is beyond the Earth,in a sky above concerned not one like him ,to whom into the earth was where he was going. And in that field he lay, only the passage of clouds gave sense of time.<br><br>In that field, obscured from worldly matters, one that had seen better days- a school,a camp- but was now nothing,a blank,a field it was called. So did he think of himself and bemoaned the passing of his own days, the ones filled with laughter, when he loved and was loved in a world that followed time faithfully.<br><br>Traffic sounded occasionally from the road, a couple of meters just over the ridge. It was no matter, nobody would stop.<br><br>To kill one's self required a rational frame of mind, the composure and the will to execute the terrible deed was of paramount importance. He had none of that, he lived wanting to die but was unable to kill himself,so it was hell. But here in this field he lay, not acting was what was required of him.<br><br>Thus he waited faithfully.<br><br>Clouds amassed stopped moving, time froze in a single frame and it started to drizzle. Was it for her or himself that he cried?<br><br>He lay there crying into the rain, something warm blew on his neck, a shaft of pain like light stabbed into his consciousness. and he was up, punching and kicking at that wet shaggy coat of fur, a yelp told him he had made contact and he ran... over the ridge into the path of an incoming car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wrote this a year ago.<br><br>---<br>Â“No! Lee! Lee! LeeÂ…..Â” she screamed in her mind as Lee slowly sank down into the dark depthsÂ…<br><br>She woke up, startled. Sitting up, she scratched her head. It was her recurring nightmare, one which haunted her ever since her imprisonment.<br><br>Â“Get the hell out of my head!Â” she screamed at the mirror, watching her reflection do the same exact thing. She washed herself, and sat on the floor, leaning against the walls. She looked at the cold steel bars. The bars that limited her for nine years and eight months. Looking at the calendar, she realised, with a shock, that it was exactly ten years ago when Lee drowned. Drowned because of her. Ever since then, she was caged. Caged inside her own remorse, agony.<br><br>Â“107982, hereÂ’s your breakfast.Â” came a rough voice. A tray of food appeared in front of her. Â“Thanks, David.Â” she said, with a fade smile. David was the warden of her cell for the past nine years. A kind, but strict man. Yet, he seemed to have a soft spot for her. Maybe it was because he saw her agony. Her sufferings, her misery, her mental jail.<br><br>Slowly eating the food, she occasionally stopped to look at the walls and bars which had bounded her for nearly ten years.<br><br>Finishing, she put the tray exactly where it was when David left it. Sitting on the grass mat which had been her bed for the past nine years, she glared out of the window. A ray of sunshine shot in. Admiring the skies and the birds, she longed for freedom. Not her physical freedom, but her freedom from her recurring nightmare. She wanted to be free. Free like the birds. Then suddenly, it hitted her. Her only path to freedomÂ…<br><br>Running up the stairs, she looked back. Four wardens were on her tail, probably more were coming by the minute. Panting, she willed herself to go on. Â“Your only path to freedom!Â” she screamed to herself in her mind. Finally, she saw it. The door. She jumped at it and opened it. Rays of sunshine hit her, blinding her momentarily. Recovering herself, she ran towards the edge.<br><br>Â“Freedom at last, Lee.Â” she thought happily as she stepped out. She was on the ground when the wardens finally reached the top.<br><br>Â“MÂ…y.. fÂ…reÂ…e...d...o...mÂ…Â”</div>
