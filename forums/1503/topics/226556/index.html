I didn't think that Mexicans could understand the lazy Hokkien spoken by a Singaporean across the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>No matter. I pulled off the headphones, and ruffled Sam's hair. I asked her if she wanted some coffee, and she nodded. While making the coffee, I gazed at her back, and saw the curves of her shoulder in the sudden sunset's shadow cast on the timber floor.<br><br>I could say that I was deeply in love. Not just with her, but with life itself.<br><br>The cars had stopped blinking below.<br><br>I looked for the keys and we went down to the carpark, and to my horror, our car was blazing like a supernova.

I really like the matter-of-fact way it's written, 'It is this' and 'I do that'. I think it has impact when you right it short and to the point like this, because all you're doing is showing, and it's up to the reader to fill in the emotion and the description. You wrapped it up well, I think, the ending is perfect.<br><br>'Static interrupted my reverie'; I think you meant that in present tense, right?</div>

The way you wrote it makes it sound very real, like a dialogue someone really would have with himself, and I think that's really well done.<br><br><strong>'The umbrella is missing. I knew it.' '...after he left this afternoon, it was gone'. </strong>Maybe it should be in present tense. Or, since the speaker wasn't there when he left, it should be something like, <span style="font-style: italic;">'he left only this afternoon, and now it's gone.'</span><br><br>I think it would have more impact if you'd added more prejudice here, not in a nasty way, but in a more I-knew-it way. Like, <span style="font-style: italic;">'It's my own fault, I knew a foreign worker would be coming, but still I didn't look after my own things.'</span>, or something like that?<br><br><strong>'He will surely put it back after using it.'</strong> Would it have worked better if you'd written something less sure? Because the speaker is prejudiced, after all, right? Or perhaps it might work if the speaker gave the person the benefit of the doubt, not because he had faith in the foreign worker, but because that would make him feel better about himself?<br><br><blockquote><br>Hmm. It is almost evening and my umbrella is still nowhere in sight. I must teach him a lesson. I will activate the spell. But really it is just an umbrella, why the need to get so work up?<br><br>------<br><br>Ah my wife is back from work. But wait a minute, it wasn't the painter who took my umbrella, it was my wife. She took it this morning to work. Gosh, I almost hurt the person I love.<br><br>I am really ashamed of myself.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>It's quite a good ending, with a nice twist! I think it's a little too matter-of-fact here, though. The speaker is thinking to himself, isn't he? Would it work better if the speaker had said something more observational, like <span style="font-style: italic;">'she must have took it this morning'</span>, or <span style="font-style: italic;">'there's my wife---and the umbrella!'</span>?<br><br>All in all, though, I think you've managed to convey the idea very well. It's realistic and has impact, and because of the way you wrote it, it is something all readers can understand and relate too. Nice!</div>

Everything was taken away - his money, his clothes, his shoes. But stupid as he is, every of those cheats would tell him, he had helped them a great deal.

With that comes the realization of what I missed; as I looked down past my tie, my shirt trim and neat, my flannel black pants and finally resting my wide, shocked eyes upon my exposed toes peeking back at me through my slippers.</div>
