I feel that the rhythm in this poem is very unstable. I read in a book that rhythm  is pretty important as it captures the reader, but of course, this can be a personal style and still as successful.<br><br></div>

So when it is transcribed, it should also take care to preserve its readability and ensuing interpretation -- hence I find the rather liberal use of ampersands rather distracting to the eye.<br><br>And someone's mentioned rhythm -- that's one of the problems that jump out immediately...<br><br>That said, pretty nice imagery in certain areas -- I especially am enamoured with the line, "fingers that paint the chicken with spice".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tried to rewrite this poem today 4 times in different ways and 3 times before in recent weeks- but i realised this may be really a stillborn one.<br><br>no1 problem for me: a poem must have change or palpable conflict, emotional or physical- and this is something i cannot resolve yet as i do not have any concluding thoughts which are important to express in this poem. So i think I will leave this one aside until i can fiercely acknowledge some sort of idea... mayb there's a genesis of an idea- but not a fierce lightning blot.<br><br>was quite a bad idea to just start writing purely for the instinct of words really... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't.<br><br>I may reuse the ideas somewhere else though...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
