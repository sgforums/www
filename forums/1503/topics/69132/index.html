The following is the poetic version.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Cookies</strong></span><br><br>A woman was waiting at an airport one night,<br>With several long hours before her flight.<br>She hunted for a book in the airport shops.<br>Bought a bag of cookies and found a place to drop.<br><br>She was engrossed in her book but happened to see,<br>That the man sitting beside her, as bold as could be.<br>Grabbed a cookie or two from the bag in between,<br>Which she tried to ignore to avoid a scene.<br><br>So she munched the cookies and watched the clock,<br>As the gutsy cookie thief diminished her stock.<br>With a smile on his face, and a nervous laugh,<br>He took the last cookie and broke it in half.<br><br>He offered her half, as he ate the other,<br>She snatched it from her and thoughtÂ…oooh, brother.<br>This guy has some nerve and heÂ’s also rude,<br>Why he didnÂ’t even show any gratitude!<br><br>She had never known when she had been so galled,<br>And sighed with relief when her flight was called.<br>She gathered her belongings and headed to the gate,<br>Refusing to look back at the thieving ingrate.<br><br>She boarded the plane, and sank in her seat,<br>Then she sought her book, which was almost complete.<br>As she reached in her baggage, she gasped with surprise,<br>There was her bag of cookies, in front of her eyes.<br><br>If mine are here, she moaned in despair,<br>The others were his, and he tried to share.<br>Too late to apologize, she realized with grief,<br>That she was the rude one, the ingrate, the thief.<br><br>How many times in our lives, have we absolutely known that something was a certain way, only to discover later that what we believed to be true Â…Â…Â… was not.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
