            <div class='col-md body'>yes... I'm getting ambitious... so starting another story while still writing the other one....<br><br>*****************************************************************************<br><br>1 June 1991<br><br>Dear Diary,<br><br>This is it. Sweet sixteen. But no big birthday parties, no dances, and no smashingly handsome guy around to give me my first kiss on my sweet sixteen. Why is life so unlike those they wrote about in books like Â“P.S. I Love YouÂ”, or Â“Dial L for LoveÂ”. Maybe sweet sixteen only happens in Sweet Dreams and Sweet Valley High.<br><br>Thankfully, Rose, Clare and Joanna were great pals. Though Clare and I quarrel almost everyday, itÂ’s amazing that we can still hang out like the best of friends so very often. We went out for lunch to celebrate my birthday and IÂ’ve received presents from all of them, albeit none of them very useful. Clare and Joanna gave me a skirt, which I doubt IÂ’ll ever wear. Beige is definitely not my color. Rose gave me something for my study desk, that is, if I could find some space for it. ItÂ’s a deskplate that says Â“NobodyÂ’s perfect, but meÂ”. I wonder what she is trying to imply by it.<br><br>Dad just handed me the mail. IÂ’ve got a letter! ItÂ’s from Colin! Great! Will read what he has written in a while. Ever since Rose, Clare, Joanna and I got together and decided to start writing to penpals, it seems that IÂ’m the only one keeping up with the writing. Rose wonÂ’t have anything to do with Colin, just because she wasnÂ’t impressed with what he wrote in his first letter, and Clare and Joanna are just too lazy to keep it up.<br><br>-------- 5 mins later -----------<br><br>IÂ’ve read ColinÂ’s letter. He wants to meet! What should I do? Should I meet him alone? He definitely didnÂ’t ask to meet the others, though I did write about them in every one of my letters to him. Should I tell them? IÂ’m not too sure what to do.<br><br>He sure sounds like a nice guy. And he has given me his phone number, because he understands that we may not feel free to give our phone numbers. Should I call him?? Will think about it in a while. Meanwhile, goodnight diary.<br><br>(to be continued)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5 June 1991<br><br>Dear Diary,<br><br>Guess what? I called him! After showing his letter to the girls, Clare persuaded me to give him a call and sort of "check him out". I really wondered how one can do that without meeting the real person, but no harm talking to him, right?<br><br>He turned out to have a really nice voice! I don't know how to describe it but it was pleasant listening to him, comfortable too. I wonder how he looks. He said he's short, about 1.6m and weighs about 60kg. Is that fat? I sure hope not. Having being in a girls' school straight after PSLE, I don't have much contact with guys and I don't know how fat or thin 60 kg is. But the voice is gentle and he does have a good sense of humour.<br><br>And yes, you know what? He said that Colin is not his real name! I was shocked at his deception but guess I couldn't really blame him, since the girls and I went into this penpal thing with the same attitude he did, just for fun. After talking to him for almost an hour (with Mom looking sternly at me), he asked for my number so that he's going to call me again! He would like to talk to me again! I have never thought I'm attractive to guys, but maybe that's because he hasn't seen me yet. Hopefully, I can maintain his interest in me....<br>In the meantime, will talk to you again. Nite, diary.<br><br>*P.S. - I was rather happy (in a bad way) when I asked him if he would like to talk to the rest of the girls, he said he's not interested. He had suspected that all along, I had been the one writing the letters and he's only interested in getting to know me better! Whee!!<br><br></div>

IÂ’ve never been on a date before and IÂ’m not sure what I should wear, how I should behave, what I should do!<br><br>Joe (by the way, thatÂ’s ColinÂ’s real name) called again last night and he asked me out for a movie. We are supposed to meet each other at City Hall MRT station, in front of Raffles City. I wonder how I am going to recognize him in that weekend crowd!<br><br>In any case, I think Rose is getting a little jealous. She kept saying bad things about the way Joe writes in his letters and even said that this group penpal thing is a silly idea and sheÂ’s not interested in it anyway! I thought she was the one who started the whole idea!<br><br>Good thing I didnÂ’t tell the rest about the date. IÂ’m sure that if I did, Rose will manage to dissuade me from going. Thinking about JoeÂ’s gentle, magnetic voice, I find it hard to imagine how he might look like.<br><br>Anyway, diary, hope youÂ’ll wish me luck for tomorrowÂ’s date. ItÂ’s my first and I hope itÂ’ll be a memorable one!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>8 June 1991<br><br>Dear Diary,<br><br>I met Joe today, for the very first time! When I first got to City Hall MRT station, I was still wondering how on earth was I to recognise him from the crowd. He did mention last nite that I should look out for someone in a blue shirt, and crooked teeth. Can you imagine all the horrible faces I conjured up because he said "crooked teeth?"<br><br>It turned out that he was not bad looking at all! Except for being a bit shorter than typical guys and having more 'width' to his waist. He's actually only 3 cm taller than me and he said he thinks he is fat with his waist around 31 inches. I thought he looked pretty ok, and the "crooked teeth" was more like one "crooked tooth" that gave him a rather mischeivous grin when he smiles.<br><br>I was looking around for guys in blue when he suddenly approached me, walkman in hand, and asked if I was looking for him. I remember I blushed and asked him how he recognised me.<br><br>"Well, for one, you look like you were waiting for someone, and secondly, you look as lost as I felt." He said with a grin that I couldn't resist smiling back to.<br><br>It was kinda shy and awkward in the beginning but we slowly warmed up to a comfortable conversation as we made our way to Prince cinema. We went for a movie, more like a cartoon actually. We watched "An American Tail" and he said that it was the first time he watched a cartoon in a cinema.<br><br>He was quite sweet too, for I remembered some of the tales that the girls at school told, about how some guys made excuses such as crossing the road or yawning when they wanted to hold the girl's hand etc. He didn't try any of those cliched tricks, though he asked if I felt cold from the aircon in the cinema. I did and I tried not to shiver while he sat a little closer to lend me some warmth. He did hold my hand, for a short while, because my fingers were so cold they were almost freezing.<br><br>"I hope you won't think I'm taking advantage or anything," he said, offering his hand.<br><br>I looked at him, for a moment puzzled. He explained that he would like to help me 'warm up' a little since his hands are warmer than mine. And he did.<br><br>After the movie, we went for dinner and he insisted on paying for everything. Oh yes, he even bothered to send me home all the way though he stays around Serangoon while I stay in the west!<br><br>All in all, a rather enjoyable date. None of those dramatic events spelled out in Sweet Dreams happened, but the ease of conversation, the comfortable companionship was welcomed on this first date. He would open doors for me and walk in front to steer the way through the crowd, while frequently looking back to see that I will not be lost in the crowd.<br><br>I wonder whether I should tell the rest of the girls about this date? Diary, do you think I should tell them about it? What do you think they will say?<br><br>Maybe I will....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>10 June 1991<br><br>Dear Diary,<br><br>I didnÂ’t tell the girls I went out with Joe. But I couldnÂ’t resist the smile on my face whenever I thought about the date. Clare thought it was suspicious that I should be so happy all the time and started asking what happened. So I had to tell her a little lie Â– that IÂ’ve been talking to Joe regularly over the phone and enjoying it.<br><br>You should have seen how they teased me about it but why should they? Afterall, none of us have ever had any experience dating guys, except maybe Rose, who claimed she had a boyfriend and broke up only last year. And you should have heard what she said about Joe. All those criticisms about him being too short, too fat, not smart enough etc., and she would boast on and on about her ex-boyfriend who was from Raffles Institution. I couldnÂ’t help but think that if he were really that good, why then did she dump him?<br><br>Do you remember Donny, the penpal who asked for all our phone number? He called again today and I was chatting with him when he started asking me awkward questions, such as Â“What do you think of pre-marital sex?Â” or Â“What do you think a couple will do when they are left alone?Â” or Â“To what extent would you allow your boyfriend to touch you (assuming you have one)?Â”  etc. I had such a creepy, sleazy feeling of the way the conversation was going that I cooked up an easily-detectible excuse and hung up the phone. He tried calling again but I told him I was not free to talk.<br><br>I think he got rather angry after that and started calling Rose and Clare to complain about me. Joanna heard it too for she was at ClareÂ’s place at that time. It was a good thing too; that I managed to call the girls in time and tell them what happened, so they would not think badly of me. After hearing my account, even Clare and Joanna were convinced that they donÂ’t wish to talk to Donny anymore, and they didnÂ’t entertain his calls. Not so sure about Rose though. She did sound as if sheÂ’s disgusted with his behavior but then again, she has always been eccentric. DonÂ’t really know what sheÂ’ll do.<br><br>-------- 30 mins later -----------<br><br>Joe called just now. He said that he enjoyed the date very much and was glad that he met me! Yeh!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>25 June 1991<br><br>Dear Diary,<br><br>It has been a couple of weeks since I went out with Joe for the first time and heÂ’s still calling me every night to chit chat. I've also been meeting up with him every Saturday for a movie, or sometimes, just lunch or dinner. I like talking to him, for he makes me feel that being myself is ok. ItÂ’s comfortable and I donÂ’t have to be extra pretty or smart all the time. I can be the plain Jane I am and the ease of it is great.<br><br>Yesterday I went out with him again, to catch another movie. Like before, it was a comfortable, enjoyable date. Though we didnÂ’t get to talk much during the show, it was really fun afterwards to discuss it with him over dinner. He is humorous and funny, and we had a good time recounting the comedic elements in the show. Did I tell you that though his eyes are small, they seem to look deep into mine every time heÂ’s talking to me? I get a little shy whenever I noticed it and I didnÂ’t really dare to look him in the eyes most of the time.<br><br>There was something different about yesterdayÂ’s date. As usual, I got cold in the cinema and he offered to warm up my hands. I didnÂ’t really want to trouble him, and I was pretty shy about it, but he insisted. This time however, he didnÂ’t let go when the show ended, even after we walked out of the cinema. There were times when I took the chance of the moving crowd to draw back my hand, but he will reach for it and hold it again, looking at me with those eyes that I would just blush. Sensing that I was quite embarrassed at times, he did let go of my hand a few times, but whenever we were crossing the road, even at the traffic crossing, he would hold my hand. As usual, he accompanied me home to make sure I got back safely.<br><br>I didnÂ’t know what to feel but it sort of makes me feel really happy. When other girls at school were boasting about their Nth number of boyfriends and dates, I used to think that I was ugly and too unlikely to attract anyone. It feels good to know that a guy likes me, especially one who is not too bad looking.<br><br>Today I heard something strange. April, RoseÂ’s friend in Guitar Club, said that Rose has got a new boyfriend and his name is Donny. When I told Clare and Joanna about it, neither of them knew anything. It struck me as strange for she swore she will have nothing to do with a guy who asks awkward questions, or seemed to have motives about sex. Yet sheÂ’s dating him? Sometimes I really wonder which side of her is the real Rose. Why does she have to be so, I donÂ’t know, is it hypocritical towards us? We are supposed to be her clique for she didnÂ’t have anyone else, but why is she being so pretentious with us? I donÂ’t know how am I going to face her tomorrowÂ…..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>29 June 1991<br><br>Dear Diary,<br><br>Something special happened today when I went out with Joe. This time, Clare, Joanna and Rose joined us for dinner and it is their first time meeting Joe. I was kind of excited and not very sure how to behave in front of them. It was a little awkward, particularly towards the later part of the evening after dinner, when Clare, Joanna and Rose were walking with JoeÂ’s friend and left the two of us pretty much behind. After some time, the girls decided that itÂ’s time to go home and Joe, as usual, offered to send me back.<br><br>On the way home, he asked if I received the card that he sent to me by post. I said I did, and commented that he sounded a little depressed and sentimental in the card. Inside, he wrote that Â“Life is like a show, where heÂ’s the male lead but not the director.Â” He merely smiled. I attempted to make conversation and sort of asked in jest, Â“What about the female lead?Â”<br><br>Â“What do you think?Â” he said, looking at me and I didnÂ’t know how to reply nor what to imply by the look.<br><br>Just then, he handed me a small black box, at the same time producing a single red rose from his bag. I was surprised and asked him what it was. He simply smiled and said that it was a present, and asked me to open it.<br><br>I opened up the box to find a lovely crystal heart pendant on a thin chain, with the letter Â“JÂ” in the centre of the pendant. He took out the necklace and put it around my neck and said that he saw this pendant at a gift shop and couldnÂ’t resist buying it for me, especially since he knew that I have recently broke my old crystal pendant. I felt so touched.<br><br>After that, he sent me home and held my hand throughout the journey. Dear Diary, does this mean that Joe has indicated that IÂ’m his girlfriend? Is he my first boyfriend?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>14 July 1991<br><br>Dear Diary,<br><br>Joe and I have gone on naturally to be a couple, and life is sweet. Even then, he had been a real nice gentleman and we were progressing slowly. I haven't even had my first kiss! Yesterday, we went out to watch a movie again, and I was supposed to go for my choir practice after that. When Joe insisted on tagging along to see me in my choir practice, I declined, thinking of how embarrassed I would be and had this feeling that was like stage fright. In the end, I had no choice but decide not to go for practice.<br><br>As we were walking around, we noticed a large crowd gathering by the side of the road, and there were railings along the road. The road was closed to traffic and then, I recalled that they are having a national day parade rehearsal that day. So I suggested that we hang around and watch the parade instead of going for my practice.<br><br>When the parade started, the crowd got bigger and people were pushing each other to get a clearer view. Joe did a really sweet thing. To protect me from the pushing crowd, he put his hand around my waist, keeping me close to him. I felt really safe and wasnÂ’t being pushed around as much as before. The parade was interested, with all the uniformed groups as well as the performers in colorful costumes and fascinating props. There were applause when a beautiful stunt was performed and we had a good time watching and commenting on the performers.<br><br>Halfway through the parade, there was a lull where one group of performers were slower in getting to their places. I sensed that Joe was looking at me and I turned around to face him. He looked deep in my eyes and gave me a smile. As I smiled back, he gave me a kiss on the cheek. I think I must have blushed for he smiled wider as I turned to face the parade again in haste.<br><br>After the parade, we went for a quick dinner at the nearby MacDonaldÂ’s. Quick because it was extremely crowded with people who, like us, have finished watching the parade. After dinner, he sent me home and made me promise to page him after I showered so that he knows when to call me up and chat.<br><br>This is my first time watching a live parade and having him with me made it all the more an enjoyable event.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4 August 1991<br><br>Dear Diary,<br><br>School is getting tough. Prelims are coming soon and IÂ’m feeling really stressed out. Luckily, Joe will always cheer me up with his easy humor. Just yesterday, we went to Marine Parade for a walk. It has been a long time since I last went there, and besides, it was near the club in which Joe is part-time.<br><br>I had just finished the last exercise on the Maths ten-year series before I went to meet him and seeing how tired and stressed up I was, Joe brought me to Toys RÂ’us. He was acting so hilariously once inside that I couldnÂ’t help breaking up into laughter. It was as if he had never seen a toy before! He kept playing the fool to cheer me up and when I was in my happy moods again, he smiled and said, Â“You look prettier and more radiant when you smile.Â”<br><br>After dinner, we took a slow walk around and ended up sitting at one of the stone tables near the HDB estate, away from the bustle of Parkway Parade. I donÂ’t know whether he was tired because he met me after his work, or because he spent so much time and effort cheering me up. After we sat for a while, he fingered the pendant that he gave me, which I wore around my neck, and leaned over to rest his head against my shoulder. Thinking that he wanted to take a nap, I kept quiet. Moments later, I could feel him stirring and before I knew it, he kissed me on the neck. I couldnÂ’t help feeling the blush creep up my face but I didnÂ’t turn away this time, for I sort of liked that tender feeling of being loved.<br><br>Â“HmmÂ… your hair smells niceÂ” he said, landing a few more kisses on my neck. Before I knew it, I felt him taking a small bite. It didnÂ’t hurt, and he was really gentle about it. When he was done, he sat up, looked deep into my eyes and gave me a soft, tender kiss on my lips. That was my first kiss! I still canÂ’t believe it happened and it makes me blush just to think of it.<br><br>The girls have no idea that Joe and I have been dating each other and after yesterday, I have this dying urge to tell them what happened, to share my happiness with them. The only thing that is stopping me is that I know they will not have anything nice to say about it. What should I do?<br></div>
