            <div class='col-md body'>Hello folks!<br><br>9 December, Saturday (that's tomorrow!), at 3pm, we will be hosting Betty Warrington-Kearsley's poetry session where the English-born, Singapore-bred poet will be reading from her poetry collection "Red Lacquered Chopsticks".<br><br><strong>About Betty Warrington-Kearsley </strong><br><br>Betty was born in Cheshire, England, of a Singapore Chinese mother and English father. She was educated in Singapore where she was conceived and where she spent her holidays under the tutelage of her maternal grandparents in their family home in the Chinese fishing village of Telok Mata Ikan which now no longer exists. After graduating from St. Hilda's, then an Anglican mission school, she went to England to study physiotherapy. She returned to Singapore and worked with the RAF and the Australian Red Cross before heading back to England for further studies and experience. She then emigrated to Canada as an officer in the Canadian Forces Medical Services where she served for the next 24 years, twelve of them as the Forces' Chief Physiotherapist. After retiring from the Canadian Forces she worked with the Arthritis Society. She finally ceased her physiotherapy practice in 1996 to write, full time. Betty has travelled widely, visiting over 30 countries in Europe and Asia, Middle East and Africa, North and South America, and Australia - sometimes on business, sometimes family related, sometimes to explore and learn, and always with a notebook at hand. She lives in Ottawa but continues to travel at every opportunity. She also enjoys reading, walking, gardening, and sitting in the garden, in a timeless space between her Zen-like rocks, absorbing the spirit of "Life, the Universe and Everything" - in all its seasons. She writes, as her husband says, because there are things which must be said, and poetry is a most powerful medium. Always the student, Betty continues to study and hone her skills. While her works in progress include a memoir of her Chinese mother and life in the early days of Singapore, essays and short stories, she presently concentrates on poetry which she began writing in childhood. She has written of her experiences in Africa, South-East Asia, Japan, Chile and Canada, but mainly writes of humanity and the universal human condition.<br><br>Her poems and other writing have won prizes and been published in Canada, the United States, United Kingdom and Japan. Her feature article won first prize in the National Capital Writing Contest in 2005, and in 2004 she was recipient of the Diana Brebner Poetry award and co-winner of the Ray Burrell poetry contest. Her poems were also short-listed in the 2004 Shaunt Basmaijan Poetry Award. Betty's debut collection of poems, Red Lacquered Chopsticks, was  published by TSAR<br><br>Publications in October 2006.<br><br><strong>Reading at The Arts House </strong><br><br>You may also be interested to know that Ms Warrington-Kearsley is invited by the National Book Development Council for a poetry reading from her recently published collection of poems, Red Lacquered Chopsticks at the Arts House at Old Parliament on December 8.<br><br>Red Lacquered Chopsticks<br><br>Here's more about her book --<br><a href="http://www.tsarbooks.com/Frontlist2006.htm#Red." rel="nofollow">http://www.tsarbooks.com/Frontlist2006.htm#Red.</a><br><br>And here's a taster of her poetry --<br><a href="http://www.softblow.com/wkearsley.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.softblow.com/wkearsley.html</a><br><br>See you tomorrow at your friendly neighbourhood bookstore perched on a nostalgic shophouse!<br><br>XOXO<br>the BooksActually kids<br>--<br>BooksActually<br><br>//  125A Telok Ayer Street<br>Singapore 068594<br>//  +65 6221 1170<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello bunnies !<br><br>Happy two-oh-oh-seven.  We shall kick our hind-legs even higher this year, and strive to eat more pawfuls of vegetables, despite our very full paws.<br><br>Just look at Paw no. 1 , we have a brand new Frankie magazine issue no. 14 (which came rather drearily late.)<br><br>Paw no. 2 presents a very fancy, growing collection of film books.  (Yes!  There is finally an excuse for us to carve out a film section in our very selective fiction + literature bookstore.)  These currently include interviews, critical essays, photographs on filmmakers Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut, Woody Allen, Wong Kar Wai etc.<br><br>Unable to resist the temptation, most of the exquisite French New Wave books have been snapped up by us (those editions nesting nicely at the counter.  Ask politely and you might be allowed to browse!)  Film books are terribly expensive, aren't they?  We are trying to lay our paws on more, promise.<br><br>Paw no. 3 (of a different rabbit, of course, anything otherwise would really be freaky) shows a new session of Literati III.  Otherwise known as Literati !!!  This session falls on 27th January, Saturday, 4pm at BooksActually.  Featuring Dominic Ng, Ruby Pan, Teng Qian Xi, Russell Tan, Donald Pan of Nuance and Amanda Tee, Literati !!! is a celebration of the power of words with the combined effort of storytellers, poets, musicians and many more.<br><br>The final paw hides our special surprise.  If you haven't lost count, that's Paw no. 4.  And that holds our very own interpretation of the local cult 555 notebook (those slim little blue things people scribble on and slip into their pockets.)  This new Birds &amp; Co. handmade series is aptly named "The 125A Notebook".  Unlike our previous limited edition notebooks, the 125A notebook is a perennial item.  It features hand-folded covers made from pages of the "New Serial Titles, 1961-1965, Volume 2, K-Z" book catalogue - so every 125A cover is different!<br><br>One day, a certain Swiss bird said to us, "Kids, you should make your notebook extra special, like so," and we did.  A secret compartment was created.  Thus was the birth of our very own cult notebook that every discerning individual, who knows the value of a hand-stitched gem, should own.  It only costs $2.50!  Everyone should buy ten!<br><br>XOXO,<br>the BooksActually kids<br><br>p.s.: This rich text thing is kind of fun.

The volume also contains a series of poems that act as a thematic through-line for the two voices. These reference heavily the lives and times of the Castrati. These poems are composed in a more formalistic mode and  (if the work is to be performed) are to be sung acappella. The Castrati are utilised as a metaphor for contemporary gay male culture and further relate or comment on the marginalisation of individuals and or artists. The volume is set in Singapore and the Australian perspective represented in the guise of a tourist, and the other a Singapore local.

Sorry!  Once again:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Excess Baggage and Claim </span> is volume of  poetry written in two character voices, one Australian, one Singaporean and both  speaking from a gay male perspective, commenting on that culture as it exists in  both countries. The volume also contains a series of poems that act as a  thematic through-line for the two voices. These reference heavily the lives and  times of the Castrati. These poems are composed in a more formalistic mode and  (if the work is to be performed) are to be sung acappella. The Castrati are  utilised as a metaphor for contemporary gay male culture and further relate or  comment on the marginalisation of individuals and or artists. The volume is set  in Singapore and the Australian perspective represented in the guise of a  tourist, and the other a Singapore local.'<br><br>(with support from the Australian High Commission)<br><br>// Book launch of Excess Baggage and Claim with Cyril Wong &amp; Terry Jaensch<br>// 17 March 2007, Saturday<br>// 2pm<br>// BooksActually<br><br>-<br><br>Bon voyage!<br><br>xoxo,<br>The BooksActually Kids<br><br>--<br>BooksActually<br><br>//  125A Telok Ayer Street<br>Singapore 068594<br>//  +65 6221 1170<br></div>

Depicting the modern world as an 'oracle refusing to yield', this collection deals with the tensions between mind and experience by highlighting the perennial problems between truth and art. The poems' imagistic utterances and eccentric speakers possess a haunting quality in their treatment of such universal themes as love, desire and death.
