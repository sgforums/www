            <div class='col-md body'>if xi ling meng can have part II after 2mths of break, i figure i can too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and to refresh everyone's (including mine) memory... here's the last episode of part I so to speak.....<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Episode #22<br><br>Looking intently into his eyes, i could clearly see regret and pain. These puzzled me even more and yet I did not want to push him to talk. No one knows better than me how difficult it is to talk about how our heart really felt.<br><br>Vince pulled away his eyes from mine and looked out of the window. Slowly he began his story...<br><br>"Remember that day I called you? And you told me you're going on a trip with Jason? When Cyndi told me that, I don't believe her. Yet..... *deep sigh* I thought we can begin again, but to realised it was all too late. My heart was crushed.<br><br>Another part of me was very upset and angry. I felt that you misled me and playing me along. How could u say u love me and go on a trip with another guy?!"<br><br>I sat there quietly, holding back my urge to defend and clarify myself. I told myself, "Let him finish..." and he continued.<br><br>"That nite i was consumed by jealousy and anger. I was beside myself. I need to vent out one way or another. And .... and... cyndi called me."<br><br>"And?" Hearing that I can't help it but to probe.<br><br>"And... we went out. We went clubbing, I just want to drink and dance my frustrations away. I wanted to numb my heart. And .... and .... i guess, i numbed myself wee too much with alcholol."<br><br>By now, pictures of a half drunk him and cyndi dancing intimately were forming in my mind. Maybe they even kissed! I shaked those images out of my head and bit my lips to hold my peace.<br><br>"Things got ... abit out of control. And.... and... well... we ended up back here in my room. One thing led to another.... and.... .... ....."<br><br>"You .... *swallow* you two.... have ...... s... ex?" I asked as if the words are fragile, fearing what the answer would be. And it did as Vince slowly nodded his head, "That was how we ended up together. I thought u and Jason have already.... you know?"<br><br>Tears flowed quietly down my cheeks. We both sat in complete silence as the sun slowly sets outside the window. As the room dimmed, he turned and asked the most stupid question i have ever heard. "Do you want to scold me?"<br><br>I just looked at him blankly. Suddenly i let out a laugh. More like a sneer, I'm not sure. "What would tat change, vince?" "Jo, I'm sorry i know i've betrayed you.... I don't love Cyndi, you know that.... I... I.... really thought you and Jason.... " He reached over to hold my hands. I moved my hands away.<br><br>With tears in my voice, i started to speak. "That time when we were .... ... ... passionate.... you stopped, you didn't want to have sex with me. You said because u love me. And now you have sex with someone you don't love? I really.... don't understand your logic."<br><br>I could see tears sparkling in his eyes. He turned and hugged me tight. His embrace felt so warm but I knew this is not what i want.<br><br>"Vince, it's ok.... It's over. You have Cyndi now and you have to take responsibilty. Too many things between us. It's no one's fault...." Slowly he released his embrace and I got up and left in silence.<br><br>As i walked out of his place, i realised there were no more tears. Yet my heart was so painful. It was as if someone tear it out while I'm still alive. Maybe... maybe this is how it feel when it hurt the most. This is perhaps what the chinese quote means by wanting to cry yet there ain't any tears...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I lost count of the number of "excuse me" i had to say just to get through the mass of people at the atrium of the mall. Finally i get to my gal friend standing impatiently outside the cafe.<br><br>"You're late, AGAIN!" she greeted me with a protest.<br>"Sorry lah, not used to have lunch at this hour mah..." I smiled sheepishly.<br>"It's 12, it's the time normal people have their lunch. Not 2 or 3pm like you....."<br>I was grinning to myself, amused at her ranting on and on. I have told her my logic of having late lunch in the heart of town, 1st to avoid the horrible lunch crowd and 2nd, 2pm lunch ends at 3pm, and that would means 3 more hours to knock off!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>"That's warp logic! Where got people like that one?"<br>"Ok ok.. my grandma also no nag like you. Let's eat, what do you..." As i turn, a gigantic mass of fat knocked into me. "Ouch!"<br>The mass ignored me and as it move away from my visual range, i froze. The once familiar face was walking pass right before my eyes. I threw a single word "wait" to my gal friend and quickly ran after him.<br><br>I caught up and tapped him on his shoulder. He turned around and we looked straight into each other's eyes. Time froze momentarily, the buzz of the crowd around us suddenly seems far away. The magic was broken when another mass of skin and bones knocked into me.<br><br>"Jo?" the surprise in his voice is undeniable. I smiled.<br>"My goodness, Jo!! It's really you!!! Ooh my!!! How long have it been?" The excitement has quickly and clearly replaced by sheer joy.<br>"Yes, Vince... it's been very long. 13 years?" I answered softly. Yes, it's been a long 13 years....<br><br>to be cont'd  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part II Episode #2<br><br>I was in a daze, staring out of the full glass panel of the fast food restaurant. I was still trying to come to soak into the fact that we could meet after so many years. If my gal friend wasn't in the area for her interview... if she has not suggested lunch... if she din insisted on a "normal" lunch hour... if i wasn't knocked by that mass of fat... if....<br><br>"OUI! help me with the tray lah!" my thoughts were interrupted by my gal friend's protest. "Buy for you still sit there and stone." I made a face and quickly help her removed our burgers and drinks from the tray.<br><br>As we settled down with our high cholestrol lunch, i gave her a grin. "Ok, what you wanna ask?"<br>"Heehee... who is he har?" Her kpo mode was evidentlly on.<br>"My ex bf...", I answered with a blush.<br>"Ex? Then why u smile like like that? Who dump who one?"<br>"He dumped me lor..."<br>"Wat? And you can still smile?" For a gal with single eyelids, her eyes sure can be big. I could just giggled.<br><br>Lunch continued with mindless crapping and the usual gossips. But my mind was somewhere else. Or rather with someone else...<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I went back to office with my loads of work piled up forming a mountain. "Gosh, I doubt i can see any sunray today again," I grumbled to myself. Sometimes i wondered is there life beside work? Just as i began to get into my work and focusing on the html codes, my mobile beeped. An sms.<br><br>"Hi darling, it's nice to see you again. After so many yrs. Perhaps we can do dinner someday and catch up?" I found myself smiling as i read the short sms and replied. We fixed up a date for dinner. And i found myself wondering what to wear already.<br><br>"Get back to WORK!" I yelled to myself in my heart and brushed aside the thought of him or our dinner date and continued punching on the keyboard.<br><br>to be cont'd  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part II Episode #3<br><br>"This is it..." I took a deep breathe after checking myself in the mirror for the last time. A reflection of a tanned gal in a lycra top and jeans smiled nervously back at me. Today is finally the day I'm meeting up with Vince. After all these years, after all the dozens of relationships i had, why am i still so nervous?! I could feel my heart pumping dangerously near my throat. Clearing my throat and taking another deep breathe, i walked out of the toilet.<br><br>Vince was already waiting outside the french restaurant when i arrived. He flashed a wide smile and i could feel my legs melting.<br><br>"Hi darling, you look great!" he greeted me with a compliment which i'm sure he was just being polite. "Nice shirt you have," I smiled and hoped i didn't sound fake.<br><br>As we were guided to our seats by the waiter, Vince's hand was on my lower back, guiding me along. It was probably just a gentlemanly gesture but it still never fails to send a bolt of electricity running through my spine.<br><br>After the waiter walked away with our order, we both fell into a silence. Perhaps it's the soft drapes of fabric down the full glass windows, perhaps it's the soft jazz music in the background, perhaps it's the flickering candlelight on our table... the silence seems too sacred to be broken.<br><br>Our orders came and gone, wine glass emptied and refilled. We both start to relaxed and chat.<br><br>"Actually..... I have something to ask you." Vince sudden changed of tone kinda worry me.<br>"Yah?"<br>"Tat time when we were together.......... are you still mad at me?"<br><br>Looking at the remorse in his eyes, who would still be? afterall it's been decades, or at least feel like it. I shaked my head with a laugh, "Of course not, silly!" Tension broke and we both started to joke and just crap.<br><br>"You What??!!"<br>I forgot what led our conversation, but my mentioned of my ex bfs was apparently quite a shock to Vince.<br>"Sssshhh........... wat's so shocking?" I giggled.<br>"You started dating so young? And I thought I'm your 1st or 2nd bf! Why didn't you tell me??"<br>"Well, you never ask.... and we just started dating, you can't expect me to go around telling everyone my history right?"<br>"Gosh! now don't tell me you ain't a virgin then...."<br>I grinned and burst out laughing as his jaw dropped to the table.<br>"You thought I was?"<br>"Yes! tat's why I never........... " both of us blushed as we recalled how close we were to crossing that barrier.<br><br>"Now that's enough of fantasising! Wipe that humsup smile from your face... " I giggled. "You also wat," Vince resorted. The night flew pass with more laughter and wine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hehehe... time to resurrect this thread of mine.... wonder if anyone still waiting to read the rest of it .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Part II Episode #4<br><br>After that night of archeology with Vince as he called it because he discovered so much about me in the past that he have never know, we have been keeping in touch. He still can't get over all the presumptous ideas he had about me that turned out all wrong. I must admit it has been fun laughing at his face of shock whenever he found out another truth about me. Felt like i'm a treasure that was slowly being discovered.<br><br>Perhaps it is because we used to date, perhaps because we technically know each other for almost 1.5 decade, there lies a sense of intimacy and security beneath the jokes and laughter. It was really comfortable just hanging out with him. In fact, it felt better now than then. There is no longer the anxiety of dating, the jealousy of a relationship, the uncertainty of a couple's future. Just warm friendship. Whoever said we can't be friends with our ex?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But i undermined the danger of being friends with a ex... The frequency of smses, phone calls and meeting up for kopi slowly but surely increases. From the occasional sms of "hey you free to meet up for kopi?" to the daily "hey baby, wat r u doing?" We have subconsciously connected in ways more than what we ought to. He has a live-together gf and i am in a serious relationship.<br><br>"Hey baby, you're here." Vince greeted me with a weak smile. My heart broke when i saw him sitting alone at the cafe, his face was full of pain.<br>"What's wrong? Are you ok?" I put my hand over his on the table as i sat besides him.<br>"It's her...."<br><br>I let out a sign... This is not the first time he shared about the problems he having with his gf. Frankly i wonder why is he still hanging on with such a woman. It turned out this time she have threw stuffs across the house when he got home at 3am last night (or rather this morn). He is running his own company and had to entertain clients at times. Last night he was stuck with some japanese guys who's supposed to sign a major contract with him.<br><br>Without hearing him out, she threw stuffs across the room, screaming and yelling vulgarity at him. He was high and ask to talk abt it the next day. She was too mad to listen. The rest were too shocking and demeaning for me to even talk about. i could not understand how could anyone (man or woman) demean his/her partner till such extent. I know anything that i say would not help, in fact, i might make things worse cos i am 100% certain that i have nothing good to say about that woman. All i could do is to hold his hand tight...</div>
