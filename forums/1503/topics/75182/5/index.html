            <div class='col-md body'>epi 21 ...<br><br>My life is such a mess. horrendous messÂ… that is what I would have called it. I had attempted to be objective but everything that Terence was doing ever since I came back just irritates me. I could feel my patience reaching its extremes and it has only been a week since the trip.<br><br>Â“YouÂ’ve changed.Â” Terence spoke the words as though they were poison.<br><br>Â“Huh? What are you talking about?Â” I looked at him, clearly irritated.<br><br>Â“YouÂ’re thinking of someone elseÂ… I knew it! It was a mistake letting you go to Bintan.Â” He accused.<br><br>Â“WhateverÂ…Â” I said and looked away. I didnÂ’t want to face him. I knew what happened in Bintan and IÂ’m not about to let him know about it. Afterall, I didnÂ’t want to kick up a bigger mess if what happened between Ran and I were nothing more than a weekend fling.<br><br>He wouldnÂ’t let up. Â“I knew something would go wrongÂ… you are in love with someone else arenÂ’t you? Tell me! Are you??Â”<br><br>Terence grabbed me by the shoulders and I twisted away, refusing to look at him. The sight of his face twisted in jealousy just makes me sick.<br><br>Â“What does he have that I donÂ’t have? That I canÂ’t give you?Â” He demanded to know. I didnÂ’t answer and continued walking on my way.<br><br>Â“I knowÂ… youÂ’re a b|+ch! Just like the others. You only want money and I donÂ’t have any! You look down on me because IÂ’m not rich! Not like him! So who is he? I want to confront him! Who is he?!Â” He was almost yelling and at this moment, my anger reached the boiling point.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m a b|+chÂ… yes you are right. But look at yourself. What are you? 23-year old Beng trying to act like youÂ’re 18. You talk big and show off all the time, but never once were you able to keep to your promises. You have no respect for others at all and least of all me. You donÂ’t even have basic mannersÂ… talking loudly in public and worse, gossiping, giggling and conversing during your friendÂ’s wedding service in church! You donÂ’t show your friends any respect and all you can think about the whole day is sex and money. You donÂ’t even know how I think or what I feelÂ… wait, thatÂ’s not right. More like you donÂ’t even understand and are not able to understand. You don't even know general knowledge half the time and you try to show that you're smarter or better than me. You try to dismiss me as frivolous even when I know I'm right. I feel like an old mother trying taking care of you all the time and all you know to do is to whine your selfish needs. IÂ’ve had enough of it. Get out of my sight. Get out!Â”<br><br>I strode off angrily and shut the door behind me, refusing to listen to anything and forbidding my mom from opening the windows. I knew I was at faultÂ… for being mean to him, for letting things happen between me and Ran. But all that mattered to me now was I wanted to wipe out my messy life where Terence belonged and begin all over again with RanÂ…<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 22...<br><br>Yen looked at me over her computer screen and gestured for me to go over to her desk. I went over, puzzled at what was it all about.<br><br>Â“HeyÂ… did you offend someone recently?Â” She asked in a whisper.<br><br>I looked at her, not quite understanding her meaning.<br><br>Â“Why donÂ’t you take a look at this e-mailÂ…Â” She pointed at her screen.<br><br>I bent forward and read the e-mail. To my horror, Terence wrote a slanderous e-mail to my companyÂ’s corporate e-mail address, describing me as wanton, desperate and hungry for sex. He accused me of demanding for sex even when he didnÂ’t want any. Since when!!<br><br>I was furious. Furious to the point that I couldnÂ’t speak and could only cry. Just then, my phone rang.<br><br>Â“What happened to you and your ah-beng boyfriend har?Â” MomÂ’s voice rang from the other end of the line. Â“HeÂ’s going crazy or what? Come all the way to our front door and started shoutingÂ… saying what you slept with him and he will be responsible to marry you. All our neighbours are watching you know. Is he telling the truth?Â”<br><br>I was stunned. I couldnÂ’t think. All I could say was insist that he was lying and that my mom should shut the door and call the police.<br><br>Just as I put down the phone, the ringing came again. It was TerenceÂ’s mom. I couldnÂ’t control any more. I had to let it all out.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know what heÂ’s doing and what heÂ’s thinking. As far as we are concerned, I made it clear to him that I wanted to break up because we simply canÂ’t go on. If he continues to stalk me or harass my family, please know that I would have no choice but to go to the police and write a letter to his superior.Â” I pleaded with his mom, asking her to put a stop to his sonÂ’s mad behaviour.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know what has gone into him tooÂ… he told me you have broken up with him and I advised him to let it goÂ… but he just went crazy for a moment just now. Maybe heÂ’s too upset. Please forgive him. You know that once heÂ’s reported heÂ’ll be ruined for life. Please give him a chanceÂ… I, as his mother, beg youÂ… Please forgive him and IÂ’ll make sure he wonÂ’t bother you again.Â”<br><br>I took a deep breath, calmed myself down and I agreedÂ… hoping that from now on, I would never see him ever again.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 23<br><br>It was a reliefÂ… for after that, Terence never called me nor showed himself in front of me again. But I did get a letter from him one day. It was a thick package in the envelope and as I read, I couldnÂ’t help feeling sad for it did remind me of some good times we had. As I came to the last paragraph, nostalgia and good memories gave way to disgust.<br><br>Â“Â… as you know, IÂ’ve got a heavy burden at home. The payment for the car is coming up soon and my dad had recently been retrenched. My sister is working part-time only and even my mom is struggling to make ends meet. As the eldest in the family, I should really be sharing the load but I have spent all the money the government scholarship has given me as allowance this year. I know you have always been thrifty and has got a bit of savings. Can you lend me some money to tide over this period?Â”<br><br>I threw the letter into the trash in disgust. After all the mess he had created in my workplace and my family life, he had the cheek to ask me for money? I didnÂ’t intend to reply and never did.<br><br>***********************<br><br>HappinessÂ… that was the only thought that came to mind as I think about my days with Ran. Weekdays were busy with work but when weekends come, our spirits rise. We would meet for movies, dinner or simply some excuse to hang out together. This Christmas will be a very different oneÂ… for it will be the first time that IÂ’ll countdown to it with a whole family Â– RanÂ’s family.<br><br>We went early at 6 pm to his grandmotherÂ’s place and I was happily introduced to all his relatives Â– aunties, uncles, cousins. The young ones look at me with curious grins and giggles, while RanÂ’s mom bustled around showing off the present that I bought for her and RanÂ’s grandmother. Suddenly I felt a lot of family warmth that I was unable to feel with my own relatives.<br><br>We went upstairs and Ran showed me the games room, where he spent much of his childhood with his cousins during family get-togethers. There was a piano sitting in one corner and Ran sat down beside it, running his fingers on the keys. It has been years since he played a piano and as he invited me to sit beside him, he started playing familiar ballads on the keys.<br><br>The setting sun beamed through the windows and I sat there looking at him play, mesmerized in the tunes that emerged from the keys. As we basked in each otherÂ’s company, the door suddenly opened and closed.<br><br>Â“OopsÂ… sorry I didnÂ’t know you two were in here. Hope I didnÂ’t disturb anything. Please carry onÂ…Â” RanÂ’s cousin said, laughing as he went out, shutting the door behind him.<br><br>Ran and I looked at each other and then burst out laughingÂ… it was pure happinessÂ…<br></div>
