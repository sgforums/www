            <div class='col-md body'>Epi 15...<br><br>************************************************************<br><br>Red, blue, yellowÂ…lights flashing everywhere. This is the first time IÂ’ve been out clubbing since my conversation with Ran. My heart was heavy and I wasnÂ’t in the mood at all but my colleagues pleaded me to join them at Mambo that night.<br><br>Â“Enough mopingÂ” I thought to myself. Â“Afterall, it IS my birthdayÂ…Â”<br><br>Just then, I turned around and who should come walking up the driveway but Ran! My heart felt torn and I wanted to run but I had nowhere to turn for he has seen me already. Previously whenever I saw him at the MRT station or in school, I would have turned the opposite direction. Now I stand rooted to the ground, and bringing a smile to my face to greet him was the toughest task at hand.<br><br>Â“HelloÂ… how are you?Â” Ran asked.<br><br>Â“Fine.Â” I said, putting on my best acting. Â“Who are you with?Â”<br><br>Â“Some guys from the hall lahÂ…one of them is celebrating his birthday.Â” He said, pointing to one of his hall mates.<br><br>Â“I seeÂ… ok IÂ’m going inside. See you around.Â” I turned and walked into Zouk after my colleagues.<br><br>Throughout the night, I felt miserable. I couldnÂ’t shake myself out of the sadness and the thought that IÂ’m spending my birthday alone made me totally depressed. I couldnÂ’t bring myself to dance and every now and then, I find myself turning around hoping o catch a glimpse of Ran. My colleagues knew RanÂ’s appearance turned my mood topsy turvy and tried to cheer me up, introducing me to their friends. I couldnÂ’t remember a single name nor face, only RanÂ’s.<br><br>Â“Hey, today your birthday right?Â” One of the guys in the group looked at me and asked. Before I could answer, he had his arm around my shoulder and a jug in front of my face.<br><br>Â“Birthday girl must drink! Bottoms up!Â” He shouted amidst the loud music. Then the whole group gathered around me, waiting. I looked around and there must have been 20 of them there. I turned around, attempting to get away from the jug but there was no way I could escape. I was surrounded, and the jug was pushed to me. I tried to excuse myself, saying that I donÂ’t drink beer but to no avail. A jug of stout showed up instead.<br><br>At that moment, Ran walked past with his hall mates, not seeing me at the corner. A wave of depression hit me like a whiplash and all I wanted to do was to hurt myself, so that I wouldnÂ’t feel the hurt in my heart. I grabbed the jug and started drinking through a straw. Just when I thought I had finished the jug and could get away, a second jug showed up. Short of having them pour it down my throat, I forced myself to drink.<br><br>"If only i could just die or disappear from all this!" That thought rang in my head countless times.<br><br>My head was spinning and I could not see beyond the ring of guys surrounding me. Something tells me that things were going wrong... that I needed to get out. Just then, I felt a ray of hope. I saw my colleague and I lunged out, grabbing her arm for help. She got me away from her friends and led me to a seat, but I was fast losing control of my limbs, going limp. I thought she asked me if I wanted to throw up and I didnÂ’t answer. I simply threw up into the empty jug.<br><br>My consciousness was slipping away when I felt strong, stout arms support me as I got up from the seat. My colleagueÂ’s boyfriend or something, I thought vaguely, seeming to recognize a voice, asking if I could try to walk. I attempted a nod, and he helped me on my feet. Stumbling, I followed him out of the club to the car where the rest of my colleagues were waiting.<br><br>I sat down in the backseat and as I leaned back, I blacked outÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Epi 16...<br><br>**********************************************************<br>Pale blue eyeshadow, mascara on the lashes, rouged cheeks and glossy lips. A short halter top and tight black pants. Satisfied with my reflection, I put on my 3-inch platforms and went out of the house. I could hear my momÂ’s nagging faintly in the background as I shut the door behind me.<br><br>Ever since I graduated and moved home, IÂ’ve never had a moment of peace with my mom constantly nagging in my ear. I know she didnÂ’t like Terence but who ever said that I was going to marry him or that heÂ’s the one guy IÂ’ll see ever after? We are just datingÂ… or ratherÂ… IÂ’m just hanging out with him because IÂ’m bored.<br><br>As I got into TerenceÂ’s car, I started smsing my girl pals who are meeting me for clubbing at Mohammad Sultan Road.<br><br>[On my way now. Where are you gals?] I keyed<br><br>[Inside MW already. Waiting for you. Better hurry cos lots of ppl here already.] Rita replied.<br><br>I deleted the message and urged Terence to drive a little faster.<br><br>*********************<br><br>Stepping out of the car park, I was instantly aware of the many pairs of eyes looking at me. It didnÂ’t bother me for this is not the first time. I walked ahead, not waiting for Terence, and went up the steps into Madam Wong, ignoring the whistles and lame pick-up lines some losers gave as I walked past them.<br><br>I saw the girls standing together at the bar counter right at the end of the club, near the pool table, and I made my way there. I greeted them happily and we exchanged hugs.<br><br>Â“Wah liowÂ… I havenÂ’t seen you for some time and look at how youÂ’ve changed!Â” Evila exclaimed.<br><br>I gave a wry smile and hugged her back.<br><br>Â“See I told you and you didnÂ’t believe me.Â” Rita said. She had met Evila on a previous occasion and told her how much I have changed.<br><br>Â“Yah now I seeÂ… complete AH-LIAN!!!Â” Evila said and I laughed along. Looking at Terence walking in behind me, she got even more tickled. Â“And going out with an Ah-beng! Wah liow!!Â”<br><br>I know IÂ’ve changed. In fact, the changing process was so gradual that I hardly noticed it, until Evila mentioned it just now. Months after my breakup with Ran, I went to the salon and chopped my hair as short as it could be. For a moment, the hairdresser thought I wanted a crew cut but that would have been extreme. I started hanging out more often tooÂ… clubbing, drinkingÂ… occasionally social-smoking. Next came the clothes and the make-up when I started earning my own keep.<br><br>But I know I still had one foot anchored on the ground somehow. I learned my lesson well from that drunken episode for if not for my colleagueÂ’s boyfriend who rescued me, I would have been a gone case. All the make-up I have and the clothes that I wearÂ… they may be fashionable now but I know deep down hidden in a corner in my heart, I didnÂ’t make these changes because I wanted to be fashionable, clueless or havoc. I made them because I didnÂ’t want to be myself. Why else would I hang out with someone like Terence?<br><br>I know Evila had lots more to ask but there was no opportunity for that. The music turned up a notch as the DJ started the dance music for the night. I ordered a drink and took a sip. As I turned around to look at the rest of the club, I smelled a whiff of a familiar perfume. Eternity. I looked towards that direction and who should I seeÂ… Ran.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 17<br><br>*********************************************<br><br>I rushed out of the cab and walked briskly through the aisles. Clarke Quay is not a place to visit on a weekend for it was so packed! I could barely walk three steps before having to halt my steps to give way to some kid dashing around or someone walking without looking. As I approached the taxi stand, Evila saw me and waved to me.<br><br>Â“AlloÂ… sorry IÂ’m late. LetÂ’s go get something to bite. What do you feel like having for dinner?Â”<br><br>Â“ArroÂ… shall we go to there?Â” Evila pointed at the nearby foodcourt.<br><br>We found a table at the foodcourt and took our turns to get food. The queues were relatively short and we got our food quickly and settled down.<br><br>Â“So how have you been?Â” Evila asked. I looked at her blankly for I thought IÂ’ve answered the same question when we met for clubbing the other day.<br><br>Seeing my expression, Evila shook her head laughing and said, Â“Ok ok, actually I asked you out today because I wanted to talk to you about something.Â”<br><br>I waited. She looked at me hesitantly before she continued.<br><br>Â“What do you think of Ran?Â”<br><br>Huh? I havenÂ’t seen him for 2 years and only saw him the nite at the club and sheÂ’s asking me about Ran?<br><br>Â“WellÂ… heÂ’s actually a nice guy, fun to hang out with and not bad looking. Though he and I found out the hard way that we are better off as friends.Â” I said matter-of-factly.<br><br>Â“But do you blame him for what happened last time? What will you do or how would you feel if heÂ’s got a girlfriend now?Â”<br><br>I shrugged and said Â“Everyone has to move on whatÂ… I also have a boyfriend at the moment. Guess at that time, we just didnÂ’t know how to handle a relationship wellÂ… I donÂ’t really blame him I guess.Â”<br><br>With that, I turned and looked at her. Something is going on and I wonder at her sudden curiosity about Ran.<br><br>Â“Why are you asking all these?Â” I asked. As she began to look sheepish, a sudden hunch dawned upon me. Â“DonÂ’t tell me you like him?? Issit? Issit?Â” I pursued, a gleeful smile on my face.<br><br>Â“Actually IÂ’ve been keeping in touch with Ran since half a year ago and he has been joining my group of friends for clubbing. A couple of months ago, we went to JB together, the whole group of us, and it was during one night when they were drinking late in my room that he said something. I didnÂ’t know the full details because I was in the shower then, but my friends told me that they were playing Truth or DareÂ… and that Ran said he likes meÂ…Â”<br><br>Suddenly I could feel a cold heavy pressure descending on me. I felt uncomfortable at that thought but I couldnÂ’t pinpoint what it was about.<br><br>Â“And what about you? Do you like him?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know. Like you, IÂ’ve known him since uni days and yah, heÂ’s fun and friendly all that. HeÂ’s even cute I think. But somehow heÂ’s not my typeÂ… then again, IÂ’ve been single for so long. Almost two years alreadyÂ… and I guess deep inside IÂ’m eager to have a relationship againÂ…Â”<br><br>I didnÂ’t know what to sayÂ… I made up something about so long as sheÂ’s happy, she should go with her gutÂ… but nothing really registers on my mind.<br><br>I stood quietly at the taxi stand for a long time after Evila has left and as I got into the cab, I suddenly remembered the first time Ran made a move on me when we were back in uni 2 years ago. Suddenly, the cause of my weird feelings and reactions to what Evila has said hit me. I still love Ran! Somehow it was easier to accept someone else liking him or admiring him from far but I couldnÂ’t deal with the idea that heÂ’s giving his affections and attentions to someone else. I was jealous. And selfish. I wanted him to regret letting me goÂ… and I wanted him to want me backÂ…<br><br>As the memories of our relationship came back to my mind, my tears began to rollÂ… once againÂ…<br></div>

It was Ran.<br><br>Â“HalloÂ… yup. WhatÂ’s up?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“Nothing muchÂ… just bored and wondering what will you be doing tonight,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“OhÂ… IÂ’m meeting Clare and Jo for some dinner and then after that we are probably going clubbing. You want to join us?Â” I asked generously. This is what being normal friends is about, isnÂ’t it? I hoped furiously I wasnÂ’t sending the wrong signals for he is EvilaÂ’s now.<br><br>EvilaÂ… that suddenly jotted my mind.<br><br>Â“EhÂ… thought you usually hang out with Evila?Â” I asked before he could say anything else.<br><br>Â“Huh? No lahÂ… we are just friends and we had some mutual friends, thatÂ’s all.Â”<br><br>Â“OrhÂ…Â” I said, not sure what to say next.<br><br>Â“What time are you all meeting? Am I going to be the only guy there?Â” He asked<br><br>Â“NahÂ… ClareÂ’s bringing a guy friend too. WeÂ’re meeting at 7 pm at MarcheÂ’s. IÂ’m leaving the house already so if youÂ’re joining us, sms me ok?Â”<br><br>***************<br><br>The phone rang again. I answered the call and struggled to hear clearly despite the noisy rumble of the MRT train.<br><br>Â“Hallo, Where are you? What are you doing?Â” A rude male voice asked before I could greet the caller. Terence. Somehow IÂ’ve been forgetting to spend time with him lately.<br><br>Â“AlloÂ… IÂ’m meeting the girls for dinner and then clubbing.Â” I said, not volunteering any more information.<br><br>Â“How come you didnÂ’t tell me?Â” he questioned.<br><br>I got pissed. I just didnÂ’t feel like hearing his voice anymore. Trying to control myself, I thought of what to say.<br><br>Â“Oi! I asked you how come you didnÂ’t tell me? You purposely donÂ’t want to tell me because you want to go and hook guys right? You think I donÂ’t knowÂ…Â” he demanded.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s a girlsÂ’ night out and youÂ’re not a girl!Â” I retorted and hung up. I canÂ’t stand this verbal abuse anymore.  Not only does he not respect me in public, nor does he respect my thoughts and much less my feelings. He treats me like a vase to show off to his friends but brushes me off when I speak even when I know I was right. He chit chats in the middle of his friendÂ’s solemnization ceremony and never considered himself rude barging loudly into a conversation where he was not invited. He thinks its ok for him to have the hots for some young Â‘ah-lianÂ” chick but IÂ’m to report every minute I spend with my own friends? In the first place, we are just hanging out with each other for the time being so who gave him the right to be possessive and controlling over my life?<br><br>Suddenly I felt that I had enough of the Â“Ah-bengÂ” brute that IÂ’ve been hanging out with. What have I been doing for the past year, hanging around losers and bullies like that? Why have I been degrading myself and behaving like some airhead bimbo? Disgusted with myself, I rejected the call when Terence called again...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 19...<br>**********************************<br><br>Marche was crowded and it took us some time to get to our table. Clare and her boyfriend, Art, went ahead to get some food while I chatted with Jo and waited for Ran to join us. He hasnÂ’t showed up yet even though he said heÂ’ll be joining us.<br><br>Â“You knowÂ… we are afterall still friends, but there is nothing going on between us lahÂ…Â” I said when Jo asked me about my meeting up with Ran again.<br><br>Something felt wrong in that statement. It was as though I wished it wasnÂ’t true. Jo simply looked at me and I thought for a moment that she could read my mind. Just then, Clare and Art came back. And Ran came to the table behind them.<br><br>I thought I saw a quizzical look on ArtÂ’s face but I chose to ignore it. Who cares, even if he were a good friend of TerenceÂ’s? I certainly donÂ’t. I made the necessary introductions and went ahead to get my food.<br><br>Dinner was fun as we got the ice broken and there were jokes and laughter all round. Some time passed before I realized that Ran sat closer and had drapped his arm over the back of my chair. The company was so comfortable that Terence was the furthest thing on my mind.<br><br>Â“So is there a chance that you might get back with Ran?Â” Clare asked when we were in the ladies.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t think so. I think Evila likes himÂ…Â” I shrugged, sounding just a teeny bit disappointed.<br><br>Â“But I think he likes you still. Look at the two of youÂ… so natural together that if we didnÂ’t know what happened, we would have thought you were a couple!Â” Jo exclaimed.<br><br>I looked at them in disbelief. And somewhere in my heart, I could feel the emotions rising, yearning for what I hear to become reality.<br><br>*********************<br>I had a terrible day at work and just couldnÂ’t wait to throw myself down on the bed when I reached home. Just then, my handphone rang and I rummaged through my bag to dig out the dastard gadget.<br><br>Â“Want to go Bintan?Â” Clare chirped over the phone.<br><br>Â“Huh? Why the sudden urge to go Bintan?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“Oh, Art has got this really good offer of a 3-day-2-night stay at Bintan, for $58 per person only. So IÂ’m asking whether you want to go with us?Â”<br><br>Â“Go with you? IÂ’ll be the biggest lamppost on the island!Â” I laughed.<br><br>Â“Of course not! Just Art and me will not be as fun. Get someone to come along with you lahÂ…Â” She let the sentence hang but I understood her meaning fully.<br><br>Â“You know I donÂ’t feel like asking Terence to go right?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“ErrÂ… Yah.Â” She confirmed.<br><br>Â“Then who do you suggest I get? ThereÂ’s no one else!Â” I said.<br><br>Â“ErrÂ… you can ask RanÂ…?Â”<br><br>I didnÂ’t say a word. That thought had never struck me but suddenly, it didnÂ’t seem like a bad idea at all.<br><br>Â“So how?? Are you coming with us?Â” Clare persisted.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ll think about it and let you know tomorrow.Â” I said. I wanted to get out of the conversation quickly. I shouldnÂ’t even be thinking about it but the idea was attractive. And disturbing. That I would be so easily swayed and unfaithfulÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 20<br><br>**************************************<br>The room had only one bedÂ… one queen-sized bed. I knew this was going to happen and I knew I told a lie to get Terence off my back so that I could come to Bintan with Ran instead. The moment we stepped into the room was rather awkward but Ran broke the silence by marching into the room, drawing the curtains open to admire the view.<br><br>And a pretty good view too. Gradually, we settled down and started unpacking our bags. Clare and Art are just next door and we are supposed to meet them at the pool in 10 minutes.<br><br>Just after we got changed, there was a knock on the door.<br><br>Â“Hey, we want to go jet skiing. Want to come? ItÂ’s $80 per ski though.Â” Clare asked enthusiastically.<br><br>I wasnÂ’t exactly for the idea of jet skiing. Being not a very good swimmer myself, IÂ’ve always been afraid of the sea. Not to mention trying to drive a jet ski myself. Ran didnÂ’t look enthusiastic about the idea either. We looked at each other and shook our heads.<br><br>Â“NahÂ… weÂ’ll just go to the pool for a swim. You two go ahead.Â”<br><br>Â“OrhÂ… ok then. See you later!Â” Clare chirped as she went off.<br><br>*************************<br>One can only swim so many hours and after a couple of hours in the chlorine-saturated water, we felt tired and decided to go to the room for a rest. The notion of sleeping on the same bed was awkward enough and Ran suggested playing a card game as he was too energetic still.<br><br>Â“Hey thatÂ’s cheating,Â” I laughed as I accused him, halfway through the game.<br><br>Â“Oh yeah? Take that!Â” Ran said with mischief in his eyes as he threw a pillow at me. The fight was on. I grabbed the nearest pillow I could get and started to wham him any way I could. He, being taller and stronger had a natural advantage and so I resorted to running to the closet to get the extra pillows as ammunition.<br><br>As I piled the pillows on him, it became a wrestling match. I was trying to keep him buried under the pillows and suddenly, he threw me off and held me down by both my hands. I struggled to get free but couldnÂ’t.<br><br>Just as I was trying to catch my breath, Ran leaned down and kissed me on my lips. I was stunned at first but my heart got the better of me and I started to kiss him back.<br><br>Â“Why does this have to happen only now? Why did he dump me and now heÂ’s doing it all over again?Â” These thoughts kept running in the back of my mind and my tears began to fall down my face.<br><br>I broke the kiss and started sobbing into his shoulders.<br><br>"Why... why now?" I asked.<br><br>Ran leaned on his side and looked at me apologetically.<br><br>"I'm sorry... I've wanted to control myself but I just couldn't hold it back anymore. Do you know that the month right after I broke up with you, I actually regretted and wanted to make it up to you? But by then you already had someone else... or at least I thought you did," Ran said.<br><br>I looked at him through my teary eyes and said: "What? No I did not. Why didn't you tell me then?"<br><br>"I wanted to when I saw you at the train station the other time, but the minute I turned around, you were gone. Then when I saw you again at Zouk, I wanted to talk to you about it but I couldn't find you in that crowded place. By the time I did, I saw you walking out holding some guy's hand. I thought you were seeing someone else and didn't dare to approach you..."<br><br>I searched my memory for the time frame and it hit me that he saw me being led out by my colleague's boyfriend when I was drunk and nearly got into trouble. I explained everything to Ran and when I finished, the look of anguish and regret on his face was unmistakeable.<br><br>"I thought you liked Evila? That was what you told her friends when you went on a trip to JB recently, wasn't it?" I asked, suddenly thinking of Evila's words.<br><br>"She was the only one out of the whole clique I bumped into since everyone else graduated and so we kept in touch and knew a few mutual friends. And when I told her friends that, it was actually in the context that I like her as a friend... plus I was in the shower and they held my clothes ransom unless I give them a satisfactory answer. At first I thought I liked her too, but eventually I realised that my heart was still with you. I was looking for a shadow of you and she reminded me of you..."<br><br>At that, fresh tears fell and I couldn't control myself anymore. Heck Terence. I still love Ran. Ran held me in his arms and comforted me as I cried my heart out ...<br><br></div>
