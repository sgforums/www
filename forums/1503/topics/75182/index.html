            <div class='col-md body'>allo folks... here's a new story I'm writing... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Feel free to comment, or feedback ok??<br><br>Just realised I missed something important....<br><br><strong> Disclaimer: The story below is purely fiction. Any similarities with names, characters, nicks are purely coincidental. </strong><br><br>hehehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>**************************************************************************<br><strong>Love Story</strong><br><br>Potato chips, coffee, breadÂ…. HmmÂ… what did I miss out? Walking down the aisles in the supermarket, I mentally ran through my shopping list again.<br><br>Â“Meeeooow!!!Â” I blushed to the ends of my earlobes at the sound of that. Why must Tin call me that in public? When I first started that nick, it was meant for use only on the Vax Notes Conference. Never did I expect to meet up with the people in Vax Notes for real and now they remember my nick better than my name!<br><br>I turned around and saw Tin and Kiat smiling and waving at me.<br><br>Â“HarroÂ… Â“ I greeted them, not looking too enthusiastic about the embarrassment they just subjected me to. CanÂ’t they see the housewives and aunties all turning and looking at me? GrrÂ….<br><br>Â“What you doing here? Shopping for groceries ah?Â” Tin asked.<br><br>Â“Yah lorÂ… ran out of food in my room. You guys leh?Â”<br><br>Â“We just had dinner with some of the restÂ… AD, .leopard, Ah Leong and Ran. WeÂ’re about to go back soon.Â”<br><br>Â“Oh okÂ… You guys go ahead. I still need to shop around somemore.Â” I said and waved goodbye at the same time.<br><br>Turning around, I continued walking through the aisles, running through my memorized shopping list again.<br><br>*****************<br><br>Lugging my shopping bags and my books, I was practically starring into space and mumbling to myself as I walked to the bus queue at the interchange. I looked at the almost empty queue in dismay as that meant 199 bus had just left the interchange and I had to wait 20 minutes for the next bus to get back to campus.<br><br>Â“Oui Meow!Â” Kiat called out from the queue. She was grinning from ear to ear and happily telling some guys in the queue that IÂ’m Â“the MeowÂ” in Vax Notes.<br><br>Â“Harro againÂ… eh? You guys are still here? Thought you left earlier?Â” I asked<br><br>Â“Yah lahÂ… but we still missed the bus. Oh by the way, you know the rest?Â” she asked, pointing at the guys standing beside Tin.<br><br>I looked through the faces and spotted one bespectacled guy that I couldnÂ’t put a name to. Standing up, he was as tall as Ah Leong, but skinnier and has pretty small eyes and a ready smile. In my heart, I thought he must be one of the Chinese students in campus. I pointed to him and shook my head, indicating that I donÂ’t know him.<br><br>Â“OrhÂ… that is Ran lor.Â” Kiat said cheerfully.<br><br>Â“Oh okÂ… harro Ran.Â” I said, distractedly as the 199 bus approaches the bus bay. I didn't even notice that he was waving hi to me...Boarding the bus with the rest, I took a seat next to Tin and started yakking about the lesson earlier this morning.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Epi 2<br>***********************************************<br><br>The Vax Notes screen blinked in front of me. While Dr Lee continued to drone on with his boring lesson on how to use Microsoft Word, I started to scan through the topics to see what the latest unread posts are.<br><br>Â‘Tonite Mambo Jambo?Â’ Kiat asked in one of the threads.<br><br>Deftly my fingers flew over the keyboard as I joined in the others in replying to her post.<br><br>Meow: Â‘Who is going?Â’<br>Kiat: Â‘Evila, myself, Ran, Praetor, GreyÂ… but we meeting for dinner first.Â’<br>Meow: Â‘ok. What time?Â’<br>Kiat: Â‘Praetor driving. We pick you up at your hall at 6 pm.Â’<br>Meow: Â‘ok lorÂ… see you.Â’<br><br>Â“And now you try doing the assignment in the text book.Â” Dr Lee said at the end of his monotonous droning. Seeing that heÂ’s walking this way, I quickly pressed Alt-tab and switched my screen to the harmless, innocent white screen of Microsoft WordÂ…<br><br>*************<br><br>At the appointed time, Praetor showed up in his momÂ’s new car, a silver Ford Laser and gave me a toothy grin.<br><br>Â“Arro, ready to go?Â” he asked.<br><br>Â“Yup!Â” I answered chirpily and hopped into the car. Ran and Grey were already in the car.<br><br>Â“So whereÂ’s Kiat and Evila?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“Oh, Kiat made a last minute change of mind and decided not to go. Evila has got something on and will join us in a while.Â” Praetor replied. Ran sort of snorted at Praetor's remark on Kiat and had a weird sarcastic expression on his face.<br><br>Â“So are we going straight there?Â”<br><br>Â“Nope, we have to drop by my place first,Â” Praetor said. Â“IÂ’ve got to go home and take a shower and I ran out of clothes in the hall.Â”<br><br>Â“What? All of us are going to your place to wait for you shower?Â” Ran asked.<br><br>Â“Oh come onÂ… itÂ’s going to be fast.Â” Saying that, Praetor drove away from the hall, with the rest of us rolling our eyes at himÂ….<br><br>It was a short wait indeed for Praetor to get a shower and get changed. On the other hand, waiting for Evila seemed like forever. And throughout the wait, Grey kept asking whether we are sure we wanted to go Mambo.<br><br>Â“I really donÂ’t feel like going Mambo lah. IÂ’ll join you guys for the dinner but you guys go ahead to Zouk after that lah.Â” Grey insisted.<br><br>Â“HuhÂ… we waited so long already then you say you donÂ’t want to join us for Mambo.Â” I asked.<br><br>At this point, Evila arrived and on hearing that Grey is not going to Mambo, she announced that she lost the mood too.<br><br>Â“Wah liowÂ… like that not fun already. I also donÂ’t feel like goingÂ…Â” Evila complained.<br><br>Â“You still have Praetor, Ran and Meow mahÂ… Â“ Grey argued.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s not the same lahÂ… the more people the more fun it is,Â” Evila insisted.  Â“Besides IÂ’ve never seen you dance. I want to see you dance! Hahaha!Â” She laughed.<br><br>Ran kept shaking his head and I was about to throw my hands up and give up when it looked like they can go on the whole night trying to out-persuade each other.<br><br>Â“Ok okÂ… letÂ’s go for dinner first. WeÂ’ll decide on this later ok?Â” Praetor suggested.<br><br>The thought of food filling our hungry stomachs won our votes and we proceeded to dinnerÂ…</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Epi 3<br>****************************************<br><br>Â“Cheers!!Â” we shouted and put our heads together to drink from the second jug of Long Island Tea. Music booming in the background, we swayed to the beat and lifted our hands in the air as we enjoyed the dance. This was our first night out clubbing togetherÂ… even though some of us had always been regular clubbers. Even Grey, who finally relented and joined us despite his many protests, was beginning to shuffle from side to side according to the beat of the musicÂ… that is until Evila teased him about his dancing.<br><br>And the other person that surprised me was RanÂ… I thought he was one of the Chinese scholars but to my surprise, heÂ’s a local and he spoke excellent English. When I confessed what my first impression of him was, he reacted with such exaggerated incredulity that I couldnÂ’t stop laughing. He is really a funny guy and great to hang out with.<br><br>Hey wait a minuteÂ… what was I thinking? IÂ’m actually enjoying myself when IÂ’m out partying without my boyfriendÂ’s knowledge? The thought distracted me for the rest of the night that I didnÂ’t even realize the lights coming on.<br><br>Â“Hey, whatÂ’s next? IÂ’m still too awake to sleepÂ…Â” Evila said.<br><br>Â“Huh? What? OhÂ… up to you guys. IÂ’m not tired eitherÂ… so IÂ’m ok.Â” I said.<br><br>Â“Want to come over my hostel room? Think I got some food left if anyone is hungryÂ… and some more drinks alsoÂ…Â” She suggested.<br><br>Drinks. That was the magic word that got everyone to agree to it and despite it being 4 am in the morning, we were still wide awake when we reached and started laying out the chips, drinks and playing cards.<br><br>Â“Oh sh|t! IÂ’ve still got lab in the morning, I just remembered!Â” Ran said, in the middle of a card game.<br><br>Â“Now then you remembered?Â” I teased. Â“So is that a good excuse to skip class?Â”<br><br>Â“No wayÂ… I need to get some sleepÂ… but IÂ’m too tired to walkÂ… AiyahÂ… think IÂ’ll just grab a few winks here before going for lab.Â” He smiled and continued playing the last couple of rounds to the game.<br><br>Time passed and one by one, the rest of the gang took up positions all over the floor and went to sleep. Even Evila, who sat next to Grey for most of the night and bugged him with her teases and questions, eventually got tired and gave up, leaving me, and Grey wide awake and still playing cards. Bored with the game, we put down the cards and began talking about Tarot Cards. Suddenly, a leg kicked against the bed boards and made a loud bang, making us jump in our skins.<br><br>Â“What was that??Â” I asked. Turning around, we saw that it was Praetor who had turned in his sleep and had kicked the bed accidentally. Leaning closer, we realized that he was actually talking in his sleep!<br><br>As one, both of us started laughing and Praetor woke from his snooze, only to be laughed at even more and told of his embarrassing sleep-talk. He rolled his eyes at us and in an effort to deflect the jokes pointed at him, he started to suggest that the others who were asleep had funny habits too.<br><br>Intrigued, I took a closer look at Ran, who at this time was sound asleep. He seemed pretty normalÂ… exceptÂ… he was smiling in his sleep! Like a little boy dreaming of candy, his lips were curved in a boyish smile though he was out like a log! Not wanting to awake the poor chap who still has to go through lessons in the morning, I kept that secret to myselfÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Epi 4<br>**********************************************<br><br>Shuffling through the crowd, with my mind in a daze, I yawned for the third time since I alighted from the MRT.<br><br>Â“YouÂ’re late!Â” Bill complained. An annoyed look fell across his face as he noticed how tired I was. Â“Overslept again right? Must have been partying again lah.Â”<br><br>I grimaced under my breath. Inside, I was feeling my anger beginning to simmer. CanÂ’t I even meet my own friends and go clubbing with them in my own time?<br><br>Â“You ahÂ… always want to go clubbing. Then end up being so tired the next day when you meet me.Â” Bill continued his torrent.<br><br>At this point, the crowd at the MRT station was starting to get to me. And BillÂ’s relentless nagging didnÂ’t help.<br><br>Mistaking my annoyance for nonchalance, Bill continued: Â“Ask you to come out, you always sound and look so tired and sian. Your friends ask you to go clubbing, youÂ’re so willing to go. IÂ’m your boyfriend leh...Â”<br><br>Â“Then all the more you should spare some thought for me instead of buying movie tickets for shows that start so early in the day!Â” I snapped.<br><br>I couldnÂ’t take it anymore. Ever since Bill graduated and started working, he had been becoming unreasonable, expecting me to stay in my hostel room the whole day waiting for his call instead of participating in ECA. And ever since he knew I hang out with the Vaxers, he had been buying movie tickets for the morning shows instead of evening shows, so that he can tell me off everytime I appear tired. Of course I am tired. Who doesnÂ’t look or feel tired having partied till 3 am in the morning and had to wake up at 9 am so that she can watch a movie at 10 am?<br><br>Â“IÂ’m your boyfriend ok, and I deserve some respect from you!Â” Bill argued.<br><br>Â“Yah! ItÂ’s precisely because you are my boyfriend thatÂ’s why I made the effort to come out for a movie instead of catching up on my sleep. ItÂ’s because you wanted to watch it and IÂ’m actually sacrificing my sleep and energy because I wanted to accompany you no matter how tired I am! Saturdays are our movie days so I make sure I keep to it. But Fridays are the days I meet my own group of friends and maintain that relationship with them. Otherwise, I would not have any friends left sooner or later!Â” I tried to reason with him and make my point.<br><br>Â“What is the meaning of that? Do you think IÂ’ll be happy that you dragged yourself out of bed and half the time weÂ’re together youÂ’re so sleepy and tired? You know IÂ’m working and Saturdays are the days we can spend more time together and you go and party and drink until drunk on Friday night. And your friends? Are you sure you only want to hang out with your friends? Not a certain guy?!Â” Bill continued to argue.<br><br>I looked at him and suddenly I felt so defeated, so strangled, tired and exasperated that I didnÂ’t want to fight to survive anymore. Not wanting to argue anymore and too tired to be bothered, I just shook my head and began walking in the direction of the cinema.<br><br>Â“Hey, IÂ’m asking you Â– what do you want?Â” Bill insisted.<br><br>Â“Forget it! I just want to watch the show now.Â” I said, and continued walking to the cinema. Deep inside my mind, I started wondering why our relationship had gotten so badÂ… was it Bill that became impossible? Or was it meÂ…?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Epi 5<br>**************************************************<br><br>Â“Hey Meow, you want to go Hall 1 for dinner with us?Â” Evila called to me across the corridor.<br><br>Â“Mmm.. actually I donÂ’t feel that hungry leh.Â” I said.<br><br>Â“Join us lahÂ…. Grey and Ran are coming also.Â” She persuaded.<br><br>At her insistence I agreed. Picking up my wallet and pager, I walked to Hall 1 with Evila. As we reached the canteen, we saw that the guys were already seated at a table and talking animatedly amongst themselves.<br><br>Grey and Ran waved at us when they saw us approaching, and Evila ever so naturally slipped into the seat next to Grey. A knowing smile showed on RanÂ’s face and he began to look at Evila with a teasing look on his face.<br><br>Either I was truly blind or plain distracted but I couldnÂ’t understand what was going on. Ran practically had to drag me off the seat to go order food.<br><br>Â“What was that all about?Â” I bugged Ran as we moved towards the queue.<br>Â“You mean you donÂ’t know?Â” He asked incredulously, lips breaking into an irresistible smile.<br><br>Â“What? Know what?Â” I continued asking.<br><br>Â“Evila likes Grey lah! Thought everyone in the gang knew about it liow.Â” He said.<br><br>Oh!! I felt stupid for not realizing how Evila was always asking about Grey, why she loses her mood when he doesnÂ’t join our gatherings and other outings. And as I began queuing up at the chicken rice stall, my thoughts turned to horror as I began to imagine the whole gang knowing some secret crush of mineÂ…<br><br>Â“YouÂ’re eating chicken rice?Â” Ran asked me from behind.<br><br>Â“YahÂ… whatÂ’s wrong with that?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“YouÂ’ve been coughing and you still want to eat chicken rice? ItÂ’ll make it worse.Â” He said.<br><br>Dumbfounded, I didnÂ’t know what to say. This is something I didnÂ’t expect from Ran and it wasÂ… wellÂ… sweet. Sweet of him to be so observant and caring about a friendÂ’s healthÂ… Somehow, not sure whether itÂ’s his expression of concern or just that I didnÂ’t know how else to react, I obediently changed my mind and decided to order something elseÂ… Bill will never notice thatÂ… I thought.<br></div>
