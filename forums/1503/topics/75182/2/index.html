            <div class='col-md body'>epi 6... somehow I have a feeling some people will feel strongly abt this epi... kekeke<br>**************************************************************<br><br>I looked around distractedly and saw Bill looking at me from where he was queuing in front of the fast food counter. ItÂ’s just so hard to concentrate when IÂ’m trying to cram for exams and heÂ’s there always asking me what do I want to drink, eatÂ…. I turned up the volume of my CD walkman, plugged in my earphones and turned to my notes.<br><br>Bill set down the tray of food and motioned for me to take my tea. As I drank the tea, my hand grabbed a pen and started doodling distractedly. Bill looked at my doodle and took the sheet of notes from underneath my pen. Displeasure crossed his face and it was only when he turned the paper back towards me then I realized what IÂ’ve drawn.<br><br>A faceÂ… with a huge grin, small eyes, messy hairÂ…it wasnÂ’t much of a doodle but that square chin I drew told me who I was drawing.<br><br>Â“SighÂ… What are you doing?Â” Bill questioned me.<br><br>Â“NothingÂ… I was just distracted and started drawing people lorÂ…Â” I tried to keep it light but realizing I drew Ran suddenly made me feel so guilty I couldnÂ’t look Bill in the eyes.<br><br>Sadness appeared in his eyes but Bill dismissed it with a deep sigh and not saying anymore. After the meal, it was obvious that I couldnÂ’t concentrate any more and I just wanted to go back to my hostel room.<br><br>***********************<br><br>Bill hung around a little longer after I got back to my room. He just sat there on the bed looking at me and I still couldnÂ’t face him without that guilty blush on my face.<br><br>Â“DearÂ… why donÂ’t we go get a date at the ROM and get registered?Â” Bill suddenly asked.<br><br>Â“What?!Â” my eyes widened, my face in shock. I couldnÂ’t react and I wasnÂ’t sure I heard right.<br><br>Â“YeahÂ… letÂ’s go get an appointment date at ROM and get registered first? We can have the ceremony after you graduated?Â” Bill repeated his question.<br><br>Â“Are you out of your mind?Â” I nearly yelled. Â“IÂ’m still studying, and I still have a loan to finance and IÂ’m not even 20 years old if you count by my birthdate!Â”<br><br>I was going wild and denial written all over my face. I didnÂ’t want to get married. I didnÂ’t want to get tied down yet, and worseÂ… I didnÂ’t want to spend the rest of my life with Bill. That thought struck meÂ… it was the first time after two years of relationship that I realized that Bill was the wrong guy.<br><br>Â“Ok okÂ… I understand. IÂ’m sorry I said it. I wonÂ’t force it on you again. Please sit down and calm down ok? WeÂ’re still together ok?Â” Bill appealed.<br><br>I took a deep breath and sat down beside him, allowing him to hold me in his arms. Bill hugged me tight and kissed me on the cheek as he repeated his apologies. Then something felt wrong and before I knew it, Bill forced me to lie down on my bed. In my ears, he said once again: Â“LetÂ’s go get a date next weekend ok?Â”<br><br>My walls of defenses sprung up and I pushed him away with all my might.<br><br>Â“HavenÂ’t you listened to what I said? HavenÂ’t you even spared a thought for how I felt? IÂ’m not ready to be married and I donÂ’t want to be married! And you had the audacity to force yourself on me?Â” I screamed.<br><br>Â“PleaseÂ… itÂ’s just getting registeredÂ…Â” He pleaded.<br><br>What did he take me for? In Singapore, once registered it means recognized as married by law! Did he think I was an idiot or what?<br>Â“Get outÂ…Â” I said, crying at the same time. Â“I think itÂ’s time we end this. ItÂ’s over. Please get out.Â”<br><br>I opened the door and pointed the way out. Hanging his head, Bill went awayÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 7<br>***********************************************************<br><br>The next few weeks passed in a blur. Somehow I pulled myself together and got through the exams unscathed. Bill called a couple of times but I made excuses to go out and cut the call short. He paged me and I didnÂ’t reply. Running away is not the way but I felt as if I didnÂ’t have any other choice.<br><br>A knock came on my hostel room door and I opened to see Bill standing outside. I breathed a deep sigh of resignation and asked him what he wanted.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m really sorry about what happenedÂ… Can I have another chance?Â” He asked, eyes pleading at me.<br><br>I shut my eyes, mustered what courage I had and forced myself to face reality. Â“Look Bill, IÂ’m sorry. All this happened because I realize now that I have been distracted. I was distracted by someone else and I still am. Though there is no guarantee in the person reciprocating to me, I canÂ’t just let myself go on leading you on. I think itÂ’s very unfair to you and IÂ’m really sorry. ItÂ’s my faultÂ… itÂ’s me, not you.Â”<br><br>Bill looked at me in silence. Sadness clouding his eyes.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m sorryÂ… but please let me go.Â” I asked him.<br><br>Bill mustered himself and tried to put on a brave front. Â“OkÂ… I guess thatÂ’s the way it has to beÂ… I only wanted you to be happy. And I hope youÂ’ll find happiness in himÂ…Â”<br><br>Hanging his head in resignation, he left.<br><br>When I closed the door, I thought I sensed a wave of relief wash over me. It was sad I had to put an end to the relationship but the relief I felt told me I did the right thing. Now is the time to move onÂ…<br><br>************<br><br>Â“TomorrowÂ’s SaturdayÂ… arenÂ’t you meeting your boyfriend?Â” Ran asked innocently as we walked towards my hall. He was walking me back because he wanted to borrow the next yearÂ’s subject timetable from me.<br><br>Â“NoÂ… IÂ’ve got no boyfriend anymore.Â” I said with a note of finality and gave him the bravest smile I could manage without breaking down. Though I was glad that relationship was over, it still tore me to pieces. Afterall, two years was not a short time either.<br><br>Â“What happened?Â” Ran asked.<br><br>I couldnÂ’t answer. I couldnÂ’t tell him that it was because of Ran that I got distracted so much that I wanted to end that relationship. It was not his fault. It was just my one-sided infatuation. I gave a nonchalant shrug and didnÂ’t say anything.<br><br>Â“I mean you two have been quite chummy and stable whatÂ… what happened?Â” Ran continued to ask. What made him so curious all of a sudden anyway?<br><br>Â“He tried to force me to marry him.Â” I finally said. That was the only excuse I could think of then to answer him, which was partly true. Â“Anyway, you so kaypo for what?Â” I teased and playfully messed his hair, so that he would stop asking.<br><br>Ran didnÂ’t ask anymore after that and we talked about practically anything under the sun till we got to my room.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 8<br>**************************************************************<br><br>Having my life to myself again took a lot of adjustment. For one, I had to find things to occupy my time since exams are over. I hung out more with Evila and her roommate Grassie, going to Mambo every week and finding things to do on weekends. As Ran and I were the only ones in the gang that stayed in hall throughout the holidays, there were days too that we met for dinner, and even an occasional movie, which gave me more opportunities to talk to him and spend time with him. I still havenÂ’t confessed my feelings for him but I was thankful for every chance I get to be in his companyÂ…even the times when he talked more about Kiat than anything else.<br><br>Â“I always hear you talking about KiatÂ… you like her ah?Â” I asked Ran one day.<br><br>Â“Kiat? That siow cha borÂ… no lah!Â” he denied. Â“Just that she stays in the block next to mine so I see her more oftenÂ… good griefÂ… IÂ’ll be crazy to be interested in her.Â”<br><br>I felt a kind of relief filling me up inside and before I knew it, curiosity got the better of me.<br><br>Â“SoÂ… whatÂ’s your type of girl? Anyone within the gang?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“Why are you asking this? You heard something issit?Â” He asked me back.<br><br>Â“No lahÂ… just wondering mahÂ…Â” I said. Shrugging his question off, I didnÂ’t insist on an answer. But deep inside me, I was hoping he would like me too.<br><br>I thought I had been rather obvious at times, despite my best efforts to mask my feelings. But somehow, RanÂ’s lack of response was getting to me. Is he at all aware of how I feel? If he is, does this mean I should give up.<br><br>Trying to take my mind off thinking such thoughts during my free time, I finally signed up for the Inter-Hall Games, playing Netball. And to my surprise, Ran was appointed overall in-charge for coordinating the Netball tournaments during the IHGs. It was a delight to see him every time we had a match and I often catch myself looking out for him, just to see his faceÂ…<br><br>*********************<br><br>Today is Christmas Eve and we had a match in the morning. As usual, when I saw Ran sitting on the floor at the side of the court at the end of the game, I teasingly ruffled his hair before I went off. And as usual, he didnÂ’t respond except to give me a friendly smileÂ… as always.<br><br>I walked from shop to shop, thinking about how disappointed and resigned I felt about not having a clue as to his feelings. And I noticed how frequently IÂ’ve been shopping on my own these daysÂ… it used to happen only when I was feeling down. As I walked past the hair salon, I caught my image in the mirror and my heart made a sudden resolution. I wanted to cut my waist-long hairÂ… cut it real short like never beforeÂ… and with it, cut away my remaining fantasies for RanÂ….<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 9....<br>***********************************************************<br><br>My pager was buzzing non-stop while the hair stylist was still doing the finishing touches to my hair. Now, cut short into a boyish bob, and dyed reddish brown, I felt like a brand new person. Giving myself a smile in the mirror, I felt much better already.<br><br>Walking out of the mall, I located the nearest payphone and returned the page.<br><br>Â“ArroÂ…. Been trying to call you just now.Â” PraetorÂ’s face came on the other end of the line.<br><br>Â“Yah I got your page. What is it?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“You free tonight? We thinking of going out for dinner and probably countdown to Christmas somewhere.Â” He said.<br><br>Â“We? WhoÂ’s we?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“Me, Evila, Grassie, BabyBoyÂ… you want to join us? Unless you got plans that isÂ….Â” He said.<br><br>Â“NahÂ… not going home tonight anyway. What time are you all meeting?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“7 pm. Can you make it?Â” He asked. I looked at my watch. Oh my! ItÂ’s already 6.45 pm and there is no way I can make it back to meet them on time. After a short discussion, Praetor decided that it was best if I just waited for them to pick me up from the mall.<br><br>*****************<br><br>Praetor picked me up at the mall and we headed for town to have Korean BBQ buffet. Evila loved what I did to my hair though Grassie expressed her lament that my long hair was gone. Everyone wondered why I did it but they didnÂ’t probe when I just shrugged it off as an act of impulse.<br><br>At least I donÂ’t have to spend Christmas Eve alone... I was just thinking of that when I was seated at the table when who should walk in but Ran! Why didnÂ’t Praetor tell me Ran is coming?<br><br>Seeing me with my new hairdo, he stopped in his tracks and pointed at me, exclaiming, Â“What have you done to your hair?Â”<br><br>Surprised by his massive reaction, I said I simply cut it. He couldnÂ’t get himself to accept that he saw me with long hair in the morning and now itÂ’s gone. Luckily, BabyBoy, playful as he always is, distracted everyone with his crazy antics and stupid jokes.<br><br>After dinner, we retreated to a small pub for drinks and have our own countdown. Mambo was way too crowded and we had no choice but try one of the pubs along Boat Quay. It was a rather quiet pub, even though the DJ was trying his best to jam up the beat. Having a bigger group, we occupied and sort of monopolized the second floor, leaving the miserable third floor to the few guests that trickle in now and then.<br><br>Despite being in a quiet place, we made quite a party amongst ourselves, drinking and joking and creating quite a racket. At one point, BabyBoy wanted me to change places with him so that he could play a trick on Ran, who was seated beside me. As I got up to leave, Ran wrapped his arms around my waist and said Â“No, you stay here!Â” and jokingly warned BabyBoy off. As I sat down, Ran did something that took me totally off-guard. Did he just leaned over and sniffed my hair? Was this a joke?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 10...<br>*************************************************<br><br>The party was getting really rowdy. Almost everyone was half-drunk except for me and Evila. And since Ran pulled me back to the seat a few moments earlier, he has not let go of my waist. Occasionally when it seemed no one was watching, he would lean over and sniff my hair.<br><br>I didnÂ’t know what to make of all these. It felt so much like he was acting on his drunken instincts but yet I didnÂ’t push him awayÂ… because in my heart I still had those feelings for him that I tried so hard to forget today.<br><br>At that moment, everyoneÂ’s attention was drawn to PraetorÂ’s drunken antics on the other side of the table. Ran suddenly leaned over and gave me a kiss on my cheek. My eyes widened and I stopped in mid-laughter. Does that mean he likes me? Or is he just plain drunk. I turned around and looked at him, bewildered, and in response, he just gave me a big smile and tightened his arms around me for a second.<br><br>I never knew how it was to be torn between happiness and misery but now I do. I felt like jumping with joy that he kissed me, but at the same time I wanted to cry in agony because I thought he did it because he was drunk.<br><br>For the rest of the night I remained very subdued and didnÂ’t say much to the rest. Evila, seeing that I was abnormally quiet, asked if I was ok. I told her that IÂ’m simply tired and would like to go home and rest. At that, the rest of the guys began rallying the group to leave.<br><br>It turned out that the only people going back to the hall were Ran and me, and we ended up sharing a cab. We didnÂ’t speak much as we crossed the road on the overhead bridge but halfway across, Ran reached over and took my hand. I let him but I still didnÂ’t say anything because I really didnÂ’t know what was going on in his head.<br><br>We hailed a cab and got in. Just as I began to lean back on the seat, Ran had his arms around my waist again.<br><br>Â“YouÂ’re tired right? Sleep and IÂ’ll wake you when we reach.Â” Ran said gently.<br><br>I didnÂ’t respond, and I couldnÂ’t sleep. Not with him acting so out of normal around me. As I got lost in my thoughts, Ran leaned towards me and gave me a kiss on the cheek again. When I looked up at him, he took my chin and lifted my face towards him, kissing me on the lipsÂ…<br></div>
