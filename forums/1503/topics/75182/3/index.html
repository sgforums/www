            <div class='col-md body'>epi 11...<br>**************************************************<br><br>I liked watching Ran sleep. Eyes closed, looking so peaceful and the hint of a smile at the corners of his lips. As I looked at his sleeping face, I thought about his arms around me, the kisses in the cabÂ… it all seemed so surreal.<br><br>Â“Good morningÂ…Â” Ran opened his eyes and said to me.<br><br>Â“Good morning.Â” I said. Suddenly embarrassed, I didnÂ’t know what to say. I searched my mind and finally, I blurted the insistent question in my mind. Â“Why? Why me?Â”<br><br>Â“What do you mean why you?Â” He asked, sitting up to clear his mind from sleep.<br><br>Â“I mean, I thought you didnÂ’t realize I like you or you didnÂ’t like me. I had already made up my mind to give up yesterdayÂ…Â”<br><br>Ruffling my short hair, he looked at me and said, Â“You went to cut your hair because you were giving up?Â”<br><br>I nodded, not looking at him.<br><br>Â“SighÂ… why are you so hasty? You werenÂ’t exactly obscure in your liking for me, and I took some time to think about thingsÂ… about whether its appropriate for me to get attached now because IÂ’m running for Hall CouncilÂ… about you just having had a breakup recentlyÂ…and I just made up my mind and wanted to find an opportunity to tell youÂ… and then you cut your hair.Â”<br><br>Shaking his head, he broke into a little laugh. I didnÂ’t say anything. I looked down and let his words run through my mind, disbelieving that it was real. Ran put his arms around my shoulders and pulled me in for a hug.<br><br>Â“Look, I need to get back to my hall and take a shower before I go home. You are going home too, right? IÂ’ll meet you at the bus stop in an hour and weÂ’ll go together?Â” He said, giving me a tight reassuring hug at the same time.<br><br>Â“OkÂ… See you later.Â” I said.<br><br>Standing up, I opened the door and he left the room. I walked to my window and continued looking out, watching Ran as he walked towards his hall. All of a sudden, what I thought had been a foregone hope came true. Despite how good everything seems, I couldnÂ’t help the sense of misgiving in my heartÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 12<br>****************************************************<br><br>Ran and I started going out since Christmas and while he was busy most of the time with his hall activities, we had great times going for movies or simply spending time watching tv in the hall. Just the other day, more than a week ago, what was supposed to be a movie date turned out to be a movie gathering with the rest of his hall people. We saw Baz LuhrmannÂ’s Romeo + Juliet and Ran was so overwhelmed by the movie that he wanted to rip off the poster to put it in his room if possible.<br><br>I smiled to myself as I walked past the poster at the Cineplex. Just then, something caught my eye. Every couple who bought a pair of tickets had a free poster! If I could just get that poster for Ran, wouldnÂ’t that be a nice surprise!? Excited, I queued up and bought a ticket, and practically begged for a poster. The guy at the counter was real nice and gave me one though it was supposed to be free for every purchase of two tickets instead of one.<br><br>Happily, I took the poster to RanÂ’s hall. As I approached, I noticed that his room was dark. HeÂ’s not around, again. He has been so busy with his hall activities that he hardly had time for me. Not a single call for more than a week and I havenÂ’t seen him around either. Even when I paged, there was no answer. As I walked towards his door, his neighbour peeked out of the room next door and told me Ran went for a hall meeting. I thanked him and left a message for Ran with him, together with the poster and took a slow walk back to my hall, alone.<br><br>BabyBoy saw me as I climbed the stairs to my floor. He had been frequenting my hall pretty often ever since he started going out with Grassie.<br><br>Â“HellooooÂ…. Just came back from meeting Ran?Â” He asked innocently.<br><br>I shook my head with a slight smile on my face. Â“NahÂ… heÂ’s not around.Â”<br><br>Â“Where is he?Â” He asked.<br><br>I shrugged my shoulders and said: Â“I donÂ’t know. Meeting maybe?Â”<br><br>Â“What?Â” He exclaimed. Â“YouÂ’re his girlfriendÂ… how can you not know?Â”<br><br>Â“Hey I donÂ’t control every second of his life ok?Â” I retorted. I knew BabyBoy was just teasing but somehow, that question struck me at the heart and it really hurtÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry for the delay... was bz with exams and then after that came back to work with loads of backlog to clear.... anyway...<br><br>Epi 13<br>****************************************************<br><br>I sat at the table, staring into space while waiting for Evila and Grassie to get their food.<br><br>Â“Are you ok?Â” Evila asked. Â“You look kind of tired.Â”<br><br>I gave her a weak smile and nodded slightly. This is really one of the times when I felt that my skin was smiling but my spirit was in tears. And recently those times seemed to have grown in frequency.<br><br>Â“So how have you and Ran been?Â” Grassie asked. Â“I hardly see the two of you go out together or something.Â”<br><br>I shrugged as I replied: Â“WeÂ’re ok, I guess. HeÂ’s been very busy lah, with his hall activities and all that.Â”<br><br>I turned away and got up from my seat, making the excuse that itÂ’s my turn to get food. I didnÂ’t want them to see the sadness in my eyes and the tears threatening to flow.<br><br>It has been more than a month since I last spoke to Ran, much less met him. The only times I saw him was the glimpses I caught in the corridors as we walked from class to class. I called, I paged, I left messagesÂ… but out of ten times I paged, he probably called back only once. There were times when I felt that he was deliberately avoiding me, for what reason, I donÂ’t know. I even had to find out from his roommate whether he has gone home for the weekends instead of staying in the hall and I could only shrug and give the excuse that he is busy when other Vaxers asked me about his whereabouts. I simply didnÂ’t know and the two of us might as well have been strangers.<br><br>I ate my dinner quietly as Evila and Grassie discussed about their class projects and complained about their lecturers.<br><br>Back in my room, I switched on my tiny tv and stared at it. RanÂ’s favourite sitcom, Friends, was showing. The more I watched, the more I thought about the Â“honeymoon periodÂ” a couple of months ago when Ran would come over to my room to watch TV together and I got even more depressed. I thought about how thoughtful he was at first. He would wait for me for meals at the canteens, whether during lunch or dinner, and he would call to ask if IÂ’m going home that weekend for he would like to go back together. Even though he was busy with his hall promotions of ValentineÂ’s Day, he made the extra effort and delivered a rose and a glass jar of 365 paper cranes at midnight on ValentineÂ’s Day eve to my door. He folded those cranes himself, and I remembered that look in his eyes as he explained the number to me. 365 cranes, one for each day.<br><br>Finally, the tears that IÂ’ve been suppressing for months broke through the dam and flowedÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 14<br>****************************************<br><br>I put down the phone the umpteenth time. IÂ’ve been trying to contact Ran for days to no avail. He has been avoiding my calls and not returning any of my pages.<br><br>Depressed, I stumbled out of my room to the washroom. I could hardly tell the difference between day and night, and it has been days since I looked into the mirror at myself. I still wash up and shower as per normal but I just refrained from looking at my own reflection. I didnÂ’t want to see the tear-stained face, the puffy eyes that reminded me of the countless insomniac nights that I cried myself to sleep. For 2 whole months, I was a complete wreck.<br><br>After washing my face, I stumbled back into my room again and sat on the bed, starring at the phone. Determined for one last time, I called RanÂ’s home number. Finally, he picked up.<br><br>Â“I think we need to talkÂ… about us,Â” He said with a sigh.<br><br>Of course we need to talk! I thought. After weeks of disappearing acts that can beat even David CopperfieldÂ’s best magic tricks and a series of unreturned calls, what did he think I was calling him for!?!<br><br>Â“YupÂ… thatÂ’s what IÂ’ve been trying to call you about. What am I really to you?Â” I asked.<br><br>Silence greeted me on the other end of the line.<br><br>Â“Well, really we need to settle this eventually. What am I to you really? Am I your girlfriend? Or someone that you just want to spend the night with when you go out and party till you are drunk?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“You know youÂ’re not thatÂ…Â” he protested.<br><br>Â“How would I know since the only times IÂ’ve seen you the last couple of times were of the same circumstancesÂ… when you went out partying and came back to hall half-drunk!Â” I reasoned. Again, silence greeted my remark.<br><br>Determined to get the matter between us settled once and for all, I didnÂ’t let up.<br><br>Â“Do you have any idea how much you have neglected me for months? Do you know how much it hurts when as your girlfriend, I didnÂ’t even know what you are doing, what kind of stress or problems youÂ’re having, and even what youÂ’re busy with this whole time? And I had to hear everything from a classmate. Your hall-mate knows everything better than I do? Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?Â”<br><br>At this point, I couldnÂ’t speak anymore as all the pent up emotions of the last four months welled up inside me and my tears began to flow again.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m sorryÂ… I really amÂ…Â” he started hesitantly. Â“And in fact, the reason these few months I havenÂ’t been contacting you is because IÂ’ve also been thinkingÂ… I may not be ready for a relationshipÂ…Â”<br><br>At that point, I was thankful that I was speaking to him over the phone instead of face-to-face. I felt such a deep urge to wallop him there and then. Yet I know that he was the only guy I truly loved, that I could give up anything for and I did.<br><br>Â“If you were not sure, why did you start anything in the first place?Â” I replied, attempting to control my voice as I continued.<br><br>Â“You know my feelings for you were real. And you also know that because of my feelings for you, I gave up a steady relationship with Bill. And nevermind all that. Most of all, you knew that I was ok if you didnÂ’t start anything at all because I already prepared myself to give you up! I would have spared myself this misery now had you not started that Christmas night!Â”<br><br>My sobs broke whatever else I wanted to say and I couldnÂ’t continue again. Ran apologized and gave his reasons but I just failed to hear anything after that. I had no idea how long I cried but soon I had difficulty breathing and had to force myself to stop and gasp for breath.<br><br>Â“Are you going to be alright?Â” Ran asked.<br><br>Â“Whatever. IÂ’ll be fine.Â” I managed.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’re still going to be friendsÂ…Â” he tried to make it sound better.<br><br>Â“Whatever. I need to go. Whatever.Â” And I put the phone down. A split second later, the phone ended up at the other end of the room, after hitting against the wall.<br></div>
