            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Waiting</strong><br><br>The breeze blew gently across the park, caressing her pale, smooth cheeks as it passed her by. Her long, slender fingers reached up and drew her soft, silky black hair behind her ears. A little sigh escaped on her breath as she looked up from her book. The corners of her tender lips curved as she smiled to herself.<br><br>The afternoon sun played a game of shadows with the rustling leaves of the tree. Sitting under the shady shelter of its crown, she closed her eyes and listened to the gentle whispers of the rustling leaves, her senses reaching out to the surrounding sounds of the quiet park.<br><br>In the distance, the schoolÂ’s clock tower chimed. One, two, three, four, fiveÂ… it was five in the afternoon.<br><br>Leaning back into the tree, still with her eyes closed, she inhaled and took in the scents around her. She could smell the deep earthy scent of the soil beneath her, the woody musk of the dark tree bark, the freshness of the lush green grass around herÂ… and the tangy musk of the pages in the aged book she had just read. She took in all the scents and sounds around her, feeling her spirit fuse with the senses. She was free and soaring.<br><br>She did not hear the sound of footsteps approaching from across the green grass, tall boots brushing against long blades of grass. She did not feel the rhythm of his footsteps of the soft earth. She did not hear his heaving breath as he quickens his pace towards her. She did not see the mess he made as he dropped the sugar sweet ice-cream he just bought on the edge of her dress. She did not feel the gentle touch of his hand on her arm as he attempts to wake her. And she did not feel the tears that rolled down his cheek, at last free from months of waiting and wondering which day will be her last.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> As long as... </strong><br><br>7 pm. The clock chimed as she laid out the plates and cutlery on the table. He's going to be home soon, she thought. She looked around and surveyed the table, satisfied that everything was neatly placed. Checking the time again, she walked towards the kitchen and checked on the meal. The soup is simmering just nicely now, ready to be served once he is back.<br><br>She walked over to the kitchen counter and laid a few pieces of sliced ginger on the fish. That should take care of the fish, she thought. She knew how much he loved steamed fish with ginger.<br><br>Footsteps at the door told her that he has come home. A click, a rattle, and the door was opened. He came in smiling at her, after a hard day's work. He dropped his jacket on the couch, gave her a kiss on her forehead and went into the room to shower. She smiled back and proceeded to put the fish into the wok to steam. It will be ready by the time he has showered and is ready for dinner.<br><br>She took out the ladle and served the soup into a large soup bowl for sharing. She brought the bowl out and placed it in the centre of the small round dining table. She then walked back into the kitchen and brought out a dish of freshly fried tofu and green vegetables in oyster sauce.<br><br>As she served the rice into the small porcelain rice bowls, a smile graced her face, satisfied that she has cooked a wholesome meal for her love, once again. Just as she did everyday, even on those days when he did not come back for dinner.<br><br>Having placed everything on the dinner table, she checked on the steamed fish. It was perfectly cooked, not too rare and not over-steamed. She brought out that last dish and surveyed the table once more.<br><br>He's still in the shower, she thought. She turned around and picked up his jacket for the laundry basket. A whiff of jasmine fragrance caught her nose and there was a tinge of color on the smart black jacket. Red.<br><br>Again, she thought. Her smile stayed on her face. So long as she doesn't see her, she thought. She still loves him, as she always did when they first met, when they got together, when they got married. As long as it is not in this house, she thought. As long as she is still the one he comes home to, she thought. It does not matter what she saw, what she smelled. She loves him and that was enough for her. He comes home to her and that was enough for her. She knows but he does not have to know she knows. That was enough for her.<br><br>The smile stayed on her lips as a tear flowed in her heart.</div>
