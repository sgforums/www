              <p>Variance (s2) tells us how far off the data values are from the

              <p>Standard deviation is the square root of variance. It is the
                                      average distance of each date point to the mean. It is an
                                      indication of the degree of variation in a set of measurements or a
                                      process calculated by measuring the average spread of the data
                                      around the mean.</p>
              <p>with normal distribution, approx 68% of the values are within a
                                      range of +/- 1 standard deviation</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Anybody....?</em></span></p>
              <p>A friend of mine told me that he's getting married some time back... He really ain't prepared for the wedding but he thought he would go into it anyhow and see how things go... And if it seems that he might take if he takes it positively, things would just turn out to be quite positive for his marriage....</p>
              <p>So somehow it occurs to me, what makes a marriage successful...? And for that matters, what makes relationships successful....? Is there a secret formula for combination...? Who + who = Yes, and Who + wHo = No? Or is it that anybody with anybody would actually holds that certain level of chance for the relationship to work out for a specific period of time....? Non-specific period of time.....?</p>
              <p>If my friend thinks VERY POSITIVELY and is VERY COMMITED to make his relationship work, would it work....? Or would it really matters because it takes 2 hands to clap...? That his thoughts and actions alone is not enough but what his spouse do would matter to a great extent too....? To make things even more complicated, does the closest of people around his spouse have a great say to which whether the relationship would work out too....? So how many hands actually does it take to clap for the marriage or even a relationship to work.....?</p>
              <p>Still.... I finally thought.... In order for a relationship or even a marriage to work, it would take LOTS of EFFORTS... COMMITMENT from BOTH PARTIES.... Somehow I think the arena has changed... People are more open..... Given more options and more alternatives... More things to handle, more things to 'commit' to..... Life isn't all that simple anymore... Where family and marriage used to be the root support of many's lives... The level of commitment we devote to our relationship nowadays tend not be that at that 'sacred' level unless it's still something very new and 'honoured' by us....</p>
              <p>I must admit that even with LOTS of EFFORTS and COMMITMENT from BOTH PARTIES, things might not work out well and it might not be enough to overcome everything in this now complicated world... But instead, I thought this might be the bare minimum requirement for now....?</p>
