            <div class='col-md body'>A friend of mine email me this a few years back.  Read it several times and every time it never fail to move me.  Just want to share this with you guys.<br><br>Red roses were her favourites, her name was also Rose.<br>And every year her husband sent them, tied with pretty bows.<br>The year he died, the roses were delivered to her door.<br>The card said, Â‘Be my Valentine,Â’ like all the years before.<br><br>Each year he sent her roses, and the note would always say,<br>Â‘I love you even more this year, than last year on this day.Â’<br>Â‘My love for you will always grow, with every passing year.Â’<br>She knew this was the last time that the roses would appear.Â’<br><br>She thought, he ordered roses in advance before this day.<br>Her loving husband did not know, that he would pass away.<br>He always liked to do things early, way before the time.<br>Then, if he got too busy, everything would work out fine.<br><br>She trimmed the stems, and placed them in a very special vase.<br>Then, sat the vase beside the portrait of his smiling face.<br>She would sit for hours, in her husbandÂ’s favourite chair.<br>While staring at his picture, and the roses sitting there.<br><br>A year went by, and it was hard to live without her mate.<br>With loneliness and solitude, that had become her fate.<br>Then, the very hour, as on Valentines before,<br>The doorbell rang, and there were roses, sitting by her door.<br><br>She brought the roses in, and then just looked at them in shock.<br>Then, went to get the telephone, to call the florist shop.<br>The owner answered, and she asked him, if he would explain,<br>Why would someone do this to her, causing her such pain?<br><br>Â‘I know your husband passed away, more than a year ago,Â’<br>The owner said, Â‘I knew youÂ’d call, and you would want to know.Â’<br>Â‘The flowers you received today, were paid for in advance.Â’<br>Â‘Your husband always planned ahead, he left nothing to chance.Â’<br><br>Â‘There is a standing order, that I have ob file down here,<br>And he has paid, well in advance, youÂ’ll get them every year.<br>There also is another thing, that I think you should know,<br>He wrote a special little card Â… he did this years ago.Â’<br><br>Â‘Then, should ever, I find out that heÂ’s no longer here,<br>Â‘ThatÂ’s the card Â… that should be sent, to you the following year.Â’<br>She thanked him and hung up the phone, her tears now flowing hard.<br>Her fingers shaking, as she slowly reached to get the card.<br><br>Inside the card, she saw that he had written her a note.<br>Then, as she stared in total silence, this is what he wrote Â…<br>Â‘Hello my love, I know itÂ’s been a year since IÂ’ve been gone,<br>I hope it hasnÂ’t been too hard for you to overcome.Â’<br><br>Â‘I know it must be lonely, and the pain is very real.<br>For if it was the other way, I know how I would feel.<br>The love we shared made everything so beautiful in life.<br>I loved you more than words can say, you were the perfect wife.Â’<br><br>Â‘You were my friend and lover, you fulfilled my every need.<br>I know itÂ’s only been a year, but please try not to grieve.<br>I want you to be happy, even when you shed your tears.<br>That is why the roses will be sent to you for years.Â’<br><br>Â‘When you get these roses, think of all the happiness,<br>That we had together, and how both of us were blessed.<br>I have always loved you and I know I always will.<br>But, my love, you must go on, you have some living still.Â’<br><br>Â‘Please  Â… try to find happiness, while living out your days.<br>I know it is not easy, but I hope you will find some ways.<br>The roses will come every year, and they will only stop,<br>When your doorÂ’s not answered, when the florist stops to knock.Â’<br><br>Â‘He will come five times that day, in case you have gone out.<br>But after his last visit, he will know without a doubt,<br>To take the roses to the place, where IÂ’ve instructed him,<br>And place the roses where we are, together once again.Â’<br></div>
