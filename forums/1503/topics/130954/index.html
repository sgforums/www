            <div class='col-md body'>My dear friend,<br><br>To be honest, I think you need to pay more attention to punctuation, linebreaks and sentence structure. At the same time, try avoiding using inverse such as poem #8 NightSky&amp;Stars, line 19<br><br><strong>Â“On this planet, spinning, are we.Â”</strong><br><br>You donÂ’t speak like that in your daily conversation right?<br><br>Personally I like Poem #3 Â– Mt. Vernon, at Qing Ming and Poem #5 Â– Jalan Bukit Merah.  LetsÂ’ start with<br><br><strong>Mt. Vernon , at Qing Ming<br><br>It seems like only yesterday<br>that we lost them<br>the memories are so fresh </strong><br><br>Good start.  Caught my attention.<br><br><strong>We lit the candles and the incense<br>rearranged the fruits and food<br>and with clasped hands<br>bowed to loved ones long gone<br>remembering sweet secrets we shared </strong><br><br>Good usage of images. Nice work.<br><br><strong>&amp; licked by hungry flames<br>paper offerings<br>their ashes fluttered<br>like unfulfilled dreams<br>&amp; shifting in the wind<br>with the smoke and the chatter<br>a hint of <span style="color: red;">fragipanni</span> </strong><br><br>Rewrite this.  Get rid of the Â“&amp;Â” and write in proper sentence. You have great potential here but in my opinion due to lack of punctuation they are in a mess.  By the way, check your spelling too.<br><br><strong>It seems like only yesterday<br>that we lost them<br>the portraits are so new.</strong><br><br>Great ending.  Rewrite the middle portion and youÂ’ll have a great poem at hand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Next, poem #5 Jalan Bukit Merah<br><br><strong>Jalan Bukit Merah<br><br>Panties on bamboo poles<br>like battle flags<br>Lifts eternally reeking<br>of urine and sweat </strong><br><br>Another great start.  I love reading poems that are original in making use of images (ask LazerLordz) and have the ability to invoke my senses.  Try playing around with the linebreaks and see if you can come up with something different.<br><br><strong>The dusty stairs are stained<br>with vomit of heroin.<br>The graffiti on the walls<br>speaks for all. </strong><br><br>Another great strophe and there goes my dinner. Good work.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>Packs of young punks with nothing to do, except<br>smoking, bragging and cursing their blues.<br>"Shall we lay a girl or two, bum?"<br>"No joe, go home get your parang." </strong><br><br>I am not comfortable with this.  After reading the previous two strophes I expect more from this poem, so I was quite disappointed with this part.<br><br><strong>Some poor bastard gonna lose an arm or two.  </strong><br><br>Again, love the ending.  I think you are quite strong in using images, but you can do better in term of punctuation and sentence structure.<br><br>Keep up the good work.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
