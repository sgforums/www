            <div class='col-md body'>The Seasons of Time<br><br>Tsurayuki ended his preface to the Kokinshu with these words:<br>Hitomaro is gone. His poetry remains. Time may pass, and seasons change; pleasure and pain may come and go. These poems, written, stand! As the long thread-like leaves of the willow, forever renewed; as the needles of the pine, eternally green; as the tendrils of creeers that cover the fields in the endless profusion; as bird-tracks that multiply in the sand by the sea-shares of time: even so Poetry shall forever last. And men who know its form and feature, and who understand its heart, will worship the poetry of old even as we do the moon in the wide heaven; but will not fail to love as well the poetry of today.<br><br>----------<br>Each season, more lovely,<br>Eight thousand kinds of brushes,<br>Trees and flowers blossom,<br>And the voices of the singing birds even change.<br>Each time we hear it with our ears<br>And see it with our eyes,<br>And still sighing within, we bend down,<br>Heartshaken, longing and yearning while living on.<br>In the dark shade of the trees,<br>When the fourth moon stands up,<br>Hidden in the night,<br>The crying cuckoo should be real young of the nightingale,<br>As in handed down since olden times.<br>The young girls will thread the sweetflag<br>And the orange into chaplets.<br>Radiant during the whole radiant day,<br>That cuckoo flies over the many tops of the hills,<br>Till he faces the moon of early morning,<br>Going and turning,<br>He sings resounding.<br>Should I ever get enough of it?<br><br>- Yakamochi<br><br>----------<br>Spring (Haru)<br><br>If it were not for the voice<br>Of the nightingale,<br>How would the mountain

wild geese returning<br>Through the misty sky-<br>A letter written<br>In faint ink!<br>- Tsumori Kunimoto<br><br>Now it is spring-<br>And across the moors the haze<br>Stretches heavily-<br>And within these rays at sunset,<br>A warbler fills the radiant mist with song.<br>- Yakamochi<br><br>When I went out<br>In the spring meadows<br>To gather violets,<br>I enjoyed myself<br>So much that I stayed all night.<br>- Akahito<br><br>Clear is the bottom of the lake,<br>That mirrors the wistaria bloom;<br>And there in those sunken pebbles<br>I see countless gems.<br>- Yakamochi<br><br>In the fields of

the green willow<br>Looks like pearls<br>Threaded on a string.<br>- Lady Ise<br><br>The rotten-wooded willow<br>At the road side<br>When spring comes,<br>Yearns bitterly for old times.<br>- Suguwara No Michizane<br><br>Can it be that there is no moon<br>And that spring is not<br>The spring of old,<br>While I alone remain<br>The same person?<br>- Narihira<br><br>In the ternal<br>Light of the spring day<br>The flowers fall away<br>Like the unquiet heart.<br>- Ki no Tomonori<br><br>In one petal of this flower,<br>I have concealed<br>Hundreds of words.<br>No not think foolishly of them!<br>-

flower.<br><br>The cherry blossoms<br>Of the tenantless house<br>On the reed plain<br>Must with an easy heart<br>Fall in the wind.<br>- Yekei Hoshi<br><br>The bridge of dreams<br>Floating on the brief spring night<br>Soon breaks off:<br>Now from the mountainstop a cloud<br>Takes leave into the open sky.<br>- Teika<br><br>As now I come<br>And see the spring day grow to dusk<br>In the mountain hamlet,<br>The cherry blossoms fall to earth<br>At the sounding of a temple's vesper bell.<br>- Noin<br><br>Mirrored in the waters of the Kamunabi River,<br>Where the song-frogs call,<br>Do they bloom

leafy treetops<br>Of the summer mountain<br>The cuckoo calls-<br>Oh, how far off his echoing voice!<br>- Yakamochi<br><br>On summer nights<br>When I wonder "Shall I go to bed?"<br>At the single note sung<br>By the cuckoo,<br>Down suddenly breaks!<br>- Tsurayuki<br><br>The men of valor<br>Have gone to the honorable hunt:<br>The ladies<br>Are trailing their red pettiecoats<br>Over the clean sea-beach.<br>- Akahito<br><br>As I row over the plain<br>Of the sea and gaze<br>Into the distance, the waves<br>Merge with the bright sky.<br>- Fujiwara no Tadamichi<br><br>Come, companions!<br>Quick to Yamato!<br>The pine on the beach of Mitu<br>Will wait impatiently for us.<br>- Okura<br><br>Standing or sitting,<br>I know not what to do.<br>Though I tread the earth,<br>My heart is in the

rowboat<br>Up the river bank.<br>- Minamoto no Sanetomo<br><br>Like mu cupped hands<br>Spilling drops back into the mountain pool<br>And clouding its pure waters<br>Before the satisfaction of my thirst,<br>So have I had to part from you too soon.<br>- Tsurayuki<br><br>We have seen the sun<br>Make colored banners of the clouds<br>As it set in the sea-<br>If only now that darkness falls<br>The

towards the moon<br>In the dark night,<br>The cuckoo's crying voice<br>Sounds remote and faint.<br>Is it because my village is so far away?<br>- Yakamochi<br><br>Here where the wild ducks<br>Sport in the pond,<br>The leaves fall from the trees<br>And float- but no floating heart<br>Have I who love you true.<br>- Taniha Ome<br><br>Even for the space of a flash<br>Of lightning<br>That flashes over

you most<br>When twillight brings the rising mists<br>To hand upon the reeds<br>And as the evening darkens cold<br>With mallards' cries across the marsh.<br>- Anon<br><br>Although both grasses and trees<br>Change color,<br>For the wave-flowers<br>Of the great sea<br>There is no autumn.<br>- Funya no Yasuhide<br><br>When I count<br>The waves illuminated by the moon which shines<br>On the face of

the heart,<br>And the quails raise their plaintive cry<br>In the deep grass of secluded Fukakusa.<br>- Shunzei<br><br>In the mountain village<br>The wind rushes the leaves.<br>Deep in the night, the deer<br>Cry out beyond the edge of dreams.<br>- Minamoto no Morotada<br><br>The deer which lives<br>On the evergreen mountain<br>Where there are not autumn leaves<br>Can know the coming of a autumn<br>Only by its own cry.<br>- Onakatomi Yoshinobu<br><br>In the evening calm the cranes search for prey,<br>But when the tide comes in,<br>The waves of the open sea rise so high<br>That each calls its own mate.<br>- Anon<br><br>In the empty mountains<br>The leases of the bamboo grass<br>Rustle in the wind.<br>I think of a girl<br>Who is not here.<br>- Hitomaro<br><br>In my loneliness<br>I step outside my hut and gaze<br>In quiet reverie,<br>But everywhere it is the same:<br>The melancholy autumn dusk.<br>- Ryozen<br><br>Upon the mountain edge<br>Noisy as a flock of teal<br>Though we

hut.<br>Minamoto no Tsunenobu<br><br>In a gust of wind the white dew<br>On the autumn grass<br>Scatters like a broken necklace.<br>- Funya no Asayasu<br><br>There is a fading time<br>For blossoming flowers.<br>But the worthless roots<br>Of the reeds of the mountains,<br>Exist a long time!<br>- Anon<br><br>How will you manage<br>To cross alone<br>The autumn mountain<br>Which was so hard to get across<br>Even when we went the two of us together?<br>- Princess Daihaku<br><br>While I stay alone,<br>Feeling weary and forlorn,<br>Longing after you,<br>The autumn breeze comes blowing,<br>And the moon sinks to the west.<br>- Anon<br><br>----------<br>Winter (Fuyu)<br><br>The white chrysanthemum<br>Is disguised by the first frost.<br>If I wanted to pick one<br>I could find it only by

crest<br>Escaped and frozen,<br>One white egret<br>Guards the harbor mouth.<br>- Emperor Uda<br><br>Yonder in the plum tree,<br>Fluttering from branch to branch,<br>The warbler sings;<br>And white on

comes to visit me;<br>There is no place to go.<br>- Teika<br><br>----------<br>This World (Yo No Naka)<br><br>To what shall I compare<br>This world?<br>To the white wake behind<br>A ship that rowed

in the world has been<br>As the reflection of the moon<br>Which lodges in water<br>Gathered in the palm of the hand,<br>About which one doubts whether it is there or not!<br>- Tsurayuki<br><br>A thing which fades<br>With no outward sign-<br>Is the flower<br>Of the heart of man<br>In this world!<br>- Ono no Komachi<br><br>Since I am convinced<br>That reality is in no way<br>Real,<br>How am I to admit<br>That dreams are dreams?<br>- Saigyo Hoshi<br><br>One of us may feel<br>That life holds only pain, and another<br>That our lot is shameful,<br>Yet since we are not birds, but men,<br>We cannot find escape in flight.<br>- Okura<br><br>O pine tree standing<br>At the side of the stone house,<br>When I look at you,<br>It is like seeing face to face<br>The men of old time.<br>- Hakutsu<br><br>In my delight to see<br>The moon come up between the trees,<br>I wish only that<br>I might live west of those western hills<br>And watch its rising sooner still.<br>- By a court lady whose name we do not know.<br><br>How I yearn to be<br>Unalterably what once I was,<br>Immovable as a rock,<br>But because I belong to this world,<br>There is no stop to time.<br>- Okura</div>
