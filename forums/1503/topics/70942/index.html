Scorpio is intensely emotional and naturally possessive but Aquarius likes to feel uncluttered and free to share interests, activities, affections with friends, groups and social causes.  If Scorpio tries to possess and dominate the indomitable Aquarian, it will bring rebellion.  When a serious rift develops, Aquarius can separate quickly and cut the losses.  For Scorpio, love is an intensely personal matter.  Aquarius sees love in broader, universal terms.  Unless this important difference in emotional attitudes is clearly understood, Scorpio will feel that Aquarius is too impersonal and detached.</span></div>

If you agree, this combination will bring great happiness but the reverse also can apply.  Both are sympathetic and compassionate, so will help the other in times of trouble.  Emotions can make clear thinking difficult, so some upsetting or muddied situations can occur when things go wrong.</span></div>

Cancer proves sincere, loyal and conscientious so will appreciate the hallmarks of Virgo which are care, attention to detail and thoroughness.  Cancer is patient and, therefore, willing to accept Virgo will not be happy with quick but shoddy work.  Virgo is too much of a perfectionist to do things in a hurry.  Cancer is hypersensitive and easily hurt, so Virgo should curb the tendency to criticize when Cancer errs.  Cancer should remember that Virgo is not too demonstrative when it comes down to expressing feelings of love and affection.</span></div>

Cancer is easily hurt but, unless peace-loving Libra is provoked, it is unlikely to do anything to cause conflict deliberately.  Libra will appreciate CancerÂ’s natural desire to love and protect but sometimes will impose on the CancerianÂ’s desire to give.  Libra likes a balance between emotion and reason, so may be disturbed on occasions by CancerÂ’s excess of emotion.</span></div>

Without good communication you could feel that you live in different worlds because Sagittarius is far too wayward and freedom-loving to be domesticated and home orientated like Cancer.  Sagittarius is mentally, emotionally and physically independent, which can make Cancer feel insecure.  Both are generous, in different ways.  Cancer is inclined to cling, which can cause Sagittarius to feel smothered or trapped.</span></div>
