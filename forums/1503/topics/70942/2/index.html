Taurus is one of the most stable signs and only feels secure when life is settled.  TaurusÂ’ strong desire to stay put and possess their loved one may be at odd with the Sagittarian need to feel free and independent.  The fire sign is restless, enjoys change, like distant horizons, faraway places and needs plenty of room both mentally and physically.  Too much of this will prove very unsettling Taurus.  But true love can still manage to transcend all these differences.</span></div>

For some, compatibility will be found in a mutual appreciation of philosophy, religion, mysticism, philanthropic pursuits, charitable causes, travel, humanitarian, etc.  For others, there will be long periods of confusion, uncertainty or wishful thinking.  In some cases each person may live in a private world, untouched and unnoticed by the other.<br><br>PiscesÂ’ vivid imagination probably will conjure up the worst picture when Sagittarius feels the need to be independent.  Although Sagittarius is basically kind, helpful and generous, the sign lacks the softness and tender loving care which is so essential to hypersensitive Pisces.  The Piscean tendency to be indecisive, impractical and disorganized may exasperate Sagittarius who is basically active, impulsive and positive and likes to get things done quickly and efficiently.</span></div>

There is a great contrast of temperaments here.   Aries cannot be bothered with the method, fuss and attention to detail which comes so naturally to thorough Virgo, although Aries appreciates the results.  Emotional natures differ so much, a good mental affinity is vital.</span><br></div>

Capricorn likes to plan ahead and can play a waiting game.  Aries acts immediately and hates to wait.   Unless both people are willing to exercise tolerance, their extremely different viewpoints can bring tension or even bitterness.  Capricorn often unwittingly squashes Aries.</span></div>

Aquarius will not dampen the initiative and independence of Aries, while Aries appreciates a friend in Aquarius.  Aries loves anything new, so is interested in the AquarianÂ’s off-beat ways.  But if Aquarius becomes unpredictable at an inopportune moment, Aries will be irritated and impatient.</span></div>
