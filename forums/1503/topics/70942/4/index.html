Both are conscientious, with a strong sense of duty and responsibility, but you should avoid a pattern of all work and no play.  Your rulers Â– intellectual Mercury and wise, self-disciplined Saturn Â– are well matched for business and practical matters but there could be a lack of feeling, warm emotions and a romantic sparkle.  Capricorn admires the systematic, methodical, well-ordered ways of Virgo while the latter is sufficiently self-contained and logical not to be cut to the quick by selfish ways.</span></div>

Virgo is sensible, rational, analytical and sometimes cool while Aquarius can be dispassionate, detached, uninvolved.  Virgo is careful, self controlled and orthodox but Aquarius can be unpredictable, temperamental and unconventional at times.  VirgoÂ’s logical mind cannot begin to decipher the enigma that is Aquarius.</span></div>

Capricorn takes life seriously, attracts responsibility and can cope with austerity much better than Libra, if this is necessary.  Capricorn should remember that sharing love, affection and beautiful things is as vital to Libra as food and water.</span></div>

When Aquarius becomes aloof or unpredictable, Libra uses tact and diplomacy, rather than anger, to handle the situation. Neither will make impossible demands on the other, yet they can have togetherness if Libra allows Aquarius freedom.</span></div>

It is important to have contact with other types of people or you both will take things so seriously that you will miss out on many light-hearted pleasures.  If you are working toward the same objectives, your combined ambitions and perseverance will ensure success.  However, if one tries to use the other for selfish ends, it can lead to much bitterness and resentment.  Outsiders who are more adventurous and relaxed are likely to find this Capricorn duo too serious and formal.</span></div>

This relationship will be subject to changes of mood, routine and attitudes. Many personal readjustments will have to be made on both sides, although these may not be easy to achieve because Aquarius is independent and stubborn about personal ideas while Capricorn is tenacious, holding tight to goals and convictions.<br><br>Capricorn can never fathom why Aquarius sometimes becomes unpredictable and capricious. This behaviour undermines CapricornÂ’s desire for stability and security.  Sometimes, Aquarius likes the thrill of a new, exciting experiment, regardless of the consequences. For Capricorn, this is totally unnecessary.</span></div>

Pisces is intensely sensitive, emotional, romantic and sentimental, so may feel sad or hurt when Capricorn hides his or her true feelings.<br><br>Pisces is not one of the aggressively competitive signs, so offers no apparent threat to CapricornÂ’s ambitions and long-range plans to climb the ladder of success.

Consequently, they transcend the limits of personal ideals and give unique qualities which others do not possess. You are both different from most people and you sometimes feel misfits, expect with other Aquarians and Pisceans.<br><br>There will be at least two sides to this combination: firstly, the superficial layers of the association appear to be quite ordinary and normal; secondly, the unseen, hidden interplay of psychological forces make an obscure and highly complex relationship.

You sense things about people, including each other, without a word being spoken.<br><br>Both can become muddled, disorganizes, indecisive and in a dither, so there will be periods when time is wasted and confusion reigns in practical matters.

Discord or conflict really upsets Libra, so each will avoid or leave unfinished anything likely to cause this.  You are both easy-going and lack a fighting spirit, so you don not make a very progressive team. Your environment certainly will reflect the elegant and attractive tastes so important to Libra.</span>[/b]</blockquote>this one boi zun ah!!! then again my hubby is very un-libra  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Gemini lacks the deep emotional intensity of Scorpio and will be overwhelmed by such magnetic power.  GeminiÂ’s free spirit will feel stifled if Scorpio becomes jealous and possessive.</span>[/b]</blockquote>hmmmmmmmm  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>whatever.......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
