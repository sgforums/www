Libra, who likes to keep things balanced, may think that the Sun child is too extravagant, generous, flamboyant or lavish.  Although Leo likes to be boss, Libra gets what Libra wants through tactful manipulation.</span></div>

In prolonged, close relationships Leo could feel too hemmed in or restricted by Capricorn who, in turn, will feel that LeoÂ’s way are too extravagant or demonstrative to be warranted.  Leo likes to live life to the full whereas Capricorn, being more cautious and conservative, likes to plan for the future. Capricorn, emotionally reserved and fairly undemonstrative, seldom realizes that Leo can feel starved unless given lots of love, affection, attention and appreciation.</span></div>

There can be a strong initial attraction which sometimes is transformed into equally strong opposition.  You both have fixed opinions, strong determination and minds of your own so, without compromise, there will be clashes of wills.<br><br>Being Leo, you feel justified in claiming most of your partnerÂ’s attention, so you will find it difficult to accept the fact that Aquarius likes to share interests, activities, ideals and affections with more than one person.  Leo will not understand why Aquarius should be so unpredictable, detached and uncatchable Â– and at the most unexpected time.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Leo with Pisces</strong></span></span><br><br><span class="large">Fire with water highlights the great difference between these two. Leo is one of the most frank, open, extrovert signs. Pisces has deep, mysterious, elusive qualities which are almost unfathomable to most people.  Leo never really knows what Pisces is made of but the latter admires the strength and purpose of Leo.  Pisces often needs to be more organized and Leo is just the one to do it.  You live in two different worlds but those who bridge the gap will learn from and benefit each other in ways neither has imagined.</span></div>

Because of this Â– and the fact that each likes to have an organized routine Â– it is easy to fall into a rut.  Neither will make impossible emotional demands on the other but each should avoid nagging or finding fault.</span></div>
