            <div class='col-md body'>Let me continue my story, as I was sayingÂ…Â…Â…..Wait, you have a question??? What happened to the victimsÂ’ bodies??? Hunting dogs???  Oh you mean will the hunting dogs kill and eat them when come out to haunt at night??? No, donÂ’t worry my friend.  Surprisingly the dogs leave them alone.  Yes, they simply ignore them, nobody knows exactly why that is so.  My guess is maybe, these victims or shall we call them dreamers (for indeed they are like having a sweet dream) once they have reach this stage; they are at peace with themselves.  The only emotions they are capable of are loves, joys and peace.  So the hunting dogs, which are only attracted by negative emotions, simply leave them alone.  HmmÂ… this is only my guess.<br><br>Dreamers will eventually died of hunger, the locations where they fell became their graves.  They have return to the embrace of Mother Nature, ashes to ashes, dusts to dusts.  And this is the real reason why these mountains are called the mountains of madness.<br><br>In such an environment, I really wonder how ratinacage could have survived.  He is after all, a human, just like us. How come the mountains do not affect him?  Well, according to the locals, ratinacage has a unique ability, he is able to sense the feelings of those people him and absorbs them as if they are his own.   If you feel fear, he will feel fear, if you feel sad, he will feel sad.  You cannot hide your feelings from him, you feel naked, expose and vulnerable when he is around.  People start to shun away from him, treat him like a plague.<br><br>How lonely can a person get?  Ask him, he will be able to provide you with the answer.  Is this a gift or a curse?  I donÂ’t know.<br><br>So into the mountains he goes, away from mankind, bringing his beloved dogs and snakes.  Somehow the strange phenomenon of these mountains has a claming effect on our hero.  Maybe it has neutralized his ability, for that will explain why he is able to remain unharmed.  For the first time, he feels at home, peaceful.  Most important of all he feels belong.<br><br>Occasionally, he does long for a human companion, someone to talk to, share his joys, sorrow, pride, love, etc.  But this must be a very special person, a person just like him, a person that has feelings as strong as him.<br><br>And he is still waiting Â…Â….  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>WhatÂ’s that! Barking of dogs!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I think we better get out of here before they sense us.

            <div class='col-md body'>Good news my fellow travelers.   We are now out of the dark side of sgforums. (I hope)  So how was KittyÂ’s cooking?  ErÂ… I knowÂ… but you donÂ’t have to be so obvious lah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>We will now be proceeding to another group of mountains Â…. donÂ’t look so afraid leh. These mountains do not have any hunting dogs or phantom guests.  It is actually a nice cozy place situated near the coast.  If we have extra time to spare, we may even go for a swim in the sea or sun tanning at the beach.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>On one of these mountains, there is a magnificent three-story bungalow.  This place is own by one Dr. Ole, an absolutely brilliant scientist.  He has so many great inventions under his name that may even put Edison to shame. (me siam, just in case got any  EdisonÂ’s fans here)<br><br>Everything in his house is powered by solar power, from air conditioners to computers, to bathroom, etc.   Even at night when the sun is asleep, solar energy are also available because his machine has the ability to store them up.<br><br>One of his greatest inventions is the Â‘S.S.A.W.Â’ machine, which stands for Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.  With this machine, Dr. Ole can change the weather of all places within the radius of 10km from his house.  The best thing is that the S.S.A.W. machine is able to divide its surrounding into four sectors, each with a different season.  Such wonder!<br><br>Thanks to his amazing machine, the locals are able to enjoy all kinds of seasonal fruits and fresh vegetables all year long.  A generous person, Dr. Ole gladly provides the locals with these goodies for free.  No charge!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Beside S.S.A.W., he has also built a tar road that cut through the mountains directly to the main gate of the city.  Using this road, it will only take less than an hour to reach the city saving precious times for locals and tourists alike.<br><br>Dr. Ole is a nature lover, in the day he enjoys going fishing in a small lake by his house. Sometimes he may invite his friends to go rowing, all the way from the small lake to the sea.  He loves the feeling of winds blowing in his face, and the sense of freedom he treasures.  At night, he will proceed to the observatory in the attic, gazing upon the distant sky, thinking of his past, his dreams Â…<br><br>Okay guys!  To the city!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
