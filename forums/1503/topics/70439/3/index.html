            <div class='col-md body'>New Version.........<br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Sgforums.    My name is Dead Poet, I am your guide in this magical land.  You are now all guests at my humble home, i.e. Dead Poet Ave, a little cottage by a lake between a pine tree forest and a lovely garden. There is no much to see here actually.  But I promise you adventures and exotic places beyond your wildest imaginations as we journey along.  You have all taken a sumptuous lunch beside the lake, so come come, my friends, it is time to take a stroll through the pine tree forest to our next location.<br><br>After walking through the forest, you will come to a fine beach i.e. Philosophy Lane.  It has the finest sands in Sgforums and a paradise for ice-cream lovers. Why is it call the Philosophy Lane?  Maybe because many great thinkers got their inspirations by simply strolling along this lovely beach.  With the soft touches of the fine sands, one cannot help but to feel inspired here.  Beside great thinkers, it is also a popular place for poets, artists and musicians too.  And if one is thinking of give himself a treat, there is always the ice cream.    Just by the beach is a 3-storeys house where weidev and his girlfriend live.  Mr. Weidev is a very homely and generous person, so this where you can get delicious homemade ice cream for very cheap prices. They have so many flavours, strawberry, chocolate, mango, vanilla, raspberry, etc.  You name it, they have it.  What more can you ask my friends!<br><br>Further down the beach you will see a huge inn called Sinned Ave, a paradise for sinners own by Sinned. It has a huge garden with exotic flowers and within it numerous pavilions for people to relax and chi-chat.  A gentle reminder for all visitors here, please turn off your hand-phones.   All forms of modern technology would become useless here. But please do not be discourage by the name of the place.  ArenÂ’t we all sinners?  It is actually a place for all of us.  In here we really have nothing to hide for we knows everyone will be truthful here.  Because of this, it is also a good place for poets and writers to get their inspirations too.<br><br>Now after Sinned Ave, you will come to a coffee shop.  Something different for a change.  Its name is LaurenceÂ’s Kopitiam, owned by laurence82.  By the way, unlike Sinned Ave, visitors are supposed to eat and go due to limited seats.  It is really a very popular F&amp;B establishment here with the locals.   And if you wondered why the milks here are so fresh, it is because it is supply by MookuÂ’s Farm just situated behind LaurenceÂ’s Kopitiam.  We will be visiting the place if we have the time, for they produce very fresh milks and breed all kind of cows.  Cows that sing, cows that dance, cows that talk, etc.  In fact they even have a cow that can flies over the moon.  A very interesting farm indeed.<br><br>As we continue our tour of Sgforums, we see a competitor of LaurenceÂ’s Kopitiam, i.e. Rendezvous Ave, another coffee shop owned by xian89.  It foods and milks are as good as LaurenceÂ’s Kopitiam.  However, it is also a favourite gathering point for those going for outing.  One of the reasons may be due to the fact that it situated near to a hot spot in this area, Beach Bum Paradise, which we will be visiting later.  Because BB Paradise does not sell any foods or drinks, most of the people will get their supply from Rendezvous Ave.  So business is really good and that makes xian89 very very happy.<br><br>As we moved along, we can see another beach not too far away. This is the beach I was previously talking about, i.e. Beach Bum Paradise owned by _attiude_. A place for all the surfer dudes and babes to catch some wave, a perfect place for a nice peaceful get away.  In here you can forget about all your worries, relax and have fun. Unlike Philosophy Lane, there is no houses or buildings here, just sand and wave.   There is actually no need for houses, for _attiude_ , the sand is his bed, the stars are his lights, and the sky is his blanket.  Just like his domain, Mr. Attiude is a modern rebel, carefree, enjoys life and likes to have fun. Cool.<br><br>Lastly, we come to Superiority Street; the wonder of Sgforums, for the street is made in gold.  However please do not be tempted to keep one of the gold as souvenir as the street was built by a mystery character known to the local as Master.  Now one knows exactly how he/she looks like, the local only clue is this -_- .  Who exactly is this super rich person, nobody really knows.  There is a saying among the locals that he/she always wears a golden mask whenever he/she is out.   And better still, some even claim that whatever Master touches will instantly be turn into solid gold.   Is this bad or good, you be the judge.<br><br>After you have enjoyed the view (golds) of Superiority Street, we will be seeing a very different side of Sgforums, the dark side. As we continue the journey, you will notice that the sun no longer shines and the birds no longer sing. The sky is covered with stormy clouds, with threatening thunders and lightening.<br><br>If you are now feeling afraid, you will be forgiven. Indeed be afraid, be very afraid, for we are now approaching the dark side of SgforumsÂ…Â…Â…<br></div>
