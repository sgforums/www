            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Everybody please gather around me, this is important, please pay attention.  Remember we first start our tour in this magical land at Dead Poet Ave?  Remember how you guys react? You were all expecting to see dead people around and were surprise to see it is actually a small cottage surround by lake, pine tree forest and lovely garden.<br><br>Tonight we are going to explore only two places due to time constraint.  First on the list, is Very Dark Woods of the Condemned (VDWC)Â…Â…Â…Â… No, it is not going to be like Dead Poet Ave or Sinned Ave. It mean what it say, it is a place for the condemned, rule by a Dark Lord known to the local here as Devil1976.<br><br>I want everyone to be very careful when we are there, be very silent, do not make any unnecessary moves or sound.   HmmÂ… Dark Woods of the Condemned, what is this place like?  If you travel by foot from Superiority Street, you should be able to come to the edge of the forest in about an hour.  Before you enter the forest, please turn off your hand phone.  And no, you are not allowed to bring any touch light.  Any unnecessary move may means sudden death.  The trick to survive there is to be invisible.<br><br>Actually the woods itself is not that frightening.  It is the cave that you have to be aware.  Do not, I repeat, do not wander into the cave if you value your life.  It is a place where all the condemned creatures go into isolation for breeding.  Like a maze, it has countless tunnels each leading to certain death.  Exactly how the tunnels look like nobody really knows.  To date, no outsiders who have ever entered the cave ever came out alive.  Maybe only Devil1976 and his condemned creatures knowÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â….<br><br>But how do you know that you are near the Cave of the Condemned?  Ironically, a distance away from the entrance of the cave is a totally different world.  This small area has a beautiful small patch of soft grass and sweet-smelling flowers by a magnificent waterfall with very clear clean water.   The air here is cool and fresh and all of a sudden you feel you are reborn, rejuvenated and alive.  You can breath again.  A total contrast from the suffocating darkness surrounding it.  The soft luke warm sunlight shines in and gently caress the living things here, for example, butterflies, birds or any wanderers that may chance upon this place. And at night, if one were to lie on the soft grass, he/she may see the crystal clear moon smiling back at him/her from the distant sky.<br><br>Even in this place, a place where almost things are enveloped by darkness, there is still light.  Maybe it is trying to tell us, even in the darkness moment of your life, donÂ’t give up, for there is still hope.  And that is so true, just a short distance from this magical place, is the way out of VDWC.<br><br>HmmÂ… maybe this Devil1976 is not such a bad person after all Â…Â…  we will never know, for we are getting out of here as fast as we can.<br><br>Out of VDWC, just across a small river, you will see another forest, a pine forest to be exact.  But unlike the one that divide Dead Poet Ave and Philosophy Lane, this pine forest has a darker side to itÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â….<br><br>Welcome to Cat AlleyÂ…Â…Â…Â….<br></div>

NoÂ…Â…Â….. we cannot return to VDWC, it is too risky.  Most likely he had wandered into the Cave of the Condemned.  We have to continueÂ…Â…Â….<br><br>Cat Alley, located deep in the pine forest just across a small stream.  It is actually a very pleasant place in the day time.  But at night it is a different story.  Maybe it is the darkness or maybe it is the eerie stories that were told by the locals about a certain witch that roam the neighbourhoodÂ’s cemetery with her nine black cats to collect inspirations from the dead for her potions.<br><br>You all look afraid.  Do not be afraid.  Actually, I kind of know this witch.  Her name is KittynMeow, I call her Kitty for short.  Cat Alley is actually just a tiny alley hidden deep inside the forest.  It has a beautiful gothic witch-house, grand and dark from the outside, but warm and cozy inside.  Kitty is very fond of guests, especially little children, who are lost in the forest. She always makes it a point to make sure that they stay for dinner before sending them home.  So there are always plenty of food, sweets, and tidbits for her little guests.  Unfortunately, she does not have any milk in her house, a pity.<br><br>Just located behind the house, you will find a little herb and spice garden.  AhÂ…. This is where Kitty grows her ingredients for her Â‘morbid and sarcasm potionsÂ’ as she calls them.  So is Kitty a real witch?  Or maybe she is just an ordinary lady trying to escape from something?  Or maybe she is trying to avoid seeing someone? DoesnÂ’t she feel lonely?  Actually as long as she is happy living with her cats, doing things that she enjoys, why not?<br><br>To be continue .......</div>

Good news, your friend who was lost yesterday came back this morning.  Apparently, the Dark Lord decided to release him.  Let him takes a good rest before we continue our journey.<br><br>Today, we will be going to visit a Dr. Ole.  He lives in the mountains near the coast to the east of Cat Alley.   There are two reasons for visiting him, Firstly his home is a very unique place; you have to see it to believe it.  Secondly, as we will be visiting the city soon, we can take a short cut through his house that directly link to the city.<br><br>But for now let us head back to the stream as we will be moving upwards along it, that will led us to a cluster of mountains known to the local as the Mountains of MadnessÂ…Â….<br></div>
