            <div class='col-md body'>From my experience, depression feeds in on itself and it's easy to fall in and fall deeper. Having people to talk to and who will listen helps, but it takes a certain amount of self determination to just to get away from that trap. Glad for you that you did not end as your poem did.</div>
