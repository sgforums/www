            <div class='col-md body'>Writer: Tan Shi Hao<br><br>It had been several days since the boy's parents passed away. Still, he could not forget the picture where his house was consumed by the raging fire.<br>The bleary scene of his parents being trapped in the midst of the fire, along with the loud and clear cries of his mother, both of these were scarred deep into his mind.<br>Edward had just finish celebrating his 10th birthday not long ago. And such a lamentable misfortune had fell upon him.<br>He was helpless, and was without any relatives within the country. The only person that he had could trust was his butler that had served his family for ten years.<br>Even at the age of ten, he clearly knew that his chance of tasting happiness in his future days were bleak. Still he was unaware of the unthinkable days ahead.<br><br>He had been travelling aimlessly with his butler for days already. Switching from train rides to train rides, oblivious of where he is heading to.<br>After days of his rudderless journey, he finally arrived a desolate train station.<br>The train station was moth-eaten, with chilling silence.<br>The railways were filled with rust, with bits and pieces of broken bottles lying on it. Every inch station's walls were scraped, some even half destroyed.<br>As if the building would just crumble into a heap dust any minute.<br>Before he could examine every corner of the train station, his butler took off.<br>At a pace that was unusually fast. Seeing this, he picked up his luggage and tailed behind.<br><br>For every step that he took, he could hear his feet grazing against the floor.<br>And that made the entire atmosphere even more shivery.<br>He was scared naturally, and followed his butler closely, not leaving more then 3 feets away from him.<br>Monitoring at every step that his butler took, he did not pay much attention to his surrounding.<br>Without any warning, his butler stopped. With both his legs unbent and sticked firmly to one and another.<br>Only then Edward had a chance to take note of his surroundings.<br>And before he even noticed, he arrrived infront of a tenebrous and suspicious gate, with a old and illuminated building infront of right behind it.<br>Crows were everywhere, singing in a raucous manner as if it was a formal welcome to them. Cold wind blew and a baleful feeling chilled down his spine.<br>Only during then, sadness was scuffed entirely off his mind. And fear had completely bestowed upon him.<br><br>His eyes was glued to the building at that instance, with his heartbeat pumping at a presto rate.<br>He then finally swallowed his saliva hard and questioned his butler in fearful manner "May I know why are we here?"<br>For each and every word he spoke, his lips trembled.<br>His butler did not answer. Not in one,two or even three seconds.<br>Instead he turn and looked at him, with a insensate and cunning smile.<br>Edward got the shocked out of his life. He had never witness that kind of expression from his butler before.<br>He knew something was amiss. And took a few steps back, still staring into the eyes of his butler.<br>In a mass hysteria, he was unsure of what to do.<br>But there was one thing he was certain of. If he fails to escape now, his life would just be concluded in a tragical manner, just like his parents.<br><br>He dropped the luggage that weight a ton on his right hand. Starting to run for his life.<br>Edward was never an athelic. And he was only 10 at that time, hardly even 4 feet in height.<br>He did not gave up, and sprinted like he never did before.<br>Sadly, in prospect, he was knocked out from the back. Not even covering more than 30metres.<br>The only thing he could remember after that was being dragged into a dark and cold room.<br><br>While Edward was un-concious. He dreamt of the paradisaic times he had with his parents.<br>The dream was just like reality. He could hardly tell the differnce.<br>His birthday presents were all over, blocking the passage of the main door.<br>Friends and relatives filled up his living room, harmonizing his birthday song.<br>His parents were on his both sides, smiling cordially at him<br>In front of him, it was a double deckered birthday cake. With his name, and 10 candles brightly light up.<br>When his relatives and friends were done with the song.<br>He clenched his fist together, closing his eyes gently at the same time, and made his birthday wish.<br>Finally, he bend over, eager to blow the candles.<br>At that moment, his dream shattered like a kaleidoscope. With pictures of his happy memories floating and sinking into a deep abyss.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Something i came up with randomly.<br>I know the sentence structure and pace a little werid.<br>Can someone help he correct some of the errors? And make the passage look more smooth.<br><br>Thank you ah<br><br>And enjoy!</div>
