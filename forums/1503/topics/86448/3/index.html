Had problem dealing with schoolwork. Was close to a nervous breakdown at one point. Woke up one morning and had chest pain and refused to go to school from that day onwards. Doctors could not find anything wrong. It was frightening. I just could not breathe properly but the doctors keep saying there was absolutely nothing wrong with me. It was agonizing Â– I missed so many days of schooling, I could not sleep well, could not eat well and I simply just did not want to go on and contemplated taking my own life (kind of like what I wrote in the poem). No one seems to be able to help and bring some relief. My family was always there but I felt they were suffering as well and it made things worst.<br><br>It was one long emotional struggle, but luckily, I eventually got out from that spiral of misery. Nevertheless till this day I still fear Â‘not being able to breatheÂ’ and that is why I chose Â‘StrangleÂ’ for the S in VERSE.  I fear strangulation and suffocation more than death itself.<br><br>Anyway, that was in the past. I have another POETIC VERSE. I would like to dedicate this to all the forumite here especially to you the DeadPoet himself.<br><br>[b]Â‘The flowerÂ’ in you</strong><br><br><strong>P</strong>retty flower blooms<br><strong>O</strong>pen your rainbow kissed blossom and banish the gloom<br><strong>E</strong>ver so beautiful, ever so gentle<br><strong>T</strong>ouching heartsÂ…lovely coloured petals<br><strong>I</strong>nviting joy to fill the emptiness<br><strong>C</strong>leansing sadness turning them into happiness<br><br><strong>V</strong>iolet or blue<br><strong>E</strong>merald, yellow and golden too<br><strong>R</strong>ays of sunlight falls on little droplets of dew<br><strong>S</strong>parkling like diamonds rare and few<br><strong>E</strong>verlasting your wordsÂ… Â‘the flowerÂ’ in you<br><br>To me, poets have little flower in them. Something like inspiration. And when that little flower/inspiration blossom it brings much joy to everyone reading the poems/words they write. Everlasting your words(poems)Â…(thank you for) Â‘the flowerÂ’(inspiration) in you.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Hey Paker, (Or should I call you Spiderman?)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  glad to know you are feeling better.  It is really tough being a teenager in the past, but actually things are not getting better either.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And yes, thanks for the dedication.  It is really refreshing to describe inspiration as Â‘flowerÂ’.  I wonder what kind of flower is inside me. Hee hee.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>To me writing poems is a self-awareness process.   It helps me to keep in touch with my inner self.  It allows me to express my feelings in ways that I wonÂ’t be able to do in Â‘normalÂ’ conditions.  And yes, sharing poems with friends is always a joy.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>There is a poet in every one of us waiting to be awake.<br><br>Thanks for sharing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

Had problem dealing with schoolwork. Was close to a nervous breakdown at one point. Woke up one morning and had chest pain and refused to go to school from that day onwards. Doctors could not find anything wrong. It was frightening. I just could not breathe properly but the doctors keep saying there was absolutely nothing wrong with me. It was agonizing ? I missed so many days of schooling, I could not sleep well, could not eat well and I simply just did not want to go on and contemplated taking my own life (kind of like what I wrote in the poem). No one seems to be able to help and bring some relief. My family was always there but I felt they were suffering as well and it made things worst.<br><br>It was one long emotional struggle, but luckily, I eventually got out from that spiral of misery. Nevertheless till this day I still fear ?not being able to breathe? and that is why I chose ?Strangle? for the S in VERSE.  I fear strangulation and suffocation more than death itself.<br><br>Anyway, that was in the past. I have another POETIC VERSE. I would like to dedicate this to all the forumite here especially to you the DeadPoet himself.<br><br>[b]?The flower? in you</strong><br><br><strong>P</strong>retty flower blooms<br><strong>O</strong>pen your rainbow kissed blossom and banish the gloom<br><strong>E</strong>ver so beautiful, ever so gentle<br><strong>T</strong>ouching hearts?lovely coloured petals<br><strong>I</strong>nviting joy to fill the emptiness<br><strong>C</strong>leansing sadness turning them into happiness<br><br><strong>V</strong>iolet or blue<br><strong>E</strong>merald, yellow and golden too<br><strong>R</strong>ays of sunlight falls on little droplets of dew<br><strong>S</strong>parkling like diamonds rare and few<br><strong>E</strong>verlasting your words? ?the flower? in you<br><br>To me, poets have little flower in them.

Most likely during secondary school.  But it was only during my Pre-U days that I started to take/write poems seriously.

That is where you can improve on your poems.  Take cooking for example; I usually ended up disliking what IÂ’ve cooked.   (Although my friends and family members disagree) Just like writing poems, I enjoy exploring different ways to improve my cooking skills.  Poetry to me is the food for the soul.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I am not that concerned with the technical details of poem writing.  As long as you are able to express yourself clearly, get your message across to your readers, you are a good poet.   On the other hand, feel free to explore the technical aspects of poetry, read on meter, metaphors, sonnets, etc. Explore new ways, get your creative juice flowing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>That is why I usually donÂ’t give negative comments on the poems posted here.  If I think it is really bad, I usually pm the poet with some suggestions or I might suggest some slight amendments in the thread, etc  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Never criticize a poem openly.  Words are like fire, it brings light, but it burns too.  A completed poem is like a baby to the poet, it is a product of efforts and love. It is a mirror of your inner soul.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>There are indeed many talents in this forum, hey; you are one of them too.  Just keep on writing, find your own style.  Have fun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
