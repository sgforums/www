            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 15.... hehehe sorry for the long wait...<br>******************************************************************<br>Â“SoÂ… what have you been doing after the exams?Â” I asked, suddenly shy as I realized Roy was still looking at me.<br><br>Â“Huh? Oh! I just came back from a camping trip with some secondary school kids. Been helping them in their studies as a mentor and joined them for a week-long camp at St JohnÂ’s Island last week.Â” He replied with a smile.<br><br>I guess that explains the great suntan. It gave him such a healthy glow that almost made him dashingly handsome.<br><br>Â“How have you been?Â” he asked. I didnÂ’t know where to start or what to tell himÂ… after all a lot of things did happen over the past few weeks. Bit by bit, I told him about CherylÂ’s breakdown, her momÂ’s visit and her start of a new life overseas.<br><br>Roy was exceedingly quiet after everything I said. He sat immersed in his thoughts for a long while, before seeming to break out of it and took a sip of his coffee.<br><br>Â“Enough of this depressing stuff,Â” he said at last. Â“ItÂ’s still early in the afternoon, and if youÂ’ve got nothing else to do, shall we catch a movie?Â”<br><br>What? An impromptu date? I could almost feel my blood rising to my cheeks, threatening to turn them absolutely pink! Yet, I couldn't resist.<br><br>Â“Sure, why not? What is good that is showing now?Â” I asked.  Roy shrugged his shoulders and for a moment, he looked kind of boyishly mischievous, I thought.<br><br>We got out of the cafÃ© and went to the movie Cineplex to check out the schedules. Just in time for the afternoon screening of Tomb Raider 2, we quickly grabbed the tickets, a drink and some popcorn, and went into the theatre.<br><br>The movie was good, and had pretty good action and an interesting plot. But half the time, I was so distracted that I couldnÂ’t remember the story! The feeling of his warmth next to me, the brush of his shoulders against mine as we leaned close to whisper to each other our comments about the show, the scent of his perfume. I could almost feel an irresistible urge to grab his hand, to lean my head on his shoulder.<br><br>The lights came on at the end of the show and I found myself speechlessÂ… and reluctant to move from my seat. I was reluctant to leave being so close to Roy. The cleaners came in to clear the theatre and we had no choice but to leave.<br><br>Â“You know somethingÂ…Â” Roy said as he stood up from his seat. Â“That was a really enjoyable movie, despite it being my second time watching it.Â”<br><br>Â“Second time?Â” I asked in surprise. Â“Why would you want to watch the show a second time if you have seen it? You should have told me earlier and weÂ’ll watch something else!Â”<br><br>Â“WellÂ… I saw it with the kids I went camping withÂ… and Drew too, your roommate. SheÂ’s one of the mentors as well.Â” He explained.<br><br>Walking beside me as we exited the cinema, he added: Â“And itÂ’s not a matter of how many times I've watched it. ItÂ’s a matter of who IÂ’m watching it with.Â”<br><br>With that, he turned and looked at me meaningfully, with a smile at the corners of his lips. My heart fluttered at his words and I could feel the growing warmth within me, spreading from my heart to my limbs. Bracing myself to meet his gaze, I looked up and gave him a shy smile.<br><br>Just as we turned around a corner towards the lift lobby, we were greeted by the sight of a person that neither one of us wished to see. There, standing next to the lift, with his hand on the wall enclosing the girl that he was talking to, was RamazanÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 16.... hehehehe... enjoy...<br>**************************************************************************<br>I stopped in my tracks, suddenly unwilling to share the same lift as Ram. Ram turned around and saw Roy and I standing there. I thought I saw a smirk appear at the corner of his mouth as he looked at us.<br><br>Â“Hi there, brother. Out on a date?Â” Ram asked. I thought he sounded sarcastic. Why in the world would I think he was handsome in the beginning? Why is it that he looked so sinister and ugly now?<br><br>Roy didnÂ’t answer but I could sense him tensing up, as though a deep hatred and anger was reaching boiling point within him.<br><br>Seeing RoyÂ’s expression, Ram looked at the girl he was with and shrugged his shoulders.<br><br>Â“Come onÂ… donÂ’t look at me like that. It just didnÂ’t work out between me and CherylÂ… things happen and life moves on,Â” Ram said lightly.<br><br>In a flash, Roy grabbed RamÂ’s collar and threw a fist into his cheek. Ram fought back and pushed Roy away from him.<br><br>Â“What the hellÂ…are you crazy or something?Â” Ram yelled, staring at Roy in disbelief.<br><br>Â“You know what you did. You drove Jas to her death and made Cheryl miserable. And you had the cheekÂ…Â” Roy yelled back.<br><br>Â“I drove Jas to her death? She took her own life!Â” Ram retorted. Â“And you know what? She wouldnÂ’t have done it if it were not for your holier-than-thou self-righteousness! Ask yourself! If you had not avoided her phone calls! If you had been more understanding and sensitive to her feelings instead of scolding her for being cheap and avoided her like a plague, would she have been so devastated and desperate to kill herself?Â”<br><br>Spitting out those words in disgust, Ram shook his head and said: Â“Have you ever thought that I loved Jas truly? Obviously notÂ… because you thought only about your own feelings. And she thought only about you. DonÂ’t you ever dare talk to me about Jas.Â”<br><br>Looking at me, Ram's expression softened and he said: Â“Sorry we didnÂ’t work out. Take care of yourself, will you?Â”<br><br>With that, he turned, grabbing the hand of the girl he was with, and left.<br><br>I stood there amidst the crowd, dumbfounded. I didnÂ’t notice the people standing around, gossiping about what happened and pointing fingers. In fact, I didnÂ’t care.<br><br>I looked at Roy and searched his face. I wanted him to tell me that what Ram said wasnÂ’t true. I wanted him to tell me that Ram was the real jerk and came up with all those lies. But Roy only stood in silence, head down, deeply hurt and angry. After a while, he just turned and walked away.<br><br>Â“Wait!Â” I called out to Roy, as I ran to catch up with him. Â“Are you alright?Â”<br><br>He paused in his tracks and looked at me. The struggle of anger, shame and guilt was apparent on his face.<br><br>'I'm really sorry to let you see this and I've got to fly. I'll call you again tonight.' He forced a smile at the corner of his lips and left.<br><br>My blissful day thus abruptly concluded, leaving me in deeper confusion and internal turmoil on what to think about Ram, Roy and everything else that happened since school began. Why did all these happen to me? Why me? These were questions I couldnÂ’t help asking myself and I was still thinking of them when I reached my front doorÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ram could just be a pathetic guy with a bruised ego who can't get true love.... ooh well.... too bad he started in the story as the "bad guy"... hehehe.....<br><br>as for roy, well even if it's true... who could blame him? it's human nature to think of our own feelings 1st.... hence the degree of forgiveness towards him? a warped justification for ourselves?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 17,... here it is...sorry it took so long....<br>************************************************************<br>It was already 2am in the morning when I put down my favourite storybook and he hadn't called me yet. I was getting kind of worried when the phone rang. I raced to pick up the call before it awakened my whole family.<br><br>'HiÂ…ermÂ… Sorry for not calling earlier.' Roy said in a husky voice.<br><br>'ItÂ’s ok. I hope youÂ’re feeling fine now.' I said, trying to sound as understanding as I could, while resisting the temptation to let my curiosity take control.<br><br>Â“No, itÂ’s not okÂ…Â” he insisted. Â“IÂ’m really sorryÂ… about what happened today, about the things you heardÂ…Â”<br><br>I couldnÂ’t keep quiet anymore. I had to know!<br><br>Â“Was it true then?Â” I asked. Â“Was Ram telling the truth about Jas?Â”<br><br>There was a long pause. I could almost hear a pin drop a mile away. Roy breathed a heavy sigh, as if unsure what to say next.<br><br>Â“In a way, yesÂ…Â” he said hesitantly. Â“When it happened, I couldnÂ’t accept the fact, and I turned my back on Jas when she needed me most. It devastated her and she took her lifeÂ… and her death dealt me such a blow that I started blaming everything, everyone, including myself. But I didnÂ’t dare let myself remember thatÂ… I had been in denial all this while and I know IÂ’ve done wrong. I should have faced up to it long agoÂ…Â”<br><br>I sighed. It was a hard truth to swallow. After seeing how Roy was being understanding and sensitive all this while, it was tough believing that he had caused JasÂ’ suicide, one way or another.<br><br>Â“PatÂ…Â” Roy hesitated before breathing another deep sigh. Â“PatÂ… IÂ’m truly sorry for what happened. And IÂ’m really sorry if this will forever become a cause for estrangement in our... ermÂ… friendshipÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“No, donÂ’t think that way,Â” I said. Â“ItÂ’s not an issue at all. Everyone has got a past, right?Â”<br><br>Â“No, Pat, you donÂ’t understandÂ…Â” Roy interrupted me before I could offer any further assurances. Â“It is an issue, because IÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“Because of what?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“Because I really like you and I had hoped we will be more than friends!Â” He blurted out in a rush. Â“I know IÂ’ve made a huge mistake, being in self-denial and all that, but I know that now and I know I can change that. I hope all this has not cast such a huge shadow on my character that you will never speak to me againÂ…Â”<br><br>My continued silence encouraged him to go on, Â“PatÂ… please. Will you give me a chance? Can we try out something together?Â”<br><br>Suddenly I felt overwhelm with exhaustion. My thoughts and feelings in turmoil, the rational combating the emotionalÂ… Everything that IÂ’ve been through since the beginning of school flashed before me and it suddenly felt as if IÂ’ve lived through more than a lifetimeÂ’s worth of relationship problems.<br><br>Â“Pat, are you alright?Â” Roy asked.<br><br>I took a deep breath and tried to relax myself. Â“Roy, IÂ’m fineÂ… but IÂ’m afraid I canÂ’t answer you right now. Too much has happened and I need to thinkÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“Sure, I understand,Â” Roy said, sounding a little disappointed as he did. Â“ErmÂ… I think I should go now and let you have your rest.Â”<br><br>Â“Right, Thanks. Good night and sleep well.Â” I said and hung up my phone.<br><br>Indeed, too much has happened, and it is becoming too much for me to handle. True that I have grown to like Roy a lot over this period of time, but I really needed to calm myself down and thinkÂ…<br><br>Tossing and turning in my bed, I was still running through my warring thoughts and emotions as I drifted off to sleepÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hehehe i know i know.. you guys are prob going to complain... but this is the last epi of this story... enjoy...<br>*************************************************************<br><br>ItÂ’s been more than a month since I last spoke to Roy and guess what? School is starting again. Boring lectures, assignments, homework.... but somehow, I'm feeling rather light-hearted today.<br><br>Having barely scrapped through my exams the previous semester, I set off for school with the resolution to study hard and do well this semester.<br><br>Â“Hi Pat, how was your holiday?Â” Drew asked from behind me.<br><br>I turned around and grinned at her. Â“GreatÂ… in fact, itÂ’s never been better. What about you?Â”<br><br>Â“WellÂ…Â” Drew blushed. Seeing her face turned beet red tickled me so hard that I didnÂ’t realize Roy came up behind us.<br><br>Â“Hi there,Â” he said, with a polite smile.<br><br>Â“Hi, good to see you again.Â” I said. For a moment, he seemed embarrassed and at a loss for words.<br><br>Â“Alright, IÂ’ll leave you two together,Â” I laughed and made my way to class on my own. Glancing back at them, I saw Roy and Drew walking to class together hand-in-hand.<br><br>Yup, it was a decision I made after much deliberating and IÂ’m glad I made it. Over the last semester, IÂ’ve been through too much ups and downs in relationshipsÂ… so much so that I felt as if I was lost and couldnÂ’t find myself. Roy is a nice guy but I couldnÂ’t bring myself to step into another relationship for the time being, much less someone who needs long-term commitment like Roy.<br><br>ItÂ’s time for me to calm down and find myself. That was what I told Roy, and he had difficulty accepting it too. But sensitive and understanding as he is, he soon saw my point.<br><br>Deep within my heart, IÂ’m thoroughly thrilled that Drew and Roy had found each other when they went to be mentors for the second childrenÂ’s camp that holiday. Perhaps it lessened my guilt at rejecting Roy, or perhaps I just think that they make a better couple than Roy and I would.<br><br>Anyway, itÂ’s a fresh semester. And everything needs a fresh beginning.<br><br>(THE END)<br></div>
