            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 6.... and i do lurve giving people cliff hangers.... kekekekeke....<br>*****************************************************************************<br><br>It has been three weeks since that fateful day in Ram's room and the rumours have started to fade away. The only thing that hasn't faded is reality... and boy it bites hard.<br><br>I still can't bear the poisonous looks Cheryl gives me every time I'm within 5 metres of her presence.... and I don't know what has happened to Ram. He seemed to have disappeared and I didn't dare ask the rest, for they are bound to know what has happened from Cheryl. And I couldn't help asking myself whether I was truly at fault..... Was it my fault? Has anybody stopped to ask about my feelings?<br><br>Every time I walk past their table towards the lecture hall, I could just feel the knives that Cheryl is dying to throw into my back... and the sneer on everyone's faces... except Roy.<br><br>He's an enigma, in a way. He still has that stone cold expression every time I see him, and I couldn't help but wonder why he had been so kind to me that day.<br><br>Gosh, I feel so lonely. Without friends, without anybody to hear my woes. Even Drew, who doesn't seem to pay attention to anything else other than homework, has heard and she's avoiding me like plague, moving out of the room to our next door neighbor. While some people will be glad to have the entire hostel room to themselves, I couldn't find any joy in the situation....<br><br>*Riiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnng*<br><br>Wait a minute. Was that the phone? Is it ringing, for once, for real??<br><br>*Riiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnng*<br><br>Jumping out of my stupor, I picked it up. It was silent on the other end.<br><br>"Hello?" I ventured.<br><br>"Hi, can I speak to Pat please?" a male voice said.<br><br>"Yes, speaking. Who is this?"<br><br>"Hi Pat. Roy here. There is something that I need to tell you. Can we meet for coffee?"<br><br>Caught by surprise, I couldn't answer. Is he a friend? or foe?<br><br>"Hello? Pat? You there??"<br><br>"Err.. yes. Sure. I'll meet you." I said.<br><br>"ok, see you at Coffee Bean in half hour's time. Bye"<br><br>And the line went dead.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 7 ....<br>******************************************************<br><br>For the fifth time, I stopped myself from stirring the cup of cafe mocha. One look at the hardly recognisable brown mix dissuaded me from drinking any more.<br><br>I looked up at the person sitting opposite the table.<br><br>Roy has resumed his cold expression which I find myself becoming familiar with. His eyes looked into a distant, as if he were looking at another world, another time.<br><br>"You had something to tell me?" I ventured.<br><br>He blinked, and looked surprised to see me. He sighed a deep sigh and took a long look at me.<br><br>"Do you want to hear a story?" he asked, out of the blue.<br><br>"Sure, if you feel like telling..." I said.<br><br>"Three years ago, there was a girl named Jas. Sweet, gentle and shy. Like you, she didn't have many friends. The only friends she had were a normal, quiet guy and the circle you know as well.... Cheryl, Ram....<br><br>"Cheryl is a friendly and sweet girl, a true friend once you get to know her... but I wouldn't say the same for Ram. Then, there came a time when Jas met with problems that she couldn't bear alone and was desperate for a helping hand. Her confidante, the quiet guy, was not around as he had been sent to Brunei for military training in NS. So she turned to her closest friend, CherylÂ…"<br><br>He paused, seeming to suppress another deep sigh.<br><br>"Cheryl provided great company and encouragement to her. And it was that fateful day when Cheryl decided to celebrate her birthday by going clubbing. Jas was persuaded to go along for the sake of Cheryl."<br><br>I could see that he was having difficulty continuing as his eyes squinted, as if at some painful thought.<br><br>"What happened to you, was exactly happened to Jas, three years ago. The quiet guy had treated Ram as his best buddy for years but by the time he came back, he found that Ram has betrayed him in the worst way possible. As you know by now, Cheryl feels deeply for Ram and turned on Jas the same way she turned on you. Much worse in fact... for she too has thought Jas was her best friend. Ram apologised to the quiet guy but never in his imagination did he realise that the latter has overheard his horrible jokes about the event to his other guy friends. Neither did Ram realise how fragile Jas was, that she felt so ashamed that she couldnÂ’t bear to face her parents. In the end, the pressure was too much for her.....and she eventually committed suicide....."<br><br>He swallowed, and managed to say "In her dying note, she said she was sorry to the quiet guy and though she felt for him, she could hardly continue her life thus in shame....."<br><br>He blinked and looked away.... and at this moment, I noticed that his eyes were wet.<br><br>"That quiet guy was you?" I asked.<br><br>He couldn't speak, but barely nodded.<br><br>"but how could you still be friends with him?" I was incredulous.<br><br>He didnÂ’t answer but for a split second, his eyes shone with such viciousness and anger that it almost turned my blood cold.<br><br>Â“I hope you are stronger than JasÂ….Â” He said after a while, trailing off mid-sentence.<br><br>Me? Suicide? I donÂ’t really know. The past month had felt like hell but killing myself had never crossed my mind. I shook my head and offered a weak smile: Â“No, I wasnÂ’t thinking of killing myself.Â”<br><br>Roy sighed in relief. Seeing that Roy has fallen into his deep, sad silence again, I decided it was time to leaveÂ….<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 8...<br>*****************************************************************<br>Minutes after I was back in my room, the door opened. Drew, carrying a huge load of books and notes, seemed to have difficulty seeing where she was going. Rushing to her aid, I took some of the books off the top of the stack and she muttered a quiet Â“Thank you.Â”<br><br>I smiled, for this was the first time Drew has spoken to me in weeks! ItÂ’s bad enough that my so-called friends have landed me in dirt but worse if I had to live with someone who considers me Public Enemy #1.<br><br>Â“So, how are you?Â” I asked, attempting to make conversation and improve on our acquaintance.<br><br>Drew put down her books on her study table, turned and looked at me, uncertainly.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m ok.Â” She paused, unsure whether to continue the chat. Â“What about you?Â”<br><br>Â“Guess IÂ’m still aliveÂ…Â” I said with a sigh. Â“Sorry if I brought you any trouble.Â”<br><br>Â“No, none at allÂ…. ItÂ’s just that IÂ’ve been hearing some unkind things being said about you in schoolÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s alright. I understand. It was partly my fault, I guess, for having a crush on the wrong guy.Â”<br><br>Â“But they said you slept with himÂ…Â” She argued, and stopped, realizing that she may have said the wrong thing.<br><br>Â“That, is technically incorrect,Â” I said, feeling anger welling up inside me again. Â“I was drunk and he took advantage of me. His girlfriend came into the room the next morning and started scolding me and calling me names, andÂ….Â”<br><br>I donÂ’t know why. Maybe I was desperate for an understanding ear to listen to me. In a torrent, I related the whole incident to Drew, who listened with increasing interest. On one hand, it was good that IÂ’m making headway in getting on better terms with her, but on the other, it saddens me that it takes a crisis like this for us to communicate with each other.<br><br>And the past month had been such a horrible time for me that it felt good to be in the company of friends again. I sighed in relief as Drew put her arm around me, offering what comfort a friend can giveÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 9...<br>*******************************************************************<br>It's been more than a month since Drew and I bonded as friends and exams are drawing too damn near to spare a thought for anything else. All those weeks of skipping class with Cheryl and Ram have now begun to show effects. I couldn't understand a single thing I was reading for next weeks' paper! Taking a deep sip of the piping hot black coffee I made, I sought to clear my head so that I could cramp more nonsensical theories in my feeble brain.<br><br>"Pat!" Drew called excitedly, bursting through the room door. "YouÂ’ve got to see this!"<br><br>"What? What is it?" I asked.<br><br>It was a sweet teddy bear stuffed in a mug full of potpourri and hugging a cassette tape. On the cover of the tape were written the titles of all my favorite rock ballads. Stuck on the mug was a beautiful blue card addressed to me. For a moment, I was stunned. What is happening? Who is it from? I thought.<br><br>"IsnÂ’t it sweet? Go on, open the card and see who it is from!" Drew insisted<br><br>I took the card off the mug and opened it. Inside, written with in a neat script, was a poem:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Pat,<br><br>When skies grow dark and heavy storms rage,<br>And you feel trapped as a bird in a cage,<br>Feel no fear for help is near,<br>From a heart whose love for you is clear,<br>Who will set you free to fly the skies<br>Whose only wish is to see a smile in your eyes<br>Rest assured that well is all,<br>For IÂ’ll be there to break your fall.<br><br>All the best and good luck for the exams!<br><br>Roy</span><br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s so sweet of him!Â” Drew exclaimed, with a mischievous, suggestive twinkle in her eye.<br><br>I blushed. Â“IÂ’m sure itÂ’s nothing more than a friendly encouragement. After all, I think he knows IÂ’ve been skipping class with Ram and Cheryl and how much IÂ’ve missed in classÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ll see.Â” Drew smiled and looked at me meaningfully.<br><br>It was a huge surprise as I recalled our last conversation in which he told me the story about Jas. And though he has been giving me tuition on my subjects, I have never seen any hint that he thought of me as any other than a friend. But in my heart, I admit I was touched by this gesture and a part of me wanted this to be more than just a friendly encouragementÂ….<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 10... sorry ah... author a bit busy lately.. kekeke<br>*******************************************************************<br><br>A month had passed since I got the little gift from Roy and despite his well wishes, things didnÂ’t look very hopeful for me. I barely scrapped through my exam papers as I was too distracted to study most of the time. I felt such relief as I stepped out of the exam hall five minutes ago, after my last paper.<br><br>I shook my head, tired of starring at my own reflection in the mirror. I turned on the tap and began splashing water on my face. Just as I was about to leave the toilet, a sob came from the last cubicle. That was strange. I didn't even notice that somebody was in there.<br><br>I stopped walking and listened more intently. More sobs rose from behind the cubicle door. I walked closer, with the courage that I wouldn't have given the same situation happening in the middle of the night.<br><br>I stopped outside the cubicle and listened. Someone is crying, and quite badly too, from the sounds I heard. I pushed gently on the door and found it locked. Finding no other way, I knocked gently on the door.<br><br>"Hello? Are you alright?" I asked.<br><br>The sobs came to a sudden halt.<br><br>"Who is it?" A distraught voice asked. "What do you want?"<br><br>"My name is Pat." I said. "I heard you crying and thought you might need some help."<br><br>"I don't need any help, from anyone!" She retorted.<br><br>With that, the door swung open and standing there, face streaked with tears, is Cheryl.<br><br>"I will never need any help from you, even if you were the last person alive!" She said angrily.<br><br>I was stunned. I didn't know what to do. Part of me wanted to run away in shame and the other part wanted to stand my ground and tell her the truth.<br><br>Cheryl took a step towards the sink and suddenly, she was falling to her knees. I could barely reach out in time to grab her arms before she fell. How weak she is! I realised when her limp arms tried to pull away from my grip.<br><br>"Please, you are too weak. Let me help you." I pleaded.<br><br>Frustrated with her futile efforts to push me away, she relented. I helped her to a seat at the study bench outside the exam hall and as she sat, I noticed that tears were still flowing down her cheeks.<br><br>Something drastic must have happened to her, I thought. And I felt sorry for her.<br><br>I took out some tissue and handed it to her, which she accepted reluctantly and tried to dry her tears.<br><br>Taking a seat on the bench across the table, I asked, "Cheryl, are you alright?"<br><br>She shook her head slightly and more tears fell. I waited patiently as she tried to stop her tears. Gradually, her sobbing abated and she turned to look at me. I was bracing myself from another barage of insults and retorts from her but to my surprise, her expression showed that she felt no anger at that point.<br><br>"Pat," she said, swallowing, as if she had difficulty continuing the sentence.<br><br>"I'm sorry...I didn't mean to be so nasty to you."<br><br>My jaw dropped when I heard her say these words, I couldn't believe my ears. Before a word could come out from my lips, she started to pour out her sorrows to me.<br><br>"Pat....I knew it was really mean of me to tell everyone about what had happened to you. But I was really blinded by anger that day. I thought we could be best of friends and I was very hurt by the thought that you have betrayed me."<br><br>When she said these words, tears started to flow down her puffy eyes like a running tap once again. I was aching to tell her the truth but perhaps drowning in my pitiful emotions for her I didn't utter a word. I knew that no matter what I say now, what's done is done. I merely kept quiet with my head bowed.<br><br>Â”ItÂ’s alright. It doesnÂ’t matter nowÂ…Â” I assured her. Despite my reassurances, her tears did not stop.<br><br>Worried for her, I asked gently: Â“What happened? Why are you so upset now?Â”<br><br>And it was after much hesitation that Cheryl began her storyÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>epi 11<br>***************************************************************<br>Â“Ram dumped meÂ…. Can you believe that? After everything that IÂ’ve gone through for him?Â” Cheryl looked at me with pleading eyes.<br><br>I didnÂ’t know what to say because I didnÂ’t really know everything that has happened in their relationship.<br><br>Â“4 years of relationshipÂ… and every time he strayed, I wanted to end it all, and he would beg me to take him back. The times IÂ’ve been betrayed by him, the times IÂ’ve put up wit his dallyingÂ…and apparently all that was for naught!Â” with that, Cheryl broke into tears again.<br><br>Â“And now he has dumped me, pointing fingers at me for being unfaithful? How could he say that? How DARE he say that?? When the baby is his!!Â”<br><br>Shock rocked through me. A baby? RamÂ’s baby? Cheryl is having RamÂ’s baby? What is she going to do?<br><br>I was stunned. I couldnÂ’t speak and what spare comfort and reassurance I could offer Cheryl earlier evaporated in an instant.<br><br>Cheryl couldnÂ’t stop crying. Helplessly, she clung onto me and drenched my shoulders in her tears.<br><br>Â“Anything that I can help?Â” a gentle male voice sounded behind me. Roy!<br><br>Taking a quick look at Cheryl and me, Roy sensitively suggested that we should go somewhere more private to talk. With Roy supporting the weak Cheryl, we walked back to the hostel.<br><br>As we walked back to my room, I kept thinking about the ordeal that Cheryl is going through. What can she do? How can we help? How will her parents react when they find out? HowÂ…?<br><br>As my mind reeled in turmoil, I was glad that Roy showed up. Quiet, sensitive and reliable, heÂ’s like the knight in shining armor, appearing wherever there is needÂ….<br></div>
