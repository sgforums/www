            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 12<br>*************************************************************<br><br>I sat there waiting uncomfortably, feeling 4 pairs of eyes looking at me. The nurses saw me look up and went back to sorting their patient records. I glanced around and the two expecting women sitting in the clinic hastily found some magazines to occupy their attention.<br><br>I glanced around as I waited impatiently for Cheryl, shifting in my seat and trying not to look at the posters of healthy babies that plastered the walls. Cheryl has gone into the doctorÂ’s office for a long, long time and I was beginning to be worried about her.<br><br>The door opened and Cheryl walked out, looking pale and miserable. Speechlessly, she took a seat next to me on the waiting bench.<br><br>Â“What happened? What did the gynae say??Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“Oh PatÂ… what shall I do? I canÂ’t let my parents know about this but abortion seems like such an awful thing to go through? The doctor showed me a video, about abortion, and you know what? IÂ’m feeling so guilty that I donÂ’t think I can go through it! IÂ’m killing a life if I go for abortion! I simply can't go through this... and how can I afford it? I don't have any savings and I can't borrow money from my parents for this too! What shall I do?Â” Cheryl asked helplessly.<br><br>I didnÂ’t know what to say nor how to advise her. I could only look on and wait patiently as she attempts to rationalize her decision.<br><br>Â“But Ram doesnÂ’t want me anymore and even if he does, I donÂ’t think this will work out. I canÂ’t bring a baby to this world where it will suffer even more with ill-prepared parents such as us. And how will the child live with the fact that he was unwanted, born out of wedlock? How will we survive? I can't support the baby on my own... and I can't get my parents to help! No! Giving birth to the child and letting it suffer such a life is even crueler than anything else.Â”<br><br>At this point, Cheryl looked at me. Â“Pat, please, help me. Tell me that it is right to abort the child. I need your support right now.Â”<br><br>I couldnÂ’t answer. I stared at her in disbelief that she wanted me to condone her act. I drew a deep breath and then said: Â“Look, itÂ’s still early. Barely two weeks old. You donÂ’t have to decide whether to abort it now, do you? Why donÂ’t you take a week to think about it?Â”<br><br>A mixture of relief and disappointment showed on CherylÂ’s beautiful face. She nodded silently and waited for the nurses to finalise her documents.<br><br>As we walked silently from the gynaeÂ’s office, Cheryl was exceedingly silent and deep in thought. Her internal struggle to come to a conclusion was apparent, for she barely noticed it when we reached her hostel. She was still so deep in thought that she didnÂ’t notice someone standing at her door.<br><br>Dressed elegantly in a jacket suit with her hair in all the right places, the middle-aged woman looked out of place on the hostel corridor. Her long fingers bent and clenched lightly into a fist as she knocked on CherylÂ’s door. Just then, she noticed us walking towards her.<br><br>Â“Cheryl, where have you been?Â” She said in slightly stern voice, annoyance creasing her elegant features.<br><br>Cheryl looked up and in horror she exclaimed. Â“MomÂ…!Â”<br></div>

I tried to be as inconspicuous as I can in the room but every now and then, I could almost sense CherylÂ’s urge to seek rescue from me. After quite a while, her mom seemed to have given up and sighed heavily.<br><br>Â“Cheryl, CherylÂ… while IÂ’m glad youÂ’ve put on a bit of weight, making yourself look healthier, IÂ’m worried about you. You havenÂ’t been home for months and you have even stopped calling home these past three weeks. Is everything alright? Are you coping well?Â”<br><br>She sipped her coffee impatiently as she waited for CherylÂ’s response.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m fine momÂ…Â” Cheryl stammeredÂ… and sort of whimpered into silence again.<br><br>Taking a long look at her daughter, she slipped into deep thought, stirring her cup of coffee subconsciously.<br><br>Â“SighÂ… Cheryl dear. IÂ’m glad so long as you are okayÂ…. I know I have been busy with work and didnÂ’t really spend as much time with you as I would have liked, but ultimately, what IÂ’ve always wanted for you is that youÂ’ll be happyÂ….Â”<br><br>Tears threatened to flow over the brim of CherylÂ’s eyes. She bowed her head even lower, not speaking a word. Under the table, I reached over and gave her hand a comforting squeeze. She looked up at me, as if pleading for advice.<br><br>Â“Do what is best. She cares.Â” I mouthed the words to her as her mom took another sip of the coffee.<br><br>Cheryl gave a small shake of her head and looked down at her hands again.<br><br>Â“WellÂ… if everything is fine, then I should get goingÂ…Â” CherylÂ’s mom got up to leave.<br><br>Seeing no response from Cheryl, I got up to open the door for her. Just then, Cheryl looked up.<br><br>Â“Mom, IÂ’m sorry!Â” She cried. With that, Cheryl broke into sobs.<br><br>Puzzlement crossed her momÂ’s face. Reeling from shock and uncertain what happened to cause this breakdown, she could only stretch out her arms to hug her daughter as the latter cried uncontrollably.<br><br>Seeing that it is best to leave them alone, I quietly left the roomÂ…..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 14.....<br>**************************************************************<br>A day after CherylÂ’s mom visited her in the hostel, Cheryl moved home. And yesterday, Cheryl finally gave me a call, after leaving me in suspense for a whole week.<br><br>Â“Hi Pat,Â” she said, sounding much happier and at peace now over the phone.<br><br>Â“Hi Cheryl, you sound much better. How are things?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“Thanks for sticking by me during that awful time. I told my mom everything, and instead of scolding me, she was very supportive and understanding. It took me by surprise too, but she convinced my dad to be supportive as well.Â”<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s great!Â” I said, feeling all the happiness for her.<br><br>Â“YupÂ… and after consulting my parents, we decided that I should still go for the abortionÂ… and my parents have already applied for my transfer of school. After the holidays, IÂ’ll be starting my new term in Melbourne instead.Â”<br><br>Â“Really? I meanÂ… while IÂ’m happy youÂ’ve got things sorted out with your parentsÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“YupÂ… I think the transfer will be for the bestÂ… But IÂ’ll definitely keep in touch with you! WeÂ’ve grown to be such close friends and I will surely miss you while IÂ’m there!Â” she said.<br><br>I smiled at the recollection, in my heart wishing Cheryl all the best as her life takes on a new page with her parentsÂ’ loving support.<br><br>Squinting at the clock, I stretched myself on the bed. Gosh... it feels so good to be home.<br>After months of staying in the hostel, I sure missed Mom's cooking and all the comforts of not having to do my own chores. Not to mention the occasional jests and irritation from Kenny, my younger brother.<br><br>"So when are you going to wake up, brush your teeth and have lunch?" Mom asked, yelling from the kitchen.<br><br>Stretching my arms, I looked around the familiar bedroom that I have woken up in for 20 years.<br><br>"Coming, Mom..." I grumbled sleepily. It's noon. How long has it been since I woke up this late?<br><br>Dragging myself to the bathroom, I took a quick shower and went to the kitchen. Mom was watching tv in the living room and everyone else was out.<br><br>"Morning, Mom." I said.<br><br>"Morning?" she said. "It's noon already! Really wonder what you do in school that makes you so sleepy-head."<br><br>Thinking back of the past semester, I merely shook my head with a smile.<br><br>"Oh, by the way, your friend called."<br><br>I looked up from the dinner table, surprised. Why didn't I hear the phone ring? Who could that be? Everyone has gone home to enjoy family time, so who would be calling me early in the morning??<br><br>"It's a guy," Mom said, coming to sit beside me at the table. I looked at her and saw her looking at me intently, a smile playing at the corners of her lips.<br><br>"Is it your boyfriend?"<br><br>I hoped not. It's been months since I've walked away from Ram and I sure hoped he wasn't the one who called.<br><br>"What's his name?" I asked.<br><br>"Can't remember lah. All you youngsters have such wierd English names that I can hardly pronounce. Think it was Loy or Ray or something...Â” she said, trying to remember the name.<br><br>Roy?? Why did he call? What happened? I wonderÂ… Still in a daze and pondering on the reason for the call, I noticed a spread in front of my eyes calling out to me. It wasn't really a spread with lots of dishes and all but Mom had whipped up my all-time favorite, mashed potatos and beef lasagne. The aroma filled my nostrils and my stomache was growling from the long sleep. I dug in and ate like a monster.<br><br>It was a truly satisfying meal. With so much thought and love put into whipping up my lunch, I could see Mom smiling widely, with her gums showing when I said,' Thanks Mom! It was the best lunch I ever had since I left for school.'<br><br>Remembering the call from Roy, I gave Mom a big hug and strolled towards the phone.<br><br>'Hi, It's Pat here? I was still in dreamland when you called. Did anything happen?' I said with a tinge of doubt and a worried heart.<br><br>'Oh! No, all's fine. You called just in time. I will be around your neighbourhood to get some necessities that my Mom needed. So......I was wondering if you wanna meet up for coffee?' Roy replied with a quivering voice.<br><br>We agreed to meet up in an hour's time at the Starbucks cafe near my house. I can't understand why I am euphoric and at the same time, tognue-tied after setting up the appointment with Roy. I didn't stop to ponder upon this emotion but went straight up to my room and picked out my favorite sun-dress.<br><br>'Mom! I'll be out for coffee with a school friend, will be back soon!' I shouted across the living room.<br><br>'Be careful!' a faint sound came from the kitchen and the door was shut behind me. Walking towards the cafe seemed like a breeze today despite a 15min walk under the scorching sun. Soon, I spotted someone who looks like Roy but I wasn't absolutely sure. I continued my light-hearted steps towards the empty table in the veranda. I was glancing around the cafe when I heard a gentle voice.<br><br>'Pat?' Roy called and I trailed the sound to familiar stranger. I was dumb-founded. It was Roy in his casual beach wear and he never looked more gorgeous. He had newly found skin just within a few days. His hazel-colored eyes were a perfect match to his bronze and toned body.<br><br>'Hi! I couldn't recognise you with this makeover you had.' I walked gracefully towards the table with a racing pulse and sat down with wearing a big smile on my face. As he ordered drinks, I was silently glad that he called.<br><br>'It's great to be home isn't it?!' Roy exclaimed with an alluring smile.<br><br>I nodded and noticed that he was looking at me with those intense eyes. I could feel my cheeks exploding in flames........<br></div>
