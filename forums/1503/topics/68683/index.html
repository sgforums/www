I couldn't help the feeling of anxiety and anticipation within me -- it's a brand new beginning! It's the first day of school and today is my 19th birthday.<br><br>Having just moved into the hostel this morning, I didn't have time to check out my roommate and neighbours, but it seemed like a pretty amiable crowd. Just hope that they don't mind me playing my games late into the night.<br><br>I can't wait for lessons to start so that everyone can start introducing themselves, including that guy half a head taller than everyone in the room. Oh god, when was the last time I had a man. The last one wasn't even half a man. This one sure looks interesting.<br><br>"My name is Ramazan, from Germany," his guttural voice resonating in the lecture room when it was his turn to speak.<br><br>"Ramazan doesnÂ’t sound like a German name" I responded.<br><br>With a cat like speed that's contrary to his huge frame, he turned around and shot me a glance. Upon meeting my gaze, his face soften and offered an explanation "My parents migrated from Turkey to Germany when I was born"<br><br>No wonder he had such a thick German accent. His curly locks are framed on a nice set of cheekbones, with big brown deep set eyes.<br><br>Lecture has indeed become more interesting...<br><br>(to be continued)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 2 is here....<br>*********************************************************************<br><br>Argh... it's finally over... or at least the first half of a boring day is...<br><br>I can't believe that after 6 months of holidaying and doing part-times mean that I'll get this bored in class, that is, minus the minutes I've been looking at Ramazan.<br><br>Suddenly, thoughts of a Turkish prince sweeping me away from this mudane university to a romantic escapade in the middle-east come to mind.<br><br>"Hey! Hello! You're in my class, right?"<br><br>I turned around to see a face that is probably many girls' envy and some other girls' worst enemy. Large, bright eyes, cheery smile, on a smooth, fair face framed with luscious black hair. Gosh, she's pretty. How can she bring herself to associate with an ugly duckling like me?<br><br>"Yeah, I think you were sitting in front of me in class just now. Hi, I'm Cheryl"<br><br>"Hi," I managed a weak smile. "I'm Pat."<br><br>"Nice to meet you. Isn't it great? First day of school? How about catching lunch together?"<br><br>She seemed sincere and friendly enough. Maybe it was the beginning of a new friendship, I thought.<br><br>"Sure, why not?"<br><br>"Let's sit over there?" she pointed towards the first table at the front of the canteen as she spoke. "Some of my friends are there and they'll be delighted to meet you!"<br><br>I looked where she pointed and there he was again..... Ramazan.<br><br>"Come on" I could barely stop myself from staring as she led me by the hand to the table.<br><br>"Hi everyone, I'll like you to meet Pat." Cheryl said as we sat at the table. " I believe you have met Ram."<br><br>She pointed at Ramazan and I barely nodded.<br><br>A lanky guy sitting on his right with an arm around a girl with short hair and freckles extended his hand and said, "Hi, I'm Jason. ItÂ’s nice to meet you. And this is my girlfriend, Lisa."<br><br>I shook his hand and nodded to Lisa, "Nice to meet you."<br><br>"So you were the one asking Ram about his name. I'm Kate," said a girl with long curly hair, giving me a really friendly smile and has such twinkling eyes that I couldn't resist smiling back.<br><br>"Hi, it's nice to meet you." I said, barely able to contain my blush when she mentioned the blooper I made in class.<br><br>"And you know who I am," said Ram in a low voice. I smiled at him and noticed what deep, dark eyes he has, the kind that you dream about in romance novels of Prince Charming looking into your soul, mersmerising.<br><br>He turned and looked at the guy on his left. Strange that I have never noticed there was anyone sitting there.<br><br>A short, small-build fellow, with clean-shaven face and eyes that look straight at you as though he has nothing to fear.<br><br>"I'm Roy." He managed a small smile and went back to his quiet, expressionless demeanor.<br><br>"Hi," I said quietly. Just then, Cheryl laughed.<br><br>"Oh he's always like that. Don't be bothered with him. Come on, let's go get lunch. I'm hungry."<br><br>I wish I could dismiss his manner as easily as Cheryl. I can't help but think about what did I do wrong to make Roy angry or something. He certainly didn't seem to like me as a friend as much as the others.<br><br>(to be continued)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 3...<br>*************************************************************************<br><br>*Riiiiiiiiiiinnnngggggg*<br><br>Oops, that's the phone and I'm not ready!!<br><br>The week seemed to fly past so fast that I didn't realise it was Friday already. And with all that excitement of getting to know Cheryl, Ram (dear, dear Ramazan...), and meeting them for lunch everyday that I can't really believe that Friday is already here!<br><br>"Are you getting that?" a bespectacled girl with long hair and small voice asked.<br><br>"Yes! Sorry, Drew." Drew is my new roommate and seems pretty OK. A quiet sort of girl that spends practically every minute of her waking moment studying and that is up till 2 am in the morning. Wonder if she ever has any fun?<br><br>"Hello," I said as I picked up the phone.<br><br>"Hi babe. Are you ready to go?" A low, masculine voice answered on the other end of the line.<br><br>"Ram! Oh.... just give me a couple more minutes and I'll meet you in the carpark."<br><br>"Going out late tonight?" Drew asked, just as I put down the receiver.<br><br>"Yeah," I said. "Meeting up with the guys for dinner and probably go pub-hopping after that."<br><br>Was it my imagination or did Drew roll her eyes? I couldn't be sure but the latter sure didn't sound happy to have a roommate that goes out late every night. GreatÂ… first Roy doesnÂ’t care a hoot whether he stepped on my toe every time I see him and now my roommate is going to be another difficult-to-handle person. Good thing that I still have the rest of my social life intact with Cheryl and Ram.<br><br>Noticing that my "couple of minutes" was nearly up, I grabbed my bag and stepped out of the room, glad to be released from the pressure-cooker for the night.<br><br>I walked to the carpark to see Ram, handsome in his black shirt that showed off his biceps, standing next to a sporty red Mazda.<br><br>"Come on, gorgeous," he said, smiling his irresistible smile.<br><br>Me? Gorgeous? That's a first, and it sounded great hearing it from Ram. This is certainly going to be a happening evening...<br><br>(to be continued)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 4...<br>******************************************************************************<br><br>I opened my eyes to the mid-noon light shining through the windows. Is it noon already?? Have I truly slept that long?<br><br>I closed my eyes and tried to think about last night. It was a complete blur...<br><br>We were partying at Velvet Underground, as we did every Friday since the first week of school. Then, Cheryl insisted on treating me to a Flaming Lambrogini for my birthday. I vaguely remember drinking and swallowing a thick, sweet mixture and then, everything else after that came in a montage of flashing disco lights, booming music and shadows. Ram's shadow.<br><br>He was attentive, more so than over the past month since I've known him. I could barely feel his arms wrapped around my shoulders, protecting me, showering me with sweet words of reassurance and asking me how I felt.<br><br>I felt my cheeks starting to flush as I thought about the way he brushed his finger on my cheek, as he bent to kiss me for the first time. Hesitant at first, tender and passionate later....<br><br>Feeling a headache coming on, I opened my eyes and suddenly, everything seemed clearer.<br><br>Wait a minute... since when did I have a poster of Jennifer Lopez hanging on the wall in front of the bed?<br><br>Just as I turned to look around, a deep voice sounded beside me, "Good morning, babe."<br><br>Oh my god! What have I done? Where am I?<br><br>I turned to the voice to find Ram lying on the bed beside me.<br><br>Sound of keys jingled outside the door as it was unlocked and opened. Ram and I sat up from bed and looked towards the door. I heard Ram curse under his breath as a shadow stepped into the room.<br><br>"What the...." the shadow said. With those words, I had the shock of my life as I realised who just came in. Cheryl.<br><br>What is going on? Why does Cheryl have keys to Ram's room? What is she doing here?<br><br>She launched her attack before I had time to think. "Pat! How could you!"<br><br>I was stunned. I never knew that Ram and Cheryl were a couple. How was I to know? And even if I did, I was drunk!<br><br>"Cheryl, I..."<br><br>"You b.itch! How dare you sleep with HIM!? I thought you were a good friend but you turned out to be worst traitor! How dare you sleep with MY boyfriend!"<br><br>"What? Ram's your boyfriend?"<br><br>"You s.lutty b.itch! Don't you dare pretend you didn't know!"<br><br>I truly didn't. But I didn't have time to explain before she hit me across my cheek with a hard, tight slap. It would have been worse if Ram had not leapt out of bed and restrained Cheryl from doing more.<br><br>"Get out of here," she screamed. "Get out of my sight! I don't ever want to see you again! You slut! Get OUT!"<br><br>I wanted to explain that I was drunk and knew nothing about what happened. But I couldn't. Shamefaced, I put on my clothes and ran out of the room as Cheryl continued to hurl insults at me.<br><br>As I ran down the stairs, i could barely control the tears streaming from my eyes. I couldn't understand what was going on, why it happened and how. I couldn't think straight. I felt deeply hurt with Ram's actions and Cheryl's words.<br><br>Seeing the door to my own room was a relief so strong that it overwhelmed me. I sobbed breathlessly as I struggled with the lock and opened the door to my refuge. Good thing that Drew had gone home for the weekend.<br><br>I slammed the door shut, collapsed onto my bed and cried my heart out.<br><br>(to be continued)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 5..........<br>**********************************************************************<br><br>I wished I were dead.<br><br>I couldn't bear the thought of seeing Cheryl and Ram and the rest of the gang in school today. My feet felt like stone as I made my way to the canteen. The weekend had seemed like an eternity of torture.<br><br>Drew came back last night to see me staring into space on my bed.<br><br>"What happened to you?" she asked. "Didn't hang out with your friends tonight?"<br><br>I couldn't bring myself to say anything and managed only a slight shake of my head. Drew looked at me with a strange expression on her face and decided that I was better left alone. She then packed her homework and spent the night with my neighbor, Maggie.<br><br>I looked up from my feet to see the usual buzz of people walking around, chatting, laughing with their friends in the canteen. I sneaked a glance at the table where we usually meet to find nobody there. Slightly relieved, I walked towards the lecture theatre.<br><br>As I entered through the door, I couldn't help but notice a hush from the noisy class. Then the whispers began. I looked around to see my classmates huddled in small groups of three or four, all looking at me with a strange expression and whispering among themselves. Some of them pointed at me, while others smirked as I walked towards my seat.<br><br>They knew. They knew what happened and I'm the culprit. I felt a sense of helplessness and rage that why was I the culprit when I had been a victim myself?? I was date raped for heaven's sake, I thought.<br><br>More tears threatened to flow from my swollen eyes and I could feel the pressure of their stares weighing me down at the shoulders.<br><br>I needed to get out of here. I needed help! Is there anyone to help me??<br><br>Just then, I felt someone sit down beside me. A tissue was thrust into my hands. I accepted it with thanks and tried to dry my tears as a quiet male voice said, "Just ignore them. I know you were the real victim."<br><br>I looked up to see the last person I had expected to see on a situation like this. Roy.<br></div>
