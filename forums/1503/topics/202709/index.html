            <div class='col-md body'>hi Mirumoto,<br>Ok, after reading your pm, i do understand a few things.<br>in <strong>Kyler</strong>, you are writing generally about life, but from a radically different angle. this is interesting. There can be many interpretations to the piece.<br><br>i was thinking more of bourbon than orange juice in Southern blend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

Somehow I get this feeling you are describing predatory men, who make traps among attractive things (pricey tags and spices) . However they also get tired of things easily, it's as if they need new prey all the time to satisfy their appetite. This is why Kyler is only happy for a while after lunch, then he becomes restless again and starts thinking about how to catch his next meal. If the current location or situation, no longer suits him, he simply moves on.</div>
