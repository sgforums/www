            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #6<br><br>I was left stranded where I was. Cyndi was too embarassed and took flight and the rest went after her to see if she's ok. Jason gave Vince a dirty look before he did so too. There I was with my feet like lead, not knowing to follow or not. If I follow would she feel worse? If I don't, what am I to say to Vince?<br><br>Vince moved towards me, with his eyes intensely fixed on me. Suddenly the grass on the ground seems so intriging...<br><br>"So you heard us?"<br>Gosh how could I not? I could just nodded with my eyes fixed on the grass.... Reaching over, he hold my hand.<br>"Is she the reason why u were avoiding me?" His hand gentlely lifted up my head, and I looked right into his eyes. How can I hide my feelings or ignore him any further?<br>"She has like you from the start... I can't do this...."<br>"Well, I have like you from the start... I can't not do this...."<br>Stunned and touched, I could only stare at him.<br>"Anyway, she knows now. So what do you say? Would you......"<br>I let out a sign and gave in....<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Things have since changed. Cyndi has no longer talked to me, and so were Jason and gang. Strangely, without her around, I seems to be focusing more in class and catching up in my school works. Well, what else can I do? My only console is during break, having meal with Vince. We were together besides the time we were in our own classes. He has been the sweetest to me. Perhaps because now I have no more friends in school.<br><br>I have refused to listen to any of the horrible rumours that were going around about me. It did affected me in the beginning, but I soon realised, people were just interested in gossips, not my explaination or rather my attempt to explain.<br><br>"Jo...."<br>I looked up and smiled, I was waiting for Vince after school as usual. Today he was exceptionally late.<br>"Let's go."<br>He seems abit out of himself today. As we walked out, I took a side glance at him. Something seems strange... His bus came before mine and this time he grabbed my hand and pulled me to broad it.<br><br>"Err.... but this is your bus."<br>"I know..." He turned and looked at me. And for the first time since school ended he smiled. He leaned over and whispered into my ear, "Let's go to my place today." I was abit taken aback... usually he'll just send me home or we'll have lunch together before he does.<br><br>Seeing how awkwardly shy I was, he gave me a mischevious grin. We sat quietly in the bus, not speaking a word. His hand holding mine all the while.<br><br>For the first time, I get to see where he stays. Outside his humble flat I saw pots of cactus and flowers. Even a pot of chilli blooms.<br><br>"Is your mum around?" I was kinda worried to finally 'meet the parents'... I wasn't even prepared and I came empty handed. Is this supposed to be so?<br>"She's not around. No one is...."<br>"Huh?" I stopped short at the door, not knowing if I should be there, alone with him. But he has opened the door and showed me in.<br><br>It was a humble, simple flat. Nothing fancy but neat and tidy. He held my hand and guided me in another room. It was his bedroom. Kinda cramped with all his marital arts stuffs, trophies from his ecas, his sport gears and tons of magazines.<br><br>Surprisingly with all his stuffs it's still pretty neat. "Neater than mine." I said aloud. There ain't a single chair, so we sat on his bed. While I was looking around, examining his trophies, suddenly I felt him leaned over to me. My heart starts to flutter and I felt my face blushing... Closer and closer he came, and I closed my eyes....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #7<br><br>Was it me or the temperature in the room was rising? I was sweating in the cool of the day. I couldn't think nor have the time to. Emotions of estacy has took over me as his kisses melted away all my defenses and logics.<br><br>After the mind blowing passion, he held me in his arms. I was soaked in heavenly bliss as I laid there quiet, not wanting to break the magic of the moment.<br><br>"Rrriinnngg...." the phone broke the silence and he got up to answer.<br>"Hello? Yah.... how much?..... hmm... ok.... no problem, later."<br>He turned and looked at me.<br>"Sorry I gotta go out now. You mind to go back on your own?"<br>"Sure, no problem." Even when I wanted to stay longer with him, I just don't have the guts to say it out.<br><br>As we leave his place, he was quiet all the way. We walked past an atm and he stopped to withdraw some cash. In fact, quite a bit of cash, a couple of hundreds. Sensing my question, he explained to me. It's for his friends. Apparently, they have been asking money from him. And he just gave. I couldn't understand why and dare not probe. Should I ask? I do not know. I left on my own while he went to meet his friends, whom I have never met.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I haven't seen him for the past 2 days in school. And he never pick up my calls. I couldn't help but wonder wat went wrong? Everything was fine till now. There wasn't a sign of anything that might went wrong. Did I do something stupid? Was he ok?<br><br>As I walked out of school in a daze, I heard someone called out to me. I turned around and saw Jason.<br><br>"You have time? Maybe we go for kopi? There's something I wanna talk to you about."<br>"Err... sure."<br>Jason was solemnly quiet through out. And the silence was simply too awkward. As we sat down at a cafe with some drinks, Jason let out a deep sigh.<br><br>"is everything ok?" I finally asked.<br>"Yes and no."<br>I sat there, took a sip of my latte and waited for him to open up.<br>"Are you seeing tat Vince?" he finally broke the silence.<br>I nodded. Well at least I think we are still seeing each other.<br>"You shouldn't!"<br>I was taken aback by his angry outburst.<br>"I'm sorry. I mean you should really reconsider it."<br>"Why?"<br>"He's not a good person. Do you know anything about him?"<br>I shaked my head. Seriously I really don't know much about Vince. He has been really sweet to me, but he have never told me anything about his past or watever. I don't even know who are the friends he hang out with.<br><br>"He's with a group of hell riders. He's in gang!"<br>I was shocked. "This must be a mistake." I defended.<br>And Jason began to tell me all about Vince. Apparently he's the "bad boy" in school, always getting into trouble. Hang out at nights with his gangster friends to the wee hours. Getting into fights and ending up at police stations.<br><br>Suddenly everything made sense. He was often very tired in the morn for school. His hush hush phone calls. He always going out late at nights. His never introducing me to his friends, and even we met people he knew on the streets, he will just let go of my hand. So this was the reason.<br><br>"Jo you ok?"<br>"Yah I guess so." I mumbled.<br>Jason reached over the table and held my hand. "I just don't wanna see u hurt." I stared at Jason blankly. Was he blushing? Gosh! What is happening?!<br><br>"I've always like you. But I was too shy to say anything to you. And after Cyndi's ordeal, it's hard or rather impossible for me to talk to you. And I realised how much I miss you..." I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Jason likes me?! This is impossible! And he was to me too confident to be shy.<br><br>"I know I am silly. I even went to warn Vince to leave you alone..."<br>"You wat?!"<br>Then the whole story came out. The other day Vince was late because Jason was 'talking' to him. How Vince was upset that Jason interferred and vowed to hurt me in ways he can't even imagine.<br><br>Coming to my senses, I moved my hand away. "Thanks for telling me all these. But... It's... it's... just too late." With that, I ran off before tears would flow down my cheeks. I don't believe what I have heard, and I know I don't want to. Surely this is not true, even if Vince is a gangster so wat? but he can't be doing this just to hurt me... or could he?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #8<br><br>The past few days I was just in a daze. Lectures and tutorials just flew by without me hearing a single word from the lecturers. All I could think of is Vince. He has been "too busy" to talk to me since. And I didn't know how to confront him, or perhaps I didn't want to.<br><br>Sitting in the canteen alone during break, at our usual quiet corner, I sipped my cup of coffee slowly. Half hoping that Vince would join me today, and half wishing no one will talk to me. I'm just not ready to face anyone. But my wish didn't come through....<br><br>"Oooooh... someone is so lonely huh?" the once familar voice pierced the silence. I looked up and saw Cyndi with a snear on her face. Great, the last person I want to face. I looked down and kept quiet, hoping that she'll just go away. Seeing my failure to defend myself, she started a whole series of verbal assaults at me. Though I was so shut out that I didn't really hear what she was throwing at me, but the sense of self pity just overwhelmed me. Suddenly I just burst out crying. All these days of uncertainty, fear and desperation seemed to pour out all at once.<br><br>Cyndi was so shocked that she stopped her assaults and just stared at me. Just as she turned to go away, someone grabbed her and pushed her to the ground. Hearing the sound of her falling to the ground, I looked up. And to my horror, it's Jason! He was hiding from afar and when he saw me crying he couldn't contain himself and came to me.<br><br>"What the h~~~~" Cyndi screamed.<br>"Shut up will ya! Look what you've done to Jo already..." Jason snapped at her and came over and pulled me into his arms.<br>"It's ok, no one can hurt you now. I'm here..."<br>I must admit, I felt really safe since a long long time, here with my head against his chest. I have forgotten how much I long for some one's support and care. Deeply touched, I put my arms around his waist and sobs quietly. Just as I was drowning myself in the gentleness of Jason, I heard a voice.<br><br>"So this is what it's all about."<br>We turned and saw Vince, standing there with his arms crossed. His face was stone cold and his tone was piercing. I quickly released my arms ard Jason.<br>"No wonder you don't seems to miss me at all. You are in 'safe' arms..."<br>"No, it's not what you think.... I..."<br>"Forget it. If you can do this in school, outside school? Ha! No holds barred eh?"<br><br>I was shocked, I have never seen Vince in this manner. How could he say this of me? All I could do was to shake my head and sob.<br>"Hey don't you accuse Jo!" Jason jumped to my defence .. again.<br>"Well it doesn't matter to me anymore, you can have her. I already had... Haha!"<br>At that Jason threw a punch at Vince, and before I could react a fight broke out and the commotion drew a large crowd around us. And unfortunately, our discipline master was also in the crowd.<br></div>
