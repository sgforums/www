Not true meh???</div></blockquote>Personal View:<br>I think they prefer non-violent 'fighting'. Once violence is involved, it becomes quite an eye-sore actually. Like uncivilised beast like that, treating the girl as a prize for winning a battle instead.<br><br>Friendly fighting is like competition. With competition, egoistic guys will motivate and push each other to greater heights to win a girl's heart. Which implies that the girl will receive more love from the guys. And i think everyone likes to be loved. So they like it when they are wanted and fought nicely for lo. But the downside might be that the winner will slacken after the competition is removed, and the girl will feel 'cheated' by the decrease in love from the guy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #13<br><br>Seated at the cafe that afternoon, Vince began to tell of his side of the story...<br><br>"Since the first day of school, I've noticed you. I was actually seated behind you in the bus as the whole bus load of us were late. You wasn't really pretty, but there's an aura of nonchantant charm about you. Your eyes wide and sparkling, as you glazed out of the window, trying to recognise the way. As we alighted and stood at the back of the assembly, I noticed how bored you were, just like me." Vince said smilingly as he stirred his coffee.<br><br>"I though I will never get to know you. It's just not me to approach a gal. But heaven must have noticed and helped me. That day at the mrt station, Cyndi approached me. I know it's wrong of me, I accepted her date because of you."<br><br>"After all the things we went through, we finally got together. That was the happiest days I had. But deep down I know, this would end some day..." he signed.<br><br>"Remember that day I made you waited for me after school? That was because Jason came to have a talk with me. He warned me not to hurt you, and that I don't deserve to be with you. I know he is right. The next few days I didn't went school, it wasn't that I was trying to avoid you. It was because I was hospitalized..."<br><br>"You're what??!!!" I had to interrupted. "What happened? Why didn't you tell me about it?"<br><br>Vince took a long look at me and signed. "How could I? Am I supposed to tell you I was hospitalized because of a broken arm I got from a gang fight? And all that you heard about me as a gangster is true?"<br><br>We both fell into a deep silence. I was speechless, not knowing what to say.<br><br>Finally he spoke again. "I don't want you to get into any trouble because of me. A number of my gangster friends had seen you around with me and recognised you already. If they do, so would my enemies. I can't afford any harm to come to you. And you are such an innocent gal, you're too good for me. I know my days of happiness has to come to an end..."<br><br>"I didn't know how to tell you. So when I saw u crying in Jason's arms, I simply took the opportunity to break off...."<br><br>I looked at him in unbelief. Was that the stupidest excuse or the most painful truth? I fought back my tears that was threatening to flow.<br><br>"Then I realised how much I missed you... " Those words broke my feeble attempt and tears started to flow.<br><br>Vince gently wiped my tears with tissues. He was still so gentle and loving as before. I looked up at him and saw his expression painful and sad.<br><br>"So now... *sob* does it means it's safe for us to be together? Are you leaving the gang?"<br><br>Vince shook his head. "Are you willing to run the risk for being with me?" I stared blankly at him. I seriously don't know. Not that I fear what might come upon me. More of an uncertainty of our relationship.<br><br>"I know it's alot of you to comprehend at once. Take your time and think it through. Let me know ok?" I nodded and left. As I walked out of the cafe, I turned back. Vince was waving goodbye at me...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #14<br><br>"Ah gal, wake up!" Mum was knocking at my door. I mumbled something which I myself can't make out. I pulled my quilt over my head and continued sleeping.<br><br>I've been sleeping alot lately, especially after that day at the cafe with Vince. Perhaps it was my way of escaping. I just didn't want to face up to any situation about the three of us.<br><br>Suddenly, someone pulled my quilt away. I squinted my eyes as the afternoon sun pierced through the window.<br><br>"What?" I protested.<br>"Aiyoh, you everyday sleep sleep sleep! Wake up lah. Ah Jason is here."<br>"What??!!!" I jumped up. I turned to the door and saw Jason standing there grinning. "Arrgghhh!!!" I darted under the quilt. And the room fell into silence. I heard the door closed and peeked out of my quilt. To my horrors, sat at the edge of my bed was Jason!<br><br>"Heehee.. saw already, no need to hide." He gently tugged my quilt away.<br>"Eeeee......... why u come without telling me?" I sulked as I sat up. He's right he already saw how ugly I am in the morning, or rather when I wake up, so no point hiding.<br>"Well, I haven't heard from you for a few days..."<br>"I knew it, he's gonna ask me about my decision," I thought to myself.<br><br>To my surprise, he went on to talk about our upcoming trip to Bali. I've long forgotten we're supposed to be leaving this coming weekend. I must have looked really awkward, sitting there, twiggering my thumbs.<br><br>"Are you ok?"<br>"Huh? Yah..."<br>"If you don't want to go Bali, it's ok one, you know..." his voice faded in disappointment that even a just woke up me can detect.<br><br>After a couple of minutes of silence, I finally ask, "Well, what time is the flight har?" His eyes sparkled when he heard this.<br><br>"Morning 9:55am. I'll come pick you up at 8!"<br>I managed to squeeze out a smile and nodded. Suddenly, he pulled me into his arms and hugged me so tight I almost can't breathe.<br>"Jason... I... I can't breathe." I protested softly.<br>"Oops. sorry! I was too happy." he let me go and grinned boyishly. "Let's go out for lunch today."<br>"Sure, just let me go wash up first."<br><br>Locking myself in the bathroom, I stared at my own reflections in the mirror. I don't know what have I done or what I should do. "Well, it's too late to pull out of it anyway. The ticket had been booked already. Don't waste people's money like that. Right?" Am I convincing? Or am I trying to fool myself? I have no idea....</div>
