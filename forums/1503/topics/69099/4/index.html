            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #10<br><br>Laying on my bed, I still can't believe the reaction of my parents. Just now when Jason sent me home, we unfortunately ran into my parents... in the lift! Sigh, major bad luck on my part. Though Jason was so happy and sweet, chatting with my dad about the current political climate. And my mum was just grinning at me all the while  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Jason was invited to have 'tea' for a while by my parents despite my mention of the late hours. The nightmare didn't stopped there. While sipping xiang pian with my dad, Jason popped the question.<br><br>"Uncle, I wonder if Jo could go Bali with me and my parents in the coming holiday. I'll take good care of her... I.. "<br>I almost choked on my tea as Jason jumped on the opportunity as their conversation stirred towards vacations.<br>"Of cos can lah!" My mum jumps in, giving me a mischevious grin.<br>"But hor she very blur blur one, you all must take care of her hor. Don't let her go lost hor..."<br>"I will, I'll take very good care of her." Jason turned and smiled at me. I smiled feebly.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The past few days, Jason has been busy in getting the holiday for us. Going to book the tickets etc, buying stuffs for the trip. I just go along half heartedly. Now how am I gonna get out of this? My parents even consented and they thought he's my boyfriend. If I go with him, his parents would think the same too. And we are supposed to share a room. Oh dear.... I can't bear to think of it.<br><br>Suddenly I stopped in my trait.<br>"What's wrong?"<br>I looked behind me but didn't see anything wrong.<br>"What?"<br>"I don't know. I just keep having this weird feeling that we've been followed."<br>Jason gave my hand a gentle squeeze. "It must be you haven't been sleeping well lately. You still having those prank calls at night?"<br><br>Oh yah those calls. My room phone has been ringing at midnight, but when I picked up, it was total silence. Jason has suggested to make a police report. But seeing no actual harm was done, I declined. Didn't wanna blew up the whole issue.<br><br>Anyway, what was more urgent on hand was my trip. Is there still any way out of this shit?<br><br>"You ok?" Jason asked, his face so concerned and worried.<br>I smiled and nodded, "Yah sure. What else are we supposed to get?"<br>As Jason happily led me to enter into a surf shop, I couldn't help but looked back again. It was that strange feeling again. Was I over suspicious or was there really someone?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #11<br><br>After a night of dinner and movies, Jason sent me home. Nowadays becos of my "strange feelings", he had insisted in sending me right to the door steps. Before I open the door, I turned to say goodbye to him. Yes I admit, I didn't want my parents to have any chance of dragging him in for "tea" again.<br><br>Jason smiled and moved in closer to me. My body stiffened as his eyes seems to pierce through my soul. I turned away slightly, worried he can see into my heart and found he's not there. But mistaking my response as shyness, he gently hold my chin to face him again. Not able to bear seeing him at such closeness, I shut my eyes. BIG mistake. He planted a soft peck on my lips, looking ever so loving.<br><br>I fumbled with my keys and quickly escaped back into the house. Damn, I'm done this time. I've been long avoiding any intimate gestures, or in fact, avoiding to face his feelings honestly. Is there no way out of this? How can I let him know that my heart still misses Vince without hurting him? He is such a nice guy afterall.....<br><br>Suddenly my thoughts was interrupted by the sound of thunder. Looking out, I see the skies threatening to break forth into a heavy downpour.<br><br>"Girl ah, back liao har?" my mum said as she came out of her room. "You lucky. Home any later, you might be caught in the rain liao lor." As she went to shut the kitchen windows, I remembered Jason didn't have an umbrella with him. "Mum I go out for a while!" I yelled as I ran out with 2 umbrellas in hand.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Down at the void deck, I ran toward the busstop, hoping that Jason haven't left. Suddenly, I heard a commotion. Sounds like someone's fighting. "Better dun kaypoh, wait I kenna beaten also," I think to myself and hurried on. But curiousity got the better of me, and I turned to take a peek.<br><br>Around the corner of the block, I saw a horrifying sight. I ran toward them and yelled them to stop! It was Vince and Jason!<br><br>"Guys stop it! What are you two doing?"<br>"Nothing. Let's go." Jason pulled back his punch and grabbed my hand to go.<br><br>But I could not go. Before me, was Vince. His right eye swollen and a tint of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth. My legs carried me towards him, only to be pulled back by Jason. "NO! Don't go to him." I turned to face Jason, only then realised that he was in no better state than Vince. His nose is bleeding slightly and face bruised.<br><br>"What happened here? Why are u two fighting? And Vince, how come you're here?" Time seems to froze at my questions as both of them sank into a deep silence. Only the thunders were rolling and raindrops began to fall.<br><br>I grabbed both of them and moved to the void deck before we all get drenched. Seated at the stone seats, they remained silence. I took out some tissue from my pockets and gave to both of them. Though I gave it to Jason first, I subconsciously turned and wiped the blood from Vince's mouth instead.<br><br>This obviously didn't escaped the eyes of Jason and I could feel his anger raising. But I couldn't help it, I didn't even realised I did that.<br><br>"Jo, I'm your bf, he's not. Not anymore..." Jason's anger soon turned into sorrow. I know it was time to face him and myself honestly. But not in front of Vince.<br><br>"Vince, why are you here? Why did both of you fight?"<br>Vince looked at me and suddenly all the memories of us came rushing over me. I knew I've missed him, but looking into his eyes was too overwhelming. Especially when he has the same look in his eyes when we together.<br><br>"I missed you." Three words and my tears starts to flow down my cheeks. "I've been following you around for the past weeks. I know you're now with Jason and you two are going for a holiday together. I know I was the one that pushes you away, but I have my reasons. And I really missed you."<br><br>By now I'm sobbing like a baby. I couldn't believe I'll hear those words from Vince. I turned toward Jason, he was quiet, his eyes sorrowful. Sitting there between the two, I wished this is just a nightmare...</div>

My body stiffened as his eyes seems to pierce through my soul. I turned away slightly, worried he can see into my heart and found he's not there. But mistaking my response as shyness, he gently hold my chin to face him again. Not able to bear seeing him at such closeness, I shut my eyes. BIG mistake. He planted a soft peck on my lips, looking ever so loving.<br><br>wah sibeh romantik hahaha.. </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #12<br><br>"Ah girl ah, wake up liao lah! Time for lunch already!!!" my mum yelled from outside my room. I could just lay there, staring at the ceiling. I haven't slept a wink the whole night, my mind still full of what happened last night....<br><br>They both agreed to give me some time to think over it and left. continued to sit at the void deck and stared out to the field. My mind felt so heavy and confused. The rain suddenly seems so inviting. I took a step out and let the rain fell upon me. Yes, it felt cold and fit how I felt within. I ended up standing in the middle of the open field, lifting my face toward heavens and let the rain washed my troubles away.<br><br>Of course that didn't work, but at least I felt more relaxed. My tears washed away by the rain, or rather I can no longer differentiate which are my tears.<br><br>"AH CHOO!!!!!!!" I sneezed. Great, now I caught a cold too.<br>"Ah girl har!!! how many times you want me to call you??" my mum yelling again.<br>"Yes! Coming liao!"<br>In the kitchen, the table was lined with preserved egg and lean pork porridge and fried you tiao. Yummy!<br>"Ask you to eat only also take so long.... People dunnoe, think I ask you to die or wat. Sleep until so late, you turning into a pig liao... " I kept on mumbling "yes, yah, orh" as I went to wash up. Suddenly facing my mum's nagging was easy. Easier than facing my own problem....<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Vince was already there with a cuppa when I arrived at the cafe. I just have to meet him and see what he have to say. Just trying to figure out things alone at home wasn't working at all.<br><br>"Hi... ah choooo!!" I sneezed just as I sat down. "Oops."<br>"Flu? You ok?" Vince reached over and touched my forehead.<br>"Yah ok, just got a little cold. No worries."<br>"Good afternoon! Can I take your order?" the cheery waitress interrupted.<br>"Yes, an orange juice please." Vince replied as he pulled away his hand. He turned to me as the waitress left our table. "You flu should take orange juice." He looked so sweet and it melted my heart instantly. "Oh ok." I was actually dying for caffeine. The lack of sleep over the past few nights were really getting into me.<br><br>After taking a few sips of my vitamine C intake, I took a deep breathe and looked up at Vince.<br>"So tell me, what exactly is going on."<br>Vince smiled and took a sip of his coffee.<br>"Like I said, I missed you. That's why I have been following you around, looking at you from a distance...."<br>"But why? Why after ... after....."<br>"After I left you?"<br>I nodded.<br>Vince took a deep breathe, "Well it's not easy trying to explain to you. But I'll try...." I sat there waiting as his expression turned serious for the first time today.</div>
