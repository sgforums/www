            <div class='col-md body'>being inspired by Kitty, here's my version....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>===================================================<br>Episode #1<br><br>I've forgotten how much I hated 1st day of anything.... The feeling of being in a totally unfamiliar environment all by myself. I can't believe out of my school I'm the only one tat got into this institute.... *sigh* and it doesn't help that I am late on the 1st day!<br><br>After I finally get to my classroom, realised that the only seat at the back left is beside this .. err not so pretty gal... seems like the back is where the guys are... oh well, have never been a teacher's pet, so the front is out for me.<br><br>"Is this seat taken?" I managed to find my voice somehow.<br>"No no no! Hi I'm Cyndi" she squeaked with a high pitched voice.<br>"Hi I'm Jo..." I whispered. I wonder how she managed to stand her own voice, but oh well don't be so mean, I reminded myself.<br><br>As the teacher step out to get some stuffs, the class burst into chitchating and groups started to be formed. And suddenly I found myself and Cyndi being surrounded by the guys seated around us.<br><br>Cyndi tho petite and well... not so pretty, seems to be very popular with the guys. Everyone seems to be talking to her. And I just sat there and sheepishly listen to all the conversations being translated.<br><br>*Riiinnnnggg* finally it's break time! Class have been so boring.<br><br>"Hey Jo let's go eat together," Cyndi squeaked and before I could reacte, she have grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the class.<br><br>Oh well, at least I don't have to eat alone. Surprisingly she has already made friends with ppl frm another class. And they were waiting for her in the canteen as we arrived. After a brief introduction, I found myself sitting at a corner and eating by myself. Seems like Cyndi has forgotten abt my existance while she is so engrossed chating with her friends. Oh well I'll just concentrate on my food then....<br><br>The day passes on and school is finally over!<br><br>"Jo, let's go!" Cyndi took of my hand again.<br>"Huh? Err... Go where?"<br>"We promised Jason we'll go and support him at the match with the seniors after class during break rem?!"<br><br>Seriously I didn't. I wasn't even involved in the conversations. But Cyndi is not one that take no for an answer. I was out of the class with the ever bubbly Cyndi.<br><br>====================================================<br><br>my writing skills no good, so dun luff hor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

I dun scream... . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>=====================================================<br>Episode #2<br><br>Arriving at the field, I realised it's a friendly soccer match between Jason and his gang with some seniors. Cyndi has "volunteered" us to be the cheerleaders!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> I almost fainted on the spot. But thank goodness she was so engrossed with chatting with the guys that she has forgotten abt me.<br><br>I sat at the edge of the field and watched the match. Frankly I have no interest in soccer, but I must admit seeing cute guys sweating it out does...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Cyndi did her job as the "cheerleader", tho I have no idea what she was cheering. Well as long as she's enjoying it, and the guys didn't seems to mind.<br><br>The match ended with Jason and team losing, much to the disappointment of Cyndi. But as the senior team came over, her disappointment seems to vanish as she chatted up with the seniors.<br><br>As I got up from the ground, a hand reached over and helped me up. Turning around, I saw it was one of the seniors --- Bryan. From Cyndi I found out that he was the school counsellor head and the captain of the school soccer team.<br><br>"Hi, I'm Bryan. You are one quiet cheerleader." His eyes sparkled as he smiled. Gosh I was stunned and couldn't find my tongue.<br><br>"She's Jo. Hi I'm Cyndi. You played so well....."<br>As Cyndi rattled on, I excused myself and ran off.... That was so embarassing. How stupid could I can??!!<br><br>After the soccer match, Cyndi seems to know every single memeber from the school team. It's amazing how easy it's for her to make friends. School continued, with Cyndi and her sudden "activities". I was getting used to her, she's been really nice to include me in everything she does with the rest. She's like my link to the outside world.<br><br>"Jo~~~~~~~~~~~~"<br>I looked up from my book and smiled. Her high pitched voice is sooo recognisable, I thot to myself.<br>"Sorry I'm late. Let's go, Jason and gang got the tickets already."<br>"Hey wait!" and Cyndi dashed off.<br><br>I turned and saw her talking to a cute looking guy who walked past. Hmmm.... Cyndi and her cute guys... suddenly the guy turned and looked at me. I was taken aback. He smiled at me.. Gosh he's cute! I smiled awkwardly and looked away.<br><br>"Guess wat?!" Cyndi has returned and was grinning widely.<br>"Er.. what?"<br>"Tat's Vince! We are going out next wkend!"<br>"We?"<br>"Yah 3 of us! Don't you recognise him?"<br>"Nope. Who is he?"<br>"He is one of our senior in school."<br>"Oh, you know him?"<br>"Well I just did!" and she gave me a cheeky wink. Oh well, tat's Cyndi...<br><br>As we walked to join the rest, I can't help but wondered what is it like next week to meet that Vince again... He wasn't as good looking as Bryan but there seems to be something about him....<br><br>====================================================</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #3<br><br>"Wait up!" I ran after Cyndi as she stepped out of the class for break.<br>"Wat issit?" she snapped.<br>"I.. I just wanna say I'm sorry I'm late today."<br>"You purposely one rite? Today is the deadline for maths assignment and you're late! You dun wanna lend me to copy, just say so!"<br><br>I was fighting to hold by my tears as she threw assaulting words on me. I couldn't even explain to her that I overslept cos I was up almost whole nite doing <span style="font-style: italic;">her </span>history assignment.<br><br>"Cyndi? Jo?" A familar voice cut in. It was Jason. I quickly lowered my head and tried to swallow back the tears that threatened to burst out any moment.<br>"Is everything ok?"<br>"Of cos! Right Jo?......... Jo!"<br>I nodded and continued studying the cracks on the floor.<br>"You sure?"<br>"Yah lah, let's go for break. Come on Jo!" Cyndi grabbed Jason's arm and hurried him off. I took a deep breathe and followed.<br><br>The week passed quickly. Cyndi has resumed talking to me, well at least in front of the rest. No matter what, she is still about the only friend I have.<br><br>Finally saturday came. And I was 15 minutes late. I arrived and saw Cyndi already there with Vince, waiting.<br><br>"Jo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~! aiyah why u so late?" From her smile, I knew I did the right thing for purposely being late. Afterall, she have a whole 15 minutes with Vince. I mumbled a stupid excuse and we moved on to a game arcade before we head for dinner.<br><br>As they were having a go at the shooting game, I was trying to cook up an excuse to resign from being the walking lamp post. Suddenly Vince turned to me.<br><br>"Hey u wanna try this?"<br>"Err... Nah, I don't know how to shoot."<br>"No problem, I'll teach you."<br><br>And before I know it, he put his arm around and holding my hands to hold the gun. At this close proximity, I could feel him breathing next to my ear. His fresh, out-of-shower kind of body scent. His muscular arms holding me. His 6 packs muscles against my back. My heart started to beat faster by the second, and I could feel my face getting red to my ears.<br><br>Suddenly, a muffled cough. I turned to see the fiery eyes of Cyndi piercing through me. Oh gosh, I totally forgotten that Cyndi has interest in Vince!<br><br>Vince probably have felt my body tensed up and asked me to focus on the target. How could I? Especially when I could feel Cyndi throwing imaginery knifes at me. But he didn't seems to notice and continued "guiding" me through the game.<br><br>"What the hell were u doing?!!" Cyndi snapped as soon as Vince went out of hearing range to order food.<br>"I.. I didn't do anything. I.. I... really din know he would do tat...."<br>"You bitch! You know I like him and u still seduce him! Some kind of friends you are!"<br>"I din..........." I lost my voice as tears was choking up my throat.<br>"I don't care! After dinner, you better disappear at once!"<br><br>It was like the "last supper" for me as I tried to swallow my food. Though Cyndi was making small talks with Vince, I could feel him stealing stares at me. I ate even faster.<br><br>"Sorry guys. I gotta go, promised mum I'll be home early..."<br>"Bye Jo!" I have hardly finished my sentence when Cyndi bid her goodbye. Was that fast response or was that fast response? Nevertheless, I just wanna get out of the place as soon as possible.<br><br>"Ok. Bye Cyndi!"<br>"You leaving too??" Cyndi couldn't believe Vince wanted to leave so soon. Frankly me neither, but what he said next was even more shocking.<br>"Yah, cos I'm sending Jo back."<br>"You don't have to. You can just stay on with Cyndi.. err.. for a coffee maybe." I suddenly found my voice. I can't let this happened, Cyndi would hate me forever!<br>"I know I don't have to. But I want to." He turned and smiled at me lovingly.<br><br>Normally I would have probably melted. But with the sudden change of temperature, namely on me only, I just couldn't. I was at a lost of words and simply stared at him blankly...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>think it's time to resurrect my story... I blamed it on sch assignment and freelance works!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>====================================================<br><br>Episode #4<br><br>After a long awkward silence, we decided we should all just head home. The walk towards the bus stop seems to last forever. Cyndi has lost her chirpy self and the absent of her high pitched voice was driving me crazy.<br><br>"Hey, u ok?" My thoughts was interrupted by Vince. I looked up and saw Vince looking at me intently, full of concern. How could I tell him that it was actually Cyndi who's interested in him? And why me?! Now I have to face the wrath of my only friend in school.<br><br>All I could do was shaked my head... realising that's not a 'right' response, I quickly nodded. I suddenly felt so stupid and dumb, who would buy tat kinda response?! But thank goodness Vince didn't pursue the issue.<br><br>My bus finally came and without any notice, I hopped on at the very last minute before Vince could response and waved goodbye to them! I sat down at the seat with a deep sign. It was wat I could conjour as the best escape plan and I wondered what would behold me when school starts next week....<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Another week began in school and I don't believe how much homework our lecturers could come up with! Cyndi never talked about that nite anymore and I think it was best kept that way.<br><br>I have since avoided Vince in school, which was pretty easy to do. He was afterall my senior and Cyndi was always around with me.<br><br>"Jo jo, going home?" a cheeky voice came from behind me. I turned and saw our class clown, Charles. I smiled and we began to chat nonsensically as we headed toward the bus stop. Charles was forever so funny and humorous. I was laughing, enjoying every moment. He has this ability to loosen up any stern faced, depressed being.<br><br>Charles went "HOT HAR HOT HAR!" and grabbed a window seat for us on the driver's side. He was so hilarious. But I admit, sometimes it could be a tad too embarassing.<br><br>"JO!!! Jo are u there?" a voiced yelled and interrupted our laughter. The bus was already packed and I couldn't see who was yelling for me. Suddenly I saw. It was Vince standing outside the window on the other side of the bus! He had ran for a bus stop distance to catch me on the bus. I was shocked and everyone was just staring at us.<br><br>"Yah?" I finally found my voice.<br>"Get off the bus! Quick, it's gonna move off soon!"<br>"Err... why?"<br>"Just come down please...."<br>I couldn't think and just mumbled a bye to Charles and got up. I wasn't sure if I saw correctly, but was that a look of disappointment on his face? I didn't have much time to think as I stumbled to get off the crowded bus.<br><br>Standing before Vince, I suddenly didn't know wat to do. There was too many questions going through my head. Why did he got me off the bus? How did he know I'm on tat bus? What was so urgent?<br><br>"So glad I managed to catch you," Vince smiled and his eyes caught the sun and it look stunning.<br>"Oh, err.... what's up? How did you know I was on that bus?" I snapped myself out of my daze.<br>"I was looking for you after class and couldn't find you. I went to the bus stop and asked around. Someone told me you just got on that bus, so I took the shortcut and caught up with you." he grinned as he proudly answered my questions.<br>"I...I see, something urgent?"<br>"Nope, just wanna see you." he smiled and the 'happiness' in his eyes was almost blinding.<br><br>I was lost for words and response. All I could think of was, thank goodness Cyndi was on medical leave that day.<br><br>"Ok you've seen me now. So I can go rite? Bye." I know I have to get out of this situation before my resistance to him fall to zero. As sudden as things have happened, he grabbed my hand. Pulling me towards him, the look in his eyes saddened as he asked, "Why are u avoiding me?" Staring into his eyes, with our noses just inches away, time stood still....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #5<br><br>I was still in a daze as I arrived in school. The events that happened the day before was still clouding my mind. I wasn't able to answer his questions about me avoiding him. I merely said I was busy. Somehow, deep down we both knew that was merely an excuse.<br><br>As I walked into school, I suddenly realised something was amiss. Everyone was staring at me and whispering among themselves. I looked down and checked my uniform. Nope I didn't miss a button or forgot to zip. What's wrong?<br><br>Seeing Cyndi with Jason and gang, I went over. They seems to be engaged in some heated conversation as I approached them.<br><br>"Morning!" I smiled and suddenly all of them stopped talking. They all turned and just grinned at me. All except Cyndi.<br><br>"What's wrong? Something on my face?"<br>And they all burst out giggling.<br>"We have heard what happened!" one of the gals said between her giggles.<br>"What happened?!"<br>"Vince! He literally RAN after you yesterday! Whoah~~~" the gals said almost in unison.<br><br>There I froze. I can't believe news have gone so far so fast. I turned and saw Cyndi's face almost exploding with anger.<br><br>"So was it true??"<br>"Of cos it isn't!!!" yelled Cyndi. "Why would Vince ever be interested in Jo? It's impossible!"<br>As they debated about the reality of the rumour, I simply stood there without uttering a word. What could I say and yet not hurt Cyndi or lie? Just then the bell rang. I let out a sign of relief as we scrabbled to class. But I know today is gonna be a <span style="font-style: italic;">long </span>day.<br><br>Later during break, I found myself surrounded by the group, drowning in questions about me and Vince. Cyndi has refused to talk to me since morning. Jason wasn't helping at all, he merely sat there and looked away. Suddenly all the gals went quiet.<br><br>I looked up and saw Vince standing next to me, smiling. "Harlo, eaten yet?" I turned to look at Cyndi who by now her face has turned into a shade of chilli red. I stared down at my shoes, not knowing what to do or say. Vince took a glance at Cyndi then me. Suddenly he went over to Cyndi. "Can we talk in private?"<br><br>The whole group, including me was shocked and could just stared at them as Vince and Cyndi walked away. The gals couldn't contain the curiousity and pulled me along to follow them. Jason surprisingly followed.<br><br>Round the corner of the block, we stood afar, just near enough to overhear their conversation.<br><br>"Cyndi, you must have heard about what happened yesterday."<br>"Oh tat rumour? That was so ridiculous," Cyndi giggled. She reached over and hold his hand. "Don't worry, I won't believe that."<br>Vince pulled away. "I think you've mistaken. It wasn't a rumour, it did happened as you heard. I just wanna ask you, do you know why Jo is not accepting me?"<br>"You mean... you really like Jo?! How could that be? No you're lying!!" Cyndi was turning hysterical and I was getting nervous.<br>"It was I who asked you out, and you agreed! You agreed to go out with me. How could it be Jo?!"<br>"Listen... I'm sorry to say this, but... that day at the station, I agreed to go out with you because of Jo. I've noticed her in school and she hangs around with you. So I figured I could get to know her through you. I'm sorry if I have misled you in any way. I didn't realised that you... err... like me..."<br><br>Cyndi has by now broke into tears and sobbing helplessly. The more Vince tried to pacify her, the more she sobbed. Suddenly Vince looked up and saw us. "Jo?" Cyndi turned and saw the whole group of us....</div>
