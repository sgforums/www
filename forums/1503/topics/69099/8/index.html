            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #20<br><br>The rest of the trips flew past with time spent in the sun, sand and the sea. And of course glorious seafood. Holidays are always fun and relaxing. Jason has been a great companion, and great fun to hang out with. And strangely, he have not hold my hands or anything like that since. But my brief moments of wonder were often disrupted by the ever ongoing beach activities at the resort.<br><br>Even the nights were spent watching and giggling over sitcoms we caught on the resort cable tv.<br><br>On the last night of our trip, as he settled down in the sofa to sleep, I finally brought the topic up again. Curiousity really kills the cat.<br><br>"Jason?" I asked while we were both laying down in our respective "beds".<br>"Yah?"<br>"Is everything alright?"<br>"Sure, something's wrong?"<br>"Nah, just that... you know... hmm.... about us?" I cautiously muttered.<br>"What about us?" He sounded so normal, that it made me felt as if I'm over-reacting or something.<br>"Well, are we... hmm.. still... you know?"<br><br>By now, he sat up on the sofa and looked at me. Staring at each other across the not-so-big room suddenly seems so silly.<br><br>"Yes, we are still friends."<br>"Friends?"<br>"Yup, that's what you wanted, right?"<br>Ok I do felt utterly stupid by now.<br>"Don't worry about it, I know how you felt."<br>Somehow his assurance starts to hurt. What is it that I wanted anyway?<br>"We'll remain friends until you want more." His eyes looking at me ever so tenderly. I nodded and hid myself under the covers. Ok I'm being ridiculously stupid while he's shockingly wonderful. Gosh, do I hate myself....<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Back in singapore, back to school again. I saw many familiar faces, now all tanned and happy. Seems like everyone had a great time during the school break and the school is now buzzing with excitement as everyone catching with everyone again.<br><br>I sat alone at my usual corner in the canteen, reading a novel while munching my sandwich. Suddenly, the once-familiar high pitched voice pierced my little piece transquility.<br><br>"Hi Jo~~~~~"<br>I looked up and surprised to see Cyndi, all smiling while she swayed her butt towards me. Something seems very wrong. As I stared at her waving at me, I noticed her other hand was occupied. She was holding someone's hand.<br><br>I dropped my book and felt tears welling up in my eyes. She was holding onto Vince's hand! I couldn't figure out she was holding his hand or pulling him along. But their hands were locked together tat's for sure. As I stared in unbelief and shock, she has made her way to me.<br><br>"How's your holiday?" Was that a smile or a smirk? I was too shocked, confused, and hurt to tell. I stared at Vince, whose face is totally void of any emotion. Except maybe one of irritation. He looked rather impatient to be pulled along to be "show" around.<br><br>"I heard you went for a holiday with Jason. Fun? Well, I had a great holiday..... with Vince of cos..." and her sentence was finished with a string of giggles, whether of pure joy or victory, whatever, I couldn't tell.<br><br>"Come on, let's go." Vince cut her off impatiently and walked off with Cyndi running after him and held his arm closed to her body.<br><br>What is happening? This can't happen. Vince... with Cyndi? Why? How? When? too many questions flooded my mind as tears starts to flow uncontrollably. Seeing them walking away, I just lost my appetite.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode #21<br><br>The next few days flew past in a daze. I have tried to avoid the public parade of vince and cyndi as much as i can. But to not much success. Cyndi seems to keep appearing wherever I go. I have this feeling that she was enjoying it thoroughly.<br><br>By the end of the week, i felt totally defeated. I have no idea what had happened and how it has happened. Maybe it's my fault. Afterall I did went on a holiday with Jason. But, yet a part of me was reluctant to accept it. I was planning to make a decision and talk with Vince when I come back. Apparently that was no longer an option.<br><br>As I came out of my daze, I was shocked to find myself under the block of Vince's place. How did I end up here? I quickly turned to get out asap.<br><br>"What are you doing here?"<br>Vince was standing right in front of me. I was at a lost of what to say. How am i to tell him that my feet brought me here w/o my permission? Nah it sounds so lame.<br><br>Vince came over and grabbed my hand. My mind was in a blank and could only follow his lead. We ended up in his place, in his room.<br><br>I sat nervously on his bed, trying to say something. Even though there were many questions running through my mind, I just can't seem to find the right words to say.<br><br>"How's your holiday?" Vince broke the silence.<br>I looked up at him, and couldn't really make out how he was feeling.<br>"Well it was ok..."<br>"Must be fun rite? So things are going on well for both of you rite?" Was that a hint of sarcasm?<br>I took a deep breathe and decided it's either now or never.<br><br>"Yes, we are still good friends."<br>"Friends??" Vince stared at me with unbelief.<br>"Nothing happened between me and him. He knew my heart is not with him." I let out a sign of relief, finally i have said it.<br>"But... but I thought u have decided to be with him when u go on the trip with him?"<br>"I couldn't reject him and everything is booked.. i know it's lame but i really dunnoe how to tell him. he was afterall very nice to me... too nice. I felt bad."<br><br>I can't believe it, i actually said all that out. Maybe because i realised all these had happened because I have not made myself clear. I looked at Vince, seeing his face turned from unbelief to realisation to... guilt?!<br><br>"Vince? Are you ok?"<br>"I know it's too late for me to say all these. Anyway, since you're with Cyndi... I... I wish you two the best." I was almost choking with tears, but that was what i am supposed to say right?<br><br>Vince bent over with his hands on his head. It was a picture of pain. For that moment, i'm not sure if I have said the right thing.<br><br>I reached over to stroke his head. Suddenly he embraced me, holding me close to him. Gosh what's happening?<br><br>"Vince? Did I said something wrong?"<br>He released his embrace and I looked into his eyes all sole and red. I could feel my jaw dropped. What followed even more shocking. Vince went on to tell of how he ended up with Cyndi....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okie okie i hear ur complains! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> and i better finish this asap... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Episode #22<br><br>Looking intently into his eyes, i could clearly see regret and pain. These puzzled me even more and yet I did not want to push him to talk. No one knows better than me how difficult it is to talk about how our heart really felt.<br><br>Vince pulled away his eyes from mine and looked out of the window. Slowly he began his story...<br><br>"Remember that day I called you? And you told me you're going on a trip with Jason? When Cyndi told me that, I don't believe her. Yet..... *deep sigh* I thought we can begin again, but to realised it was all too late. My heart was crushed.<br><br>Another part of me was very upset and angry. I felt that you misled me and playing me along. How could u say u love me and go on a trip with another guy?!"<br><br>I sat there quietly, holding back my urge to defend and clarify myself. I told myself, "Let him finish..." and he continued.<br><br>"That nite i was consumed by jealousy and anger. I was beside myself. I need to vent out one way or another. And .... and... cyndi called me."<br><br>"And?" Hearing that I can't help it but to probe.<br><br>"And... we went out. We went clubbing, I just want to drink and dance my frustrations away. I wanted to numb my heart. And .... and .... i guess, i numbed myself wee too much with alcholol."<br><br>By now, pictures of a half drunk him and cyndi dancing intimately were forming in my mind. Maybe they even kissed! I shaked those images out of my head and bit my lips to hold my peace.<br><br>"Things got ... abit out of control. And.... and... well... we ended up back here in my room. One thing led to another.... and.... .... ....."<br><br>"You .... *swallow* you two.... have ...... s... ex?" I asked as if the words are fragile, fearing what the answer would be. And it did as Vince slowly nodded his head, "That was how we ended up together. I thought u and Jason have already.... you know?"<br><br>Tears flowed quietly down my cheeks. We both sat in complete silence as the sun slowly sets outside the window. As the room dimmed, he turned and asked the most stupid question i have ever heard. "Do you want to scold me?"<br><br>I just looked at him blankly. Suddenly i let out a laugh. More like a sneer, I'm not sure. "What would tat change, vince?" "Jo, I'm sorry i know i've betrayed you.... I don't love Cyndi, you know that.... I... I.... really thought you and Jason.... " He reached over to hold my hands. I moved my hands away.<br><br>With tears in my voice, i started to speak. "That time when we were .... ... ... passionate.... you stopped, you didn't want to have sex with me. You said because u love me. And now you have sex with someone you don't love? I really.... don't understand your logic."<br><br>I could see tears sparkling in his eyes. He turned and hugged me tight. His embrace felt so warm but I knew this is not what i want.<br><br>"Vince, it's ok.... It's over. You have Cyndi now and you have to take responsibilty. Too many things between us. It's no one's fault...." Slowly he released his embrace and I got up and left in silence.<br><br>As i walked out of his place, i realised there were no more tears. Yet my heart was so painful. It was as if someone tear it out while I'm still alive. Maybe... maybe this is how it feel when it hurt the most. This is perhaps what the chinese quote means by wanting to cry yet there ain't any tears...</div>
