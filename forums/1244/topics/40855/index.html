            <div class='col-md body'>Its responsible of you to take into time management and constraints. Some people just acquire it out of impulse, and when they cannot afford the time, they just rehome it, or worse, abandon it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Studies in the Journal of the American Medical Association show that children with dogs and cats at home have a much lower risk of contracting allergies than children in homes without. Animals give protection from allergens by building up immunity to these allergens. This is why 80% of children who are allergic to cats in Sweden have never had a cat. In a study done by Warwick University in Britain, children who owned pets had stronger immune systems and took less sick days off school than those who did not. Pet owning children benefited up to 18 extra days of school than their non pet-owning counterparts. Articles in the September 7th 2002 issue of the Lancet and the September 1st 2002 issue of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine show that children in households with cats specifically, had less asthma and wheezing than children who did not, as long as their mother did not have asthma.<br>The above information is provided by Ms Dawn Kua, Cat Welfare Society<br><br>something to share with all</div>
