"You okay?"<br><br>she frozed, then quickly knocked the chair over. listening intently, she heard him shut off the tv, then moments later the sounds of his feet on the stairs. she was suddenly nervous and excited and excited all at the same time. her knees were shaking and her nipples were already rock hard. this was it.<br><br><strong>-end of part 1, to be continued-</strong><br><br></div>

Inside his jeans his cock twitched, pressing painfully against his zipper. Standing again, she twisted and wriggled, moving this way and that, once again admiring her reflection in the mirror. She adjusted ties, straps and stockings with deft fingers. Her hands reached up and cupped her breasts, pushing them upwards. She pinched the nipples between her fingers and groaned, a long low sigh of pleasure that he felt zinging down his spine straight to his balls. His dick surged against his jeans insistently.<br><br>Slowly, so she wouldn't hear it, he undid the button and lowered the zipper. He pushed down his briefs, wrapping his fingers around his throbbing dick, the relief was instantaneous. Her fingers slid between her sex, disappearing beneath the already damp crotch of her teddy. Watching the wet spot growing on her teddy started his cock dripping cum.<br><br>She sat in the chair, wiggling to settle herself on the very edge of it, her pussy pointing upwards. The chair faced the cheval mirror she'd bought a week ago, clearly reflecting her. He was treated to a side view and a full frontal view of her. He watched her fingers dig into her pussy, matching her motions with strokes on his cock. She groaned, undulating in her chair, her eyes half lidded and staring directly at the mirror.<br><br>He leaned against the door, unbelievably turned on by the site of his gorgeous wife pleasuring herself. He pinched the tip of his cock, stemming the flow of sperm, he didn't want to cum yet, he wanted this erotic show of hers to go on forever.<br><br>She hooked her fingers into the crotch of the teddy and ripped at it, pulling it open with loud snaps, then shoving the loose end up and out of the way. She spread her legs wider, reaching between them and spreading her glistening lips, opening her pussy for him to see. She licked a finger and touched her clit with it, jerking and crying out. As he watched, a rush of cum oozed from deep within her.<br><br><strong>-end of part 2, to be continued-</strong><br><br></div>

Visions of dropping between her legs and licking up the wetness roared through his brain, replaced seconds later by an overwhelming desire to slide his cock into her instead. He used what was left of his willpower to restrain himself. Watching her do something this intimate was too arousing to stop.<br><br>Pulling the two shining fingers from her pussy, she slid them into her mouth and delicately sucked at her juices. He shuddered and nearly came. He watched her fingers trail across the velvet teddy back into her even velvetier pussy. The fingers of one hand pistoned in and out of her cunt, fucking herself in rhythm with the finger on her clit. Her ass was squirming all over the chair, bucking against her fantasy lover. She was moaning and panting, loud cries echoing through the room.<br><br>Right in front of his eyes he watched his woman dissolve into a toe curling orgasm. She looked incredibly beautiful and sexier than he'd ever seen her. The image of her straining against her fingers and screaming incoherently burned itself into his brain. He couldn't take it anymore, he worked his dick with his fist, feeling his balls tighten up in preparation of his own orgasm.<br><br>She couldn't believe what a sexual rush it was to have him watching her. When he pulled his unmistakable wet erection from his jeans and started a slow stroking, so obviously hard from watching her, she started cumming. Intense tiny orgasms that sizzled through her spine, spurring her on to even more exhibitionistic actions.<br><br>Then he groaned when she opened her pussy for him. Everything inside her seemed to tighten up, then explode in one of the strongest orgasms she'd ever had. Her eyes were locked on his cock, all pretense gone with her climax. His fist flew over it, turning the head an angry red. His hips were thrusting reflexively, shoving his cock into his hand as if he were in the midst of fucking her pussy instead.<br><br>Suddenly he groaned her name, arching his whole body. His hand was moving on his dick, wiggling and pulling it. Spurts of creamy white cum exploded from the tip, spraying out in time with his jerking fist. He continued milking his cock for a few more moments, leaning back against the doorjamb. His finger moved over his dick with long, slow squeezes, producing the final drops of cum.<br><br>He had no idea what to say now. Opening his eyes and lifting his head, he met her smiling, replete eyes. He didn't have to say anything after all. Her husky voice washed over him, bringing a stiffening of interest to his dick. "Baby, that was beautiful."<br><br><strong>-end-</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A BATH TIME GANG BANG (by English Bob)</strong></span><br><strong>Part 1</strong><br><br>He had no idea what to say now. Opening his eyes and lifting his head, he met her smiling, replete eyes. He didn't have to say anything after all. Her husky voice washed over him, bringing a stiffening of interest to his dick. "Baby, that was beautiful."<br><br>The door is slightly ajar and I can hear the men downstairs preparing themselves as, likewise, I prepare myself up here. I have already cleansed myself thoroughly and am now really just waiting...waiting for something to happen! I wonder to myself how this will all work; will they wait for me downstairs or will they quickly become tired of my prolonged absence and come looking for me? As this was all my idea, I know that I should really make the first move, but my submissive side prohibits me from doing this and I sink down lower into the soothing water.<br><br>I catch my breath. My heart leaps and misses a beat as I hear footsteps on the stairs. Someone is coming! I feel my pussy tingle slightly, my nipples visibly tighten as the footfalls reach the top of the stairs and wait outside the door. I have no idea who any of the men are; my husband has arranged the whole thing, his only condition being that he remains with me the whole time to ensure that I am safe and happy (and, I suspect, to watch!).<br><br>There is a soft knock on the bathroom door. I try to speak, maybe to allow his admittance, maybe to refuse; I don't know, but the words get stuck in my throat. But it becomes irrelevant. The man has not waited for my response and has entered my domain regardless. I look up. He is smiling and naked. My eyes want to study his body, but are held, fixed by his gaze. The smile is warm and inviting, it calms and relaxes me somewhat. My husband is also smiling, a sort of crooked grin as he watches the man and me. I love him for his acceptance of this situation.<br><br>The naked man walks towards me and sits on the side of the tub. I now see his body. He is young and beautiful. I have never seen him before and will never see him again after this. His chest is hairless and leads down to a flat stomach. My eyes wander further down and fix on his cock. He is already erect and I sense my pussy tingle again. His hand is in the water, swishing the suds and foam around. He cups one of my breasts gently and I gasp. He can feel how hard my nipple is and squeezes it between his thumb and forefinger. I place my hand in his lap and wrap my fingers around his hot shaft while he plays with my large tits. I hear my husband's heavy breaths and I am reminded of my audience.<br><br>My lover now swings his legs over the edge of the tub and sits with both feet in the water. He gently pushes my head down. I know what he wants. I want it also. My ruby painted lips part and close over his glans. Ironically, I suddenly recall applying my lipstick earlier. I had taken so much care to get it right, only to have it smeared lewdly around this mans penis. He tastes good; a hint of male musk creeps into my nostrils and I lower my head further down his shaft. As I feel him enter my throat I sense him throbbing. I wonder how long it will take him to cum. I hope that it will not be too quick - I want to enjoy these sensations as long as possible.<br><br>Alternately, I relax and tense my throat muscles as my husband has shown me. My lovers moans echo around the bathroom as I deep throat him; taking him all the way down and then pulling slowly back and rolling my tongue around the large, purple head. His grip on my breasts suddenly tightens. A deep, almost unearthly groan escapes his lips and I know that the time has come. I relax my throat muscles once again and allow his thick cock to slip from my mouth. As I see it appear, it looks angry and red. It throbs and twitches for a few seconds and then spews its wonderful liquid over my waiting face. I open my mouth to swallow as much as possible, but most of his issue lands on my hair and face. A little unsteadily, my lover swings his legs back over the edge of the bath and stands. He bends and kisses me lovingly on the lips, playfully squeezing by boob for the last time. Before I have chance to thank him, he leaves as silently as he had arrived.<br><br><strong>-end of part 1, to be continued-</strong><br><br></div>
