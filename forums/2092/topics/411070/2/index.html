              TS must be really stupid or the banks must be (or maybe TS is working for the bank to promote some products). And since the bank has been around for more than 100 years as TS claimed, I suspect the stupid person must be TS. Sorry, I am so straightforward one... If I think you're stupid, I gotta let you know directly.
              
              My rationale is this...
              
              If a policy gives more than 200% returns annually and you can take the money within 1 month period, you seriously think someone with smart bankers in them will release to the public? Me? I think the bankers would have thrown their entire assets into this investment and take out the money 1 month later and reinvest into the same scheme. Bankers only tell you to "invest" when it's to THEIR advantage (maybe some minor advantage to you but mainly to their advantage). If they can make 200% annually, they won't even bother telling you. Like hello? Have you hear someone goes something like "Hey guys I found diamonds in here, come and take some everybody please..."
              
              Secondly, the other very common investors made is this. Be happy someone with financial intelligence is telling you for free on this. The bank says you invest $25k, at the end of the investment period, you get $50k, double your money!!!!! (Or REALLY???) NO!!! Of course banks are not stupid, they make money through YOUR MONEY. If they make money from your money, then obviously SOMEONE has to lose money, and guess who that someone was? Ok, back to that double your money thingy, they usually requires an investment period of 15 or 20 years. Even if your money has been doubled, by the time you take out that money to spend, you realize your money can only buy HALF the things, so in fact, your money has been HALF. I know it's very hard to understand but it's due to something called inflation. It's similarly to what coffee used to costs 10 cents long time back and now it's only $1.30 at Ya Kun. So even if your investment from 10 cents become 40 cents (WAH SEH 4 TIMES MORE MONEY!!!), you cannot even drink coffee, poor you.
              
              You need to come to my education centre and take my financial course lah poor you.
