              Johor to raise property tax for foreigners
              
              Johor, one of the most developed states in Malaysia, will implement higher tax rates for some 130,000 foreigners owning properties this year, said state chief Mohamed Khaled Nordin.
              
              "I believe that most locals will be in agreement over this new policy and it is done to increase our state's returns," he said on Saturday, adding that the new rates will be implemented by the end of the year.
              
              He said that the rates will be re-evaluated to reflect current property values as the last formal evaluation was done in the 1980s.
              
              "Taxpayers need not worry about the evaluations as [existing] property taxes will be retained for lower-priced properties," he said.
              
              The proposed increase is seen as a way for the Johor government to rein in skyrocketing property prices spurred by keen interest among foreign buyers, 90 per cent of whom are Singaporeans. In Johor, the annual assessment rate for residential properties is 0.14 per cent of the property value and 0.2 per cent for business holdings. For a 500,000 ringgit (Bt4.92 million) house, owners need to pay 700 ringgit a year.
              
              Foreign and local property owners in Malaysia are charged two types of property taxes - assessment tax, based on the rental value of the property, and quit rent, determined by the land size of the property. The amounts vary from one municipality to another.
              
              Johor property agents were unsure of the impact that new rates will bring to the market. "Foreigners might be taken aback, but they will see that property prices in Johor are still affordable," said one.

              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 50pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Buying property overseas? Here's help</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Report by ZUL OTHMAN</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The recent changes in property rules in Malaysia have got the market buzzing.</strong></p>
              <p>Yesterday, it was reported that foreigners buying properties in Johor from next January must pay higher processing fees instead of the current RM10.000 (S$3,900).</p>
              <p>   A Johor state official said that foreign buyers will have to pay 4 to 5 per cent of the sales price of the properties.</p>
              <p>   So are there more perks or pitfalls when investing in overseas properties?</p>
              <p>   The New Paper spoke to Mr Johnny Chng (below), head of international projects at property consultancy OrangeTee - one of the four panellists who will be speaking at the STProperty Seminar on Oct 27 - to find out more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 41pt;">1</span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 13pt;"> <span style="color: #00b0f0;">Why are overseas properties popular with investors at the moment?</span></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the property curbs in Singapore, more investors are turning their eyes across the Causeway.</p>
              <p>   Overseas markets have become an alternative investments destination for them to park their money because of the potential capital gains, strong Singapore dollar, lower entry barriers and easy access to credit.</p>
              <p>   Current hot spots are Malaysia, Australia and Britain's London. Some investors are also buying properties in the Philippine capital Manila. In all cases, buyers are attracted by returns and potential capital appreciation.</p>
              <p>   Some purchases are needs driven (for example, retirement plans in Johor's Iskandar region) or involve providing accommodation for children studying overseas (Australia and England in particular).</p>
              <p>   In all cases, the strengthening of the Singapore dollar makes overseas properties look relatively "cheap".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 41pt;">2</span> <span style="line-height: 115%; color: #00b0f0; font-size: 13pt;">What do In need to know about the overseas market before jumping in?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Know your risk appetite and financial means, and determine which market suits your investment needs.</p>
              <p>   Also, be updated with new rules and regulations that have been or are going to be implemented, such as the revised processing fee in Johor. In this case, be aware of the implications.</p>
              <p>   Finally, have an exit plan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 41pt;">3</span> <span style="line-height: 115%; color: #00b0f0; font-size: 13pt;">With the overseas market looking hot, is it too late to get in? Also, could a bubble be forming in these markets?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   If you look at price movements since the global financial crisis, there is no doubt that prices at most of these markets have reached new highs.</p>
              <p>   However, different people have different investment objectives and horizons.</p>
              <p>   In some markets, rental yields could be around 6 per cent even when property prices are not rising much, so they meet the investors' needs.</p>
              <p>   Over the longer term, property prices should go up if the demand is supported by fundamental drivers such as population growth, wealth creation and occupancy rates.</p>
              <p>   As long as the investors know what they are investing in and manage their risks properly, their investment may eventually bear fruit.</p>

              PRIVATE AND INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL FAIR, JOHOR BAHRU 2013
              
              International schools have wide appeal for both Malaysian parents and expatriates because of the international curriculum offered. The international schools in Malaysia offer a variety of curricula. These include the International Baccalaureate, International Primary Curriculum, American Curriculum, Australian Curriculum, UK Curriculum, Islamic Curriculum, Canadian Curriculum, Indian Curriculum, IGCSE, O Levels, A Levels, Cambridge and Singapore Curriculum. Each of these has its own unique characteristics, such as teaching or delivery methodology, learning philosophy or objectives, focus or emphasis, type of assessment, and extracurricular activity programme.
              
              To find out more about the different curricula offered by international schools and to find a suitable one for your children, visit:
              The 2nd Private &amp; International School Fair in Johor Bahru
              Date: 27 Oct 2013 (Sun)
              Venue: Puteri Pacific Hotel
              Time: 12noon to 5pm
              Free Admission!
              
              Speak to representatives from leading international schools in the country. Organised by Mint Communications, this fair aims to provide the ideal platform for schools to meet with parents, and for parents to find a suitable school for their children.
              
              The first ever Private &amp; International School Fair in Johor Bahru was held in 2012 at the same venue in Johor Bahru and attracted over 200 families. Visitors were mostly parents looking to send their children to private and international schools. There were many parents with young children below 6 years of age looking for preschool education options, as well as those with children who will be completing their primary education and are looking to enrol them in the secondary level at international schools. There were 20 exhibitors including learning centres. Most schools offer preschool education right up to pre-university.
              
              Majority of the visitors came from Johor and Singapore. There were also some visitors who came from other states in Malaysia, such as Kuala Lumpur and Sarawak, as well as different countries, such as the United States and Japan.
              
              Another highlight of the fair is that parents will be able to get a copy of the Education Destination Malaysia: Guide to International &amp; Private Schools. This guide is the definitive resource on international and private schools in Malaysia for both expatriate and Malaysian parents. This annual 168-page guidebook showcases the full spectrum of international and private schools in Malaysia and will empower parents by providing them with the information they need to make informed decisions about their childrenâ€™s education. This guide will be available for sale at a special price during the fair in Johor Bahru.

              From JB CIQ to Senibong Cove via EDL

              SENIBONG COVE - Secure waterfront living at Johor Bahru's east coast sanctuaryâ€¦
              
              Johor Bahru offers a lower cost of living compared with Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. The excellent new shopping centres, golf courses, sport and recreational facilities, tourist attractions, health care and schools make this a very attractive new lifestyle destination.
              
              Just as attractive is Senibong Coveâ€™s easy connection to major new employment zones and industrial estates.
              
              The area is Johor Bahruâ€™s new â€˜east coast sanctuaryâ€™ abundant in natural beauty, with traditional fishing villages and local restaurants located nearby.
              
              Travel to Johor Bahru city in just 8 minutes. And, with the completion of the Johor Bahru East Coast Highway, the Causeway is only 6 km away. 
              
              The amazing tourist attractions and fascinating culture of Singapore is only 40 minutes drive from Senibong Cove. Itâ€™s a dynamic city rich in contrast and colour where youâ€™ll find an energetic array of theme parks, museums, landmarks, cuisine, shopping, arts and architecture.

              YACHT OWNERS
                  
              Johor Bahru is accessible for yachts whose height of mast is less than 25 meters from waterline. Sail 13 miles up the western arm of Jahor Straits, past Raffles Marina and under the centre span of the Tuas Bridge, (the "Second-Link" bridge), which has a minimum vertical clearance of 25 meters at HWS. Proceed upstream, staying away from the Singapore coast and keeping close to the Malaysian mainland all the way.
                  
              All yachts requiring clearance here must ensure they fly the Q flag, otherwise they may be fined.
                  
              Yachts coming from Sebana and other ports in Malaysia also have to do harbour clearance here.
                  
              Clearance can be completed at Puteri Harbour, but still not possible at Danga Bay marina itself, however, the marina will arrange for free transport to the apropriate offices and facilitate clearance.
                  
              Immigration is at the causeway and the Harbour Master (in Jabatan Laut), 1km along the waterfront from the anchorage, towards the causeway, as is the Customs office.
                  
              Customs is only required for outward clearance and issue of Port Clearance after clearing out with the Harbour Master.
                  
              Immigration outward clearance is not required if stopping at further Malaysian ports. Passports receive a new entry stamp, which is good for three months stay in Malaysia, each time you return across the causeway from Singapore.
                  
              Last checked February 2012.
                  
              ANCHORING 
                  
              Anchor close to the causeway but on the Malaysian side. There is plenty of room between the Customs wharf and the causeway and the holding is good.
                  
              There is no charge and the boats seem to be safe here with no thefts reported so far. The dinghy can be tied up at the Customs pontoon and left for days whilst you go into Singapore etc.
                  
              Visitors from yachts are advised to wear shirts when walking through the Customs base and to wait while the men are on morning parade and prayers - or at least walk discreetly at the rear of the parade. This is of concern to the Commandant at times. This is a free and secure mooring and it would be a shame if it were to be discontinued because of the annoyance caused by a few.
                  
              Yachts can also anchor in 4.0 to 7.0 meters with excellent holding in mud/clay at Lat 01.28.47N and Long.103.43.37E just off Danga Bay Marina for free. A member of the marine staff will come out in a dinghy to welcome you and give you a choice of the best places to anchor. A floating pontoon dinghy dock is directly in front of the anchorage and has 24/7 security. Free water is also available at the dinghy dock for either jerry cans, or yachts can come alongside for water by prior arrangement.
                  
              In addition there are three yellow buoys for mooring by yachts. Although is is not clear how much has changed since the marina has been built here. Close by are shops, restaurant, a reasonable supermarket, internet access and a laundry.
                  
              MARINAS
                  
              Danga Bay Marina, previously an entertainment centre, is now under new management and much improved. It is situated 5km by road from the centre of Johor Bahru and the causeway to Singapore. Buses to and from Johor Bahru stop right outside the complex every few minutes. You need to have the exact bus fare of RM1.10. Taxis also pass by regularly (marina information updated September 2013).
                  
              A new marina, Puteri Harbour, opened on 15th January 2009, and is situated 30 minutes away from Johor Bahru. Clearance formalities can all be completed at Puteri Harbour.
                  
              CRIME
                  
              Penang and JB are reported to be the worst areas for crime in Malaysia. Take necessary precautions when going ashore and if cycling, be sure to cover baskets/crates to avoid bags being snatched.

              Tel: +607-221 5688 Fax: +607-221 5688 ,VHF Channel 74
              marina@dangabay.com
                  
              Danga Bay Marina is located just after a floating fish farm on your left, with several large fisherman houses on stilts on the right. From the entrance you can also see the distinctive roof line of the complex and four 14 storey apartment blocks which are part of the Danga Bay development. The marina entrance has now changed significantly as the entrance channel is being dredged. 
                  
              Probably the best approach is to the west of the dredgers. DON'T go between them and the reclaimed land as before, as they are tied to steel drums attached to the shore. Keep 100 metres to the west in 2 metres of water. Because of dredging operations it may be necessary for your boat to be moved. Call on 74 on approach for advice on where to berth. If no answer, anchor off and dinghy in.
                  
              There is usually plenty of empty berths. Toilets above the office with 1 shower in the ladies toilet. Berthing is 100Rm a week plus power. 50Rm a week extra if you leave the vessel unoccupied. Water is currently free (requires filtering and/or treatment to be potable) as is Wi-Fi.
                  
              Staff very helpful but VHF not always monitored, so best contacted by phone. Very handy for supplies.
                  
              Marina will arrange free transport to facilitate clearance. They also arrange fuel &amp; gas runs twice a week. Laundry drop off close by. Currenly (Feb 2013) there is a daily shuttle bus sevice to to Danga City Mall at 10am.
