              MIDA Approves 619 Manufacturing Projects In Jan-Sept 2014
              
              JOHOR BAHARU, Jan 28 (Bernama) -- A total of 619 manufacturing projects with investments of RM63.5 billion were approved by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) between January and September last year compared with 787 projects valued at RM52.1 billion in 2013.
              
              MIDA executive director of manufacturing development (resource) N.Sangaran said 147 of the projects worth RM20.1 billion approved between January and September last year were in Johor.
              
              He said Johor received the highest investment in the manufacturing sector amounted to RM14.4 billion involving 197 projects in 2013.
              
              "Johor will continue to remain a favourite among foreign investors," he said after opening a seminar on food technology industry, here today.
              
              Organised by MIDA, SPRING Singapore, Singapore Manufacturing Federation and Iskandar Regional Development Authority, the seminar is attended by over 200 participants from Malaysia and Singapore.
              
              Sangaran said MIDA approved 51 food manufacturing projects worth RM2 billion between January and September last year compared with 77 projects valued at RM4.7 billion in 2013.
              
              He said Johor received 12 of the projects worth RM399.5 million between January and September last year.
              
              Meanwhile, International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed is expected to announce the country's total investment in the manufacturing sector on Feb 28, Sangaran said.

              <p><strong>DANGA HEIGHTS - JOHOR BARU </strong></p>
              <p>I saw this project signage while travelling in the bus from Skudai district to Johor Baru city. It is just next to the ongoing project of Brio Residences - Paradigm, which is also just next to The Platino Condo project. Danga Heights development is just next to Skudai Highway towards Johor Baru city, near and opposite to the already completed Danga Utama Centre, which is also near to the Kipmarts shopping complex in Tampoi. This place is inbetween Tampoi and Skudai district, which is not far from JB City, by bus from JB City approximately around 20 minutes and if by private vehicles or taxis probably within 10 minutes. This project is on the high ground area.</p>

              <p>Iskandar is cheap in Sing$ terms... where can you get a landed property for S$500k. If you have extra cash, and have the time to travel to JB on a weekly or forthnightly basis, go ahead and buy yourself a nice holiday home over there. It's really cheap in comparison with Singapore.</p>
              <p>Do make you sure you buy Gated and Guarded (G&amp;G) condos/landed property only. My malaysians friend themselves also choose to buy in G&amp;G properties.</p>
              <p>Beware the market liquidity when you want to sell... its not as liquid as singapore. </p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth...</p>

              Iskandar Malaysia Declared As RCE
              
              JOHOR BAHARU, Feb 7 (Bernama) -- Iskandar Malaysia has been declared as the Regional Centre of Expertise for Sustainable Development (RCE).
              
              State Health and Environment Committee chairman Datuk Ayub Rahmat said Iskandar RCE is a platform to bring together individuals and organisations to promote sustainable development.
              
              "This recognition is a step towards ensuring that Iskandar Malaysia achieve 50 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emission by 2025," he told reporters after closing the Iskandar Malaysia Sustainable and Low Carbon Exhibition organised by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), in Johor Baharu, Saturday.
              
              RCE has been recognised by United Nations University as a network of cooperation between experts, individuals and organisations who are committed to build sustainable development via education.
              
              RCE Iskandar is the third RCE in Malaysia after RCE Penang and RCE Central Malaysia.

              The Straits TimesThursday, Feb 12, 2015
              
              PETER LIM $153M TONIC FOR JOHOR MEDICAL HUB 
              
              Singaporean tycoon Peter Lim has stepped up plans to transform part of the land he owns in Iskandar into a medical hub. TMC LifeSciences, a Malaysia- listed firm which he controls, is buying a health complex in the area for RM400 million (S$153 million). Thomson Iskandar, as the hub is called, will be ready in 2018.
              
              It is owned by a firm called Best Blend, which is in turn 70 per cent owned by Mr Lim, with Johor Crown Prince Tunku Ismail Idris holding the other 30 per cent.
              
              The buyout deal announced last Friday will bring Thomson Iskandar into TMC, giving its investors a stake in the area's fast- growing medical sector.
              
              TMC chief executive Wong Chiang Yin told The Straits Times yesterday: "Johor Baru is under-served in terms of the number of private hospitals and beds... There is scope for growth in the private hospital scene."
              
              Thomson Iskandar's location "in the heart of Johor Baru and close to Singapore" is a big plus, he added. It is about 1km from the Causeway and will be home to a tertiary care hospital and an outpatient centre with 400 clinics by the time it is completed in 2018.
              
              It will be part of Mr Lim's Vantage Bay project, which will include one of the tallest condos in Malaysia, a mall with a net lettable area of one million sq ft, a hotel as well as office blocks. The project is expected to take 10 years to complete. The Vantage Bay site is owned by a 70-30 joint venture between Mr Lim and the Johor royal family.
              
              "We expect the majority of our customers to be Johoreans, but there should also be a substantial number of foreign patients, such as Singaporeans looking for affordable health care, and Indonesians," said Dr Wong.
              
              The 1.6ha site for the medical hub has been approved for a hospital of up to 272 beds, but the one being built - Iskandariah Hospital - is eventually expected to have capacity for 500 beds, subject to regulatory approval.
              
              Thomson International, a subsidiary of Thomson Medical, will manage the complex.
              
              TMC is also increasing bed capacity at Tropicana Medical Centre, a hospital it owns in Kota Damansara in Selangor. There could eventually be 1,050 beds when both the Selangor and Johor Baru projects are fully developed.
              
              TMC's shares closed at 64 sen last Friday before the announcement, but gained 12.5 per cent to 72 sen yesterday. The deal will be funded by the issuance of new TMC shares.
              
              Dr Wong also said the acquisition underscored TMC's recovery from its loss-making days.
              
              "The current management team came on board in 2012 and we are now firmly in the black. Now that we are profitable, it's time for us to look beyond Selangor," he said.
              
              Thomson Iskandar will add to Iskandar's budding health-care sector, which includes the 300-bed Gleneagles Medini Hospital - due to open in the second half of this year - and the 80-bed Columbia Asia Hospital in Nusajaya, which opened in 2010.
              
              As at end October last year, health care accounted for RM2.59 billion or 1.7 per cent of cumulative committed investments in Iskandar since 2006.

              OUR EXPERIENCE WITH COLUMBIA ASIA NUSAJAYA HOSPITAL 
              
              Thought I'd share our experience in healthcare facilities in Johor.
              
              Some of you may know that I gave birth to baby James in Columbia Asia Nusajaya hospital. We decided to switch from Raffles Hospital SG to Columbia Asia when I was about 7 months pregnant, mainly due to the hospital's proximity and flexibility of going home post delivery (Myself and baby would be stuck in Singapore for weeks if we're to deliver in SG as we'd need to wait for James' passport to be completed).
              
              Columbia Asia Nusajaya is quite a new hospital located near Bukit Indah (10 mins drive from East Ledang).
              
              Columbia Asia Sdn Bhd is 30% owned by the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and 70% by a US-based fund, the International Columbia USA LLC (ICU), which comprise over 150 individual and institutional investors. The hospital provides quite an extensive range of health services as you can see here.

              REGENCY SPECIALIST HOSPITAL - JOHOR 
              
              Besides Columbia Asia, we have also visited Regency Specialist Hospital a couple of times.
              
              "Regency is the first private hospital in Johor Bahru to be approved under Ministry of Health, Singapore, for the use of Medisave overseas for the approved hospitalisation and day surgeries. Regency was conferred the Malaysian Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC) certification by Ministry of Health, Malaysia, for providing healthcare services to regional patients". - See more at: http://www.regencyspecialist.com/about-us/introduction/#sthash.RWqTnql6.dpuf
              
              Located in Bandar Seri Alam, this hospital is bigger than Columbia Asia but is quite far away from East Ledang (about 40 minutes drive).

              Wait for the property market in Singapore to go up again then sell. Settle your new BTO flat in full. Look for a private property that are within your financial means to service the bank loan and rent it out in a short term or long term. A word of advise, by the age of 40, you should be free from any financial debts so you can be free from financial burdens and concentrate to do something else to make your money grow. I know millionaires and billionaires when they purchase residential property or properties, they bought it in cash to gain high discount and they do not have to worry about exit plans when the economy is down. Good luck.

              <p>Thanks very much for your valuable input, Zulkifli. That's what I planned to do, although all property agents i've contacted asked me to purchase private property after selling my resale HDB.</p>
              <p>Do you think I shall apply for BTO now? (which will be completed by the next 4-5 years) By then, i will evaluate the market price, and if it is good to sell my current flat, i will do so, and settle the BTO in full payment. I assume I will still have left with some cash from the sold flat. I can then save and use that money to loan for Pvt property. What do you think?</p>
