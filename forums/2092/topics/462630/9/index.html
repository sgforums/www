              OLD CHANG KEE CURRY PUFF 
              
              In 1993, Old Chang Kee opened its first overseas franchise outlets in Malaysia, Indonesia, China and Japan featuring the slogan â€œA taste of Singaporeâ€�. A factory in South Africa and distribution to taverns and supermarkets there followed in 1994. Expansion abroad was rapid, with 20 outlets in Indonesia and 10 in Malaysia by the end of the first year of their foray overseas and sales in each market passing the S$1 million mark. In Japan, Old Chang Kee puffs were distributed through coffee house chains, leisure destinations and vending machines at the rate of hundreds of thousands each month. By 1996, there were 30 franchised outlets in Malaysia, Indonesia, South Africa, China, Japan, India and New Zealand. In Singapore, Old Chang Kee produced curry puffs at a 20,000 square foot factory in Woodlands and sold between 12,000 to 16,000 puffs daily at its 20 retail outlets.
              
              However, business at the overseas franchises eventually declined. There were complaints about the quality and consistency of the puffs, and the franchise outlets became unprofitable. Han decided to terminate all 24 overseas franchises in 2002 at a loss of about S$50,000. By contrast, the Old Chang Kee brand remained strong in Singapore, and the company racked up S$14 million in sales in 2002.
              
              Diversification and re-expansion overseas
              
              Hanâ€™s nephew William Lim joined the company in 1995 and became Old Chang Keeâ€™s managing director in 2003. Lim increased the number of outlets to 40 by 2005, with half of these having been opened within the previous two years. The menu was also expanded to include other fried items such as chicken wings, fish balls and nuggets, and a delivery service as well as a fast food cafe concept called OCK Take 5 was introduced. A research and development team was given the task of coming up with a new product every three months, and the company attained halal certification. The companyâ€™s turnover reached S$20 million in 2004.
              
              In 2005, Old Chang Kee re-entered overseas markets with stricter controls for foreign franchises. Three factories in Malaysia and Thailand were opened to maintain the quality of the curry puffs, and retail outlets were opened in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. To maintain freshness and taste, the puffs were manufactured at the factories then fried at the various outlets. By 2008, there were 54 outlets in Singapore, two in Kuala Lumpur, four in Indonesia, and two in Manila.

              Singapore businesses forced to venture abroad to survive
              
              SINGAPORE -- Singapore firms have for decades been encouraged to spread their wings into foreign markets.
              
              But given the twin challenges of rising business costs and manpower shortages, an increasing number of companies are now taking flight just to survive.
              
              As Singapore restructures its economy, the government has been encouraging companies to regionalize, and the upcoming Budget is expected to include new measures to help firms venture abroad.
              
              At the moment, says Singapore Business Federation (SBF) Chief Operating Officer Victor Tay, there is a growing number of companies which want to move out of Singapore altogether.
              
              â€œIn the past, companies would keep their headquarters and operations here and replicate another center elsewhere for marketing purposes,â€� he said. â€œNow there is a group saying, we are actually uprooting part of our operations and shifting it out because we can't survive here.â€�
              
              Some companies are even thinking of relocating their entire operations elsewhere, he added.
              
              The SBF began noticing this trend last year, Tay said, as business leaders from both small and large companies kept bringing it up in their focus groups.
              
              Chan Chong Beng, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (Asme) agreed.
              
              â€œWe have been getting more complaints from SMEs that they can't get workers,â€� he said. â€œRising costs, plus the problems of not having enough workers â€” 2012 was a very tough year for SMEs.â€�
              
              In its most recent survey of 3,000 member firms, the SBF found that 15 percent of those polled planned to relocate their businesses, either partially or entirely. Another 1 percent said they were winding up their businesses.
              
              R-Logic, an SME which provides repairs and customer care services for consumer electronics, is relocating the more labor-intensive part of its operations to Johor Baru to save costs.
              
              â€œEven when we take into account the added transportation costs of moving the goods between JB and here, the cost reduction is good enough for us to have decided to shift there,â€� said managing director Ken Tan.
              
              Singapore's Story of Internationalization
              
              Singapore's history of internationalization has three chapters thus far, says IE Singapore chief executive Teo Eng Cheong.
              
              The first, which encompasses the decades prior to 1990, is what he refers to as Singapore's â€œgrowing upâ€� years.

              China's rail car giant starts building manufacturing center in Malaysia
              
              BATU GAJAH, Malaysia, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's leading railway car manufacturer, China South Locomotive and Rolling Stock Corporation Ltd. (CSR), started the building of its 131 million U. S. dollars ASEAN manufacturing and maintenance center in Malaysia on Tuesday.
              
              Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, officiating the ground breaking ceremony in Batu Gajah of Perak State, said the project is a result of the good bilateral relations between Malaysia and China.
              
              "The first phase of the project, valued at 400 million ringgit (131 million U.S. dollars), would create 800 jobs," he told local residents and railway employees.The ASEAN rail center would cover all-in-one scope of work of production, assembly, testing, overhaul and refurbishment.
              
              The first phase of the project is expected to be completed by mid-2014, with the annual capacity of the production of 100 carriages and the overhaul of around 150.
              
              Zhou Qinghe, general manager of CSR Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co., Ltd. (CSR ZELC), a CSR subsidiary and an active player in Malaysia's mass transit projects, said the company is eyeing Malaysia as the base to promote its products in other Southeast Asian countries.
              
              CSR ZELC has won the bid for 20 sets of light rail vehicles for Malaysia's AMPANG Line Extension Project, and the cars will be among the first to be manufactured by the new plant.
              
              "We managed to become accredited in the country after several years of good cooperation with Malaysia," Zhou told Xinhua.
              
              The agreement signed between the Malaysian government and the company last year also involves technical cooperation in railway engineering and technology, as well as human resources training.
              
              CSR, based in Beijing and listed on Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets, has been developed into one of the major players in the global railway transport industry and is one of the biggest by global sales revenue.

              Good. Hope you know the price difference too. Malaysians and some Singaporeans in Malaysia are having at least 3 cars in one household. One for the father, one for the mother and one for their children plus a motorcycle.

              <p>Yes zulkifli, i'm also aware of the price difference. But at the end of the day its a matter of opinion. Some might not want to travel over the causeway just to have 3 cars and wud prefer a shorter trip to work instead on being stuck at the dam causeway.</p>
