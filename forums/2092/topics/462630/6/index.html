              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">SINGAPOREAN buyers make up 74 per cent of non-Malaysians who have purchased properties in Iskandar Malaysia developed by UEM Sunrise.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>   Most of these Singaporeans are people who go to Johor frequently for business and those seeking a weekend home, said UEM Sunrise chief executive Wan Abdullah Wan Ibrahim, reported The Straits Times Online.</p>
              <p>   "They have been buying both landed homes and strata developments. The landed houses are in our East Ledang development and the strata units are at our high-rise developments in Horizon Hills, Puteri Harbour and East Ledang," he said at a briefing on Thursday.</p>
              <p>   The high numbers of investors flocking to Iskandar has pushed prices up considerably, Mr Abdullah said.</p>
              <p>   Prices of bungalows at UEM's East Ledang development have surged 44 per cent on average in the resale market since 2011.</p>
              <p>   Even so, prices in Iskandar are still much cheaper than in Singapore, he added.</p>
              <p>   The price of a 1,500 sq ft three-bedroom unit at the upcoming Marina One condominium in Singapore is likely to be "in the region of 11 million ringgit", he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Swimming pool villas</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   "For 11 million ringgit, you can buy two swimming pool villas in East Ledang. These are villas of 5,500 sq ft, each with a swimming pool and sitting on a land of about 10,000 sq ft.</p>
              <p>   "You can buy two and still have some change left over for a penthouse at our Teega condominium in Puteri Harbour, and still go for a tour around the world with your family."</p>
              <p>   UEM Sunrise is partnering Mapletree Investments to manage Marina One, developed by M+S, the joint venture between Khazanah Nasional and Temasek Holdings.</p>

              This reminded me of one of the SG Forum member....can't recall who was it that said, "Australians retire in Bali. Singaporeans retire in JB." Its true. While I was living in Bali for 3.5 years, I saw many Australians living there and not only that I saw many Australians doing business there too. I know many of the restaurants, shops and small hotels/motels are own by Australians. In fact about more than 70% of the businesses in Bali there are own by foreigners who are living there.

            <div class='col-md body'>For young Singaporean business people who are interested in opening up business outside Singapore, my advise is that you should live in whichever country that you have setup you business. Do not depend on your foreign partners to run the business for you. If you really determine enough to be successful and apply whatever business knowledge / experiences you have gain as a young entrepreneur in Singapore, chances are you will become a successful business person. In this matter, your paper qualification is not an important factor but rather your courage to face whatever obstacles you will be facing while doing business overseas. Don't be afraid and willing to take risks are the main criterias as a business person and to become a successful business person.</div>

              <p><br>Talk is very cheap lah! I have just watch an TV programme from Discovery Channel name "Son of Guns" session 4 episode 4  and the gun manufacturer Will Hayden he is facing problem with his gun manufacturing project because he cannot get his part for that rifle and if the client could not get their order in time or maybe this customised rife at all, Will will not get the revenue and not issue the 'salary' to his worker.</p>
              <p>Although not sure this is another reality tv gimmicks, the moral of story : a million of things might go wrong and if you have workers working for you, that kind of 'leverage' will add higher risk to business owner and rest assure that if boss choose not to pay their workers regardless of what vaild business problem, chance are you will run into problem with labour's law and maybe hopely 'god' can save you or your business.</p>
              <p>Finally another common 'risk' that the boss will faced would be their workers WILL demanding for pay rising. I'm sure you know what happen to the local SMRT bus drivers' strike and at least Singapore is run by legal system it is considered an 'rare' case, in other countries like US, currently the fast food workers is on strike to 'fight for 15' dollar : <a href="http://fightfor15.org/">http://fightfor15.org</a> and mind you, they have the 'right' to do that.</p>
              <p>You give in to their demand, you will have low profit margin, if you didn't, your business 's operation will be ruined. Also the US government is considered taxing the rich which will make these companies looking for elsewhere for opportunity. So if you feel that the above 'risks' is considered to be an successful entrepreneurship, then maybe you should 'follow' your successful advise and faced these problem yourself instead? <img id="yui_3_7_2_25_1380467266639_59" src="http://mail.yimg.com/ok/u/assets/img/emoticons/emo29.gif" alt="*:)) laughing"></p>

                  Hmm...I just don't talk. In fact I speak through first hand experience and I've encountered those obstables myself with composure. Whatever you have posted above is part and puzzle of business and every business people will face it without any doubt. I see you only talk about this through your reading and hearing something from someone else experience without actually doing it yourself and experience it first hand. About labour law and legal system, every country have their own labour law and legal system. You just need to abide to it and try to overcome the problem. About worker strikes, its their right to pass across their messages of unhappiness to the management if the company refuses to listen to their unhappiness. It happens in first world country, developed countries and third world country. Their Union is not control by the government unlike in Singapore. Hmmm....there are many Singaporean entrepreneurs who have venture their business overseas like in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia etc and having good business there too and they rather have their main business operated from there. Its a simple fact my friend that Singapore market is small and saturated unlike in those big countries.....they have more opportunities if you see carefully. About low business profit margin and high running costs...its a simple solution....if you see that the country where you have invested is no longer profitable....cut your loses by closing your business and move on to other country that will help you to sustain your business...see...so simple.
