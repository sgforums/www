              Hong Kong developer launches its first project in Johor Baru
                  
              PUBLIC-LISTED Hong Kong-based property developer New World Development Co Ltd has chosen Johor Baru for its first residential property development project in Malaysia.
                  
              Taipan Eagle Sdn Bhd, a joint-venture company formed by New World Development and Luen Yum Development (M) Sdn Bhd, is undertaking the on-going project.
                  
              The gated-and-guarded project, named New World Garden, comprises 96 units of high-end residential properties on a 4.85ha site along Jalan Masai Baru in Mukim Plentong.
                  
              The properties are four units of three-storey bungalows priced from RM4mil and 92 units of three-storey semi-detached villas with prices starting from RM2.4mil.
                  
              The project also includes a sprawling 40,000sq ft club house with amenities for residents such as swimming pools, gymnasium, barbecue pits and function rooms.
                  
              â€œWe decided to come to Johor Baru in view of the positive development taking place in Iskandar Malaysia and the good growth prospects,â€� said Luen Yuen director Michael Tham.
                  
              He said this when met after the launch of the project last Friday which was attended by senior management from New World Development led by executive director and joint general manager Gary Chen Guanzhan.
                  
              Tham said the project has a gross development value of RM240mil and is expected to be completed in the secondquarter of 2014.
                  
              â€œWe are banking on the projectâ€™s strategic location and its easy accessibility from other parts of Johor Baru to attract buyers,â€� he said.
                  
              The project is only a short drive to the commercial centre in Taman Molek, Johor Baru city centre, Danga Bay, Senai Airport and Singapore via the Causeway.
                  
              Tham said Taipan Eagle plans to embark on a bigger development, such as a township development, in Johor Baru and the Klang Valley in the future but did not set any timeframe.
                  
              Chen said the New World Garden offered greenery and serenity reminiscent of resort living, providing the best in a high-end residential enclave befitting the status of the home owners.
              
              â€œThe development also takes into account of feng shui elements, with the houses facing north to bring luck and wealth to the owners,â€� he said.
                  
              Chen said prospective buyers would not have to worry about the completion of the project as it is being undertaken by reputable companies.
                  
              New World Development was formed in 1970 and listed on Hong Kongâ€™s Hang Seng Index two years later. It is the fourth largest property company in Hong Kong with HK$286.3bil (RM111.42bil) in assets as of June, 30, last year.
                  
              It is owned by the Hong Kong public-listed company Chow Tai Fook Enterprise Ltd, a leading jeweller with 80 years of history, in China, Hong Kong and Macau.
                  
              â€œOur company also has a presence in over 21 cities in China and the country is a big market for us as property demand there is growing over the years,â€� Chen said.

              Foreigners can buy Malaysian properties worth RM1 million or more, double from now
              
              Announcing this when presenting the 2014 Budget, Prime Minister Najib Razak said this was among a slew of measures being implemented to temper the sharp rise of homes in the country.
              
              http://news.asiaone.com/news/malaysia/foreigners-can-buy-malaysian-properties-worth-rm1-million-or-more-double-now
              
              ****************************
              
              Measures will have impact on Sâ€™poreans, but unlikely to kill market completely: Analysts
              
              SINGAPORE â€” The clock is ticking for Singaporeans who want to buy a mass-market home in the booming Iskandar region, as foreigners will only be able to buy properties in Malaysia priced above RM1 million (S$390,000) from next year.
              
              At that threshold, Singaporeans will not be able to buy the sort of property that they have been snapping up in droves. As a result, the regionâ€™s position as a top investment destination may take a hit, said analysts.
              
              While there is no official data on property transactions in Iskandar, anecdotal evidence suggests that, although prices have been on a steep uptrend, the vast majority of homes there are priced below RM1 million, which means they will soon be off-limits to Singapore buyers.

              Singapoeans buying cars in Malaysia to beat COE prices
              
              As prices for the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) continue to soar, some Singaporeans have been seen buying cars in Malaysia, according to a report in Lianhe Wanbao.
              
              The COE price now for a small car below 1,600cc is $64,201, while cars above 1,600cc fetch $91,000.
              
              The open category COE, which can be used for any vehicle, is $92,010.
              
              In light of these prices, some Singaporeans have been tempted to buy cars from across the Causeway instead.
              
              Checks with car dealers in Malaysia found that a brand new 1,600cc Toyota Altis sedan can cost S$70,000 less than in Singapore.
              
              The car can be bought at RM$107,121 ($44,633) from a car dealer in Malaysia. In Singapore, it costs $116,688, including COE.
              
              A Malaysian car dealer revealed that one to two Singaporeans will show up every month to buy cars.
              
              This practice, however, is illegal.
              
              Most of the buyers are said to own buinesses in both Singapore and Malaysia.
              
              According to Raymond Tang, Honorary Secretary of the Singapore Vehicle Traders Association, most of these businessmen pass the Malaysian-registered cars to their employees and use them to commute between the two countries.
              
              A check with the Land Transport Authority confirmed that Singaporeans and Permanent Residents are not allowed to own or use foreign registered cars here.
              
              Those found doing so may be jailed up to three months or fined up to $2,000.
              
              Repeat offenders face up to six monthsâ€™ jail and can be fined up to $5,000.

              Retired to Malaysia but not allowed to drive to Singapore
              
              MY WIFE and I recently retired to Malaysia due to the property rules as well as the high cost of living in Singapore.
              
              We come back to Singapore to visit relatives and friends, and attend medical appointments every two to three months.
              
              However, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has informed me that as I am not an employee in Malaysia, my wife and I - a Singaporean and Singapore permanent resident - are not allowed to drive our Malaysia-registered car into Singapore.
              
              I understand that this ruling is to close the loophole in the control of the vehicle population in Singapore, but I hope the LTA can allow me to drive our Malaysia-registered car in based on the following:
              
              - My wife and I need a car to run errands in Malaysia as public transport there is not yet well developed, except in the city centre.
              
              - It would be very expensive for us to maintain a Singapore-registered car to drive in Malaysia.
              
              - Should there be an accident while driving a Singapore-registered car in Malaysia, it would be tedious to tow the car back and make a claim in Singapore. My insurance agent is also unsure of how to handle such a claim.
              
              - Taking the bus would be too inconvenient, and flying too expensive for us as we return to Singapore regularly.
              
              - We do not stay in Singapore for many days each time.
              
              My use of a Malaysia-registered car in Singapore would not be more than that of visiting Malaysians and Singaporeans working and residing in Malaysia.
              
              I hope the LTA can review my case. Though retirees are no longer working, we have contributed towards the Singapore economy and continue to do so in the form of property and income taxes. We do not deserve to be disadvantaged this way.

              Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios
                  
              Pinewood Studios to grow Malaysia's film industry
                  
              Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios targets to train 900 people by December to supply its studios in Johor.
                  
              Nusajaya, Johor: Adventures on a grand scale including technically advanced films like 'Life of Pi' will soon be filmed at Pinewood Studios' state-of-the-art facility in Malaysia's southern state of Johor.
                  
              Pinewood Studios is building a new integrated studio facility in Iskandar Malaysia.
                  
              Mr Michael Lake, CEO of Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios, said: "This is an initiative of Khazanah Nasional. They wanted to build the film industry in Malaysia. After a lot of studies they realized the best way to do this is was to create a large film studio to anchor the industry in Malaysia, and this is about attracting international productions especially into Iskandar.
                  
              "They went out and did a deal with Pinewood to license their name and to involve Pinewood in the management of the facility. So it gave us straight away an international recognition for the studios."
                  
              Since the movie-making business has its ups and downs, to keep overheads in check, the facility will be have about 50 staff - mostly deployed in the television and post-production areas.
                  
              The 50-acre Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios will have state-of-the-art film stages, TV studios and post-production suites.
                  
              It will have two 12,000 sq ft television studios.
                  
              There will also be five film stages. The largest stage, at 30,000 sq ft, will have an indoor water tank for productions involving work on or under water.
                  
              "That will be the only one in Asia Pacific and that's to film those projects that are set at sea. 'Life of Pi' is a prime example. With this tank we can film that production here in Iskandar."
                  
              And training is already underway to prepare locals for the creative industry.
                  
              Mr Lake said: "Training is a very important part of what we are doing. We're building these studios in a green field area where there's been no film industry before.
                  
              "So one of the key things for us is attracting talent but most important of all, is building a local talent force. So we've done that in conjunction with the Iskandar Regional Development Authority.
                  
              "We created a training programme. In fact, we've just graduated our first 147 students that we trained in hair and make-up, wardrobe, costume design, production accounting.
                  
              "And it was a very smart course, because we took people who had already graduated in the basic skills there. We took in carpenters and trained them as set construction people.
                  
              "We took somebody who'd been training to do hair for a salon and cross skilled them into the film industry. So it was a very easy start for us to build a strong talent force here.
                  
              "Our estimation is by the end of December we'll have trained 900 people for the film industry to supply our studios."
                  
              Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios says plans are also underway to provide internship opportunities for local film-major students when University of Southern California (USC) operates an international branch in nearby Edu-city.
                  
              And with film companies flying into Iskandar for production work, apartment rentals, hotel rooms and a range of other services all stand to benefit.
                  
              Edward Kollmer, general manager of Thistle Hotel in Johor Bahru, said: "It's had a great impact. Our business is seven days a week. Initially business was always strong on weekends. Some good examples of this would be Legoland opening in September 2012 and it has increased our business at the weekends, in particular.
                  
              "Also, we've seen developments within the Iskandar project with regards to Educity and we've seen a lot of overseas organizations come to JB...they use our facilities and our hotels to develop their originations. So it's had a fantastic impact.
                  
              "Our business year-on-year has grown and with the sustainability of the plan has continued to grow moving forward."
                  
              Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios, once fully operational, is expected to become the regional hub for film and television production - which augurs well for the various stakeholders, especially local Johoreans.
