              In the past, when MACS PASS was processed by Malaysia Immigration at CIQ Johor Bahru, in the arrival section of the CIQ building, just next to the escalator (which is going up to the arrival immigration counter from the bus bay arriving from Singapore), you only pay RM30 for one year. But now you pay in Singapore dollars and you have to leave your passport for one day and collect it the next day. In the past you could have the MACS Pass done within minutes and made the payment. 
                          
              Hmmm..

              INTERVIEW WITH SAM GOI
                  
              1. To be a good Businessman, you must be a good Salesman.
              2. Timing and Location is very important.
              3. Singapore Market is small.
                  
              I agree with him.

              Country Garden unveils RM175b 'Forest City' project
              
              SINGAPORE: "Forest City", a lush urban getaway on four man-made islands in Iskandar Malaysia was formally unveiled on Friday by Country Garden Holdings Co Ltd, a Hong Kong-listed property developer.
              
              Sprawled over 1,386.05ha, Forest City is a joint development with Johor's Esplanade Danga 88 Sdn Bhd.
              
              Forest City is South-East Asia's first and largest mixed-use green development in terms of the number of units to be built with a vertical greenery and smart city design theme. 
              
              With an estimated investment of S$58.3 billion (RM175.8 billion) over the next 20 years, Forest City is expected to fuel the economic development of Iskandar region, the main southern development corridor in Johor and neighbouring Singapore.
              
              Eight industries including education, healthcare and tourism will be the main economic pillars of growth at Forest City.
              
              Forest City is the first of its kind mega development in South-East Asia.

              FOREST CITY CONCEPTUAL MASTER PLAN
              Country Garden Pacificview, Iskandar Development Region, Malaysia
              
              "Sasaki's master plan for Forest City seeks to establish a symbiotic relationship between development and the natural environment. Organized around the Seagrass Preserve - a critical ecological feature of the region - Forest City embraces this unique marine sanctuary with a contiguous network of complementary waterfront landscapes that offer opportunities to learn about and protect the region's ecosystems. With 31.4 linear kilometers of coastline, edges are designed to mimic naturally occurring features of Malaysia's coastal ecosystems, including tidal pools and shallow bays that provide critical marine habitat and support local fisheries. The most essential of these is Forest City's restored mangroves, which provide over ten linear kilometers of essential habitat and help to improve regional water quality".

              AIRASIA ADDS NEW ROUTE FROM JOHOR BAHRU TO GUANGZHOU
              on: April 17, 2016In: Business
              
              JOHOR BAHRU â€“ AirAsia is poised to make Johor Bahru the gateway for Chinese travellers to visit Southern Peninsular Malaysia with the introduction of AirAsiaâ€™s new direct flight to Guangzhou, which is scheduled to commence operations on May 29.
              
              The daily flights connecting Johor Bahru and Guangzhou will be the airlineâ€™s 17th route into China from Malaysia, and the second route into China launched this year after Shantou.
              
              Celebratory all-in-fares from as low as RM88* one way are available for booking online at airasia.com from yesterday until April 28, for the travel period of May 29 to Oct 29.
              
              â€œAlternatively, the promotional fares are also available on AirAsiaâ€™s mobile app on iPhone and Android devices, as well as the mobile site mobile.airasia.com.
              
              Spencer Lee, AirAsia Berhad Head of Commercial said, â€œOur southern hub of Johor Bahru is one of the key development points for us this year, and we are pleased to be connecting the rapidly developing Johor Bahru to Guangzhou, China through this unique route that will be operated exclusively by AirAsia.
              
              â€œThis will further increase our market share in Johor Bahru, and we look forward to working closely with all key industry players here to grow Johor Bahru together.â€�
              
              Md Derick Basir, CEO of Senai Airport Terminal Services Sdn Bhd said, â€œSenai Airport is delighted to introduce the new route to China by AirAsia. With the ongoing development in Iskandar Malaysia, there has been a lot of demand for air travel between Johor and certain parts of China. As such, we believe that the new Johor Bahru â€“ Guangzhou route introduced by AirAsia will be a success.
              
              â€œWe have been exploring on the possibility of starting a Johor Bahru â€“ China route with a few parties and AirAsia was the first airline to act on the opportunity. This demonstrates AirAsiaâ€™s seriousness and commitment to further develop Senai Airport as their secondary hub, after KLIA2. Now, the people of Johor can travel to China more conveniently compared to before. Previously, they had to travel to KLIA2 to take a flight to China. With the new daily flights between Johor and Guangzhou by AirAsia, Johoreans need not to do so anymore.â€�
              
              YB Datuk Tee Siew Kiong Johor State EXCO of Tourism, Trade and Consumer? said, â€œ?The state government welcomes AirAsiaâ€™s decision to launch this new route connecting Guangzhou to Johor Bahru.
              
              â€œWe believe that this is definitely the right time as we have seen an increase in tourists, business travellers and investors from China especially from Guangzhou into Johor Bahru lately. This initiative brings both cities closer, and will help to boost the cooperation between Johor Bahru and Guangzhou especially in tourism, trade and investment. Furthermore, the e-visa entry which was implemented by the government last March has made it much more convenient for Chinese visitors to enter Malaysia,â€� added YB Datuk.
              
              AirAsia Group currently operates 139 weekly flights into of Johor Bahruâ€™s Senai International Airport, inclusive of both domestic and international flights.
              
              Formerly known as Canton, Guangzhou is a sprawling port city located at northwest of Hong Kong on the Pearl River. This capital city of Guangdong Province is a prosperous metropolis that is the third biggest after Beijing and Shanghai.
              
              Tourists to Guangzhou must not miss the breathtaking night city view walking along the Pearl River bank, go to the top of the Canton Tower to enjoy a birds-eye view of the city, visit the historical Temple of the Six Banyan Trees and many more.

              Innovate UK
              
              GREATER UK-MALAYSIA COLLABORATION IN DEVELOPING SMART CITIES
              
              MOU signed during Connected Cities trade missionâ€™s visit to Malaysia.
              
              Innovate UK / UKTI Connected Cities mission at Forest City development in Johor
              
              The Malaysian and UK Governments are joining hands in making urbanisation manageable and, most importantly, sustainable for the future. Smart technologies will be essential to achieving this. Both countries have taken a number of positive steps in their rapidly developing relationship around smart cities, to help position each other as a leader in the provision of innovative solutions in Europe and South East Asia respectively.
              
              Through our joint Newton-Ungku Omar Coordination Fund, Innovate UK, Research Councils UK (RCUK) and the Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology (MIGHT) have come together to fund and deliver a new type of programme, called Research and Innovation Bridges.
              
              We opened this funding competition in June 2015, jointly investing up to Â£14.4 million in collaborative research and development projects to stimulate innovation in response to Malaysiaâ€™s urbanisation challenges. The competition has been popular, with approximately 70 applications. All partners hope to fund a range of exciting collaborations between Malaysian and UK businesses and research organisations, proposing novel solutions to help Malaysia achieve its ambitious smart city aspirations.
              
              Malaysia also hosted a hugely successful Connected Cities Trade Mission from the UK in March 2016. This is the third Connected Cities delegation from the UK to visit Malaysia since 2012, reinforcing the UKâ€™s ongoing commitment to developing closer links with Malaysia in this critical field. The mission was strongly endorsed by the UK government.

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">During the joint-announcement, Najib and Lee also announced the proposed Malaysia-Singapore RTS link expected to be up and running by 2018.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">"Bukit Chagar has been chosen as the terminating station here of the RTS linking Johor Baru and Singapore,'' said Hasni, adding that the project bodes well for the multi-billion ringgit Johor Baru city centre transformation project.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">He explained that the trains for the RTS would be run above ground (grate) or sunken tunnel but the main objective of the RTS was to improve connectivity and accessibility between the two countries.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">KGV International Property Consultants (M) Sdn Bhd director Samuel Tan Wee Cheng said the major physical hindrance between Singapore and Iskandar Malaysia was the inefficient road connectivity despite having two links - the Causeway in Johor Baru and the Second Link Crossing in Tanjung Kupang, Gelang Patah.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">The congestion is heavy especially during peak hours and public holidays.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">"This resulted in economic loss and opportunity cost as investors are deterred from investing in Iskandar Malaysia," he said.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">The RTS would take the pressure off the Causeway and save time as it would be a station-to-station connectivity with the custom and immigration integrated within it.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">He also noted that the Malaysian authorities must ensure ample parking at the station and reliable feeder bus system to ferry thousands of commuters daily.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">"When this happens, Iskandar Malaysia will experience increased excitement especially in the property sector,'' added Tan.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">He added Malaysians and even some Singaporeans would stay in Iskandar Malaysia and commute to the republic daily for work and Iskandar Malaysian residential properties would be a good proposition for holiday home.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">Tan noted that the less congested links would encourage more factories from Singapore to relocate their operations to the economic growth corridor here and this would push demand for industrial properties.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">He said Iskandar Malaysia would then become an alternative site for the Singapore-based companies wanting to offer products or services at a lower cost compared with Singapore.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">"The retail sector will also benefit from this development due to the influx of population from the city state and the strong Singapore dollar,'' said Tan.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">Other economic segments which would also benefit from the RTS include hospitality, tourism, food and beverage, medical, entertainment and education.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">Meanwhile, Johor Real Housing Estate and Developers branch chairman Hoe Mee Ling said the RTS would be a catalyst to the property development in Iskandar Malaysia.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">With more job creations and higher population, the two factors would create higher housing demand in south Johor to cater for the influx of domestic and foreign investors.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">"Iskandar Malaysia is progressing well and the development taking place is the economic region is the testament that it is moving in the right direction,'' said Hoe.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">Hoe said it was only logical for Singaporean manufacturing companies planning to relocate their operations elsewhere to choose Iskandar Malaysia due to its close proximity with the republic.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">"They can have the best of both worlds Singapore and Johor Baru just less than two kilometres away and improvement in connectivity and accessibility will benefit both countries,'' she added.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">The Johor Causeway, which is about 1.06km was completed in 1932 and links Johor Baru to Woodlands on the other side of the Straits of Johor.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">About 100,000 vehicles use it daily.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #2c3643; font-family: Lato, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">Johor and Singapore are also connected via the Second Link, a 1.9km dual three-lane carriageway linking Tanjung Kupang in Gelang Patah to Tuas in Singapore.</p>
