              the World’s Richest Investors</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Warren Buffett and George
              Soros all started with nothing — and made billion-dollar fortunes
              solely by investing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">But their investment
              strategies are so different how could they have anything in
              common?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">As Mark Tier demonstrates in
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.inversebooks.com/buy_it.htm"><em>The Winning Investment
              Habits of Warren Buffett &amp; George Soros</em></a>, the secrets
              that made Buffett and Soros the world’s richest investors are the
              mental habits and strategies that they all practice
              <em>religiously</em>. Mental habits and strategies that fly in the
              face of the conventional Wall Street “wisdom.” For
              example:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><img src="http://marktier.com/images/arow.gif" alt="" width="8" height="14"> Buffett and Soros don’t diversify. When they buy they always
              “buy as much as they can.”</span></p>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><img src="http://marktier.com/images/arow.gif" alt="" width="8" height="14"> They’ll both tell you that making predictions about the
              market or economy has virtually nothing to do with their
              success.</span></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><img src="http://marktier.com/images/arow.gif" alt="" width="8" height="14"> They’re not focused on the profits they expect to make.
              Indeed, their primary motivation is not the money at
              all.</span></p>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><img src="http://marktier.com/images/arow.gif" alt="" width="8" height="14"> They don’t believe that to make big profits you must take
              big risks. Indeed, they are far more focused on not losing money
              than on making it.</span></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><img src="http://marktier.com/images/arow.gif" alt="" width="8" height="14"> Their beliefs about what makes markets tick are amazingly
              similar — and diametrically opposed to academic theories like the
              “Efficient Market Hypothesis” and the “Random Walk” which they both
              view with contempt.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><img src="http://marktier.com/images/arow.gif" alt="" width="8" height="14"> And all those research reports that Wall Street churns out —
              they never read them. They don’t give a hoot what other people
              think. (In fact, Warren Buffett says he only ever reads them when
              he’s looking for a laugh.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ff0000; font-size: xx-small;"> <strong>...and Transform Your <em>Own</em><br> Investment Profits</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Investment success lies in
              your mental habits and strategies, as Mark Tier demonstrates in
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.inversebooks.com/buy_it.htm"><em>The Winning Investment
              Habits of Warren Buffett &amp; George Soros</em></a>. In
              identifying the winning investment habits that led Warren Buffett
              and George Soros to phenomenal success, he has uncovered for the
              first time the mental habits and strategies that ALL successful
              investors share.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">What’s more, every one of
              these winning habits is something you can easily learn
              yourself.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Whether you look for stock
              market bargains like Warren Buffett, trade currency futures like
              George Soros, scour the markets for undervalued takeover targets
              like Carl Icahn, invest in real estate, antiques or collectibles,
              use technical analysis, buy on dips or buy on breakouts, use a
              computerized trading system — or just want to salt money away
              safely for a rainy day. Harness the investment genius of the
              world’s richest investors by adopting the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.inversebooks.com/buy_it.htm"><em>The Winning Investment
              Habits of Warren Buffett &amp; George Soros</em></a> and you, too,

              possible.</span></p>

              discover how the mental habits and strategies that guided your last

              Investors. And then learn exactly what you need to do to harness
              their investment genius — and transform your own investment

              <p> </p>
              <p>Stock picking can be a complicated process but does not have to be. Many investors have different approaches. However, it is wise to follow general steps to minimize the risk of the investments. This article will outline these basic steps for picking high performance stocks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Step 1</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Decide on the time frame and the general strategy of the investment. This step is very important because it will dictate the type of stocks you buy.</p>
              <p>Suppose you decide to be a long term investor, you would want to find stocks that have sustainable competitive advantages along with stable growth. The key for finding these stocks is by looking at the historical performance of each stock over the past decades and do a simple business S.W.O.T. (Strength-weakness-opportunity-threat) analysis on the company.</p>
              <p>If you decide to be a short term investor, you would like to adhere to one of the following strategies:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a. Momentum Trading</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With this startegy look for stocks that increase in both price and volume over the recent past. Most technical analyses support this trading strategy.</p>
              <p>Consider stocks that have demonstrated stable and smooth rises in their prices. The idea is that when the stocks are not volatile, you can simply ride the up-trend until the trend breaks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b. Contrarian Strategy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This strategy is to look for over-reactions in the stock market. Researches show that stock market is not always efficient, which means prices do not always accurately represent the values of the stocks. When a company announces a bad news, people panic and price often drops below the stock's fair value.</p>
              <p>To decide whether a stock over-reacted to a news, and look at the possibility of recovery from the impact of the bad news. For example, if the stock drops 20% after the company loses a legal case that has no permanent damage to the business's brand and product, you can be confident that the market over-reacted.</p>
              <p>With this strategy try to find a list of stocks that have recent drops in prices, analyze the potential for a reversal (through candlestick analysis). If the stocks demonstrate candlestick reversal patterns, I will go through the recent news to analyze the causes of the recent price drops to determine the existence of over-sold opportunities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Step 2</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conduct researches that give you a selection of stocks that is consistent to your investment time frame and strategy.</p>
              <p>There are numerous stock screeners on the web that can help you find stocks according to your needs.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Step 3</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once you have a list of stocks to buy, you would need to diversify them in a way that gives the greatest reward/risk ratio. One way to do this is conduct a Markowitz analysis for your portfolio. The analysis will give you the proportions of money you should allocate to each stock. This step is crucial because diversification is one of the free-lunches in the investment world.</p>
              <p>These three steps should get you started in your quest to consistently make money in the stock market. They will deepen your knowledge about the financial markets, and would provide a sense of confidence that helps you to make better trading decisions.</p>

                  Picking</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stock picking can be a complicated process but does not have to
                  be. Many investors have different approaches. However, it is wise
                  to follow general steps to minimize the risk of the investments.
                  This article will outline these basic steps for picking high
                  performance stocks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Step 1</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Decide on the time frame and the general strategy of the
                  investment. This step is very important because it will dictate the
                  type of stocks you buy.</p>
              <p>Suppose you decide to be a long term investor, you would want to
                  find stocks that have sustainable competitive advantages along with
                  stable growth. The key for finding these stocks is by looking at
                  the historical performance of each stock over the past decades and
                  do a simple business S.W.O.T.
                  (Strength-weakness-opportunity-threat) analysis on the company.</p>
              <p>If you decide to be a short term investor, you would like to
                  adhere to one of the following strategies:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a. Momentum Trading</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With this startegy look for stocks that increase in both price
                  and volume over the recent past. Most technical analyses support
                  this trading strategy.</p>
              <p>Consider stocks that have demonstrated stable and smooth rises
                  in their prices. The idea is that when the stocks are not volatile,
                  you can simply ride the up-trend until the trend breaks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b. Contrarian Strategy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This strategy is to look for over-reactions in the stock market.
                  Researches show that stock market is not always efficient, which
                  means prices do not always accurately represent the values of the
                  stocks. When a company announces a bad news, people panic and price
                  often drops below the stock's fair value.</p>
              <p>To decide whether a stock over-reacted to a news, and look at
                  the possibility of recovery from the impact of the bad news. For
                  example, if the stock drops 20% after the company loses a legal
                  case that has no permanent damage to the business's brand and
                  product, you can be confident that the market over-reacted.</p>
              <p>With this strategy try to find a list of stocks that have recent
                  drops in prices, analyze the potential for a reversal (through
                  candlestick analysis). If the stocks demonstrate candlestick
                  reversal patterns, I will go through the recent news to analyze the
                  causes of the recent price drops to determine the existence of
                  over-sold opportunities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Step 2</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conduct researches that give you a selection of stocks that is
                  consistent to your investment time frame and strategy.</p>
              <p>There are numerous stock screeners on the web that can help you
                  find stocks according to your needs.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Step 3</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once you have a list of stocks to buy, you would need to
                  diversify them in a way that gives the greatest reward/risk ratio.
                  One way to do this is conduct a Markowitz analysis for your
                  portfolio. The analysis will give you the proportions of money you
                  should allocate to each stock. This step is crucial because
                  diversification is one of the free-lunches in the investment
                  world.</p>
              <p>These three steps should get you started in your quest to
                  consistently make money in the stock market. They will deepen your
                  knowledge about the financial markets, and would provide a sense of
                  confidence that helps you to make better trading decisions.</p>
