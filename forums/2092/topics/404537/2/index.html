              <p>Nope you are wrong.</p>
              <p>I am not soliciting for investors and asking people to pump money into any fund of any sort. please do not misunderstand.</p>
              <p>I am well aware of the law and i have no intention of getting investors here or anywhere else.</p>
              <p>what i invest is my own money. i not trying to catch fish for ppl</p>
              <p>but i am suggesting people learn to catch their own fish through proper channels instead of relying on robots for trading.</p>
              <p>discover something useful that can really help you to make money on forex.</p>
              <p>don't listen to people who tell you they have 7 secrets to forex trading or how to make $1000 in $1 million or "why i quit my 10k/month job to trade forex"</p>
              <p>like i said there is more to trading than just indicators and systems. it if were that simple everyone would be rich. and this is where a lot of people new to the market gets burned.</p>
              <p>A lot of people come in thinking that they going to beat the market by understanding all these technical indicators and fundamental analysis. They have a fantasy that they would be on top of the market making millions and a lucky winning streak would lead them to a down fall.</p>
              <p>The fact is that you cannot beat the market. the market is SETUP FOR YOU TO LOSE MONEY. this is a simple fact you must truly understand. it is not a zero sum game. it is a minus sum game.</p>
              <p>last but not least. understand everybody's interest in the market.</p>
              <p>ur broker makes money when you trade so its in their interest that you trade as often as possible. the question you should really ask is that if this is truly beneficial to you?</p>
              <p>there are lots of tricks up the brokers sleeves better to know some of them =)</p>
              <p>of course you can also consider my interest. I am definitely not neutral no doubt about it and i advocate for trend trading instead of day trading. because we believe that a lot of people have been for the longest time teaching people what we consider to be wrong. they focus on series of complicated indicators to confuse their students and introduce robots or even scalping for 10 pips on minute charts.</p>
              <p>we definitely do not believe in these methods, what we can share we tell you and is skewed to our perspective. it is up to you to analyze and decide if trend trading is the right method</p>

              <p>Let me ask you a question.</p>
              <p>Lets say you are a good property agent. Would you sell houses for free or maybe even give a bigger discount because you are good? Or if lets say you have just discovered a method to make petrol out of water. Would you give that technology you have been working on for years for free?</p>
              <p>No offense but your argument makes no sense. What you basically try to say is that people should provide you free service at their expense. My mentor doesn't reside locally and actually needs to sit on a plane and pay for hotel fees while in Singapore. </p>
              <p>My mentor is retired he made his money through traditional businesses after retiring from the brokerage. He has enough capital outlay for his own investment purposes, he is just helping out young folks like myself and presenting us with an opportunity to build our capital requirement and build his own legacy in the process.</p>
              <p>As he has already told us before, investment is a capital game. You cannot make $100 into $1 million in one year.</p>
              <p>like i have said before, you can follow his free signals and see his results. just PM for his blog address.</p>
              <p>You can find me for a chat there is no obligation but i only ask that you be sincere in wanting to learn. This is also my mentor's requirement, if you're sincere in wanting to learn trend trading from someone then look for us. If you're unteachable we don't want to try either, because you will just lose money if you cannot change your mindset.</p>
              <p>Also please remember that forex is NOT for you to make INSTANT riches. A lot of people come into to investment thinking they can turn small amounts of capital into big bucks.</p>
              <p>If you are under capitalized i suggest you build up your capital before you even consider trading forex. Because this is the number 1 way to lose money.</p>
              <p>Have an open mind. Its great to be skeptical, but if you choose to deny every opportunity that presents itself even BEFORE understanding it in depth. Then you are just consistently denying yourself opportunities. Sure there are lots of "get rich" quick courses that never work, but how do you know for sure something cannot work even before understanding it a little more?</p>
              <p>Don't be too quick to pass a value judgement, but don't be too eager to jump into it either. Everyone should make clam and informed decisions i didn't join this trend trading course the instant i saw it either. I followed my mentor's blog for long time before jumping in which was at that time not held in Singapore either.</p>

              <p>i already stated my position to be non-neutral from very early on.</p>
              <p>it is fair enough to question my motive and i also already said that you should.</p>
              <p>what is not fair is suggesting that i run a foul of the law when i haven't done so. Unfortunately i won't be getting free coffee anytime soon.</p>
              <p>I never tried to break the opinions of anyone I provided my perspectives and responded to others. </p>
              <p>i don't spam anyone's mailbox. i told ppl if they are interested then look for me. if not its ok we can discuss about trading here</p>
              <p>Good to have your own opinion</p>
              <p>i just hope the conversation could be civil</p>
              <p>anyway i stepped in because i saw someone talking about robot trading. so instead of just attacking me, you might want to look at that or do you believe in forex robots?</p>

              <p>Hi Vitto84, for the sake of proper discussion of forex trading and so there is not pointing fingers and "arrowing" around here. It is an open "secret" that if normal trader like us who loss any forex trade, it is not because the logic or any "trend" education is wrong, but rather it is due to the fact that our own broker are the one who are playing against us ! (Ironally they are the "licenced" people who do this to us) and currently I don't think our government is doing anything about it.</p>
              <p>It just like for example when we see dark cloud are coming, we know it is going to rain and we will feel cold, but in forex world, the monents the dark clouds came, we start to feel heat and sweat like we are in desert ! Or in forex example, people always say it is logic that the trend will go up when "good" finanical news was announced, yet the market will dropped like hell before you can imagine and as mention, it is not surpise as why this happen once we know the "secret".</p>
              <p>Unless your school of thought have any protection against this kind of menace, I don't think any "methods" is "Money Back Guarantee". In fact it also don't surpised me if you cannot find any brokers in Singapore who offered Metatrader 4 platform !</p>

              <p>I would love to get into discussion about forex trading with anyone =)</p>
              <p>Of course we are aware of the fact that brokers are playing against us. We consider the daily high and lows as illusions in the market.</p>
              <p>We have a way to avoid this, some consider it risky but this is to us the cost of acquiring a trend.</p>
              <p>Its very good point you brought up and i agree. the greatest enemy in trading is yourself and a lot of times it is NOT the system that is faulty. Be it trend trading, or MACD or even moving average, if you have the discipline any method works.</p>
              <p>On the subject of news, we don't trade news. Because you must understand it is NOT the news that makes the market, but the market that MAKES the news. How we determine the trend has nothing to do with "news" because you must understand that whatever "news" you see on bloomberg, is considered "old news" by financial standards</p>
              <p>You can see many instances where the market moves in "opposite" direction of the news.</p>
              <p>It is not really the trader's method at fault that they lose money, it is their PERSPECTIVE that causes them to lose money. Why? Because many traders jump into the market thinking that they can BEAT the market.</p>
              <p>You must really understand that the market is setup for you to LOSE money. </p>
              <p>But then again i am not for methods such as robot trading, scalping, etc. these methods that require HIGH levels of activity. Forex is NOT a zero sum game, it is a MINUS sum game, the minute you trade you losing money. Thus the more you trade the harder you work and the more money you lose.</p>
              <p>That is my opinion. </p>
              <p>Btw a money back guarantee can serve more purpose than you think. That is if the course is on the right focus and not just trying to lure you in.</p>
              <p>You maybe a good trader i won't know. But have you held more than 1000 pips before on any pair?</p>

              <p>Yo Vitto84, not many people can trade that many lots and that many instruments lah....dun give them false hope mah....only 1% of the FX traders make $. If u are that 1%, congrats! FX trading is for the people who are already rich....eg. more than S$100k trading account. Those who dun have that amount better dun touch FX.</p>
              <p>Trading Mini/Micro are waste of time and energy....</p>

              <p>Sorry to over hype my trading. Sincere apologies, I didn't really realise how bad it sounded anyway i will remove it. Admittedly I let emotions get the best of me as I was a little ticked off. </p>
              <p>I think i failed to mentioned it here. But my stand is that 95% of forex traders are losers.</p>
              <p>I think I did however mentioned on the top that forex is not the path to instant riches and that capital outlay is an important factor.</p>
              <p>You don't need $100k but you can't be under capitalized either. For beginner, actually 1-5k is quite conservative; its not a waste of time if you don't day trade. I trend trade meaning I hold for long term gains; I trade 10 minutes a day. The important thing is that it SUITS your lifestyle and you CAN do it.</p>
              <p>In fact! You SHOULDN'T trade 100k if you're a beginner; it should be scaled to your tolerance level. Its takes time and training to master forex trading. Doesn't mean if you have 100k you will win money in the market either.</p>
              <p>The reason why most people lose is because their money management sucks; they try to rob the market and end up burning themselves. They may win 10 trades; get greedy and lose everything in a single trade.</p>
              <p>Its not "impossible" to make money from forex. Its just that you MUST have the RIGHT perspective of the market. </p>
              <p>After all forex is very similar to casinos; the house always wins. It appeals to our human nature; but doesn't mean we cannot skew the odds to our favor.</p>

              <p>like i said.</p>
              <p>i am a trend trader.</p>
              <p>i only open to see my positions 10 mins a day. i just check to see if my positions need to be closed or reversed.</p>
              <p>i hold my positions for as long as the trend brings me.</p>

              <p>you can look at my mentor's blog he has been recording 5 major pairs for almost 2 years now. he records every profit and loss that occurs</p>
              <p>its great to be skeptical but still try to have an open mind. its not impossible to make money in the forex market.</p>
              <p>but its take more than just a system to achieve consistent results. its not about gambling. we don't day trade and we don't gamble. we have a specific system and set of rules we follow. we don't gamble on probabilities by using technical analysis.</p>
              <p>do we lose money? yes of course we do. we don't have 100% winning ratio in fact on some pairs its less than 50% but the amount we make when its profitable is more than enough to cover our losses with profit.</p>
              <p>most 'gurus' show you tons of past results. how many can actually take up a challenge and show u results from present till 3 months or even 2 years ago.</p>
              <p>if you're interested and open to such an idea then pm me. there are a lot of different ways to trade the market but if you are looking to know the 7 secrets of forex trading or the holy grail, i am sorry but we cannot offer you this.</p>
              <p>but we do know what a trader needs to be profitable and its beyond just technical tools and indicators.</p>
              <p>if you don't believe it. follow my mentor's blog. follow it for 2 years, 5 years or even 10 years. see the results for yourself until you are satisfied.</p>
              <p>there is no rush to come to a conclusion. the market will always be there and the opportunity to make money will always be there.</p>

              <p>and whenever you look to find some kind of trading strategy you must ask whether it SUITS your lifestyle. Someone may provide you the BEST trading system in the world but if you cannot understand, cannot use it because it doesn't suit your lifestyle. Then you will still lose money at the end of the day.</p>

              <p>trading is a capital sum game.</p>
              <p>you can only make as much as you can afford. and never trade if you cannot afford it.</p>
              <p>but we are always taught to talk in pips.</p>
              <p>because my mentor always says that pips is something that everyone can achieve.</p>
              <p>if you talk in dollars, you will stir emotions of other traders because dollar is not always achievable, someone with a million dollars can make $100k easier than someone with $100k</p>
