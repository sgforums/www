               used to be the norm between the 1930s and 1960s. Wives were outliving 
              their husbands. So, how did the wives survive after their husbands were 
              gone? You guessed it. These widows invested in stocks that paid 
              dividends. Back then, it was such a common investment strategy that 
              people started calling it the "Widow's Portfolio".  Not only the widows 
              did it, insurance companies, investment banks and funds started doing it
               too.</span><br> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br> </span><br> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">However,
               the huge multi-year bull run in the 1990s changed all that. Dividends 
              investing fell out of fashion. It was considered boring, dull and less 
              profitable. A new generation of greedy investors and traders wanted to 
              earn a quick buck in the short term. Everyone thought the era of 
              income-investing was over. Everyone was going for capital gains.</span></div>

              <p>Dividend paying stocks do not just include REITs. They include business trusts, and some other equities as well, for example, SPH, Singtel, Starhub, SingPost, and bank stocks. There are also smaller cap companies that gives rather good dividends, and this include GRP, Silverlake, Aztech, Innotek, Neratel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In judging which to buy, of course we have to take into account the current economy, your personal financial status, on top of the financial and business health of the stocks you have.</p>
              <p>For example, I bought Starhub at $1.90 when it lost the BPL. Why did I buy it when everyone on my breakfast table was saying sell?<br>Reasons<br>1) Near 10% dividend (it was 4.5cts per quarter that time)<br>2) Defensive telecom business with extremely high barrier to entry, coupled with already paid-up infrastructure cost<br>3) With advent of smartphone and higher speed broadbands, we can expect higher revenues<br>4) Free Cash Flow exceeds dividends paid out</p>
              <p>While it's debts are rather high, it is to me acceptable for a relatively new company (compared to Singtel) in such a defensive sector.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another example, I bought SPH at $4, $3.80 and $3.14, so an average of $3.65.<br>Reasons:<br>1) Defensive newspaper businesses  (monopoly in Sg). I believe the impact of the internet has already been factored in, and any changes due to the internet from now on will only be slow.<br>2) Nearly 7% dividend yield.<br>3) Ventures into property sector was successful. With upcoming Clementi Mall, we can expect higher revenues<br>4) Dr Tony Tan as CEO<br>5) Super Ah Gong linked. Won't let this propaganda tool die off</p>
              <p>On hindsight, I made a bad decision to wait at $3.50 instead of jumping it at $3.51 when it announced the takeover of clementi mall at a price much higher than the next competitor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Something like that lor... Down then down, I buy more... The dividends were rather consistent throughout the recession.</p>
