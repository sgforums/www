              <p>Stock market investing is not simply buying a stock at its current price, and then selling it when the price goes up and cashing in. There are many things to consider, but the first basic thing you need to know is how much money you can invest and how much a stock costs.</p>
              <p>But that's the trouble - everyone is stuck on dollar price, when in reality, all any investor should care about it net price - that is, how much a stock is REALLY worth, once you've deducted all the costs of that stock.</p>
              <p>And that is what intrinsic value is all about. So why should you calculate intrinsic value before you start investing your money? Here are the top reasons why:</p>
              <p>Get rid of "bloated" stocks when you calculate intrinsic value</p>
              <p>Many factors affect a stock's value, and, honestly speaking, most of them really shouldn't. News and current events, gossip and speculation - these contribute to the daily ups and downs of any stock, when really, they have nothing to do with the inner workings of a company.</p>
              <p>When you get down to the numbers, you're stripping a stock down to what's really important. You find out the answer to the question "Will this stock make me money?"</p>
              <p>See the real value of the business</p>
              <p>Stock price is important, but what anyone investing in the stock market should see is how a business (not the stock) can bring value to your investments.</p>
              <p>Are you investing in a company that shows progress, makes the right decisions and, in the past, has proven to make money for their shareholders? For example, if a firm is making enough profit to give its shareholders a yearly dividend, then it's a good sign.</p>
              <p>@eagle, could you "enlighten" us the intrinsic value of Singtel as that we can understand the winning formula to go for it.</p>

              <p>Once you know and can feel the pulse and momentum of the market, there's honestly little need to do so much analysis.</p>
              <p>Too much analysis can cause paralysis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before you do so much analysis, ask yourself if your returns minus market returns is worth your time spent doing the analysis. I honestly did not use any calculations or much analysis, apart from knowing what these companies do as I'm a Singaporean, before I bought into Singtel, SPH, Starhub, ST Engg, and Capitaland. I used to do extensive TA and FA in my bid to try to "discover" what is the right method, but after 2 years, I don't see why it is absolutely necessary.</p>
              <p>Both TA and FA gives micro pictures, but knowing things and reading news give the macro picture, something which I found is more important.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't need to be earning obscene amounts at all; I'm content with a decent ROI for the amount of time I "spent".</p>
