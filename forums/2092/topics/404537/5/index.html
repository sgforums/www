              <p>I have actually post this some where in Money forum but if you want to talk about stock or share, I heard there is an new school who provided are "free" course on how to get profit continuously. The trainer name John Lu, owner of CapitalMaster, Link : <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.capitalmaster.com.sg/">www.capitalmaster.com.sg</a> , email : <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:sales@capitalmaster.com.sg">sales@capitalmaster.com.sg</a> Telephone : 68370116. Not only is he claim that he is experience in profit application in stock market, he is also selling an stock trend evolution software call Homily Software for preventing loss with free gift moblie phone, laptop etc @$2680 in certain period if you buy the software. (I think most "expert trader" who conducted lesson charge around that range).Anyway no harm attending his "free" course for knowledge intead of pay $ if he still continue it.(At least just let your know some some update to "new trading school")</p>
              <p>Finally I think he had given a story which is worth post here or read for entertainment :</p>
              <p>                                           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Story of Two Donkeys</span></p>
              <p>A farmer has two donkeys.One is healthy and strong, and the other is weak and lame. One day the farmer needs money for development and decided to sell a donkey.Because since the lame donkey is valueless and nobody will pay an penny for an donkey which produced nothing for their harvest, so the farmer decides to sell the strong donkey.However, when farm works come, the lame donkey fats up its body rather than works well.The farmer has to buy good feed using the money earned from the good donkey.As things go on like this, the farmer becomes worse and worse.</p>
              <p>Conclusion : Investors usually sell good stocks in their hands and buy bad ones from others. As a result, their money becomes less and less.</p>
              <p>Also there is another company who is specializing in trading systems alogorithm called SharesXPert.com : <a href="http://www.sharesxpert.com">http://www.sharesxpert.com</a></p>

              <p class="vspace">Once upon a time in a village, a man appeared and announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $10 each.</p>
              <p class="vspace">The villagers, seeing that there were many monkeys 
                  around, went out to the forest and started catching them. The man bought
                   thousands at $10 and as supply started to diminish, the villagers 
                  stopped their effort.</p>
              <p class="vspace">He further announced that he would now buy at $20. 
                  This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching 
                  monkeys again.Soon the supply diminished even further and people started
                   going back to their farms.</p>
              <p class="vspace">The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of 
                  monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let
                   alone catch it!</p>
              <p class="vspace">The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at 
                  $50! However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his 
                  assistant would now buy on behalf of him.</p>
              <p class="vspace">In the absence of the man, the assistant told the 
                  villagers; "Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has 
                  collected. I will sell them to you at $35 and when the man returns from 
                  the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each.</p>
              <p class="vspace">"The villagers rounded up with all their savings and 
                  bought all the monkeys. Then they never saw the man nor his assistant, 
                  only monkeys everywhere! Now you have a better understanding of how the 
                  stock market works.</p>
              <p class="vspace"> </p>
              <p class="vspace"> </p>
              <p class="vspace">Conclusion: Traders usually fall into the trap of big mafia buyers and buy from them at a higher price.  As a result, their money becomes less
                                          and less.</p>

              <p>Thank Eagle for your story. Anyway I head another classic story of "big boy" controlling the stock market and I will share with your in an story form :</p>
              <p>                                                 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The Story of the duck</span></p>
              <p>Imagine that there were 100 people participating in a guessing game of only 3 probabilities.The players involved in this game are the richest and smartest who amongst them played the banker and the rest of the 99 were just ordinary players.<br><br>The 99 players had to board a huge machine that the banker had control over.The players had to guess which direction the banker would move the machine - either UP, DOWN or STILL. To make the guessing easier for the players, the banker gave them one hint, and the rest was up to them to make their decision.Each of these players had only to pay $50 to join the game for a grand prize of $1000 each if they guessed correctly. After analysing and weighing the odds, they were all convinced it was a pretty good deal. The hint went like this : "There is a duck in the middle of a pond floating peacefully. An alligator is coming silently from behind it.How do you think the duck would react ?" said the banker.<br><br>The players were laughing inside their hearts, thinking : "What a straightforward hint !" Everyone was busy writing down their answers on pieces of paper provided to them earlier. "OK! Time up.Please raise your answers so that I can see clearly," instructed the banker. They all displayed their answers joyfully - 80 of them chose UP, 15 of them chose STLL and only 4 chose DOWN.<br><br>The banker looked at their answers and gathered that in order to win, he had to move the machine down, so that 95 of them would lose, and only 4 would win. And so he moved the machine DOWN. The 80 players who chose UP became furious because they found the answer ridiculous.They stood to voicing their objections : "Even the stupidest duck like Daffy Duck <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> would fly for its life !" The other 15 joined the opposition: "Weren't you trying to fool us with a plastic duck? Why would a duck dive into the water knowing very well it would never out swim an alligator ?"<br><br>The banker answered with a smilie : "I am quite agree with all of your theories and analyses, but unfortunately, the duck was at the moment unaware of the approaching alligator, and so happened to dive into the water to catch its meal: A fish."<br><br>Conclusion :<br><br>The market 's predators have learned, understood and now know very clearly the habits and weakness of their "ever-naive" prey. They are just like a fisherman who knew exactly where he can find his fish, the various baits he should use for different type of fish and the best time to fish by observing the tides to ensure a fruitful trip full of catch.No matter how many times he goes back to the same place with the same bait, the same load full of fish fall into his net.(Unless the fish is smart enough to ç ´å¤©ç½‘ <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png">)</p>

              <p>I have actually post this some where in Money forum but if you want to talk about stock or share, I heard there is an new school who provided are "free" course on how to get profit continuously. The trainer name John Lu, owner of CapitalMaster, Link : <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.capitalmaster.com.sg/">www.capitalmaster.com.sg</a> , email : <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:sales@capitalmaster.com.sg">sales@capitalmaster.com.sg</a> Telephone : 68370116. Not only is he claim that he is experience in profit application in stock market, he is also selling an stock trend evolution software call Homily Software for preventing loss with free gift moblie phone, laptop etc @$2680 in certain period if you buy the software. (I think most "expert trader" who conducted lesson charge around that range).Anyway no harm attending his "free" course for knowledge intead of pay $ if he still continue it.(At least just let your know some some update to "new trading school")</p>
              <p>Finally I think he had given a story which is worth post here or read for entertainment :</p>
              <p>                                           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Story of Two Donkeys</span></p>
              <p>A farmer has two donkeys.One is healthy and strong, and the other is weak and lame. One day the farmer needs money for development and decided to sell a donkey.Because since the lame donkey is valueless and nobody will pay an penny for an donkey which produced nothing for their harvest, so the farmer decides to sell the strong donkey.However, when farm works come, the lame donkey fats up its body rather than works well.The farmer has to buy good feed using the money earned from the good donkey.As things go on like this, the farmer becomes worse and worse.</p>
              <p>Conclusion : Investors usually sell good stocks in their hands and buy bad ones from others. As a result, their money becomes less and less.</p>

              <p>A broker named, Jean Paul, moved to Texas and bought a donkey from an old farmer named Ben for $100. The farmer agreed to deliver the donkey the next day.</p>
              <p>The next day, Ben drove up and said,</p>
              <li><em><span style="color: #00cc66;">Ben</span>: Sorry, but I have some bad news. The donkey died.</em></li>
              <li><em><span style="color: #ff9966;">Jean Paul</span>: Well, then, just give me the money back, </em></li>
              <li><em><span style="color: #00cc66;">Ben</span>: Can't do that. I went and spent it already. </em></li>
              <li><em><span style="color: #ff9966;">Jean Paul</span>: OK, then. Just unload the donkey, </em></li>
              <li><em><span style="color: #00cc66;">Ben</span>: What ya going to do with him? </em></li>
              <li><em><span style="color: #ff9966;">Jean Paul</span>: I'm going to raffle him off, </em></li>
              <li><em><span style="color: #00cc66;">Ben</span>: You can't raffle off a dead donkey! </em></li>
              <li><em><span style="color: #ff9966;">Jean Paul</span>: Sure can. Watch me. I just won't tell that he's dead, </em></li>
              <p>A month later Ben met up with the Cajun and asked,</p>
              <li><em><span style="color: #00cc66;">Ben</span>: What happened with that dead donkey?</em></li>
              <li><em><span style="color: #ff9966;">Jean Paul</span>: I raffled him off, I did. I sold 500-hunderd tickets at two dollars apiece and made a profit of $898, </em></li>
              <li><em><span style="color: #00cc66;">Ben</span>: Didn't anyone complain? </em></li>
              <li><em><span style="color: #ff9966;">Jean Paul</span>: Just the guy who won. So I gave him his two dollars back.</em></li>
