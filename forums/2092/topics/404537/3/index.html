              <p>Guess what Vitto means is the actual trade is done within 10 minutes.</p>
              <p>Forex requires lots of preparation and homework beforehand. What has been heard is the successes. What has not been shared is the failures. No matter how good someone is, there are bound to be some mistakes here and there. The key is to earn more than lose in total.</p>

              <p>your friend must be a rich guy in the 1st place to lose 150K..........in just 3 mths.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you're right that forex is the hardest to trade becoz basically currencies are ranging in a very huge range............it has too many retracements and range too much so you need a big account to make a lot as you need a huge stoploss............otherwise you can get the directions right 9 times out of 10 and still lose money becoz your stops are too close.........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>stocks and shares has greater momentum...............but you can't get in and out as easily and as quick as forex................also the commission or cost of trading is a lot more than forex plus there's no super leverage like forex................also since you need to buy/sell in lots of 1000 shares you can't limit your risk exactly.............</p>

              <p>what is there not to understand?</p>
              <p>there are basically 4 types of traders.</p>
              <p>1. day traders or intraday traders</p>
              <p>2. swing traders</p>
              <p>3. scalpers.</p>
              <p>4. trend traders.</p>
              <p>i am a trend trader i DON'T day trade, meaning i do not monitor the market during the day.</p>
              <p>I only setup my positions once every morning.</p>
              <p>Why is not possible to do it within 10 minutes?</p>
              <p>I use a system, my indicator is clear as day. I don't need to analyze markets.</p>
              <p>I also do not need to enter the market at the "precise" moment</p>
              <p>I don't try to catch a falling knife. I never capture 100% of a trend; but just 60-70% is more than enough for me.</p>
              <p>You know why you think its impossible?</p>
              <p>Because you look at trading as an "academic" venture. If after saying so much you still cannot understand what i am trying to get at; then i won't bother either.</p>
              <p>The path to success in trading is NOT knowledge. I can tell you EXACTLY where eur/usd is next week and you will still lose money because you don't understand how the game works.</p>
              <p>Anyway I didn't say I go in and out of trades for 10 mins</p>
              <p>Don't be crazy. How can market move that much. I said I TRADE 10 mins a day. Meaning I setup positions, i may close i may open. Some of those positions i hold for days, weeks or months as long as the market trend continues i won't close my positions</p>

              <p>If you keep making money and taking it out you will be a poor investor forever.</p>

              <p>its FXtrade not FXgame.</p>
              <p>And you think i waste my time trading 1 unit with a proven system? why everyone so concern about how much other people make? </p>
              <p>I already said how much i make is not necessarily how much you CAN make.</p>
              <p>It all depends on ur CAPITAL OUTLAY. </p>
              <p>I can sell you the fact that i make $5-10k a month and appeal to ur human greed making you believe that trading forex can replace ur income. But i don't tell you how much i have as a trading capital.</p>
              <p>You all are asking the wrong questions.</p>
              <p>Remember. Capital gains is not achievable by everyone. Pips on the other hand is.</p>
              <p>lol.</p>

              <p>Please don't try to aim being a trader so that you don't need to
              work.</p>
              <p>It doesn't work that way; unless you are VERY rich. But if this
              is the case you probably shouldn't be trading yourself =)</p>
              <p>For folks in debt (car loans, house loans) trading with
              a sensible savings and investment strategy can help to
              build ur wealth OVER time. And hopefully pay off your loans so that
              you finally own some real assets.</p>
              <p>And i wish everyone well in trying to achieve this =)</p>
