              <p>Why wasted your money on expensive course trading manually when nowadays there are forex software that can help you to trade automatically ? I heard that one of the few kind of software called Pips Conqueror seem to work out fine when I attended their talk before.</p>
              <p>This software is developed by the company name Investology Pte Ltd and it founders are Sam Se and David Gan.

              <p>i currently hold about 12 pairs and holding about 2300+
              pips </p>
              <p>i oni joined quite recently so i missed a big trend...namely the
              usd/chf... u can see on his blog my mentor is holding more than
              2700+ pips on just 5 pairs... </p>
              <p>the results is actually quite awesome so far...</p>
              <p>actually its not that u cannot make money from forex... i
              think you just need the correct mindset... anyway i just trade less
              than 10 mins a day using this method and there is no reason why i
              shouldn't work =D</p>

              <p>closed off gpb/jpy for -96 pips on 1 oct</p>
              <p>i know alot of ppl who have been burnt by bad courses</p>
              <p>me included but don't lose faith that a properly executed system can still make u a decent sum of money.</p>
              <p> we don't rely on blackbox system and neither do we use tons and tons of indicators to confuse one and another</p>
              <p>and the fact of the matter is that you will realise as i have that systems are just a small part of a trading strategy and there are more important aspects of trading required for success. </p>

              <p>like i said.</p>
              <p>i am a trend trader.</p>
              <p>i only open to see my positions 10 mins a day. i just check to see if my positions need to be closed or reversed.</p>
              <p>i hold my positions for as long as the trend brings me.</p>
              <p>i was up to 4300 pips yesterday morning</p>

              <p>you can look at my mentor's blog he has been recording 5 major pairs for almost 2 years now. he records every profit and loss that occurs</p>
              <p>its great to be skeptical but still try to have an open mind. its not impossible to make money in the forex market.</p>
              <p>but its take more than just a system to achieve consistent results. its not about gambling. we don't day trade and we don't gamble. we have a specific system and set of rules we follow. we don't gamble on probabilities by using technical analysis.</p>
              <p>do we lose money? yes of course we do. we don't have 100% winning ratio in fact on some pairs its less than 50% but the amount we make when its profitable is more than enough to cover our losses with profit.</p>
              <p>most 'gurus' show you tons of past results. how many can actually take up a challenge and show u results from present till 3 months or even 2 years ago.</p>
              <p>if you're interested and open to such an idea then pm me. there are a lot of different ways to trade the market but if you are looking to know the 7 secrets of forex trading or the holy grail, i am sorry but we cannot offer you this.</p>
              <p>but we do know what a trader needs to be profitable and its beyond just technical tools and indicators.</p>
              <p>if you don't believe it. follow my mentor's blog. follow it for 2 years, 5 years or even 10 years. see the results for yourself until you are satisfied.</p>
              <p>there is no rush to come to a conclusion. the market will always be there and the opportunity to make money will always be there.</p>

              <p><em>Fx trading is not solely base on Charting (intra-day, daily or weekly) intervals.</em></p>
              <p><em>Hence <span style="color: #ff0000;">Technical indicators</span> come into your assistance like the MA (moving averages), MACD, Stochastic Oscillators, RSI, etc. Other technical knowledges like Elliot Waves, fibonacci calculations are advantages to your trends positions.</em></p>
              <p><em>Plotting charts manually are also an add-on knowledge as you can have the feels of the market's sentiment.  Well, in the early 90s, there are hardly any charting providers.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></em></p>
              <p><em>Now, you have many charting providers to choose from, hence saving your precious time plotting charts.</em></p>
              <p><em>Knowing the technical aspects are only half a battle won.  As most currencies are against the US Greenback, hence the US economic indicators comes into picture.</em></p>
              <p><em>The<span style="color: #0000ff;"> Fundamental Indicators</span> - and alot of them (approx 150) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.  The major ones are Employment situations (1st Friday of the month), the CPI, PPI, retail sales etc. The FOMC meetings (deciding the interest rates and bias) are top in the list of market movers. </em></p>
              <p><em>Your strategy trading plans on entry points, cutting losses with lots of self-discipline.  Probably using dervatives futures to hedge positions.</em></p>
              <p><em>FX trading are not for everyone.  Definitely harder for investors will small capital outlay.  If you do not have the technical supports, i reckon you keep your $$ in your bank rather than losing it to the markets.</em></p>
              <p><em>The above statements are my personal views.  I had worked in the banking industry for abt 12yrs.  Doing online trading on &amp; off now. (al2gether coming to 20yrs of trading experience).  i used to be licenced by MAS &amp; SGX as well... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></em></p>
              <p><em>Good luck to those trading.. Not many traders come close to George Soros.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></em></p>
              <p><em>Furthermore FX is almost 24hrs... your sleeping hours will definitely be affected. </em></p>
              <p><em>Pleasant weekends to all.</em> </p>
