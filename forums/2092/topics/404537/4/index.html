              <p>i never said i wasn't</p>
              <p>i only told people to PM if they were interested</p>
              <p>even if you have no $ it doesn't matter</p>
              <p>you can still PM to talk about forex investment and i can provide u the link to the video.</p>
              <p>Its a good video because it highlights how the forex market and promise of riches appeal to our human weakness.</p>
              <p>And why the market is setup for us to LOSE money.</p>
              <p>The market is unpredictable. I maybe winning today but losing tomorrow. </p>
              <p>The important thing is that I know why i am losing and why i am winning.</p>
              <p>And remember. Knowledge is free. Never pay for knowledge. </p>

              <p>forex trading can be used as another source of income, not as the only income.</p>
              <p>that is what vitto is trying to tell the rest.</p>
              <p>There are too many smoke screen thrown on day trading as the complete sole income replacement and making you millionaire.</p>
              <p>It may be possible after many years of failure and bankrupt as trading itself is against human common sense and emotions.</p>
              <p>That is why most of the people failed as it was never meant to be a fast get-rich scheme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is actually no need for vitto84 to prove anything as it is his way of life and he is just sharing it with the rest as good will.</p>
              <p>If you think that he is selling a course, just ignore him.</p>
              <p>If you are curious, you can PM him for more information.</p>
              <p>But, you have to open your mind as regard to trading.</p>
              <p>No one in this world can predict the market trend and there are loses coupled with winning.</p>
              <p>Therefore, no need to prove him wrong as there are actual cases of people making money from trading.</p>

              <p>he's 60+ and retired.</p>
              <p>its good to be skeptic </p>
              <p>in fact most of all forex "gurus" are really not
              that spectacular</p>
              <p>i have seen people who do previews trading blindfolded</p>
              <p>and there are actually people who fall for it. its really
              amazing.</p>
              <p>but like i said. don't pay for knowledge because its free.</p>
              <p>when u pay make sure its for something else, something that
              gives u an edge</p>

              <p>your kind of story about mentor from big banks also very common lah.................virtually every course out there has a mentor from a big bank..........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>then why he wanna teach instead of making big bucks in banks.............??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and if you say he retired from big bank............then why teach people ???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they'll say they wanna help other traders...........but then why charge high fees for the courses then ???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway why so secretive about identity of your mentor ???  after all he wants more students so he can get more course fees mah ???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is he Dirk Du Toit from Sth Africa ???</p>

              <p>There is a local forex training, if  I canrecall correctly, it is called <a href="mailto:T2@B">T3B</a> or something like that.</p>
              <p>The trainer claimed to teach trench trading. Any comment on that? I am open to comment and opinion.</p>
              <p> If you not comfy posting online, can PM me your opinion. Your feedback is greatly appreciated. </p>
