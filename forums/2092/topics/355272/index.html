              <p>And if it was and honest mistake, you should learn to check before you confirm in future. One of the traits of a good broker is that he is consciously, consistently, making sure that he is not making a mistake.</p>

              <p>First of all if you want to become an trader or broker, the most basic qualfication you need is an CMFAS certification. You can take the examination at Institute of Banking and Finance , link : <a href="http://www.ibf.org.sg">www.ibf.org.sg</a> .The "small" problem is , this is a self-study course and the textbook you can buy it at IBF or maybe MAS. Most important you must pass all the 10 Modules and each modules got different prices and if you are an polytechnic student, maybe you got exemption some modules plus save $.</p>
              <p>To prove my point, you can visit this broker name "Ong First Tradition" and see this under their career section of their website : <a href="http://www.ongfirst.com/">http://www.ongfirst.com/</a> . Most broker firm would defintely required you to have CMFAS because this is MAS 's "law". If you want to only upgrade yourself with extra knowledge, you can explore the SGX website as their trading courses is usually within 100 dollars. Link : <a href="http://www.ses.com.sg/">http://www.ses.com.sg/</a></p>
              <p>If you have some money and you can affort to "invest" and want to learn trading free , there are some broker firm who offered free training for trading strategies and even coach you on how to use their trading tools. I listed down some of them in point form, but this is just only some suggestions and FYI only :</p>
              <p>1) City Index Asia : <a href="http://www.cityindexasia.com/">http://www.cityindexasia.com/</a> : One of the company who teach you how to trade for free, but of course you must open an account with them. Reasonable price like for instance in their forex account, low minimum deposit starting from US$250.</p>
              <p>2) CMC Market Singapore : <a href="http://www.cmcmarkets.com.sg">www.cmcmarkets.com.sg</a> : Another company who offered free education and lesson, except they do mainly on CFD and min need $1000 to open an account.</p>
              <p>3) optionsXpress : <a href="http://www.optionsxpress.com.sg">http://www.optionsxpress.com.sg</a> : One of the best in free education and there is no min amount to open the account.(Once you view their website, you can see video on how to use their tools) The only problem is if you are dealing with options, it might be in USA market and it is based on their trading time(This mean in Singapore you might need to trade at night).Also option has some setback like you need to check your options "time decay" and if there is bad news like interest rate change, "war" or "factor" that make a lot of people selling options like mad.(Remember this simple rule in trading : Buyer &gt; Seller = Bull , Seller &gt; Buyer = Bear), you might not have enough time to react to the market due to different time zone in trading and you might end up "burning" yourself, so don't say I don't warned you.</p>
