              <p><br><br> In 1923, when a strong earthquake destroyed most 
              of Tokyo, Japan suffered a crippling economic downturn that may have 
              hastened the onset of military rule. Yet financial markets around the 
              world barely shrugged.<br><br> Ninety years on, Japanese cash plays
               a crucial role in global bond and stock markets. Despite two decades of
               stagnant growth on home turf, Japan is the second-largest foreign owner
               of United States government securities, with nearly US$900 billion 
              (S$1.15 trillion) of America's public debt. This time it could be the 
              rest of the world that takes a financial hit, while the Japanese economy
               booms.<br><br> To understand how this could happen it is necessary
               to follow the Japanese money. Savings by individuals and money held by 
              Japanese insurers and financial institutions amount to trillions of 
              dollars in cash, much of which makes its way on to world securities 
              markets. When natural disasters happen in Japan, individuals and 
              companies need this cash to rebuild, and insurance companies need it for
               payouts.<br><br> Earthquake insurance is hard to get for most 
              households in Japan, so much of the cost- estimated at US$100 billion- 
              will have to come from a mountain of ordinary savings held in Japanese 
              financial institutions, much of it invested overseas. <br><br> For 
              anything that is insured, possibly amounting to between US$10 billion 
              and US$15 billion - the situation is complicated. Japanese insurers will
               also have to sell overseas assets but they will be spared the full cost
               because they have reinsured a lot of their risk with overseas insurance
               firms, who in turn have reinsured it with other insurers. <br><br> This insurance trail is a global labyrinth. Japan's risk, it turns out, is the world's risk.<br><br> Sure enough, as US markets opened last Friday, the sell-off of 
              Japanese-held treasuries began. Bond prices fell and yields rose, 
              although analysts say the selling was offset by buying from investors 
              fleeing debt problems in the euro zone and unrest in the Middle East. 
              The yen was also sold off immediately after the earthquake - before 
              investors realised that billions of dollars held by Japanese insurers 
              and investors would have to be repatriated. Within a few hours the 
              selling reversed itself  and the yen strengthened sharply. <br><br> Japan's central bank said it would inject Â¥15 trillion into the economy
               to stabilise markets  but that did not stop the Nikkei index slumping 
              16 per cent earlier this week - the biggest two-day fall since the 1987 
              global stock market crash.<br><br> All of this was predictable. In 
              1991 I wrote a book, Sixty Seconds That Will Change the World, about the
               consequences of a major earthquake in the Tokyo area, and discovered 
              that the rest of the world would come off far worse than Japan. <br><br> US treasuries would have to be sold to meet insurance claims and 
              pay for rebuilding, resulting in falling bond prices and rising interest
               rates. The yen would then rise as these overseas savings were 
              repatriated.<br><br> A model produced by the Tokai Bank in 1989 
              found that Japan, after experiencing severe short-term negative growth, 
              would bounce back as the cash flowed home and the rebuilding began. It 
              was the rest of the world, starved of this investment and hit with 
              rising interest rates, that went into recession.<br><br> Qualitatively, the financial markets are already reacting exactly as 
              predicted. But there are differences in quantitative terms.<br><br> The Tokai model was based on a major earthquake much closer to Japan's 
              industrial heartland and a rebuilding cost of about US$1 trillion at 
              1990 values. And Japan was then a much more significant global creditor 
              than it is today. Twenty years ago, it was the world's largest creditor 
              nation and the top buyer of US bonds. Now it has lost that position to 
              China.<br><br> Perhaps the biggest difference is the Tokyo 
              government's fiscal position, awash in debt that amounts to two years' 
              worth of GDP. It can ill-afford the generous injections it is making to 
              stabilise markets and the spending that will be needed to restore 
              infrastructure. If the model plays out as predicted, the sell-off in 
              bonds will continue, and the yen could rise further. The immediate 
              effect on the Japanese economy will likely be to turn an expected 0.3 
              per cent growth this quarter into negative growth, perhaps sending Japan
               back into recession. <br><br> But within a year the rebuilding 
              effort will deliver strong GDP growth. Production of everything from 
              cars to concrete will have to be ramped up to satisfy the expected 
              demand.  <br><br> Peter Hadfield is the author of Sixty Seconds That Will Change the World.<br><strong><br>Source:</strong><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Commentary/EDC110318-0000336/In-a-year,-Japan-may-be-booming-while-world-pays-for-quake">http://www.todayonline.com/Commentary/EDC110318-0000336/In-a-year,-Japan-may-be-booming-while-world-pays-for-quake</a></p>
