              <p>So young and you're thinking about investing? You will have a great future man! :)</p>
              <p>My advise is do not rush into investment. Take your time, research on financial instruments that appeals to you and suits your personality. </p>
              <p>Some forex traders likes the votality more than some stock traders. </p>
              <p>Others prefer low yield growth plan which I don't get why. </p>
              <p>So, it really depends on you. The web has tons of information on investing.</p>

I didn't earn much in term of ROE because I started out new not knowing anything, and only with a paltry $30k in bank at Nov 2008 as a fresh grad. Made a lot of mistakes.

              <p>Instead of disregarding paper assets, well not just allow them
              to remain in your portfolio? 5 to 20% a month isn't that bad. If
              it's consistent, you already beat the market. </p>

              <p>It will definitely remain a part of my portfolio, but it's percentage and importance would eventually not be as high as currently, which is very high. There are many things that could be done with other asset classes that paper assets can't.</p>

              <p>You're right. If you can trade it right, I don't see why you can't acheive high returns in PA. Just saying. We should all have different asset classes invested in. </p>

              <p>No, I don't really do lots of trades at all. I hold for quite long.</p>
              <p>Nowadays I buy based on fundamentals and market cycles. If you spend too much time, you get diminishing returns on your time. Then it isn't worth it.</p>
              <p>Learning how to read financial statements in fundamental investing is good if one is planning to move into business in the future.</p>
