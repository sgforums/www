              <div id="post_message_674563"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Banks should be careful when granting credit to these greedy old Seniors.</span><br> <br> I refer to <strong>'MAS rule unfair to seniors' </strong>[<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/Story/STIStory_716044.html">ST, 24Sept2011</a>] (annexed bottom).<br> <br> Firstly, it can be inferred that Mr Koh DOES NOT hold an existing credit
               card account with Maybank, which is what prevents Maybank from granting
               him unsecured credit on a credit card. Secondly, how can Mr Koh expect 
              Maybank to grant him unsecured credit when he himself is unwilling to 
              collateralize his <em>"substantial unencumbered fixed deposits (FD)"</em> to cover for whatever credit limit that he so demands.<br> <br> Nobody is stopping Mr Koh from using a credit card in so far as he is 
              willing to collateralize an amount equal to the credit limit of the 
              credit card account; or else a debit card [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit_card">wiki</a>] without any need for collateral at all.  <br> <br> Whilst Mr Koh introduces himself as a <em>"59-year-old retiree who held a senior position in a bank"</em> the inherent and unjustified risk that the bank takes in providing debtors with unsecured credit seems to elude him.<br> <br> If banks were expected to provide seniors with unsecured credit then 
              what is to prevent Seniors, the likes of Mr Koh to go 'bank shopping' 
              demanding cheap and easy credit from banks all over Singapore for 
              suspect reasons known only to himself.<br> <br> Doesn't Mr Koh sense the danger of his proposition? How is the bank to 
              retrieve its dues upon the illness or demise of Mr Koh whose life 
              expectancy remains another great unknown. Will his decedents/ estate 
              administrators volunteer to settle his dues or should the bank be 
              expected to seek in protracted legal recourse to recover such dues; or 
              worse write off such dues as bad debts only to seek a later bail out 
              through the use of government funds?<br> <br> As a senior bank officer, Mr Koh's ought to understand that this 
              irresponsible and arrogant demands by Seniors that he advocates poses to
               the bank an immense credit risk as none of his investments, with the 
              exception of collateralized FD accounts is guaranteed in the midst of a 
              volatile economy. Could Mr Koh become bankrupt by the casino?<br> <br> As a matured and respectable Senior, hasn't Mr Koh already earned enough in his lifetime, and  given his <em>"substantial unencumbered fixed deposits"</em> in the bank, why isn't Mr Koh willing to collateralize even a small 
              proportion of it to reassure the bank that his application for the 
              credit card and its associated credit limit is a bonafide one?<br> <br> Or is the monies in the fixed deposit account only temporary and could Mr Koh be running a scam?<br> <br> Banks who wish to operate secure and sustainable business, ought be 
              weary of the smooth words of these sly old retirees/ civil servants from
               <em>"senior positions"</em>, the likes of Mr Koh whose actions betray their willingness to<em> 'put their money where their mouth is' </em>[<a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/put+money+where+mouth+is">def.</a>]<br> <br> They could even be <em>'sub-prime'</em> debtors for all we know.<br> <br> At his age, Mr Koh should spend what he owns and not abuse the banking 
              system for more cheap and easy credit. A debit card or secured credit 
              card is the most suitable option for use by Mr Koh.<br> <br> Reference:<br> - e.g. <strong>'Maybankard Visa <span style="color: red;">Debit</span>'</strong> [<a href="http://www.maybank2u.com.my/mbb_info/m2u/public/personalDetail04.do?channelId=&amp;cntTypeId=0&amp;cntKey=CRD03.03&amp;programId=CRD03-DebitCards&amp;chCatId=/mbb/Personal/CRD-Cards">Maybank</a>]<br> - e.g. <strong>'HSBC <span style="color: red;">Secured </span>Visa Credit Card'</strong> : [<a href="http://www.hsbc.com.sg/1/2/personal/cards/hsbc-secured-visa-card">link</a>]<br> <br>

              application, which requires a minimum qualifying income of $30,000, and 
              copied my complaint to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).<br> While I had substantial unencumbered fixed deposits in that bank, <strong>they wanted me to collateralise my credit card limit</strong>, which I declined.<br> I am a 59-year-old retiree <strong>who held a senior position in a bank before I retired</strong>.
               I am debt-free, I have no bad credit record, and I own a few properties
               which are free of encumbrances. Despite the above, I cannot qualify for
               a credit card simply because MAS requires a minimum qualifying income.<br> My income tax returns show that I have been paying income tax regularly and without fail.<br> My regular 'income' is no longer derived from a salary, but from rental 
              income, dividends, interest income, capital gains from share 
              investments, director's fees and so on.<br> Yet all these do not qualify as eligible 'qualifying' income to the bank
               and MAS. Those who can voluntarily retire at age 62 or earlier are 
              mostly financially independent, prudent and conservative in managing 
              their personal finances over time.<br> Such retirees are excellent credit risk for banks, so why are banks and 
              MAS not customising their risk profiling of these older people 
              differently, instead of applying the traditional debt servicing 
              criteria?<br> They are losing a golden opportunity to expand business to this growing 
              group of well-heeled retirees who may not be super-rich, but are 
              considering investments, spending money travelling, buying expensive 
              goods, cars and so on. My problem is not unique.<br> Lending banks could get a personal net-worth statement from me, do a 
              historical credit profiling of my person, and check with a local credit 
              agency on my credit history, for instance, to support my wish for a 
              credit card or other credit facilities.<br> It is time for the banks and MAS to think outside the box if they 
              believe that ours is a progressive and international financial centre.<br> Raymond Koh Bock Swi<br> <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/Story/STIStory_716044.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/...ry_716044.html</a></td>
