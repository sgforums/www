              <p>-21 years old now, third-year NUS law student on full, bond-free scholarship (no NS either), technically also CEO of a tech startup.</p>
              <p>-Saved a lot since first year in university. Worked some as well. Monthly expenses are below $100 every month. Have free accommodation (scholarship recipient). Have scholarship allowance. Have parent allowance (no big handouts here, just enough to cover/supplement typical living expenses).</p>
              <p>-Invested most of my savings in one stock in fall of 2008. Second round of investment in early 2010, in the same stock (price was good then). Stock still doing well. Counter went rather crazy the other day (KLSE counter), causing my net worth to exceed S$100,000. Not sustainable, yes. But still an achievement in itself.</p>
              <p>-Basically more than tripled my base capital since 2008.</p>

              <p>-Started a scalable software product company in middle of 2010. Never really took off, but still working hard at it. Can be considered a failure, at this point. Launched a product, struggled for adoption. Launching another product soon. A huge, huge time commitment, since prototyping software and getting feedback is time-intensive. This is my "the Social Network" sort of gamble, only that I'm already aware of such a thing long before the movie was released.</p>
              <p>-Invested in AUD at the end of 2008. Despite a small profit, the opportunity cost was huge. Same with my unit trust investment (DWS mutual fund).</p>
              <p>-Bought a bunch of domain names hoping to resell them for a profit. Never happened. But I never made the effort to look for buyers either.</p>

              <p><br>actually thats not my initial plan when i first came here but</p>
              <p>1. the citizens became hostile towards FTs and even new citizens</p>
              <p>2. the govt initiate reforms that made being a PR a disadvantage</p>
              <p>3. rumours that CPF will collapse in the next 30-40 years - if lucky</p>
              <p>what do you expect me to do?<br>its not that i didnt try to intergrate<br>i intergrated so well that most people do not know i am an FT if i did not tell them<br>i speak singlish so well that my family commented my standard of english have deteriorated since coming to Singapore.</p>

              <p>Thank you for screwing our backsides beside the PAPist.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>I don't blame you, the PAPist wanted clever but yet political naive people to support their regime anyway, If I were you I would do the same thing, one man against the whole system is impossible, just get away and remember, even in your own country, citizenship comes with responsibilities, the locals here including me never cared to really push for changes to happen here, thus having a tragedy of the gov replacing its' own people for PAPist party survival, and worst still with many more locals oblivious to it.</p>
              <p>I think your "incest" series that you posted somewhere quite good.</p>
              <p>Live well and prosper and carry this tale of a tragic nation to anyone who cares for a bedtime story. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p><strong>My Financial Successes</strong></p>
              <p>-21 years old now, third-year NUS law student on full, bond-free
              scholarship (no NS either), technically also CEO of a tech
              startup.</p>
              <p>-Saved a lot since first year in university. Worked some as
              well. Monthly expenses are below $100 every month. Have free
              accommodation (scholarship recipient). Have scholarship allowance.
              Have parent allowance (no big handouts here, just enough to
              cover/supplement typical living expenses).</p>
              <p>-Invested most of my savings in one stock in fall of 2008.
              Second round of investment in early 2010, in the same stock (price
              was good then). Stock still doing well. Counter went rather crazy
              the other day (KLSE counter), causing my net worth to exceed
              S$100,000. Not sustainable, yes. But still an achievement in
              itself.</p>
              <p>-Basically more than tripled my base capital since 2008.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>My Financial Failures</strong></p>
              <p>-Started a scalable software product company in middle of 2010.
              Never really took off, but still working hard at it. Can be
              considered a failure, at this point. Launched a product, struggled
              for adoption. Launching another product soon. A huge, huge time
              commitment, since prototyping software and getting feedback is
              time-intensive. This is my "the Social Network" sort of gamble,
              only that I'm already aware of such a thing long before the movie
              was released.</p>
              <p>-Invested in AUD at the end of 2008. Despite a small profit, the
              opportunity cost was huge. Same with my unit trust investment (DWS
              mutual fund).</p>
              <p>-Bought a bunch of domain names hoping to resell them for a
              profit. Never happened. But I never made the effort to look for
              buyers either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, I'm bragging, because I'm fairly proud of my successes
              *and* failures.</p>
