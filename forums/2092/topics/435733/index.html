              <div style="float: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">This past week has been one of 
              the more volatile and turbulent trading periods for the stock market 
              since early 2009. Money has flown right out of the stock market as the 
              problems in the European Union and the United States  hit main street. 
              The problems are debt, debt, and more debt. There has been very little 
              done to correct these debt issues, except for creating more debt. The 
              stock market is now telling the world that simply increasing the debt is
               not going to fix the problems facing the United Sates and Europe. It 
              can be argued that every bailout, whether it was the TARP bailout in the
               U.S, or the recent EU bailouts in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal are 
              simply just more bailouts for banks. Eventually, the banks that hold all
               of this bad debt will simply have to take the hit and write down the 
              loss. That has not yet occurred, however, it is getting closer to 
              reality everyday. In this week's report we shall examine three different
               financial institutions that are likely to come under further selling 
              pressure due to holding bad debt.<br> <br> Banco Santander SA (NYSE:STD) is a leading European bank that is based 
              in Madrid, Spain. This leading bank has been declining since January 
              2010 when the stock traded as high as $17.55 a share. On August 5, 2011 
              the stock traded down to its June 2010 low before closing at $9.39 a 
              share. This stock is in a very weak technical position trading below all
               of the major daily chart moving averages. The only positive factors 
              that we can see for the stock at this time is that it is very extended 
              and oversold at the moment which typically leads to a move up. The stock
               also has some daily chart support around the $9.00 level. It is 
              important to note, in this type of economic climate weak stocks can 
              easily break daily chart support levels. News out of Europe is being 
              released very often and this should make this stock very volatile for 
              weeks to come. Traders can watch for some daily chart support around the
               $8.00 area. Should the stock rally from its current level, traders 
              should watch the $10.50 area as important resistance in the near term.<br> </span><br>

              <br> <span style="color: #000000;">Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) is leading
               bank based out of Frankfurt, Germany. Believe it or not, Germany has 
              been considered by most investors as the safe haven country in the 
              European Union. In any case, the Deutsche Bank stock topped out in 
              October 2009 at $84.93 a share. Since that time, the stock has been 
              making a series of lower highs on the weekly chart. On August 5, 2011 
              the stock closed at $48.20 a share after trading as low as $45.83 a 
              share. This leading European bank stock is also very extended and 
              oversold at the moment. Stocks with this type of pattern will usually 
              react and bounce to any positive news. Should that happen over the 
              weekend, traders can watch for resistance around the $55.00, and $57.50 
              levels. Should DB stock continue to decline the next important support 
              levels will around the $44.00, $40.50, and $37.75 areas. Watch these 
              levels closely, place them on your charts and trade them accordingly.

              <br> Credit Suisse Group (NYSE:CS) is one of the leading banks based out of 
              Zurich, Switzerland. First, it is important to note that Switzerland is 
              not part of the European Union, however, the bank does have global 
              exposure, especially to most of Europe. This is another leading bank 
              that topped out in October 2009 at $60.00 a share. On August 5, 2011 the
               stock closed at a new 52 week low at $31.58 a share. This stock is 
              really not very different from the other leading banks stocks on the 
              charts, it is oversold and extended to the downside on the daily chart 
              time frame. Should the European Union come out with some type of 
              band-aid fix for the European Union countries over the weekend this 
              stock could be a bounce candidate. Should the stock decline from here 
              traders should watch the $30.00, $27.00, $24.00, and $22.50 levels for 
              support. Should CS stock bounce higher from current levels traders can 
              watch for resistance around the $34.00, $36.00, and $39.00 levels. These
               markets are extremely volatile at the moment and wide swings in both 
              directions are very possible.    Note the key levels, play them with 
              tight stops and make money.<br> <br>
