              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By Jerome Corsi and Chelsea Schilling<br> © 2009 WorldNetDaily </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One of the world's largest banks is bidding
              farewell to the U.S. dollar – just as the dollar faces intense scrutiny at
              today's G-20 summit and the United Nations announces it wants a new global
              reserve currency replacement. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The dollar looks awfully like
              sterling after the First World War," David Bloom, HSBC currency chief,
              told London's
              Telegraph. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The whole picture of risk-reward for
              emerging market currencies has changed. It is not so much that they have risen
              to our standards, it is that we have fallen to theirs. It used to be that
              sovereign risk was mainly an emerging market issue but the events of the last
              year have shown that this is no longer the case. Look at the U.K. – debt is
              racing up to 100 percent of GDP," he said </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">China</span><span lang="EN-GB"> and rising Asia can no longer
              continue holding down their currencies to boost exports because it's hurting
              their own economies, creating asset bubbles, the Telegraph reported. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The policy headache was already
              becoming clear in the final phase of the global credit boom but the financial
              crisis temporarily masked the effect," the report states. "The
              pressures will return with a vengeance as these countries roar back to life,
              leaving the U.S.
              and other laggards of the old world far behind." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Bloom told the newspaper that regional
              currencies will emerge as the anchor for HSBC's smaller trading partners, with China, Brazil,
              or South Africa filling the
              role of the U.S. Australia has been linking its fortunes to China through
              commodity ties. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The news comes on the heels of a <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=109774">recent Red Alert report</a> that world organizations, including the United Nations, are openly calling for
              the creation of a one-world currency to replace the dollar – and the Obama
              administration's trillion-dollar deficits are serving as a trigger for the
              currency switch. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/tdr2009_en.pdf">A United Nations report</a> recommended that a new one-world currency should be created to replace the
              dollar as the standard for foreign-exchange holdings in international trade. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"If the plan succeeds, the United
              Nations would effectively end up replacing the United States as the issuer of the
              one-world international currency used as the standard of foreign exchange to
              settle international trade transactions," Red Alert reported. "The
              move would obviate the need for any nation state in the future to be the arbiter
              of world trade, marking yet another blow to national sovereignty on the path to
              one-world government." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The report, released by the United Nations
              Conference on Trade and Development, or UNCTAD, endorsed a proposal that
              Special Drawing Rights, or SDRs, issued by the International Monetary Fund, or
              IMF, "could be used to settle international payments." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The dollar is also expected to come under
              intense scrutiny at today's G-20 Pittsburgh summit. China is leading calls for
              reconsideration of the dollar as a reserve currency. The country was first to
              call for a new global currency as an alternative to the dollar as the U.S. deficit
              began multiplying. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://redalert.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=262">Red Alert has also reported</a> that Russia and China championed the idea to use the IMF's Special Drawing
              Rights as a new international currency as a proposal that was adopted by the
              2009 G-20 London summit held last April. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The G20 summit meeting took a step toward
              creating a new one-world currency through the International Monetary Fund that
              is designed to replace the dollar as the world's foreign exchange reserve
              currency of choice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://www.g20.org/Documents/final-communique.pdf">Point 19 of the final
              communiqué from the G20 summit</a> in London on April 2 stated, "We have
              agreed to support a general SDR which will inject $250 billion into the world
              economy and increase global liquidity," taking the first steps forward to
              implement China's proposal that Special Drawing Rights at the International Monetary
              Fund should be created as a foreign-exchange currency to replace the dollar. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The IMF created SDRs in 1969 to support the
              Bretton Woods fixed exchange-rate system. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The international supply of two key
              reserve assets – gold and the U.S. dollar – proved inadequate for supporting
              the expansion of world trade and financial development that was taking
              place," <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/sdr.htm">a
              document on the IMF website explains</a>. "Therefore, the international
              community decided to create a new international reserve asset under the
              auspices of the IMF." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When the Bretton Woods fixed-rate system
              collapsed, major world currencies, including the dollar, shifted to a floating
              exchange-rate system where the price of the dollar and other major world
              currencies was created by trading on international currency exchanges. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Until the current global economic crisis,
              SDRs issued by the IMF have been used by IMF member nation states primarily as
              a reserve account to support international trade transactions, not as an
              alternative international currency available to settle international debt
              transactions in danger of default. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some say the discussion of using SDRs at
              the IMF as an international reserve payment system is further evidence that the
              momentum to create a one-world currency is gaining not only among academic
              economists, but also among professional economists holding prominent government
              positions. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://redalert.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=260">Red Alert
              previously reported</a> that strong support for the idea of a one-world
              currency has recently come from Canadian economist Robert Mundell, who won a
              Nobel-prize in 1999, for his work formulating the intellectual basis for
              creating the euro. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mundell endorsed the idea of Kazakhstan
              President Nursultan Nazarbayev to create the "acmetal" as a world
              currency, according to the Australian News. </span></p>

              U.S. gold and silver coins, has been warning about the decline of the dollar

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"It is now happening before our
              eyes," Smith said. "The dollar is getting ready to get hammered, and
              there is no way for the Fed to stop it." </span></p>

              <p>I am pretty sure it would be the Swiss Franc. They peg it to their Swiss gold reserves.</p>

              <p>If American's do a bull run on gold with their US dollars, then the US dollar will be absolutely worthless long before even a fraction of it has been converted. That's because the US dollar is not backed by gold at all, but by the 'integrity' of the US Government. Hence it is a Fiat currency, like most government controlled currencies in the world today. The last 'gold standard' currency of the US ended in 1933. </p>
              <p>In 1972 the French government called the US government on their 'gold standard' and asked them to exchange the US dollars that the French had stockpiled up until that point with gold. The US refused. In fact, since the seventies the US dollar has been supported by another well known commodity. Oil, black gold. US interests were clever enough to initially broker deals with Saudi Arabia that required all oil to be sold in US dollars, effectively taxing the whole world for their use of oil. </p>
              <p>Iraq was not attacked because it invaded Kuwait, but because Iraq first attacked the US hegemony by supplying oil to anyone, in any currency. That action threatened the US far better than an enemy nuclear submarine anchored off the east coast of America. The US is still in Iraq today.</p>
              <p>Now Iran, Iraq's neighbour also sells oil to anyone in any currency, and the consequence is the destabilization of the Iranian regime. Coincidence? I think not.</p>
              <p>The US dollar has been physically worthless for a long time, and only desperate measures have kept it afloat. These initial moves by the UN to introduce a global currency is a disaster, and is yet another stop gap measure introduced by the US administration to save themselves.</p>
              <p>Governments should never control currencies. Currencies need to become independent and accountable to economic forces. Reject a global currency, and demand many <em>independent</em> currencies.</p>
              <p>The best way to achieve this is to demand that your government allow the use of independent tenders in your country. </p>
