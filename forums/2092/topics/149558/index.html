The portfolio will closely mirror the basket of bonds in the iBoxx<br>ABF Singapore Bond Index. The index currently has about  35 bond issues.<br><br>Mr Ronald Howe, in his opening address, spoke of the increasing demand for<br>Asian bonds from both Asian and developed market investors. The Singapore<br>bond market is also well positioned to benefit from such inflow of funds.<br><br>DBS Asset Management explained to the seminar attendees that investors<br>with a minimum investment of $1,000 will buy into a portfolio of high<br>credit quality Singapore Government bonds and quasi-Government bonds.<br>Typically investors would require a larger outlay of capital to get the<br>same diversification.<br><br>The Fund, once it is listed on the Singapore Exchange from Aug 31, 2005,<br>will also offer convenience and accessibility to investors. Investors can<br>buy and sell Fund units traded on the SGX through their regular<br>stockbrokers just as they would for any other listed stocks.<br><br>Investors will also benefit from the low cost of the Fund. Unlike normal<br>unit trusts, there is no sales charge. Management fee is set at 0.15 per<br>cent per annum of the net asset value. However normal brokerage fees are<br>applicable for trades done via the stock exchange.<br><br>Mr Howe commented that the Fund is designed for investors who prefer lower<br>risk and lower cost. Investors seeking a better return than bank deposits<br>or to lower the risk of their investment from equities may wish to<br>consider this Fund.<br><br>The IPO, which started on Aug 15, will end at noon on Aug 26. Applications<br>for the IPO can be done at any DBS/POSB ATMs. The prospectus is available<br>at any DBS branch.<br><br>+The fund may in future invest in bonds denominated in Singapore dollars<br>issued by other Asian governments, agencies of other Asian governments, or<br>other quasi-Asian  government  entities if the composition of the iBoxx<br>ABF Singapore Bond Index includes such bonds. In that event, the credit<br>risk of the  investments of the Fund may differ from its credit risk now.<br><br>The prospectus is available at all DBS  and POSB branches when the offer<br>or  invitation is made. Investors should read the prospectus before<br>deciding to subscribe for  or purchase units in the Fund.<br><br>The value of the Fund and the income from them, if any, may fall or rise.<br>The annual distributions are dependent on the Fund's performance and not<br>guaranteed. Investors may only redeem units with the Manager under certain<br>specified conditions and the listing of the Fund on the Stock Exchange of<br>Singapore does not guarantee a liquid market for the units.<br><br></blockquote>Closing date at noon today (26 Aug)<br><br>was at the retail seminar at DBS auditorium the day before, where DBS was promoting the fund's IPO. The fund started with 330mil and grew to 335mil.<br><br>The fund manager was answering a lot of tough questions regarding how much dividend yield and capital gain he would project. The past gains were mainly due to the flattening of the yield curve.<br><br>Those who are interested to reduce the volatility of their stock portfolio, may want to have a look at this stock (which invest in bonds). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

However, cos of the higher price of borrowing plus uncertain growth prospect, prices of long term bonds go up. (something like dat)..<br><br>meaning, even tho i/r is increasing, people who were buying long term bonds were making some money.. but the returns would not be as spectacular as stocks tho.</div>
