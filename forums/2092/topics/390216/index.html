              <div class="story-info"><strong>THE world's top central bankers
              began arriving in Australia yesterday as renewed fears about the
              strength of the global economic recovery gripped world share markets. </strong>  
              <p>Representatives
              from 24 central banks and monetary authorities including the US Federal
              Reserve and European Central Bank landed in Sydney to meet tomorrow at
              a secret location, the <em>Herald Sun</em> reports.</p>
              <p>Organised by
              the Bank for International Settlements last year, the two-day talks are
              shrouded in secrecy with high-level security believed to have been
              invoked by law enforcement agencies.</p>
              <p>Speculation that the
              chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Dr Ben Bernanke, would make an
              appearance could not be confirmed last night.</p>
              <p>The event will be
              dominated by Asian delegations and is expected to include governors of
              the Peoples Bank of China, the Bank of Japan and the Reserve Bank of
              India.</p>
              <p>The arrival of the high-powered gathering coincided with a fresh
              meltdown on world sharemarkets, sparked by renewed concerns about
              global growth and sovereign debt.</p>
              <p>Fears countries including
              Greece, Portugal, Spain and Dubai could default on debt repayments
              combined with disappointing US jobs data to spook investors.</p>
              <p>Australia's ASX 200 slumped 2.4 per cent, to a its lowest close since November 5, echoing a sharp fall on Wall Street.</p>
              <p>Asian
              share markets were also pummelled, with Japan's Nikkei 225 down almost
              3 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slumping 3.3 per cent.</p>
              <p>The damage was also being felt by European markets last night with London's FTSE 100 down sagging 1 per cent in early trade.</p>
              <p>Sovereign
              debt fears rippled through to the Australian dollar which was hammered
              to a four-month low of US86.43 and was trading at US86.77 cents last
              night.</p>
              <p>"This does feel like '08 and '07 all over again whereby we
              had these sort of little fires pop up and they are supposedly contained
              but in reality they are not quite contained,'' said H3 Global Advisors
              chief executive Andrew Kaleel.</p>
              <p>"Dubai should have been an isolated incident and now we are seeing issues with Greece, Portugal and Spain.''</p>
              <p>It
              wasn't all bad news with the RBA yesterday upping its Australian growth
              forecasts and flagging more interest rate rises this year.</p>
              <p>The
              central bank estimates the economy grew 2 per cent in 2009, and will
              expand by 3.25 per cent in 2010, and by 3.5 per cent in 2011.</p>
              <p>The outlook for global growth is likely to be a key theme of the high level central bank talks.</p>
              <p>The
              gathering also comes at an important time for the BIS as it initiates
              an overhaul of the global banking system which will include new capital
              rules applying to banks and more stringent standards regulating
              executive pay.</p>
              <p>A key part of the two-day talkfest will be a
              special meeting of Asian central bankers chaired by the governor of the
              Central Bank of Malaysia, Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz.</p>
              <p>Influential BIS general manager Jaime Caruana is also expected to take a prominent role in the talks.</p>
              Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan will address the central bank officials at a dinner on Monday night.</div>
