              <p> </p>
              <p>THE Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has taken civil enforcement action against a company executive for insider trading.</p>
              <p>  The case is made somewhat unusual as the "inside information" or non-public material information relates to a deal overseas and the trades related to a foreign-listed firm.</p>
              <p>  The case involves Mr Shi Jiangtao, a department manager in the investment department of China Minmetals Non-ferrous Metals Company (CMNMC) - the parent firm of Hong Kong-listed Minmetals Resources - when the contraventions occurred.</p>
              <p>  MAS said yesterday that Mr Shi was a member of the project team formed by CMNMC to work on a proposed takeover of Equinox Minerals, which has shares listed on both Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).</p>
              <p>  Between March 14 and April 1 last year, while in possession of non-public materially price sensitive information related to this acquisition, Mr Shi traded various contracts for differences (CFDs), which give investors an option to make huge bets on stock price movements.</p>
              <p>  He bought 342,000 CFDs relating to Equinox shares, 206,000 relating to Minmetals shares and sold 213,000 CFDs relating to Minmetals shares. It was only on April 4 that Minmetals announced its intention to make an all-cash takeover offer to acquire all outstanding common shares in Equinox at CAD$7 a share.</p>
              <p>  The offer price was at a 23 per cent premium to the closing price of Equinox shares listed on the TSX on April 1. After the release of the announcement, shares of Equinox - on both the TSX and ASX - closed at least 28.7 per cent above the closing share price on April 1. Shares of Minmetals also closed 2.3 per cent higher.</p>
              <p>  The trades took place in Mr Shi's personal trading account and his wife's trading account, opened and maintained with CMC Markets Singapore. The trades were then cancelled.</p>
              <p>  The MAS statement said Mr Shi has admitted to contravening the insider-trading provision and has paid a penalty of $100,000 to MAS without court action. He has cooperated fully with MAS in the investigations, MAS added.</p>
              <p>  Mr Lee Chuan Teck, MAS' assistant managing director (capital markets) said this case shows MAS' resolve in pursuing insider-trading perpetrators, including those residing overseas, or those trading in over-the-counter CFDs. "Individuals should not think that they can avoid detection by dealing outside Singapore, even when dealing in over-the-counter products."</p>
