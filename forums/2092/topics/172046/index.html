            <div class='col-md body'>Lets start the new year with a good counter that will reap good dividends and capital appreciation! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Feel free to post a counter which you think have good potential in terms of dividend yield and capital appreciation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Remember, the following recommendations cannot be a substitute for professional financial advice. We are not responsible for any investment decision you make based on the contents of this thread.<br><br>Stock: Suntec Reit<br><br>Current Price as of 29 Dec 05: $1.08<br><br>According to the inaugral annual report from Suntec Reit, "Suntec Reit has consistently outperform its IPO forecast each quarter and delivered higher distribution yields to its unitholders".<br><br>Suntec Reit has also managed to drive up office occuapancy rate from 75% in Dec 2004 to 90.4% as of 30th September 2005. Asset Enhancements works has also been succesful. The successful implementation of the Happy Kidz zone on the 3rd floor has yielded an average rent of $13psf.<br><br>Although Reits, as high yield investment products, has been somewhat affected by rising interest rates, Suntec Reit believes it is in a good position to overcome this through "hedging strateges and stregthening revenue streams through proactive leasing and yield accretive acquisitions to deliver sustainiable growth".<br><br>Suntec Reit will also stand to benefit from the favourable office market outlook in Singapore.<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>As such, I think the current price of Suntec Reit is quite attractive. The average yield of S-Reits are around 5.2%. Based on the current Price of Suntec Reit, this represents a yield of 5.8% which is slightly higher than the average yield.</div>

On top of that, since the value of the property is subject to market fluctuations, there is a chance that the value could go up considerably if the returns consistently beats Analyst forecast.<br><br>Let me give you an analogy for raffles. Lets say you own a business with a great potential for growth. However, growing that buisness comes with associated risk which, although, you can afford , you dont want to undertake. So whats the solution? Sell the business away at a super good price to somebody who is experienced in undertaking the risk!<br><br>Colony Capital already owns and manages 19000 hotel rooms in the US alone. TO them, Buying over the raffles brand is a good way to acheive a headstart rather than setting up their own brand of hotels in SIngapore.<br><br>So its a win win situation for all parties involved. The buyer gains, the company earns and the shareholders walk away richer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
