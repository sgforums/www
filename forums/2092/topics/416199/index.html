              <p>US will not go broke for the moment because no one can replace the American consumer.</p>
              <p>China and Japan will continue to lend US the money she needs because they themselves require the consumer markets that their own economies have come to rely on.</p>
              <p>US has also made the unwise decision to print money. If they continue to debase their currency it will mean that the wealth of US as a whole would be reduced significantly.</p>
              <p>Reason being that everything in US, stocks, housing is dominated in USD. So a reduction in USD would mean a hit in the wealth of US consumers which may lead to a prolong slow down.</p>
              <p>There is little trade advantage for US in debasing their currency. They are doing this simply because helicopter ben has absolutely no idea what else to do.</p>
              <p>Every commodity is traded with USD, this means that a lower dollar would eventually fuel a very high level of inflation for US consumers as they find that they are attacked by a weaker domestic currency and increasing commodity prices.</p>
              <p>In short helicopter ben will doom us all in the long run.</p>

              <p>the US only knows how to print money, thus debasing their currency. The US dollars, will follow the path of sterling pounds, ie down and down all the way.</p>
              <p>the US will never solve their budget deficits. look at the incredible amount of money they spend on social welfare &amp; on defence, clearly unsustainable. sure they want to maintain their status as the world's super power with troops in Japan, Germany, South Korea and their aircraft carrier scattered around the world. can they still afford to maintain status quo?</p>
              <p>US is on a downward spiral. its a matter of time, before they cant pay their debts. the FED is supposed to keep inflation down, but they keep printing and debasing their currency, so inflation will rise. somemore the interest rates is almost zero to encourage businesses and consumers to borrow, thus igniting growth in the economy and bring down the unemployment rate. it remains to be seen if QE2 will work and unemployment down, we will know next year.</p>

              <p>Their intention is to increase inflation. Fed wants to target inflation at a certain percentage to spur spending and promote growth.</p>
              <p>To put it simply the Fed has run out of ideas. They out of ideas and their Keynsian methods will come back to bite their ass.</p>
              <p>You ought to have more revolutionary ideas if you intend to work for Jim Rogers... </p>
              <p>Anyway lower interest rates cannot do anything for the US economy. Because the real problem is confidence. Even they have 0% interest rates the money will seek higher yielding assets in emerging economies because nobody has faith in the current state of the US economy.</p>
              <p>This is the real problem. =)</p>

              <p>USA already long ago can't pay its debts liao..........in fact they can't even pay the interests on the loans........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but not to worry becoz this is the real order of things............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>USA controlled by ..............shareholders of Federal Reserve (private central bank)................that's why you read about the FED buying US Govt Bonds.....if US Govt is printing their own currency then  that won't happen liao.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>World Bank and IMF (both are also private) are controlled by the people that own the FED.............and with Bank of England........Japan and European Central Bank also borrowing money in USD from the FED...........the FED is the world's central bank..........!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>plus as long as commodities like oil.........metals..........grain.....etc etc...........are sold in USD........USD will always be the world's reserve currency and the FED will make tons and tons of money..................don't forget that most international loans are also made in USD and must be repaid in USD...............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so if USA go into depression.................game over for the world too.................China and India will collapse first............maybe both will have revolutions even................</p>
