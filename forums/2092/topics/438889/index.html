              <p><a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=EK:US">Eastman Kodak Co. (EK)</a>, the unprofitable
              131-year-old camera maker, is weighing options including a
              bankruptcy filing because of concerns raised by possible buyers
              of its patent portfolio, said three people with direct knowledge
              of the process.</p>
              <p>Some potential bidders for the patents are wary of
              proceeding because a purchase may amount to a so-called
              fraudulent transfer if Kodak is insolvent, said the people, who
              asked not to be named because the talks are private. Kodak
              confirmed that it hired <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/jones-day/">Jones Day</a> to advise it on considering
              options and said it doesn’t plan to seek <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/bankruptcy-protection/">bankruptcy protection</a>.</p>
              <p>“As we sit here today, the company has no intention of
              filing, and there is no change in our strategy to monetize our
              intellectual property,” Gerard Meuchner, a spokesman for Kodak,
              said yesterday. “We’re not concerned about fraudulent
              conveyance in regards to the sale of our IP portfolio.”</p>
              <p>The company will make a $14 million coupon payment due
              today, he said. Meuchner declined to comment on whether the
              company had discussed a potential filing with law firms, saying
              that Kodak is “focused on the fourth quarter and on delivering
              on our strategy to become a profitable, sustainable digital
              company.”</p>
              <p>A number of suitors, such as <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GOOG:US">Google Inc. (GOOG)</a>, have signed
              confidentiality agreements to examine the assets, said the
              people. If a sale was judged fraudulent, creditors may sue for
              more money, said one of the people. A bankruptcy filing may help
              clear the way for a patent sale, said the people. The sale could
              fetch about $3 billion, MDB Capital Group estimates.</p>
              <h2>Law Firms</h2>
              <p>Kodak also has discussed its options with law firm Kirkland
              &amp; Ellis LLP, the people said. Companies may hire bankruptcy or
              restructuring counsel to advise on options besides bankruptcy,
              including debt restructuring, asset sales or operational
              improvements. <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=LAZ:US">Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)</a> is advising Kodak on options for the
              patent portfolio.</p>
              <p>Kodak plunged 91 cents, or 54 percent, to 78 cents a share
              yesterday in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york/">New York</a> Stock Exchange composite trading, the
              biggest drop since at least 1974. Trading was halted four times
              by circuit breakers introduced following the May 6, 2010, crash
              to prevent losses in one security from spreading throughout the
              stock market.</p>
              <p>The cost to protect Kodak’s debt from default jumped.
              Credit-default swaps linked to the company rose 4 percentage
              points to 66.5 percent upfront, according to data provider CMA.
              That means investors would pay $6.65 million initially and
              $500,000 annually to protect $10 million of Kodak’s debt for
              five years.</p>
              <h2>Debt Rating</h2>
              <p>Kodak’s debt is rated CCC by Standard &amp; Poor’s and Caa2 by
              Moody’s Investors Service. The ratings are the eighth levels
              below investment grade at each firm.</p>
              <p>A representative from Kirkland declined to comment. Katelin
              Todhunter-Gerberg, a spokeswoman for <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/mountain-view/">Mountain View</a>, California-
              based Google, didn’t immediately respond to voicemail and e-mail
              messages seeking comment, nor did an official for Jones Day.</p>
              <p>Moody’s cut Kodak’s bond ratings Sept. 27 and indicated
              further reductions may follow, citing “ongoing weakness” in
              the company’s operations. Kodak, which tapped a <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/credit-line/">credit line</a> last
              month, has seen its market value sink by more than $30 billion
              from its 1997 peak.</p>
              <p>Chief Executive Officer Antonio Perez, who took the helm in
              2005, has sharpened Kodak’s focus on the printing business to
              help revive revenue. Perez announced plans in July to explore
              options for the portfolio of more than 1,100 patents, including
              some for processing, editing and storing images.</p>
              <h2>‘A Conundrum’</h2>
              <p>“What’s facing Kodak is whether it can give assurances to
              third-party buyers that they’re not going to get sued,” <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/mark-kaufman/">Mark Kaufman</a>, an analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets in New York,
              said yesterday by telephone. “Here’s the irony: If they sell
              the assets for a good price, the issues of insolvency are over.
              It’s a conundrum.”</p>
              <p>A bankruptcy filing “would be a mechanism to get this
              asset sale done,” said Kaufman, the only analyst among seven
              tracked by Bloomberg who rates Kodak as “buy.” He values the
              patents at $2.4 billion.</p>
              <p>Kodak’s sales have fallen by half since 2005 to $7.2
              billion last year, with further declines predicted this year and
              next. The company’s losses since 2008 exceed $1.76 billion.</p>
              <p>Kodak, whose origins date back to 1880, was founded by
              George Eastman, who introduced the Kodak camera eight years
              later, according to the company’s website. Kodak has shifted
              away from traditional film as consumers gravitated toward
              digital cameras.</p>
              <h2>Kodak Investors</h2>
              <p>Kodak’s top debtholders include Fidelity Management &amp;
              Research, Fidelity International, Banc One Investment Advisors,
              Davidson Kempner Capital Management LLC and OppenheimerFunds
              Inc., according to Bloomberg data.</p>
              <p>Fidelity and its affiliates ranked as the largest Eastman
              Kodak shareholders as of June 30 with a combined 24.4 million
              shares, most of which was held in the form of bonds that are
              convertible into common stock, according to regulatory filings.</p>
              <p>The largest owner of actual Kodak stock was <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=LM:US">Legg Mason
              Inc. (LM)</a>’s LMM LLC, which held 18.2 million shares outright, the
              equivalent of a 6.8 percent stake, when the second quarter
              ended, the filings show.</p>
