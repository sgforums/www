The effective date is set for July 1 2006.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Only CPF savings in the Ordinary Account in excess of the Minimum Sum cash component can be used for the purchase of second and subsequent properties.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  No new applications in the Ordinary Account in excess of the Minimum Sum cash componet can be used for the purchase of second and subsequent properties.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> No new applications to use CPF savings to fund purchases of non-residential properties will be allowed from July 1, 2006<br><br><strong>Foreign Property Ownership</strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Under a new option to the EDB's Global Investor Programme, a foreigner can be considered for permanent resident if he invests at least $2 million in business set-ups, other investment vehicles such as venture capital funds, foundations or trusts, and/or private residential properties. Up to 50 per cent of the investment can be in private residential properties.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Foreigners can buy apartments in non-condo developments of less than six levels without the need to obtain prior approval.
