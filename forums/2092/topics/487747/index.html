              <p>Money, money and more 
                  money! The recent news about the US interest rates hikes has hit our 
                  shores in Singapore and the news is not entirely encouraging.</p>
              <p>The three-month <strong>Sibor</strong>, which is used to price most 
                  loans and mortgages here, has been inching its way upwards due to 
                  interest rate hike in the United States and a weakening Singapore dollar
                   versus the greenback. The recent announcements by MAS to reduce the 
                  Singapore dollar from appreciating aims to keep the Sibor elevated.</p>
              <p>The Sibor is fixed daily by the Association of Banks in Singapore 
                  based on quotes from banks on what they expect to pay for interbank 
                  loans that day. In short, it is affected by liquidity in the banking 
                  sector.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“The reduction of the appreciation slope could keep 
                  pressure on the US and Singapore dollar exchange rate and thus could 
                  ensure Sibor remains at current levels … This move by MAS helps keep 
                  Singapore policy on a stable footing, and we expect it to be modestly 
                  beneficial for Singapore bank earnings,” analysts from Morgan Stanley 
                  said in a research note.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h2>Interest Rate Hike: What does it mean for You?</h2>
              <p>Many housing loans offered by banks are tied to three-month Sibor. 
                  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC), for example, has 3 types of home 
                  loans and one that is currently offering home loans at three-month Sibor
                   plus 0.85 percentage points for the first three years, according to its
                   website. Lending rates are reviewed every three months. As the Sibor is
                   set to increase, so will the interest rate rise. Home owners will 
                  eventually face higher mortgage payments.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“We had expected the bullish move in the SOR and Sibor since last year,” says UOB economist Francis Tan (<a title="What to do about home loan interest rate rise" href="http://business.asiaone.com/news/what-do-about-home-loan-interest-rates-rise">source</a>)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Analysts are looking at further upside to about 1 to 1.2 per cent at 
                  the end of the year. Effectively leading to an interest rate of about 
                  over 2% for home loans.</p>
              <p>Let us assume an outstanding housing loan of S$500,000 and 20 years 
                  remaining. With the current interest rate of 1.5 per cent, this works 
                  out to a monthly payment of about S$2,410.</p>
              <p>If the interest rate is increased to 2 per cent, the monthly payment 
                  would rise to around S$2,530. Should the rate rise to 3 per cent, the 
                  monthly payment would be S$2,770.</p>
              <h2>What to Do Next with Higher Interest Rate?</h2>
              <p>Higher interest rates charged by banks affect your loans directly. 
                  Thus you will see your loans, home mortgage loans, renovation loans 
                  slowly inching its way up.</p>
              <p>Hence start reviewing your loans! For example, review your home loan 
                  packages every two to three years. Look at the trends Conventional 
                  wisdom has it that you should review your loan package every two to 
                  three years, or before the promotional period ends and your bank raises 
                  its premium on the interest you pay, which increases your monthly 
                  instalments.</p>
              <p>In short, think long term and look around for good deals. Always negotiate with the bank on refinancing options.</p>

              <p>DPM Teo added that the improved situation was due to the tough laws 
                  enacted, strong enforcement efforts against loan-shark syndicates and 
                  the high level of community support in the fight against unlicensed 
                  moneylending activities.</p>
              <p>According to DPM Teo, about 1,900 people were arrested for unlicensed
                   moneylending and related harassment offences on average yearly between 
                  2011 and 2014, while about 2,600 were convicted in court for these 
                  offences.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Seen the recent hype about public harassment during working hours? 
                  Debt collectors created a ruckus at Funan Mall over unpaid debts. 
                  Moreover, this was during working hours infront of the public eye.</p>
              <p>With clamping down on unlicensed activities and harassment cases, 
                  this is looking good for us licensed moneylenders at Empire Global. The 
                  image of licensed lenders is changing for the better as tougher laws are
                   weeding out bad lenders. Thankfully, the ruly debt collectors have been
                   arrested for unlawful assembly.</p>
