The world is an unequal place, with the rich countries getting richer and the poor countries getting poorer. Money is perhaps just a tool of society to facilitate buying and selling, for we have progressed beyond our primitive forefathers.<br><br>The Greed component is that of capitalist economies desiring to become more rich and powerful, exploiting the oilfields in countires such as Nigeria, creating massive enviromental destruction. Then again, poor policies and corruption in these poor countries also contributed to the situation today.<br><br>Let's just hope that the G8's pledge of US$50 billion to developing countires by 2010 will turn things around. They're obliged to help for they created the problems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As the saying goes, the rich only gets richer and the poor only gets poorer.<br><br>There are many reasons for poverty, besides the introduction of money to primarily agrarian society. Like Civil War, Natural disaster, economic crisis..<br><br>But then International (and IMF) food/ monetary aid may not be the solution. In fact, some of the countries have got poorer from these 'aids'. Cos these funds  usually are attached with some terms and conditions. For eg., in the recent Tsunami, many countries provided 'relief funds' ON THE CONDITION that the construction/ rebuilding projects on some parts of Indon goes to coy from the 'helping' country.<br><br>Even IMF aid comes with strings attached. IMF requires the countries to adopt 4 things: <strong>Privatization, Capital market liberalization, Market-based pricing, Free trade</strong>. But none of these work.<br><br><strong>Privatisation</strong> ends up with important utilities falling into the hands of corrupt govt officials. <strong>Capital market</strong> liberalization causes an outflow of capital and creates a vicious cycle of rising interest rates, to attract speculators to return the capital. <strong>Market-based pricing</strong> is also a fancy term for raising prices on food, water and cooking gas. <strong>Free trade</strong> only makes it legal for foreign countries to depress wages and gain excess to the countries' capital.<br><br>Surprisingly, even seemingly Noble acts of providing <strong>food supplies</strong>, can damage the economy. Cos it under-sells local farmers and can ultimately affect the entire economy of a poor nation.<br><br>If poorer nations are not given the sufficient means to produce their own food, if they are not allowed to use the tools of production for themselves, then poverty and dependency will continue.<br><br>(Most of the above material come from this website:<br><a href="http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Poverty.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Poverty.asp</a> )</div>
