            <div class='col-md body'>Depends what kind of investor you want to be...<br><br>You want to be active....or you want to just find someone/ some institution/ fund manager to let them make the decisions for you.<br><br>Because it depends...not everybody is interested in the nitty gritty details of investing, they are more interested in their own jobs or activities. And they can be happy just by knowing although they dont understand much on investments, they have experts who manage their money. They are happy, not worried by this at all.<br><br>BUT seeing your post and your age, I bet you are not this kind of personality, right? You want action, right? hehe.....<br><br>OK you want the fastest game in town? Trade derivatives. Options and futures. It will suit your personality the best. Exciting. Im sure you will love it.<br><br>Firstly if you want to be active that means you invest short term. If you invest short term you need to know technical analysis. Basically reading charts.<br><br>After that, you can learn the derivatives, options and futures.<br><br>So for now I recommend to start studying technical analysis. You can start from the web, books, join online forums, etc.<br><br>Approx.....uhhh...I dont know, maybe 1 year. 2 years or more is better. Then study derivatives for further 1 or 2 years. After 3 or 4 years you will get the grasp.<br><br>Don't worry as long as you keep studying it, you will definitely get good. Don't let the time put you off. But Im just saying patience is required.<br><br><img src="http://photobucket.com/albums/b122/newties/th_LKSs.jpg"></div>

Buying low with the hope of selling higher later.<br><br>But an entity can go down too. When you think it's going downwards, you can still get a profit by doing the opposite of long, which is short.<br><br>Short selling means you borrow a stock (or whatever, a stock is the example here) and you sell it at the market price. When the market price drops, you buy it back, and return the stock to your lender. The difference of higher sell price and lower buy-back price is your profit.<br><br>It's the same like the 'long' principle of buy low sell high. Except it's reversed in order, it becomes sell high buy low.<br><br>Basically it's for participating in market downward movement.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dont worry there's no stupid questions in this world.<br><br>The factors which will affect the price...supply and demand, but if we talk more specifically about the general stock market, that would be the general economic and political conditions where that stock market is in.<br><br>That would be, for economic conditions......GDP growth, inflation rate, central bank interest rate, average earnings growth, and some more minor datas like unemployment data, housing data, consumer spending data, etc.<br><br>Also price of oil. Important nowaways.<br><br>For political conditions....basically whether it's politically condusive and stable. For example when a new president comes in, and during campaign he already promised some measures the market like, the stock market will go up, in anticipation of more condusive environment. That's an example of a politically motivated price movement.<br><br>A politically motivated price movement can be caused by election results, scandals, etc.<br><br>Another important mover is 'unexpected events' such as disasters or terrorist attacks.<br><br>If you talk about specific stock/ company, apart from the general conditions above which also apply to them, additional factors include: news, earnings growth, new product launches, FDA approvals, mergers and acquisitions, analysts ratings (downgrade/ upgrade), etc.<br><br>But....how to keep up with all these, right? So many of them.<br><br>That's why people say the market is already pricing in everything that it knows currently as well as what it expects to happen in the future.<br><br>So to know how the market price will behave, we need to study charts.<br><br>By studying charts, we are studying what the market thinks. We are free riding on other people who study more detailed datas like above.<br><br>It's nice to be a free rider, isn't it?<br><br>Studying charts basically mean drawing graphs and predicting the future based on the chart. That's usually for the near and medium term.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mmm okay then, but for example I have stocks in company A and B which deal with real estates. How exactly would prices of, for example, oil affect the ups and downs of my stocks? How do inflation and interest rates affect?<br><br>If I buy stock A at $1.00 each, and all of a sudden people start selling it. $1.00 goes up or down? As long as the company does not go bankrupt or close down, the stocks that I hold are 'safe' right? I mean even if it goes down all the way to a temporary low of $0.10, I don't have to come out extra money to maintain the number of stocks I had right?<br><br>How exactly do good news for company A, for example, "a better board of directors going to take over the current ones", or "sales for company A are going to go up this period of time" affect the rise of the share price of company A on the market? Does that mean I can just call up the newspaper and spread good rumours about company A, and when it appears in the newspaper, everyone will start buying the stock of company A thinking its good news for company A and it will prosper, the price goes up, and I sell for a profit? Is it this simple as I think or no?<br><br>What I gave are basically examples of the logics/systems/theories in the stock market that I don't exactly understand so hopefully someone can help me here because I doubt books can help me understand this part.

            <div class='col-md body'>A stock price reflects a company's valuation. And it is affected by its specific factors as well as the overall economic, and political condition, where that stock is in.<br><br>Therefore a stock price is affected by the price of oil, inflation rate, GDP growth, average earnings growth, central bank interest rate, etc, as these are indicative of the overall economy.<br><br>How closely a specific stock follow the general move of the broader market as affected by these factors, depends on the nature of each company.

Up in inflation rate, means worse overall economic conditions, the stock market goes down (opposite).<br><br>When all these datas come up, you are confused how to interpret them as a whole. Like if it's 3 up, 3 down, so what does that mean?<br><br>Even the best economists miss their forecasts. We don't try to be an economist. We look at the overall market price. The overall market price has already priced in everything it knows including the overall economic and political conditions.<br><br>So like I said, we just be a free rider. Just look at the INDEX.<br><br>The index reflects the overall market price, which means it reflects the market digestion of overall economic and political condition as a whole.<br><br>Since a specific stock is always affected by its specific factors as well as general economic and political factors, the index will always affect a specific stock price.

If people sell, price drop of course. If it drops from $1 to $0.10 like you said, you don't need to pay for any maintenance and it's safe, but theoretically you got a massive loss. This should worry you more than any maintenance. Such massive lost will not happen in real life though, since you have risk management like placing stop-loss.<br><br>Your third question. You can spread rumours of course and if the stock is cheap and small, your rumour can move the stock, and you can con them all.

So if the INDEX is healthy, its a good day to invest, but how does that arrow down to the very stock that one would want to buy?

When exactly and how exactly do the price drop? After the first, lets just say, 100 people sell, the price drops significantly? SO first come first serve basis? Or is it after everyone, in this case the 200 people, sell at that particular price, then the price drop accordingly? Which means all 200 people have managed to sell at the same price.. (Sorry I think this is basic econs but I'm not too sure how it goes about..)<br><br>When I check out the different INDEXes in the newspapers, I notice that the names of the listed companies have additional words such as "50c" or something similar like that. What does this means? 50 cents per share? What about those names which does not have this "50c"?</div>

(Beta is correlation). Or just trade the index itself.
