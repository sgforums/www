Owning a business is more challenging and more exciting, at the same time can be stressful sometimes and it is definitely something which I would like to do in the future.

I'm a muslim, and by understanding how the market works in depth allows me to do my investments carefully without challenging the restrictions within my religion.

The most common is fundamental analysis while the other is known as technical analysis.<br><br>Each method has their pros and cons. Generally, both methods will agree with each other on the long term basis, however, they differ on a short term basis.<br><br>Islam forbids the investment of money into companies that engage in haram activities such as "gambling, alcohol, prostituition and vices". I dont think there are much companies listed on the SGX that deals in these activities as their core business. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I suggest that you purchase a copy of the business times everyday and read he articles in there.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
