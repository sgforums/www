                      environment not only to the individuals but also to the very societies 
                      due to the <strong>global resource constraint and technology bottle neck</strong>.<br> In the past, there were enough technologies breakthrough and innovations
                       that allowed the the country with the most advanced scientific power to
                       become superpower in terms of economy and influence. Example is America
                       and Japan, where their innovations allowed them to develop leading 
                      technology and products that dominated the world economy. When 
                      technology innovations are at that plenty, the direction of the future 
                      development is clear and obvious for the world leaders. USA and Japan 
                      would always manufacture the most leading products, while the less 
                      developed cheaper countries would manufacture more mainstream products 
                      at a cheap lower cost.<br> What happened later is that there is a slow down of technology 
                      innovations. there is less and less new leading products coming to the 
                      market, USA and Japan start running out of leading products to 
                      manufacture and find themselves hard to compete against less developed 
                      countries to manufacture more mainstream products. <strong>Slowly USA and 
                      Japan find themselves losing manufacturing power to less developed 
                      countries, at first to South American and Asia. </strong>So USA have no 
                      choice but slowly turned its attention to service sector and domestic 
                      demand, such as finance, multimedia such as films, books and others.<br> Initially the South America and Asia are booming, but India and China 
                      suddenly become the big players as they start opening their market and 
                      opening themselves to the world. Due to their huge population size and 
                      low wage cost, they become the biggest mainstream products manufacturing
                       with the potential to become some of the largest domestic market 
                      globally. Suddenly, India becomes the world largest IT outsourcing venue
                       and China becomes the largest mainstream product manufacturing venue. <br> Therefore, as the <strong>economies of USA and Japan become stagnant</strong>, 
                      India and China are growing at a staggering pace. As USA continues to 
                      focus on its domestic market, India and China is supplying their cheap 
                      services and products to USA and the rest of the world. Soon USA finds 
                      that it needs to borrow money to sustain the current lifestyle of 
                      living. Just like a fisherman borrowing money from the moneylender. The 
                      fisherman keeps on borrowing money from the moneylender and the 
                      moneylender dare not refuse as it depended on the fisherman for enough 
                      fishes for his diet. If one day the moneylender able to catch enough 
                      fish on his own, he will refuse to lend money to the fisherman and 
                      fisherman will become broke.<br> [<strong>bold font</strong> and spelling edits added] </blockquote></div>
              <p>Not to sure if the fisherman scenario is that apt an example bc the US in reality, now doesn't borrow, it simply <strong>PRINT$$$$</strong>;
               anyhow, I think that recent US Presidents in recent times have breed an
               increasingly STUPID population based upon their 'job printing' policies
               to that lull lay electorate from genuine concern.<br> <br> From what I do hear, many American citizens are still stuck in their 
              pre-Lehman (2007-8) profligacy, (then and still) funded by the USA 
              housing boom funded perpetuated by deception, aka "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_financial_crisis#Weak_and_fraudulent_underwriting_practices">fraudulent underwriting practices</a>".<br> <br> Currently, their chieftain, Mr Ben Bernanke, Chairman of US FED, seems 
              to be of the opinion that if by hook or crook, the share markets can be 
              propped up by quantitative easing (aka printing $$$), then the economy 
              can glow again, but all this silliness is no contest for the stable 
              Asian concept of 'love' whereby individuals are taught to place others' 
              (family/ country) first.<br> <br> My current view is that rather than sticking to the purity of its own religion (Christianity (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States">mainly protestant AFAIK</a>))- as exemplified by <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A8&amp;version=NIV"><strong>mutual caring and love between men as the alter of God bestows</strong></a>,
               American citizens have instead increasingly believed in the deceptive 
              statistics spewed by economist, in conspiracy with 2 querulous political
               parties- democrats and republicans, purporting on each side- skewed, 
              half baked economic theories.<br> <br> Whilst money printing aka "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing">quantitative easing (QE)</a>" in the short term might indeed boost the economy (raise GDP), this effect is temporary (think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Armstrong_doping_case">drug doping in cycling sport/ Lance Armstrong</a>),
               unfortunately, the cost of such myopic endeavor is oft devastating. For
               the profit of aggrandizing Obama's joblessness/ GDP statistics/ 
              Presidency short term, here's what QE will do to human (American) 
              society:<br> - <strong>Widen rich poor divide</strong> because only equity (bonds, stocks etc) holders and home owners profit from the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2012/12/12/more-fed-stimulus-on-the-way-stocks-rise/">FED's US$1trillion p.a. QE plan</a> (US$85billion/ month = US$1020 Billion p.a.). The $ sloshing around the
               economy will immediately raise stock prices and housing prices through 
              cheap mortgage rates but the consequences of such are manifold:<br> <br> - More money around makes people more <strong>stressed </strong>and the economy 
              more complicated- essential public services are strained and eventually 
              will costs more to run (healthcare, police, fire service)- eventually 
              dragging down the economy if mismanaged.<br> - People become more <strong>unreasonable and demanding</strong> because there is 
              excessive dependence upon government powers to provide jobs/ sustain the
               economy since inflation is often a delayed side effect of loose 
              monetary policy: this disquiet will be politically challenging to 
              control down the road for politicians of today's standards (e.g. Bush, 
              Obama).<br> - Politicians who depend upon loose monetary policies (<strong>borrowing against future generations</strong>) rather than "leading by example" set the example for dishonesty amongst the citizens of the country. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/like_father,_like_son">'Like father like son'</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7:15-20&amp;version=NIV">bad leaders beget bad followers</a>,
               the Americans of tomorrow will not be more virtuous then their leaders 
              today who rather borrow money against the credit of their unborn 
              children than lead society by moral example.<br> <br> - needless to say, I do indeed believe that the US economy is heading in
               the wrong direction as it seems a growing economy devoid of <strong>moral foundation</strong>.
               Obama's theory seems to be that by increasing the food pile upon the 
              table of the rich, more food will fall off the table as scraps for the 
              poor- an extremely inefficient method of alleviating poverty in the 
              world today.<br> <br> Still, little does Obama realize that over eating by the rich will 
              result in indigestion, and over a longer term, a fatal coronary. The 
              scraps the poor get from the floor are also stale and the indignity of 
              receiving half eaten food isn't significantly uplifting. Worse, all the 
              food wasted in this process only serves to pollute the environment, 
              making it less hospitable for all (read global warming, Fukushima 
              nuclear disaster*, environmental pollution). Ultimately, an economy that
               encourages 'creative accounting' and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard">moral hazards</a> and plagued by an ever increasing class divide cannot be described as a
               resilient society and where push comes to shove, civil discord/ war 
              will again take hold and reduce all liberties to that of a police state.
               One full circle, the rise and the fall of the Unites States of America.<br> <br> In short, the American economy, originally built more like a house upon a rock, is now built like <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A24-27&amp;version=NIV">one upon shaky soil</a>; the moral compass of America is broken.<br> <br> Where love and liberty fail, corruption and authoritarianism take hold.<br> A political system not driven by <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A8&amp;version=NIV">moral interest (love)</a> but by the unilateral and irresponsible desire for personal wealth(at all costs)- is doomed to fail.<br> <br> Pre-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers">Lehman </a>was a mirage, post Lehman is truth.<br> <br> Sans moral purpose and direction, the citizens of this world have little, if any, to look forward to.<br> <br> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A8&amp;version=NIV">1 John 4:8; New International Version (NIV)</a><br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">God’s Love and Ours</span></strong><br> 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.<br> <br> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7:15-20&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 7:15-20, New International Version (NIV)</a><br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">True and False Prophets</span></strong>:<br> 15 “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, 
              but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. 16 By their fruit you will 
              recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from 
              thistles? 17 Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree 
              bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree 
              cannot bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is 
              cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 Thus, by their fruit you will 
              recognize them.<br> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A24-27&amp;version=NIV"><br> Matthew 7:24-27; New International Version (NIV)</a><br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Wise and Foolish Builders</span></strong><br> 24 “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into 
              practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 The rain
               came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that 
              house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 
              26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into
               practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27 The rain
