              If you want to continue your study in University, work part time to pay for your fees or work full time and study part time.
              
              About how much you left after paying your housing loan for thirty years, my advise don't hope for your CPF fund for your retirement, you need to create you own saving account for your retirement. Again that depends whether you can afford to retire in Singapore or you want to stretch your dollars and retire abroad.
              
              About cars....you can't afford it, don't buy. Save your money instead.

              About your housing loan, well, they deduct that from your cpf. About renovation loan, why must you renovate your house expensively. Is it necessary? To me, when you have a hdb, just do the kitchen cabinet and paint the house yourself....other renovation not necessary because if you can't afford it, don't spend on it...then no renovation loan. Probably, you don't even need to make a kitchen cabinet...just buy a mobile kitchen cabinet will do....and save money and no debt. If you can't afford to pay your own down payment for your hdb flat by cpf, then don't buy the hdb flat until your cpf is enough to pay for your own down payment. In the meantime, stay with your own parents, parent-in-laws or grandparents flat. Don't get married if you know you can't afford to support your own self or your future spouse. If you do get married, no need to spend so much on your wedding..instead use your money for honeymoon and for your hdb flat. About saving, try to save $50 a month when you start work and later when you can save more...do it.

              <p>You go and be monk or priest then you will be debt free. <img id="yui_3_7_2_33_1373811216712_57" src="http://mail.yimg.com/ok/u/assets/img/emoticons/emo29.gif" alt="*:)) laughing"></p>
              <p>Otherwise :</p>
              <p>For University, apply for scholarship, if you have to sign bond, just treat it like NS, better than take loan cos you still have to pay interest. Otherwise ask from the school whether they have installment plan or government's subsidies</p>
              <p>For Housing, if you cannot buy an HDB, you can also get an living space from rental, especially I know of those super rich one who didn't stay frequent in their condominiums they always rent out to people.</p>
              <p>Cars? Unless you are doing an sales job which some company required, otherwise look for car leasing company or if your "best" friends have one, just "borrow" it from them and return it in "one" piece.</p>
