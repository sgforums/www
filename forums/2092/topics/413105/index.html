              <p>FORMER IPO king Choo Chee Kong is returning to the investment fray three years after he sold his stake in corporate finance outfit Westcomb Capital, and left corporate life.</p>
              <p><br>Mr Choo, who has handled more than 100 IPOs, is taking on a senior advisory role at home-grown private equity firm CMIA Capital Partners.</p>
              <p>He told The Straits Times earlier this week that he wanted to capitalise on his expertise with SMEs and tap opportunities 'in a more structured and more systematic way'.</p>
              <p><br>During his time at DBS Bank, and later as head of Westcomb Capital, he handled the listing of a succession of local SMEs, including DMX Technologies, Apex-Pal and Thomson Medical.</p>
              <p><br>Mr Choo began his career at DBS, where he rose to head its corporate finance unit<br>before leaving to set up Westcomb Capital, said to have been Singapore's first homegrown boutique corporate finance outfit.</p>
              <p><br>The latest step in the 52-year-old's career will see him work with CMIA in finding and<br>assessing promising investment opportunities in Singapore's SME sector.</p>
              <p>'We will hold their hand, teach them about running a company, and how to grow and<br>professionalise their businesses and raise successive levels of finance.'</p>
              <p>The ultimate sign of their success will come with their listing. 'For many, to go for a<br>listing - to be able to say that they are the boss of a listed company, that is the apex of their career,' said Mr Choo.</p>
              <p><br>CMIA Capital Partners is little known in Singapore, given that it has invested mostly in China, but it has spearheaded about US$600 million (S$784 million) worth of private equity investments to date.</p>
              <p>Only a handful of its investee companies have listed here, the most recent being China Minzhong.</p>
              <p>CMIA is now turning its sights on Singapore and has handpicked Mr Choo to expand its operations here.</p>
              <p>CMIA's co-founder, Mr Lee Chong Min, said: 'In the last decade, many of us embarked on private equity investments in China. But now US funds back US companies to go into China instead. Why shouldn't we do the same and back our own companies to go to China?'</p>
              <p><br>Mr Lee anticipates launching a fund of at least US$50 million soon.<br>CMIA will invest the money either by directly taking stakes, or by lending money with<br>the option to take up shares at a future date, a mezzanine form of financing.<br>With more and more investors in the region hailing from Europe and the Middle East,Mr Choo thinks that Asia's time has come.</p>
              <p>'There is so much emphasis on Asia, with people from Europe coming here. A lot of<br>people want to set up their base here.'</p>
              <p>CMIA and Mr Choo should be a high-powered match in the SME landscape, bringing together funds and decades of expertise.</p>

              <p>CMIA Capital Partners ("CMIA") is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Peter Choo Chee Kong as a Senior Advisor. Mr. Peter Choo brings to CMIA a wealth of experience, having more than 20 years experience in investment banking, with a track record of helping over 200 SMEs across the region realize their IPO aspirations.</p>
              <p>Since leaving the investment banking business in 2008, where he was Deputy Chairman and CEO of WestComb Financial Group, Mr. Peter Choo has been actively investing in various small and mediumsized businesses. In addition, he has been "rolling-up his sleeves" with his direct involvement in the operations and management of such businesses. In this sense, Mr. Peter Choo has shifted from the conventional investment banking "transactional" role into one that resembles more closely private equity investing.</p>
              <p>"We are very pleased to have Peter as our Senior Advisor. He is not only a successful investment banker with a strong SME business network across the region, he is also an entrepreneur in his own right and essentially pioneered Singapore’s boutique investment banking industry", commented Mr. Anson Wang, co-Founder of CMIA Capital Partners.</p>
              <p>Over the past year, CMIA has also been actively evaluating investment opportunities in well-managed growth companies in Southeast Asia, with a primary focus in Singapore.</p>
              <p>"We believe in a value-added business partnership with good and trustworthy management teams. CMIA looks forward to work actively with these SMEs to maximize their business opportunities and growth potential. CMIA has a strong network of government and business contacts in Southeast Asia, China and the Middle East and can help SMEs to tap business growth opportunities in these emerging markets", commented Mr. Lee Chong Min, Managing Partner of CMIA Capital Partners.</p>
              <p>On being asked about the reasons of joining CMIA, Mr. Peter Choo commented, "It has always been my modus operandi to support and partner with reputable and professional "Singapore-bred" companies. I have known the Founders and Managing Partners, Anson and Chong Min for many years and watched both of them build CMIA from a two-man firm in 2003 into a leading private equity firm in Singapore with a full professional team and a strong investment track record. Over the years, I have also been exploring opportunities to work closely with Anson and Chong Min."</p>

              <p>SMALL and medium-sized enterprises should work together and leverage 
              on each other's strengths to better exploit opportunities in foreign 
              markets.</p>
              <p>IE Singapore and Spring Singapore gave that advice yesterday to the 
              SME community here, as optimism improves along with the economic 
              recovery.</p>

              The 
              eighth annual SME Development Survey released yesterday found that 
              almost one in two SMEs here is trying to achieve greater penetration of 
              their current overseas markets, while another 29 per cent are aiming to 
              increase the number of overseas markets they serve.</p>
              <p>The survey was conducted by DP Information Group (DP Info), which polled 2,341 firms between April and June this year.</p>
              <p>Not surprisingly, Asia remains the key region for SMEs, with Malaysia
               being the top market served by 73 per cent of the companies.</p>
              <p>China is the second-most-preferred market, served by 71 per cent of the firms.</p>
              <p>Strong overseas competition is still the biggest concern for SMEs 
              doing business outside of Singapore, a worry cited by 50 per cent of the
               companies.</p>
              <p>Other major concerns include the lack of overseas business contacts, 
              knowledge of a foreign market, brand acceptance, manpower, access to 
              external funds and distribution channels.</p>
              <p>Because of their smaller size, SMEs typically have to work harder for
               their market share, but by forming a consortium, they can pool their 
              resources and level up with their bigger rivals, said Ms Azlinda 
              Sulaiman, group director of IE Singapore's Enterprise Services Group.</p>
              <p>Ms Chen Yew Nah, managing director of DP Info, said: "Forming a 
              consortium is one of the ways for SMEs to succeed overseas, as such 
              markets are too large. There are many new things to learn and plenty of 
              challenges to face."</p>
              <p>That said, SMEs are not rushing to expand aggressively, given how the recent crisis has exposed their vulnerabilities.</p>
              <p>Many said they were looking to invest more heavily in staff, training, branding and technology.</p>
              <p>The survey found that the key focus of SMEs over the next 12 months 
              is to step up advertising for their brands. About 46 per cent are 
              looking into introducing higher-value-added products and services.</p>
              <p>"SMEs are focusing on qualitative improvements to their businesses 
              because they are more positive about the future," said Ms Chen. 
              "Strengthening their internal skills and capacity will help them deal 
              with the increased competition they face at home and abroad."</p>

              SPRING Singapore has launched two new toolkits to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) here improve their customer service and marketing capabilities.
              
              Both toolkits are available free on the EnterpriseOne portal. SMEs can access step-by-step guides on how best to create a marketing plan, among other things. The marketing toolkit also provides links to case studies and tools on how to measure the plan's effectiveness.
              
              A survey by DP Information Group last year showed that more than 88 per cent of the SMEs polled viewed marketing-related issues as among their toughest challenges. In the same survey, 47 per cent of the SMEs identified improving customer service as their top business strategy.
              
              SPRING has also announced enhancements to its existing SME Management Action for Results, or SMART, initiative. The diagnostic instruments used to develop the roadmap for SMEs have been improved to sharpen the identification of capability gaps where specific solutions are available to help SMEs address the shortcomings.
              
              A productivity diagnosis is also available for the first time. It will help SMEs identify their strengths and weaknesses and guide them on taking steps to improve productivity. A solutions guide has also been developed for SMART consultants so that they can consider a wider range of solutions to help SMEs.
