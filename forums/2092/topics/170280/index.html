            <div class='col-md body'>They want to kill maxtor and take over their market share lah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . Normally there is no point in such acquisition because both are in the same industry and if seagate really want to expand why couldn't it just build a few more plants and add more production lines? Wouldn't it be much cheaper? Because takeover there will be a premium to pay for share price and later on you would have to consolidate the activities of maxtor into seagate that will take time and money. Then there will be redundancies so you have to axe staff and pay golden parachutes.<br><br>Just like EMC storage and clariion storage years before both were in the same industry, EMC was supposedly a more superior product than clariion but more expensive while clariion was more simple and much much cheaper and workable solution, clariion garnered a much larger market share during the dot com years.<br><br>Later on when EMC took over clariion, it killed the product making it more expensive in terms of technology dollar value to use clariion than to use EMC and the rest they say is history.<br><br>Just like the time oracle want to makan peoplesoft and microsoft want to makan SAP systems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>once there is a big boy on the block, the rest of the smaller players will be either be squeezed and go out of business or have to join alliance with the bigboy.<br><br>Just like rockerfella's STO standard oil in america, when it became the biggest and meanest, it literally controlled or influenced all the railways and made them give special discounts over other oil competitors for transporting his oil because doing STO business was so huge and they just cannot afford to lose the business of STO, STO also influenced all the companies that made wooden barrels he even threaten some of these companies not to supply his rivals. In this way he brought almost all his competitors their knees by forcing them to sell out to him or join him, the other option was to close shop.<br><br>Of course this attracted the unwanted attention of the government regulators who sought for 30yrs and finally managed to break up his company into SHELL, EXXON MObile companies that you see exist today.<br><br>Just like seagate if they become too big, the american regulators will come in.</div>

Their manufacturing they started like us, then they moved into counterfeiting and imitation manufacturing from there their learning curve actually increase dramatically.<br><br>If you look at it from another light it's actually another form of contract manufacturing cum reverse engineering. You are taking apart a product and learning how to build it all over again bit by bit, part by part to perfection ie make another copy, if you have a large scale of industries that can do that imagine why you cannot come out with a similiar product to sony or hitachi or nike but under a different brand name and compete with them.<br><br>The taiwanese also started out like that with counterfeiting but they shrewedly did it with semiconductors like computer parts, motherboards in the 70's - 90's but instead of calling their semiconductors copies it's called OEM, look where are taiwanese products today, you can find them in almost all markets around the world in the form of semiconductors, chips, electronics and many are under their own taiwanese brand.<br><br>Now China is also trying to follow as taiwan and thailand and hope to replicate that success and increase the learning curve.<br><br>We started out with small scale software counterfeiting but along the way we gave in to US preassure, had we not given in and went ahead to higher forms  of reverse engineering I think today our situation will be vastly different and probably already have a number of application out in the market under our own singapore brand. We will not be in the predicament that we are in today.<br><br></div></blockquote>Haha.. maybe that's why most, if not all ppl from western countries upset about chinese n some asian companies (not just in China, but Taiwan n other places as well)... Japanese n Caucasians invent a product, paying expensive engineers, set a patent and copyright..  Then Asians... copy, modify and use all the knowledge to their needs... then in the end, the modified versions are claimed as their own patents. Just look at the pirated CDs..budget DVD/VCD players, electronics...<br><br>China smartly use modern technologies from first world countries, studying it then use their local cheap labours n low currency to take advantage of the situation. Sometimes it's not fair, but this is how competitiveness works... It hurts developed countries which labours tend to be more expensive like Singapore, HK, U.S, Europe etc..<br><br>Anyway... i'm not sure about this, maybe just my feeling... but i feel companies still prefer Japan,Singapore and western countries for invention, product design n development while the rest of the process goes to most developing asian countries (China, indonesia,malaysia) that have cost advantages, so they can produce cheaper..  I think we won't know the prospects of manufacturing companies here in singapore... Currently they just need Singapore's engineers.. then manufacture in China.. which soon all the engineers can be substituted with China's...</div>
