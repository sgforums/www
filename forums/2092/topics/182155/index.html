It is not buying/selling volume per se as it only implies the price people are willing to buy/sell for the stock.<br><br>More people bidding at the bid price does not imply price will go up if they are not willing to hit the offer price and vice versa.<br><br>I can have 1,000,000 lots queuing to buy at $14 for DBS and 1 lot offered to sell at $14.10.  Price will not go up if "buyers" do not hit the offer.  It is only the willingness to buy at a higher price or sell at a lower price that moves the market and hence prices.  Not because there are more "buyers" than "sellers".<br><br>You are refering to "buyers" and "sellers" as those queueing to buy/sell in the market.  However, they have not bought or sold anything until someone hits the bid/offer.<br><br>But don't believe what I say.<br><br>You know I talk crap everyday in here.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div></blockquote>The basic idea here is this. For the price to go up, the power of buyers must outnumber the power of sellers. So yah, when excess buyers compete with the limited number of sellers(assuming a situation where there is bullish news), some of the buyers would offer a higher price. Why would people offer a higher price if there is less buyers around? Its a case of demand and supply.<br><br>But anyway, thanks for you contribution. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
