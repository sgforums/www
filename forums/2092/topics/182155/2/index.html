(at least for short term). (short term for this kinda thing means not more than 5 trading days).<br><br>This is the latest YHOO chart as of today, 17 March 2006.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, me again.....<br><br>Ya, TA works.....TA is basically just sentiments.....like when you see somebody hand shakes because he is afraid...... and then he runs away......that is a sentiment......next time you only need to watch his hands.....got shake anot.....if you see his hands shake again.....then you can predict that he will run.......Well, TA is same principle....TA is simply watching sentiment.....Same thing really......<br><br>As you see from charts above.....those are real applications on how TA works...<br><br>I understand some people are sceptical....because how can we see those black bars and then predict....such nonsense idea...sound like hype......but if you observe a guy with shaking hand always run away......and this happen again and again......you can then conclude the next time his hand shake, he will run....this is TA in essence....<br><br>But anyways,<br><br>Actually Im here to talk about Support and Resistance again. Please contribute and talk here also leh......<br><br>I have PM-ed shade343 as a courtesy and sought his permission. It was graciously granted. (He's the one who opened this thread).

You know already.<br><br>Just that if I were to draw, I would draw it up a little, at $29 there. The $29 is a stronger Support level than the lower $28.6 - $28.7. Because at $29 we can see more action of the Support, more price bars hovered and bounced up at $29. The $28.6 - $28.7 line you draw is also a Support level, just a little bit more minor that's all.<br><br>In practice there are many lines we can draw in one chart, not just one single line. The line you draw is also one of the Support lines.<br><br>So, congrats! You now understand already. Simple right?</div>
