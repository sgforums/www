              <p>Monday recovery was due to the rescue package by IMF and EU, but Tuesday it loses all the gains because the rescue package does not answer or solve the fundamental questions. how can you throw more money in when you are already indebted. you become much more indebted as a result? go listen to Jim Rogers have to say on this indebtness. this is lehman brothers rewind from 2008.</p>

              <p>1) London Open very often goes against Frankfurt Open.....................no problem.............</p>

              <p>nowadays, it's almost by luck that you profit/loss...................even with good Price Action at Support/Resistance also like playing the roulette................LOL</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>***) seriously thinking of switching to individual stocks, seems to have better momentum but never try before..............FX has too much ranging periods and far too deep retracements (good for 2nd entry, bad for losing previous profits) but the killer part is it's mirroring of the Dow............</p>

              <p>Japan for quite some time has been a very inactive one.</p>
              <p>That is why you often see many traders dumping capital into JPY as many think of it as a safe haven(at least for a short while). Not volatile compared to the other currencies.</p>

              <p>I took the position on Monday because I expected the €uro to continue sliding for a couple more days. It was only when I realised that they came out with that package of €€€ then it went up like a top.</p>

              <p>the only one i personally will do with the JPY is the USD.</p>

              <p>why? coz i think €uro is more complicated than it seems.<br>for USD it is straightforward. either japan side or us side say something then it go up or down.</p>
