              <p>last year I read a retiree borrowed 3m from banks but use his two condo as mortagage, all pumped into capitamall when it was 96 cents if I remembered correctly. capitamall I think share price is now $1.90. I think this guy really earned a lot of dividends and if he sell now, he earned alot thru capital appreciation and can afford to pay off bank interests with spare cash to buy other shares.</p>

              <p>high inflation lor. very soon the FED is running out of options of keep printing money and money. if you print money, the value will drop/depreciate. it is said the next generation of americans are going to repay the money for these excesses. this century will belong to Asia, if you believe Jim Rogers. last century belonged to US and the previous one, Britain. Asia has done well compared to their american and european counterparts. Asia has learnt its lessons in 97 crisis, remember.</p>

              <p>i believe eagle more or less knows about FX. Just that FX is very intricate, even I don't know some parts of it(and thus I don't do those parts).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Spot forex is the way to go. Buy sell buy sell buy sell. best in these times where everything is so volatile. volatility is good for forex, but as said earlier, high risk, high gain(and also high potential of losses).</p>
