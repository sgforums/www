              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">12 March 2007</span> <br> <br> EVEN before he graduated from an Australian university, this Singapore engineering student earned $80,000 in a month. 
              <br> <br> Mr Chan (we are not giving his full name to protect his identity) did not have a job. 
              <br> <br> The 27-year-old was betting on the Singapore stock market, and managed
              to pick the shares whose prices rocketed in the recent bull run. <br> <br> Buoyed by the success, his father was convinced that his only son had a Midas touch<strong style="color: black; background-color: #ffff66;"></strong>.
              So, the 67-year-old former sailor, who runs a shop selling women's
              clothes in Chinatown, gave his son $300,000 - his whole life savings -
              to invest in shares. <br> <br> That was a couple of months ago. 
              <br> <br> Today, Mr Chan has not only lost all his father's savings, he has incurred another $320,000 in trading losses. 
              <br> <br> When the global market went through a sudden meltdown last week, so did his luck and fortune. 
              <br> <br> EVERYTHING BOMBED
              <br> <br> In just two days, Mr Chan chalked up a few hundred thousand dollars in
              losses when The Straits Times Index (STI) dived by 75.9 points on 27
              Feb and another 127.87 points (the steepest dive in 20 years) on 28
              Feb. <br> <br> He said: 'Everything bombed in just 48 hours. My life, my future... and now, even my parents could lose their home.' 
              <br> <br> In three short months of trading, Mr Chan has lost about $700,000. 
              <br> <br> Although the market has regained some of its earlier losses this week, the recovery means little to him. 
              <br> <br> Mr Chan was dabbling in high-risk contra trading, where you buy and
              sell the same shares within three days, putting up no money and earning
              the profits when share prices go up. But investors can lose money when
              the stock market is having a downturn, and they will have to pay the
              losses to their stockbrokers within days. <br> <br> Mr Chan bought heavily into popular counters such as DBS, UOB,
              Capitaland and even China stocks such as Longcheer Holdings, and hoped
              to sell them for a gain before the usual deadline. <br> <br> But as the market dipped suddenly and he could not afford to pay and
              keep all the shares, he had to make up for all the losses he incurred
              during his trading period. <br> <br> Even after exhausting his previous winnings, his father's savings, and
              loans from friends, he still owes two of his remisiers more than
              $200,000. <br> <br> To add to his woes, his girlfriend of eight years has also walked out
              on him, disappointed by how his gambling had cost him dearly. <br> <br> Most of his friends are also avoiding his calls or finding excuses not
              to meet him. Word has gone around that he is desperate for money
              because he has already borrowed some $70,000 from 20 of his friends. <br> <br> Mr Chan said: 'No one can blame them for avoiding me. Thankfully, I
              still have my parents on my side, otherwise I'd probably have gone
              insane.' <br> <br> To help him, his father is prepared to move to a smaller home if
              needed. While the family is scrambling to raise the money to clear the
              debt, Mr Chan admitted he had entertained thoughts of filing for
              bankruptcy. <br> <br> He said: 'I was told if I did that, it'd be tough for me to find a decent job.' 
              <br> <br> During the interview with The New Paper on Sunday, Mr Chan became
              rather agitated and restless when he related his problems. 'Look, it's
              fine if it's just me, but I've got to think of my parents,' he said. <br> <br> This is a far cry from October last year when he was preparing for his final-year examination in Perth. 
              <br> <br> At a group study session, one of his Singaporean classmates checked on
              his own trading account and shouted happily when he made a few thousand
              dollars. <br> <br> Mr Chan recalled: 'I was hooked from the minute he started talking about how easy it was to make a profit. 
              <br> <br> ''He encouraged me to do likewise and even suggested that I start off with contra trading since I didn't have much cash.' 
              <br> <br> Mr Chan then contacted a cousin, who had an online trading account in Singapore, and asked him to buy some shares he selected. 
              <br> <br> He said: 'I made $23,000 by the end of the first week and my friends started calling me Prince Midas. 
              <br> <br> 'I guess I sort of got carried away when I made another killing of
              about $30,000. I got bolder and by the time I stopped because of the
              exams, I was richer by $80,000.' <br> <br> Mr Chan returned to Singapore in early December after his examinations
              and shared the news with his father and 58-year-old mother. They were
              impressed with his 'windfall'. <br> <br> Still, he insisted that it was not the 'easy cash' but boredom that got him trading again. 
              <br> <br> He said: 'I wanted to take a break for a couple of months before
              looking for a job, so I was idling during the day when my parents and
              my girlfriend were at work. 'I was surfing the Internet when I decided
              to check out the SGX homepage. I randomly picked a few companies and
              the chart pattern I saw was definitely encouraging.' <br> <br> He started to monitor the shares, and role-played as if he had bought heavily into them. 
              <br> <br> When the STI closed on the first day, he had made an imaginary $100,000; on the second day, it was another $110,000 'win'. 
              <br> <br> 'I was, like, geez! If only I had dealt in real money. Then it occurred
              to me, maybe this is my calling. If I were good, I could afford to let
              my parents retire comfortably, have a lavish wedding, and upgrade my
              Honda Civic.' <br> <br> Over dinner that night, Mr Chan shared his plan with his parents and asked them if they would like to pool in their money. 
              <br> <br> He said: 'My father told me, no risk, no gain.' Two days later, the
              senior Mr Chan transferred $300,000, his whole life savings, to his
              son's bank account. <br> <br> Flushed with cash, Mr Chan was able to open trading accounts with three
              stockbroking firms. He was so focused on his new 'responsibility' that
              he 'ate, slept and breathed stocks'. <br> <br> From analysing companies' chart patterns to buying stocks after a fall, Mr Chan traded shares of up to six companies at one go. 
              <br> <br> 'I thought I was so smart to diversify... you know what they say, never put all your eggs into one basket,' he said. 
              <br> <br> But when he registered the first negative return, Mr Chan 'freaked out'. 
              <br> <br> 'I felt it should not have happened because people were making money.' 
              <br> <br> The $28,000 loss was just the beginning of his nightmare. He said: 'I
              lost control. I could not afford to lose the money. My family does not
              belong to the high-income strata.' <br> <br> His confidence level dipped further when he kept picking 'the bad eggs'. 
              <br> <br> As his stocks dipped further, he started to panic and began to ask his friends for loans. 
              <br> <br> To help him, his girlfriend applied for four bank overdraft facilities and even maxed the limit on five credit cards. 
              <br> <br> She was the only one who knew the true extent of his losses. 
              <br> <br> Mr Chan said: 'I couldn't tell my parents. But my girlfriend was there for me... until she could not take it anymore. 
              <br> <br> He covered his face for some seconds and said quietly: 'I've let her down. Really.' 
              <br> <br> In his bid to win his girlfriend and his money back, Mr Chan said he
              stopped trading for about two weeks, but continued to monitor the
              charts. <br> <br> Hoping to recover some of his earlier losses, he set his sight on the
              stocks of nine companies when the market re-opened after the Chinese
              New Year. <br> <br> But Mr Chan ended up suffering $100,000 in paper losses and $220,000 in contra trading. 
              <br> <br> He said: 'I went in for the kill, only to find I could barely stay
              alive less than five trading days later. My loved ones may now have to
              'die together' with me.' <br> <br> He added: 'I don't even know if I have the money to return to the
              university for my convocation end of this month. I can't bring myself
              to think of what's next.'</span></p>

              <p>I don't think this is illegal, but I do trade for my dad too. So what I do is, when I buy on the EUR/USD pair, I sell the equivalent on my dad's account for the same pair.

              <p> </p>
              <p>This doesn't happen when I have that feeling that the currency pair is hopeless ala now when EUR/USD just sank to its lowest, same wif the CHF pair on the USD.</p>
              <p>For now I just buy. For sure it will go up. And that is using less than 25% of my general equity, so even if it went 100pips lower it wouldn't severly affect my trading portfolio(and needing to top-up).</p>

              <p>Your strategy sounds good. Well, as long as it works for you :)</p>
              <p>It's not illegal I think. There's a similar strategy being used for options trading as well, called straddling.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, I'm not the type to trade that much. I prefer to build up funds from active income and pump into dividends generating equities. Simply don't have the time to monitor any forex accounts. Don't think I make as much as you though, but for 2009, I managed to realised 9k worth of gains through dividends and capital appreciation... Not sure how to talk about principal capital, because I pump in my savings every month if there's value and reasons in doing so.</p>
              <p>So far for 2010, it wasn't very bad. I managed to realised 2k+ from a stock that my reason for buying does not stand anymore. My expected dividends this year is another 6k+... so more or less for 2010 is confirmed near 8k to 9k gain also... excludes any unrealised capital gains...</p>

              <p>My advise to babel is that, if you don't want to go thru the long procedure of setting up a forex acct and having to monitor it, just go to your moneychanger to buy EUR/CHF now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Spend about $1800 and you should get around 940Euros. That was the rate which I got just recently. I do this for cold, hard cash so that I have actual value in my hands. This also helps coz I'm going to Europe soon and the EUR is damn low now haha!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Swiss Franc is something like 1.359 the last I checked. SGD$135 should get you about 100Francs at moneychangers.</p>

              <p>If you have that amount of capital, I recommend you trade instead of leaving your cash in the bank. Do note that inflation is around 3 to 5% yearly, and 1.25% will not allow you to recoup that "loss" even after years. Putting your money in the bank is not always as good as what you think, especially in Singapore where the interest rates are lower than the inflation rates.</p>

              <p>Good advice on starting. My cousin does this with few hundred bucks instead of 1k.</p>
              <p>Lowest risk on forex plays...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alternatively, you can always put into foreign currency fixed D (min 5k) in our local banks. But I have never tried it... So far, my dividend investing strategy has been working ok for me... I think at my rate, should be able to achieve 2k plus average monthly before 30 in dividend income....</p>

              <p>or simply buy Nzd/Usd when it's really low since each pip worth
              more and better positive swap plus not so volatile as Aud/Usd.</p>
              <p>any good lobangs to share ?</p>

              <p>As I have said, I am willing to take such risk and also, I am that kind of person who is willing to hold my position for longterm gains.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DJ is expected to go down, but the EUR will go up(longterm), together with the Swiss Franc(the reason why it suddenly plunged was prolly because Libya pulled out investments and assets from Switzerland due to a dispute).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know Greece is just the tip of the iceberg, but should the other governments rake in spending and also cut public debt slowly their economies will reflect positive results.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Portugal is making small steps and also Spain is taking its move to cut debt seriously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to my plotted graphs and charts the EUR/USD will not plunge to 1.25, at the most 1.28. It shouldn't be that bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, I have my plans.</p>

              <p>the only people making money from robots are those selling them................the markets are very different from year to year plus it's too dynamic for a robot to work.............example - prices now move several times quicker than just a few years ago and respond too much to Dow...........</p>
