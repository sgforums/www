Finally I am only offered suggestion, good or not is up to your to judge and decide. Cheer!</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well , another latest news for inexpensive forex training.Just recently, a new school/company name Asia Investors and Traders Institute was opened not long ago(about 1 month from March 2009) in Park Mall and they offered forex training at affordable price of $700.Their lesson will be conduct about 1 month, every Monday to Friday from 7 p.m to 10p.m? If you want to find out more, kindly visit this blog : <a href="http://sgtradeforaliving.blogspot.com/">http://sgtradeforaliving.blogspot.com/</a> . (From this blog you can already see that they are sharing strategy instead of how famous they are or some marketing suspense compared to "other" training school) But they mention to me that their course price might change in future if their school's property or other "expense" increase or unless they can get government support or subsidy like WDA for instance so don't said I don't warn your.</p></div>

              <p>Actually regarding whether the Forex course cost $100 or $1000 range, there is still a chance that we will loss money.The reason is not because their manual "trading law", forecasting Oscillator like Stochastic, MACD, trend pattern study etc is no good but because it is an open secret that it is our broker that might have played or trade  against us.if you lose, they pocket your money; if you win, you pocket their money. This is why broker will do all they can to give you the worse conditions such that you dont make money.Why? It is broker's interest to pass as little on to the global market as possible. It costs them more to do this and is far more profitable to take your losses.</p>
              <p>One example would be the stop loss function, everyone would agreed that without this important function, it would be like a car without brake and you can will lose all your investment.However because your broker has access to all of their clients orders, including stop losses, they can have a clear reference and picture on how much they need in order to "gun" you down.</p>
              <p>Secondly example is just as same as above, just like they can access to your order, they can also monitored the volume of the forex market, therefore they can judge the number of buyer and seller and make accurate decision based on that, so don't be surprised when you find that a support pattern is formed (we don't know if the volume of buyer are little or more)is formed, a few second later, to your alarm, it become an resistance or breakdown.</p>
              <p>You want to know more, check this link : <a href="http://daytrading.about.com/od/currencies/a/RetailForexBrok.htm">http://daytrading.about.com/od/currencies/a/RetailForexBrok.htm</a> , anyway if your still want to enrolled in these forex course, be sure to bring this topic up and if they don't have an sureproof solution to solve this problem, forget the training and save your money.(you know that you are already in an disadvantage based on above point)In fact if they are really effective, the only way to tell is that most broker probably would not engaged any order or service with these "guru".</p>
