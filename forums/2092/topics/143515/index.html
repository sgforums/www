The job market is improving, retail sales are picking up, business investment is firming and inflation is fairly tame, he noted.<br><br>"Our baseline outlook for the U.S. economy is one of sustained economic growth and contained inflation pressures. In our view, realizing this outcome will require the Federal Reserve to continue to remove monetary accommodation," he said, referring to further interest rates increases.<br><br>The Fed has pushed a key interest rate to 3.25 percent in nine modest, quarter-point moves. Before the Fed embarked on its credit tightening, that key rate stood at 1 percent, a 46-year low. Economists viewed Greenspan's comments as cementing another quarter-point increase at the Fed's next meeting, Aug. 9. Some believe the key rate could climb as high as 4.25 percent by the end of this year.<br><br>Greenspan is delivering his final midyear economic outlook to Congress this week. At the helm of the Fed for 18 years, Greenspan is expected to step down next year.<br>... </blockquote>For full story, see :<br><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/050720/greenspan.html?.v=26" rel="nofollow">http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/050720/greenspan.html?.v=26</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is an open secret that interest rate will have to move up because of inflation. The only question here is increase by how much? 1/4pt maybe?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah.. in one of the paragraphs above..<br><br><blockquote>Economists viewed Greenspan's comments as cementing another quarter-point increase at the Fed's next meeting, Aug. 9. Some believe the key rate could climb as high as 4.25 percent by the end of this year.</blockquote>But on the backdrop of rising oil prices, which is already creating a dampaner on the ecy, I doubt if it will really climb to 4.25 by year end.. unless oil prices fall drastically..<br><br>Does sg's banks has a history of following US interest rate? anyone knows?<br>and how close is the correlation?</div>
