Buying shares from a broker is much more expensive than buying it from an internet platform. The older generation would probably prefer to trade shares through a broker. The younger generation prefers to trade shares online.<br><br>There are pros and cons for both systems. But the trend is moving towards trading shares using an internet platform.<br><br>2)Well, its difficult to define what is "normally". How many shares each person buy is up to the individual. If you are bullish about a certain stock, you buy more of it. If you are not too confident, you either buy less or dont buy at all. The amount you buy is also limited to the size of your pocket.<br><br>3)1 lot normally means 1000 for most counters. However, there are some counters that are traded in lots of 50, 500 and 100. This is because the price of that counter is very high.<br><br>4) Lets say you want to buy 2 lots of SMRT shares at $1 per share. 1 lot of SMRT consist of 1000 shares.<br><br>COST<br><br>2000 x $1 = $2000<br><br>Broker's Fees: $25<br><br>Total= $2025<br><br></div>

So far no problems except that some of their Listed Company Data is outdated. Phillips isnt the cheapest in terms of broking charges. But they have a stable online trading platform. I think eq.com.sg is the cheapest. They give Linkpoint rebates also.<br><br></div>
