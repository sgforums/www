              <p>I find that most people today tend to think only about wealth accumulation.</p>

              <p>However, all of that can be wiped out if you forget about your healthcare.</p>

              <p>Yes, I am a Financial Services Consultant. However my job is not to sell, it is to advise. Healthcare is one of the most important things that anyone needs, yet it is not something that planners choose to use in their opening scripts. Prior to this job I was approached about life and savings plans...but not healthcare. Hence, I am hoping to find out more about what people think so I can shift the focus toward it.</p>

              <p>I personally enjoy keeping fit, but even so, there are concerns that you cannot forsee. No one plans to get a massive leg gash from simply sitting on the couch (which did happen due to a sharp glass coffee table edge) and no one plans on catching one of the dread diseases. These things simply happen due to random factors and for that reason, I think it is still worthwhile to invest in healthcare.</p>
              <p>After all, my biggest investment is myself right? Unless you don't believe in yourself (T3T)</p>

              <p>I only know that the AIA company in Singapore almost went bust because their holding, AIG was badly affected by the Lehman Brothers crash and a lot of policy holders was queuing to withdraw their plan until MAS assured them it is still 'safe'. Therefore the only health policy I trust is government's medical subsidies like medishield if you want to know what kind of 'investment' I trusted.</p>

              <p>Well actually, AIA was never bust. It was a misconception since it was their parent AiG which had money troubles. They sold off AIA in order to recover their capital. That is why we are now completely stand-alone.<br><br>Government medishield is great, but I recommend you read this article:<br><br><a href="http://the-truth-about-insurance.blogspot.sg/p/medishield-life-private-shield-plan.html">http://the-truth-about-insurance.blogspot.sg/p/medishield-life-private-shield-plan.html</a></p>
              <p>Medishield is not enough if you wish to receive the best healthcare treatment. Which is often what most people want to have when they are ill. You want to be well again quickly.</p>
              <p>Of course, if you do not trust AIA, there are other insurers out there. I would be very worried if you were only on government medishield, it is rarely enough.</p>
