            <div class='col-md body'>I think dats possible only if ur fren had purchased the commercial properties at all-time low, maybe in 1998 or smthg. Besides, i think the commercial properties should be in prime district in order to garner that kind of returns, which is above the norm of 3-5 % like someone mentioned.<br><br>Anyway,10% return per annum is not THAT impressive, u can get better returns from the stock market.

I suggest you onvest in something with higher yields like companies with small market capitalisation or REITs and Funds that gives a 5-6% annualised yield.</div>
