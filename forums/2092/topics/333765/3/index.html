              into stock markets, from the investment gains, they deduct off

              <p>Possibly, yes. But again it all depends on your needs and what you are looking for. Ok let's say you are looking to do the shield+term plan option. Your term policy will cost you possibly $30-$60 thereabouts + whatever your shield plan costs you. (Btw, AIA has some very good shield plans payable by medisave, you should check them out.) that will cover you for about $100k-$300k (dependent on insurance company and plan).</p>
              <p>This option will give you comprehensive coverage, but may not result in a lower premium. Money from medisave, though intangible, is your money after all.</p>
              <p>Most term plans will only cover u until age 65. The only term plan i know that covers you for life is UOBLife's. But that option is going to cost you about $70 p/mth for 100k coverage, and it only protects against death.</p>
              <p>If you are really concerned about comprehensive life protection, may i suggest you buy a limited pay life protection policy. I must forewarn that this option is quite expensive. About 4k per year ($330/mth). However you only pay for a limited time (usually 10-15yrs), and it covers you for life with very good coverage. Plus side is your coverage grows as you grow older, you get cashback, and you only pay premiums for a limited time. Downside is it can be quite painful financially ($330/mth). But if you are looking to save money and  get comprehensive protection for life, i will strongly recommend this option.</p>

              <p><br>it's risk diversification, but then again during your younger years the probability of occurence is lower, that's why it's always cost more to get insured when one is older.</p>
              <p>if a person is high risk group, they also don't want to insure you, all in all, they want to make money from you rather than lose money.</p>

              <p>yes but what is the point of covering yourself only until age 65 ? chances are that if anything is going to happen to you, it will happen after you r 65, not now.</p>

              <p>i see your concern. u want something temporary but covers you for now. today u are single, earn a meagre salary, and probably have no liabilities. a few years from now you will probably be married, earning more, but have alot more liabilities in the form of kids/loans/(this list can go on forever). when then is a good time?</p>
