              <p>May i recommend that for the next few years at least, you could consider a pure savings plan without insurance coverage. Do a RSP ( regular savings plan) with either POEMS, Finatiq, FundSupermart, or Dollardex. Invest your money into a unit trust regularly for the next 5 years thereabouts.</p>
              <p>Why? Because stocks are cheap now and should get cheaper over the next few years. By investing in a unit trust u maximise your returns by diversifying your portfolio and buying into a range of stocks. Cash out in a few years ( maybe 5?) and you should have a small lump sum at least.</p>
              <p><br>In the meantime to protect yourself from any castrophes u might want to buy a term insurance policy. Assuming you are healthy and have no illnesses, and assuming you are below 25, your premiums should not cross $20 a month for $100000 coverage.</p>
              <p>After 5 years you may want to buy an investment linked policy.</p>

              <p>Assuming u r a non-smoker with no major health liabilities, term insurance coverage for $100k to $300k will cost about $20-$30 a month. Some of the term insurance policies i like are Manulife's and UOBLife's. UOBLife's term insurance policy offers lifetime coverage at a fixed amount- about $60 p/mth for $100k coverage. ( Most term insurance policies only cover you until you are 65 and in my opinion, your major concern will be after 65). Although i recommended you keep it for only 5 years you may decide that $20 - $60/mth is a small price to pay for keeping yourself protected.</p>
              <p>As for the RSP (regular savings plan), min investment will be $100 a month. Do note that investments are not risk free and there is a chance that you might not make, or even lose money. That being said i think the reward outstrips the risk, esp this period in time. These websites will be of more help to you.</p>

              <p>one more thing, if you die die can only afford $100/mth u may want to consider an investment linked policy with any insurance company/bank. ILPs typically offer you both insurance coverage and investment for as low as $100/mth.</p>

              <p>A term plan is an insurance policy that covers you in the event of death. You may opt to include critical illness cover e.g. major cancers, heart problems etc. at a premium. Usually the coverage for a term plan starts from 100k up. This means that in the event that something happens to you, the insurance company will pay out the amount you are insured for.</p>
              <p>The good thing about term plans is they are usually very cheap. They cost less than $50 a month (dependent on age) and they cover a very high sum (100k and up). They are therefore a very affordable option if you decide you don't want to spend too much on insuance but you want cheap cover.</p>
              <p>The disadvantages? Term plans do not have cash value in them, meaning if nothing happens to you, you don't get paid. They are usually considered pay and forget plans, where you pay and forget about the money. They also (usually) cover you until age 65-66, depeding on insurance company.</p>
              <p>Your NTUC life policy probably is an endowment policy. I would need to see the details before i can tell you more, but as a good gauge, if you're paying around $100 a month, there's a good chance that you are covered for about $50k. Your NTUC plan would also probably have cash value in it, meaning if you decide to terminate the plan you would get some money back.</p>

              <p>A term plan is an insurance policy that covers you in the event of death. You may opt to include critical illness cover e.g. major cancers, heart problems etc. at a premium. Usually the coverage for a term plan starts from 100k up. This means that in the event that something happens to you, the insurance company will pay out the amount you are insured for.</p>
              <p>The good thing about term plans is they are usually very cheap. They cost less than $50 a month (dependent on age) and they cover a very high sum (100k and up). They are therefore a very affordable option if you decide you don't want to spend too much on insuance but you want cheap cover.</p>
              <p>The disadvantages? Term plans do not have cash value in them, meaning if nothing happens to you, you don't get paid. They are usually considered pay and forget plans, where you pay and forget about the money. They also (usually) cover you until age 65-66, depeding on insurance company.</p>
              <p>Your NTUC life policy probably is an endowment policy. I would need to see the details before i can tell you more, but as a good gauge, if you're paying around $100 a month, there's a good chance that you are covered for about $50k. Your NTUC plan would also probably have cash value in it, meaning if you decide to terminate the plan you would get some money back.</p>

              <p>ok. i need to ask you first, why would you want to buy a term plan? r u looking for higher coverage? cheaper premiums?</p>
              <p>i can understand your desire to obtain the best value for money plan, but do not forget that there are tradeoffs in everything. in the case of a plain vanilla term policy coverage is high but not comprehensive. remember, you pay peanuts, you get monkey.</p>
              <p>if im not mistaken, if u terminate your ntuc policy now u will receive some cash value. as to how much i am not certain, you would have to check back on the policy details. i also think the coverage for your ntuc life policy is quite comprehensive as it would probably include protection against the 30 critical illnesses.</p>

              <p>Possibly, yes. But again it all depends on your needs and what you are looking for. Ok let's say you are looking to do the shield+term plan option. Your term policy will cost you possibly $30-$60 thereabouts + whatever your shield plan costs you. (Btw, AIA has some very good shield plans payable by medisave, you should check them out.) that will cover you for about $100k-$300k (dependent on insurance company and plan).</p>
              <p>This option will give you comprehensive coverage, but may not result in a lower premium. Money from medisave, though intangible, is your money after all.</p>
              <p>Most term plans will only cover u until age 65. The only term plan i know that covers you for life is UOBLife's. But that option is going to cost you about $70 p/mth for 100k coverage, and it only protects against death.</p>
              <p>If you are really concerned about comprehensive life protection, may i suggest you buy a limited pay life protection policy. I must forewarn that this option is quite expensive. About 4k per year ($330/mth). However you only pay for a limited time (usually 10-15yrs), and it covers you for life with very good coverage. Plus side is your coverage grows as you grow older, you get cashback, and you only pay premiums for a limited time. Downside is it can be quite painful financially ($330/mth). But if you are looking to save money and  get comprehensive protection for life, i will strongly recommend this option.</p>
