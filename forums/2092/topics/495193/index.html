              <p class="MsoNormal">You can,of course, become a consistent trader over the time but
                  it would not happen right away. Actually, even the Singaporeantraders did not become
                  traders right away they rather worked hard for it. They are consistent traders but
                  they did not achieve it in a day or two. So, you should understand that there
                  are many things that you can achieve but not too soon. You should accept the fact
                  that it will take some time to get what you want. It will take some time to achieve
                  the success in trading. People can accomplish many things but they should work for
                  it. You cannot sit back and wait for it to happen. Mostly naïve traders are not
                  consistent in trading which is a negative factor. You cannot become successful if
                  you are not consistent in what you are doing. You should understand the importance
                  of doing something continuously. If you want to get positive results in trading
                  you should understand that it might take some time andeffort. As amateur traders
                  are in need of some tips, we will mention a few powerful tips.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Mastering the art of trading is not so easy. You have to
                  educate yourself with the proper knowledge of trading. If you don’t devote
                  yourself chances are very high that you will lose a significant amount of money
                  in forex market. As a new trader, it’s better for you to seek help from the
                  professional traders at Saxo. Having a mentor from the very beginning is going
                  to change to your trading performance dramatically. You will have a clear
                  guideline to place trade in the market. However, always remember to trade this
                  market with managed risk. Never risk too much in any single trade since it will
                  ruin your trading capital. Always focus on the longer time frame data and try
                  to trade in favor of the market trend.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>You should keep an
                  eye on the overall process </strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Do you think it is enough if a trader knows the basics of
                  trading? Well, we don’t think that it would be enough if you know the basics. A
                  trader should keep an eye on the overall process of trading consistently
                  meaning he should not have breaks in between. If you are consistent in what you
                  are doing you can see the results easily. A trader’s consistent action is the responsibility
                  for the trading results. You are not responsible for the trading result but you
                  are responsible for how you trade. If Singaporean traders have managed a great Forex trading account Singapore it is because they have been focused on the way they perform not the result. They
                  have been consistentin trading so automatically they have received positive results.
                  As an amateur trader, you should understand that attention and energy are necessary
                  to become successful<a name="_GoBack"></a>. Even if you face an emotional
                  rollercoaster do not let it ruin your trading success.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>You should not hurt yourself </strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When you become disappointed in yourself it is the first failure
                  you face. You should not hurt yourself if you want to become a pro trader. No matter
                  what comes in your trading journey, you should not let any barriers to disappoint
                  you. You should be effective and confident when trading because your personality
                  affects a lot in trading. If you want to become a successful trader you should not
                  hurt yourself by over-trading and by being addictive to trading. Overall, you
                  should value yourself as an amateur trader.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Take baby steps to
                  success </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You cannot take huge steps in trading because it is not a short
                  distant destination it is rather a long distantdestination. If you want to become
                  a successful trader you should make sure to take baby steps towards the trading
                  goals. If you take baby steps it will not be difficult or overwhelming. If you follow
                  the short-term goals you can easily focus on the major goal. </p>
