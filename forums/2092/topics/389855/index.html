              <h1>Watchdog: Bailouts Created More Risk in System</h1>
              <div class="story_byline"><strong>By DANIEL WAGNER and ALAN ZIBEL AP Business Writers</strong><br><span>WASHINGTON  January 31, 2010 (AP)</span></div>
              <div class="story_byline"><br></div>
              <div class="story_byline"><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9709670">http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9709670</a></div>
              <div class="story_byline"><br></div>
              <div class="story_byline">The government's response to the financial meltdown has made it more
              likely the United States will face a deeper crisis in the future, an
              independent watchdog at the Treasury Department warned.</div>
              <div class="story_byline"><br></div>
              <div class="story_byline">
              <p>The problems that led to the last crisis have not yet been addressed,
              and in some cases have grown worse, says Neil Barofsky, the special
              inspector general for the trouble asset relief program, or TARP. The
              quarterly report to Congress was released Sunday.</p>
              <p>"Even if TARP saved our financial system from driving off a cliff back
              in 2008, absent meaningful reform, we are still driving on the same
              winding mountain road, but this time in a faster car," Barofsky wrote.</p>
              <p>Since Congress passed $700 billion financial bailout, the remaining
              institutions considered "too big to fail" have grown larger and failed
              to restrain the lavish pay for their executives, Barofsky wrote. He
              said the banks still have an incentive to take on risk because they
              know the government will save them rather than bring down the financial
              system.</p>
              <p>Barofsky also said his office is investigating 77 cases of possible
              criminal and civil fraud, including crimes of tax evasion, insider
              trading, mortgage lending and payment collection, false statements and
              public corruption.</p>

              </div>
              <p>One case concerns apparent self-dealing by one of the private fund
              managers Treasury picked to buy bad assets from banks at discounted
              prices. A portfolio manager at the firm apparently sold a bond out of a
              private fund, then repurchased it at a higher price for a
              government-backed fund. A rating agency had just downgraded the bond,
              so it likely was worth less, not more, when the government fund bought
              it. The company is not being named pending the outcome of Barofsky's
              investigation.</p>
              <p>Barofsky renewed a call for Treasury to enact clearer walls so that such apparent conflicts are less likely.</p>
              <p>Treasury said it welcomed Barofsky's oversight but resisted the call to
              erect new barriers against conflicts of interest. The new rules "would
              be detrimental to the program," Treasury spokeswoman Meg Reilly said in
              a statement. The existing compliance rules "are a rigorous and
              effective method of protecting taxpayers," she said.</p>
              <p>Much of Barofsky's report focused on the government's growing role in
              the housing market, which he said has increased the risk of another
              housing bubble.</p>
              <p>Over the past year, the federal government has spent hundreds of
              billions propping up the housing market. About 90 percent of home loans
              are backed by government controlled entities, mainly Fannie Mae,
              Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration.</p>
              <p>The Federal Reserve is spending $1.25 trillion to hold down mortgage
              rates, and millions of homeowners have refinanced at lower rates.</p>
              <p>"The government has stepped in where the private players have gone
              away," Barofsky said in an interview. "If we take government resources
              and replace that market without addressing the serious (underlying)
              concerns, there really is a risk of" artificially pushing up home
              prices in the coming years.</p>
              <p>The report warned that these supports mean the government "has done
              more than simply support the mortgage market, in many ways it has
              become the mortgage market, with the taxpayer shouldering the risk that
              had once been borne by the private investor."</p>
              <div class="story-embed-left box">
              adsonar_placementId=1280598;adsonar_pid=43750;adsonar_ps=-1;adsonar_zw=165;adsonar_zh=220;adsonar_jv='ads.adsonar.com';
              
              </div>
              <p>Barofsky's report echoed concerns raised by housing experts in recent
              months, as home sales and prices rebounded. They warn that the primary
              reason for the turnaround last year has been billions of dollars in
              federal spending to lower mortgage rates and prop up demand.</p>
              <p>Once that spigot of cash is turned off, they caution, the market will
              be vulnerable to a dramatic turn for the worse. Daniel Alpert, managing
              partner of investment bank Westwood Capital, wrote in a report that
              national home prices are bound to fall 8 to 10 percent below the lows
              of last spring.</p>
              <p>"The lion's share of the remaining decline will occur in markets that
              saw sizable bubbles but have not yet retrenched," he wrote.</p>
              <p>Officials from the Obama administration counter that massive federal
              intervention has helped the housing market stabilize and prevented more
              dire consequences.</p>
              <p>Barofsky's report also disclosed that, while the Obama administration
              has pledged to spend $75 billion to prevent foreclosures, only a tiny
              fraction — just over $15 million — has been spent so far. Under the
              Making Home Affordable program, only about 66,500 borrowers, or 7
              percent of those who signed up, had completed the process as of
              December.</p>

              </div>
              <p>He said the key to preventing future crises is to reform Fannie Mae and
              Freddie Mac, create and improve loan underwriting and supervision of
              banks. He stopped short of endorsing specific proposals for overhauling
              financial regulation, but said many of the proposals would go far to
              improving the system.</p>
