              <p>Really frustrated with this shareinvestor.com website</p>

              <p>does anyone here actually use that shit? by this Christopher person - the so called CEO of shareimvestor.com?</p>

              <p>maybe this dinosaur should really step down!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have worked in foreign lands, even indonesia. We have better and FREE websites in Indonesia.which is laughable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Made the mistake of going to the recent  INVESTFAIR by this idiotic company.It was suppose to be "prestigious" being held in Marina Bay Sands. can you believe the roads were blocked half the day. Nobody was able to drive in.</p>
              <p>The CEO from The Singapore Merchantile Exchange was stucked at the MRT and Had To WALK!!! all the way from the MRT to the Marina Bay Sands Convention Hall because the idiot organizer Shareinvestor.com screwed up the transport</p>
              <p>to make things worse. The SMX CEO was due to make a presentation. When he arrived he found the slides totally screwed up.</p>
              <p>What a joke. First class company by SPH indeed!!!</p>
              <p>There was some commotion at the end of the  fair, where Christopher was shouting and howling as well.</p>
              <p>what a bloody joke.</p>
              <p>The turn up rate at the InvestFair was dismayal.less than 50% of the expected crowd turn up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what a SCREWED UP organization this Shareinvestor.com</p>
              <p>A totally disappointing experience by anyone visiting the InvestFair</p>
              <p>as well as anyone participating </p>
              <p>at least the COMEX were more succesfull.</p>
              <p>I would totally encourage everyone to avoid any Investfair organized by Shareinvestor.com or  even Shareinvestor.com website as a whole</p>
              <p>Perhaps SPH should ask the CEO of Shareinvestor to step down!</p>
              <p>or should we expect more of the same in the future?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyone care to share their experiences at this Investfairs? It will certainly be the last one I attend in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Do you read Biz Daily, an online daily 
              publication?<br>Nice formatted soundbites of Biz-related info, in a 
              structured .PDF form. Free somemore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Suggest you 
              take a look. Their website is also pretty good.<br>Not like the mess 
              which is shareinvestors.com~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IMHO, Biz Daily is THE up 
              and coming Biz news publication to watch. Hearing from the Business community
               grapevine that they are upping their mantle on the editorial side and 
              etc. I'll post up one of the daily copies that I get from them.</p>
