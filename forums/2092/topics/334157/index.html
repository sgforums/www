              <p>Hi people</p>
              <p>Some banking people has persuaded my mum to buy some products and she signed the transactions. Best part is tat she kept it away from me.</p>
              <p>Now that there are banks and investment institutions collapsing, she sure is worried, and suddenly surrendered everything n show me.</p>
              <p>I am trained in software engineering, not finance reporting. So what ever she bought, I have no idea wat they are.</p>
              <p>Anyway any kind souls can help me with the following products:</p>
              <p>Allianz Global High Payout FD<br>Schroder Asian Bond<br>DBS Vitamin Account<br>OCBC 3.5 years SGD FX-Linked Structured Deposit.</p>
              <p>Any kind soul can explain them to me? Really need to settle for her as she keeps bothering me about them. Worried that they are linked to lehmans and such.</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>The first 2 looks like unit trusts to me. The other 2 are structured deposits with our local banks, as the name suggests.</p>
              <p>All you need to do now is to look for the agent, bank manager, financial adviser or underwriter whom your mum signed the products with. Their contact details will be found on their respective prospectus.</p>
              <p>Just give them a ring to allay your fears since your primary worry is whether their linked to Lehman. Heck, thats what you guys are paying them for anyway.</p>

              <p>Not only your parents.</p>
              <p>Last year I went to a bank with $11,000 to open an e-account. I was ushered to a fund manager, who talked me into putting $10,000 into unit trust, that was supposed to grow at 8 -9% pa. It is now worth only $4,800, shrink more than 50%. Sigh!!</p>
              <p>Now when I go to a bank, I tell myself, go for the intended purpose, nothing else, and get out. </p>

              <p>Allianz Global High Payout is a unit trust. It is not principal protected. And over the past couple of months, it hasn't been doing very well.</p>
              <p>Schroder Asian Bond is also a unit trust. It is doing ok, BUT the value of the fund is dropping. However it has been giving payouts equivalent to about 4% of investment per year.</p>
              <p>DBS Vitamin Account is a structured deposit. Structured deposits are 100% principal protected if held to maturity. So wost case scenario is your mum doesnt get any interest over the tenure but will still get her principal amount back. One thing not many people know is that if the bank collapses, structured deposits are not insured by the SDIC (government). The latest ruling by MAS (100% guarantee on all deposits) does not change this fact.</p>
              <p>OCBC 3.5 years SGD FX-Linked Structured Deposit - if im not mistaken, this particular structured deposit is quite new = last 3 months. There is a fixed component ( fixed interest payout) to it and it is also 100% principal protected when held to maturity. The same rules apply as per DBS Vitamin Account.</p>

              <p>one more thing, one thing i don't like abt structured deposits are that they lock u in for a certain tenure. For e.g. OCBC's 3.5 yr FX Linked structured deposit locks u in for 3.5 years. NOTE : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there are very high early redemption charges ( early withdrawal charges) !!</span></p>
              <p>so structured deposits are good for people who know that they wont need this $$$ for a extended period of time.</p>

              <p>I have no issues with what they want to invest, but I am damn mad and pissed that they don't listen to advice or just jump into any investments without considering the fact that they will ask their offsprings for help later on.</p>
              <p>They like to invest, and maybe hao lian to their relatives/friends later on. If lose money then keep quiet.</p>
              <p>Anyway I will be monitoring the 2 funds for now. Have to see how they perform and advice my mum later.</p>
