              <p>Cashflow is important, as I have written earlier <a href="http://wealthbuch.blogspot.com/2009/04/importance-of-cash-flow.html">here</a>.<br><br>One
              of the ways to improve your cashflow is through dividend investing.
              Passive dividend investing can help build a form of passive income. Not
              only does it improve your cashflow, it also puts money into your
              pocket, and you do not need to do much to maintain it.<br><br>Some of
              my friends asked me, why invest so passively for dividends when one can
              do short term guerilla trading, entering and exiting the market in a
              short period of time and earn a lot.<br><br>To me, <span class="postbody">whether
              a market goes up and down is mostly due to traders. Some will lose,
              some will gain. But mathematically, logically and theoretically, the
              overall gain of traders is equal to the overall gain of passive
              investors.<br><br>Why is it so? It is because trading is a zero sum
              game, so on average, some the traders would have gains more than the
              passive investors, and some would have gains less than the passive
              investors. </span><span class="postbody">The total gains of all
              winning trades minus the sum of all losing trades would be equal to the
              total gains (or loss) of the market. In addition, the gains of an
              average trader would be the same as that of the market.<br><br>The
              gains of passive investors, however, follow the market, excluding
              brokerage fees, and minus the effort and energy used to identify stocks
              in which to execute trades.</span><br><br><span class="postbody">So, if
              we think we are average, or below average, isn't it simpler to just
              invest passively? Isn't it simpler to buy and keep stocks for the long
              term?<br><br>Why dividend investing?<br><br>Dividend investing works
              well for many investors. Dividend investing in defensive sectors will
              continue to provide a steady stream of income â€“ income that can be
              counted on whether the market moves up or down. This stream of passive
              income provides cash which can be used or reinvested. Reinvesting the
              dividends will help the overall investment grow at a compounded rate
              (excluding brokerage fees). Adding to the fact that stock values
              traditionally increase over time, the new shares that are continually
              bought with received dividends will also increase, and at the same
              time, increasing the amount of dividends received.<br><br>Most dividend
              stocks (bank stocks are an exception) are also usually not as volatile.
              And because for defensive sectors, where dividends-payable are usually
              stable, investors face lesser risks. This is especially important and
              useful in a bear or sideways market, where investors will find it hard
              to count on capital gains to give them the returns they need. Dividend
              paying stocks also work well in both bear and bull market cycles.
              During a bear market, dividends provide a return on investment when
              gains from price appreciation are almost non-existent. During a bull
              market, dividends provide additional returns on top of capital gains.<br><br>Finally,
              for the Straits Times Index, it traditionally gains 7% compounded per
              annum. Yet in a bear market as of now, there are many a defensive
              dividend stock that yield 10% per annum. With dividend reinvestments,
              that will yield 10% compounded per annum. And all these are excluding
              possible capital appreciation!<br><br>Sadly, in a bull market with fast
              and furious price increases to seduce investors, many forget about the
              consistent returns and safety of the such stocks. History has proven
              the benefits of dividend stocks in almost any market condition. And
              with dividend reinvestments, one can generally expect increasingly
              greater dividend income.</span></p>
