            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's Chartered Semiconductor raises Q4 profit forecasts<br><br>SINGAPORE : Singapore contract chip maker Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing (CSM) on Friday raised its profit forecast by six million US dollars for the fourth quarter due to better-than-expected orders.<br><br>The revised forecast means profit in the December quarter will likely be 11-21 million dollars, up from the previous estimates of 5-15 million dollars, the world's third biggest contract chip maker said in a statement.<br><br>For the fourth quarter, Chartered now expects revenues of 363-371 million dollars, up from the previous forecast of 355-363 million dollars.<br><br>"Consistent with higher revenues, our fourth quarter net profit is now expected to be approximately six million dollars higher than the mid-point of the range previously guided," chief financial officer George Thomas said.<br><br>Analysts said the company's revenues were boosted by strong sales of Microsoft's Xbox 360, the latest game console from the US software giant. Chartered is one of two chip suppliers for the game console.<br><br>"We believe CSM's optimism for its fourth quarter is largely premised on the production ramp up of Xbox 360 CPUs (central processing chips)," OCBC Securities said in a note to clients.<br><br>"Following the launch on November 22 in the US, Microsoft's latest game console was wildly popular and was sold out quickly at most US stores shortly after its debut," it said.<br><br>The profit upgrade boosted Chartered's shares, which were up one cent at 1.34 Singapore dollars by mid-morning. - AFP /ct<br><br></div>

I think any other manufacturing company would have thought seagate was nuts and done the reverse even I was puzzled, retrenching when business was hot? They should be recruiting.<br><br>But as we all see 1-2yrs later the fallout up to today, I guess they were positioning themselves, lowering their manpower overheads in advance for such a likelihood.
