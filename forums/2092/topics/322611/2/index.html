              <p>Maybe you can go thru what have been posted to have ideas on what you might be interested.</p>
              <p>You can even go to the safe level of those saving fund, where every month you put in a sum of money. The interest rate is higher. Or bank fund/ deposit/ performnance fund/ investment fund. Or whar are stated in the previous posts.</p>

              <p>the era is now in commodities and agriculture.. you buy silver or gold and hold 1 year can almost be said confirmed go up..</p>
              <p>for the time being better perhaps you invest in commodity and agriculture sector.. buy futures contract on commodities that are dropped and still have lots of upside room</p>
              <p>wine investment rather ok, can get 10~15% in 4 years holding</p>
              <p>landbanking is just aint so good, you cant reap returns unless you sell your plots which may mean 15-20 years..</p>
              <p>shares bonds unit trust are taking heavy beating now... depends on how people see them, it is a no brainer... either you invest now and leave it for 2 3 years or just avoid it outright and wait till bull run cycle comes back in 4 year or so..</p>

              <p><br>For landbanking, you can sell when you need to, they have resale market for it. Of course, if you want max returns, it will be when the plot of land are sold. It can be 5-15 years depending which one. So you have to check it out when understanding each individual project and area.</p>
              <p>In terms of commodities, gold and oil will be going up despite being high. There are others that are not moving so fast, but their prices are moving up.  </p>
              <p>I will suggest to place it as long term (1-3 years) if you want to see substantial returns. But investing in commodities will mean that you have to check regularly, as no one can predict accurately and anything might affect its price going up and dwn.</p>

              <p>Maybe i can share my opinion in investment</p>
              <p>Market is still under inflation, economy wont recover that soon...</p>
              <p>There are many form of investment but to newbie investor i believe is like how you first time bet on soccer at Spool, u got to try bcos the ball is round you wont know you win or you lose. But as long as you try a few times you know your game better...</p>
              <p>Same as doing investment see which one suits your budget and your cup of tea. You got to try it, in this world there is no guaranteed investment if there is, share with me i park mine there...</p>
              <p>Just an advise from me, try learn an investment that you can control like physical assets.</p>
              <p>property or wine investment.</p>
              <p>Or else if you are those big risk taker, then try your luck in Stocks</p>
              <p>You no need to be an expert to learn in many form of investment, you need to know a good advisor/broker.</p>
              <p>I make money , you make money , everyone's happy!</p>

              <p>I've made several investments so far, for anyone who is interested:</p>
              <p>1) Foreign currency fixed deposit.</p>
              <p>2) Regional equity unit trust with low sales charge (2%).</p>
              <p>3) Low interest-bearing savings account (negligible).</p>
              <p>4) Awaiting Anwar Ibrahim's takeover of Malaysia and the subsequent stock market crash for stock-shopping opportunities! Fat hope though...</p>

              <p><br>Hi Darkensun,</p>
              <p>I'm impressed that you are actively looking at your finances at this age. Starting early would definitely give you a good headstart compared to your peers who haven't done so.</p>
              <p>When you mention you have steady income of $100-$200 per month, have you already factored in your expenses?</p>
              <p>If this $100-$200 is your monthly surplus, you should consider what you want to do with this money, depending on what are your financial goals in life. It also depends on your risk profile.</p>
              <p>If you are really keen to know more, I can meet up with you to share more.</p>
