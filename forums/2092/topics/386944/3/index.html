              <p>there will be a correction later on, but dun think the correction will be as  severe as the credit crisis last year. where have you seen DBS dropped from 20 - 6 plus one, then slowly risen to 15 plus. this type of event only happened once in a lifetime. I remembered CMT price in 2007 was 3 plus, now is 1.82 plus.</p>

              <p>now you buy still lower price than in 2007. capitaland 4 plus, CMT also not bad 1.82, starhub 2 plus, SPH 3 plus, OCBC almost 9 etc.</p>

              <p>I'm not so confident as you, although I'm still holding on to my longer term positions.</p>
              <p>First, you have to take into account Capland's rights issue, and splitting up assets to CapMallAsia.</p>
              <p>2nd, we are indeed approaching an interim top, where a multi-month correction should begin. The question is when. I have not been going into longer term positions for quite a while, just short to mid term ones... STI 2968 (61.8% fibo) is a significant level to watch out for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My dividend amount is about 6k per year... Waiting to liquidate some of my trading positions, hold on, and then latch in again, perhaps leveraging a little with DBS Share financing using my own portfolio as collateral...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--President Barack Obama's proposal to rein in
              banks contains a number of provisions that could have a serious impact
              on the private equity arms of banks, as well as the private equity
              industry overall, depending on how the vague outlines unveiled Thursday
              are filled in.</p>
              <p>Obama said in his remarks on the proposal that "banks will no
              longer be allowed to own, invest in or sponsor hedge funds,
              private-equity funds or proprietary trading operations for their own
              profit, unrelated to serving their customers."</p>
              <p>Some say the clause at the end of that statement about serving
              customers may provide a loophole, as most banks would argue that their
              PE investments do just that. But the proposal nonetheless could mean
              any private equity or venture capital firm run by a bank would need to
              spin out on its own or wind down.</p>
              <p>The number of such firms has decreased in recent years, as many
              banks have spun out their merchant banking operations, but there are
              still a number of financial institutions with significant private
              equity operations.</p>
              <p>The most notable is Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which has some
              $145 billion in alternative assets under management as of Sept. 30.
              Goldman Sachs runs some of the biggest private equity funds around,
              including the $20.3 billion GS Capital Partners VI and the $13 billion
              GS Mezzanine Partners V. The bank has been a big investor in its own
              funds, with close to half of the capital in its sixth main fund, for
              instance, coming from the parent company and its employees.</p>
              <p>Many market participants believe Goldman Sachs will be the hardest
              hit by the proposal as it is currently phrased. "[The proposal] is a
              big deal," said a senior executive at one bulge-bracket firm. "It hurts
              Goldman Sachs the worst because of its reliance on proprietary
              trading."</p>
              <p>During a conference call with analysts Thursday, Goldman Sachs
              Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the firm's private-equity
              business is "important" and "very integrated" with the rest of its
              businesses. "There are a lot of our very important clients invested in
              our private-equity business," he said, according to a transcript. "We
              invest alongside other clients of the firm, and we invest in clients to
              help them grow."</p>
              <p>But Goldman Sachs is far from the only bank that might be impacted.
              The fate of Morgan Stanley's (MS) direct buyout arm, for instance, is
              up in the air. That unit is still trying to raise a multi-billion
              dollar fund, which held a first closing on around $2.5 billion in 2008.
              A person familiar with the matter said the fund is still open, though
              it isn't clear how much capital it has collected. Morgan Stanley also
              has a fund of hedge funds business, with about $16 billion in asset
              under management. It owns stakes in several hedge fund managers,
              including Avenue Capital Group, and has real estate investments and a
              small proprietary trading desk.</p>
              <p>The co-heads of Morgan Stanley Private Equity, Stephen Trevor and Alan Jones, weren't available for comment.</p>
              <p>J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), which spun out its larger buyout
              arm a few years ago, retains a smaller buyout unit, One Equity
              Partners. A person familiar with the situation said One Equity would
              have to be divested, while the bank's asset-management business, which
              manages assets on behalf of third-party clients, probably wouldn't be
              affected. Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for One Equity, wasn't available
              for comment.</p>
              <p>It isn't clear what will happen to Merrill Lynch, now part of Bank
              of America Corp. (BAC), or to a multi-billion-dollar private equity
              fund that it may or may not still be trying to raise. The fund
              originally had a target of $6 billion, with roughly half of the money
              to come from Merrill Lynch itself.</p>
              <p>Other banks with private equity operations include Citigroup Inc.
              (C), which owns Metalmark Capital; Credit Suisse Group's (CS) DLJ
              Merchant Banking Partners, and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (WFC), which is
              the sole or main LP in a number of funds carrying the Norwest name. A
              spokeswoman for Citigroup declined to comment, while spokespersons for
              Bank of America, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo weren't available for
              comment.</p>
              <p>More broadly, the proposal as worded could shut down banks' capital
              commitments to any private equity firms--not just their own PE
              arms--making fund-raising harder for many in the industry.</p>
              <p>Banks aren't huge investors in private equity funds--in 2008 they
              accounted for only 10.3% of overall U.S. fund-raising, according to the
              Private Equity Analyst Sources of Capital survey, and that percentage
              likely declined in 2009 as banks tend to pull back from PE during down
              periods. But in what is already a tough fund-raising environment, their
              removal from the capital pool wouldn't help, especially for the few
              firms that still do count banks as big investors.</p>
              <p>"If banks can't invest--if insurance companies can't also--if
              endowments and pension funds have less money to put to work, it's going
              to be difficult to raise money for funds," said Antoine Drean, chairman
              of placement agent Triago.</p>
              <p>Depending on how the administration's proposal is enacted, it could
              also force banks to sell existing fund stakes on the secondary market.
              If this were to happen en masse, it could result in a real logjam on
              the secondary market and major headaches for firms that count banks
              among their LPs. That has secondary firms salivating already.</p>
              <p>"The regulations may cause some wholesale spinoffs," said Kelly
              DePonte, a partner at placement agent Probitas Partners. "This is good
              news for the secondary market as attractive partnerships will be
              offloaded."</p>
              <p>However, one key legislator acknowledged the problems with that
              scenario, as House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank
              (D., Mass.) said in an interview on CNBC that any banking curbs should
              be implemented over a longer time frame of three to five years. "To
              order this to be all done all at once, it would be a fire sale and I
              would be opposed to that happening," he told CNBC.</p>
              <p>In the end, industry participants said it is difficult to tell from
              Obama's brief statement just what the administration's proposals will
              look like in more fleshed-out form. They also don't know how the
              proposals might change as they make their way through Congress.</p>
              <p>One guidepost might be similar proposals on Securities and Exchange
              Commission registration. When the administration originally proposed
              SEC registration in early 2009, it was intended to apply to all private
              equity, venture capital and hedge funds, but after heavy lobbying by
              the National Venture Capital Association, the version of legislation
              that eventually made it through the House of Representatives omitted
              venture funds from registration. And the version still pending in the
              Senate omits both venture and private equity funds.</p>
              <p>Whatever happens, those affected in the private equity industry are
              hoping for more clarity soon, as they say the uncertainty this proposal
              has created--like others from this administration on topics like
              health-care reform--makes it difficult to go about their daily lives.</p>
              <p>"These are prognostications that aren't actionable," said one
              executive at a private equity firm that used to be part of a bank.</p>
