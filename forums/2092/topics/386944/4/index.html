              <p>Technical wise, STI has reversed. As we are near a more mini fibo level, a rebound is expected soon, but to break the previous high of 2947 will be extremely tough... In fact, 2900 might probably be too touch a nut to crack...</p>
              <p>Today isn't the herd mentality. STI's technicals has already shown warning signs, which is the reason why my remaining funds went to the more defensive Singtel instead of any higher beta stocks. It's not a big deal, but it provides a good reason to leverage on and sell down. Whipsawing, chainsawing, massacre of bulls who are weak will occur. Contras and kancheong bulls will be decimated.</p>
              <p>Also, insider news that a extremely large fund is pulling out of Asia. More to come I suppose. But before that, the evil fun managers will push up prices artificially to make the herd believe that the rally has returned and is still intact..... so that they can offload at higher prices to you...</p>

              <p>Technical wise, STI has reversed. As we are near a more mini
              fibo level, a rebound is expected soon, but to break the previous
              high of 2947 will be extremely tough... In fact, 2900 might
              probably be too touch a nut to crack...</p>
              <p>Today isn't the herd mentality. STI's technicals has already
              shown warning signs, which is the reason why my remaining funds
              went to the more defensive Singtel instead of any higher beta
              stocks. It's not a big deal, but it provides a good reason to
              leverage on and sell down. Whipsawing, chainsawing, massacre of
              bulls who are weak will occur. Contras and kancheong bulls will be
              decimated.</p>
              <p>Also, insider news that a extremely large fund is pulling out of
              Asia. More to come I suppose. But before that, the evil fun
              managers will push up prices artificially to make the herd believe
              that the rally has returned and is still intact..... so that they
              can offload at higher prices to you...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gone case stocks which I have mentioned in another forum:
              Yanlord, Genting. Noble appears to be gone case as well, after
              breaking a year long trendline support</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good if any one understands what I just said.</p>

              <p>no need all that bumbo-jumbo lah................bottom line is............THE BEAR RALLY IS OVER.............</p>
              <p>downtrend is back now that the banks are finished pumping the market................that's how they made their billions this year............they know they can't cover up other massive derivative losses any further.....</p>
              <p>DOW's next leg down will go below the previous low of 6,200 pts...................the bear rally after that will not be anywhere near like in 2009................</p>
              <p>DEPRESSION  is coming.............Dow will go to as low as below 2,000 pts even..............or just above........so STI will go below 1000 pts..............</p>

              <p>Obviously you do not know how such businesses work. $3500 per outlet isn't a lot, given that the owner isn't even there doing the job??? Give me a break.
