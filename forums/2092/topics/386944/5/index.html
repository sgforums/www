              <p>Yes, the main trend has changed down. But a technical rebound is in the works, and this will likely draw retailers in and comments from analysts that the bull is still intact.</p>
              <p>China crash? Doesn't bother me in my selection of individual stocks for their dividends. You want you can wait for below 500 points. To me, STI 2000 ~ 2400 region will offer good value for longer term entries, according to my analysis. This region shall be reached in a matter of months. I've already warned earlier of a multi-month correction in page 2. And in my calculations, a probable estimate is about 5 to 6 months.</p>
              <p>My main targets are companies like SPH, Starhub, SMRT, which will not be affected much by economies overseas. As my main target is on dividends, some funds will go into REITs and some into Trusts as well. I'm targetting to reach $1k dividends monthly on average by end of this year, and $2k monthly before 30 yrs old.</p>
              <p>Anyway, just treat my opinions as entertainment. They are not meant as any financial advice.</p>

              <p>all i know FOR SURE..................i want to get involved with Silver, can only go up so buy on dips and average down then close out at every new high.............should've bought at 4 bucks years ago and then 6 bucks in 2008............i told so many people about it but i didn't do nothing...........damn it......</p>

              <p>I'm starting to enjoy chatting with you, As romainsta2001. :) Let us continue our discussion:</p>
              <p>I'm not into forex... And about the calls I made, I won't want to say any because I didn't go in... In fact, I was buying so furiously till I had only $200 left in my bank account for the whole of March 09.... Since then, I have grown other income sources...</p>
              <p>I won't be shorting stocks as well, although my Elliot wave count has already long warned of an impending correction... which made me simply stop buying every month with my spare funds like in 2009... I'm growing my opportunity funds at the moment, waiting for the right moment to strike when my indicators tell me to.</p>
              <p>As for REITs, I would like to say selection criteria must be stringent and not solely based on dividend yield. I'm surprised there are those who balked at a REIT's &lt;40% gearing when so many people in Singapore have properties with 70% to 80% loans.... only repaying perhaps 50% of the loans after 15 years for a 30 year loan (simplified calculations)... Gearing is not an issue to me provided they satisfy my criteria. So far, only about 5or 6 REITs satisfy my requirements, and I'm already into two of these. What is your opinion on this? Thanks.</p>
              <p>As for silver, Robert Kiyosaki did mention it before. But then again, you must have that much cash to load so many things. I rather focus on dividend stocks at the moment because cashflow to me is important. Dividend stocks in Sg are different from that in US; most of the dividends here are tax-exempt. So we can safely use dividends and reinvest them easily.</p>
              <p>I'm already halfway to my first goal of $1k a month. Only about 60% of my monies are in dividend stocks, 20% in growth stocks, and 20% in trading stocks. Poor strategy, discipline and selection criteria earlier on made my trading stocksk in the red, but my dividend and growth stocks are very green fortunately. But for 2010, a higher percentage will start going into dividend stocks when they reach my target price. I really do expect $1k monthly by end of year.</p>

              <p>have you read this book ''birdwatching in lion country'' ?</p>
              <p>it's written for forex but it can be used for stocks too since it's about fundamentals...............</p>
              <p>you into foreign stocks ?  a few years back, i did some research on SinoGold......listed on ASX if i recall correctly, it was at around 2 bucks........i believe this company is now partly owned by Chinese govt and since the Chinese govt asking citizens to buy gold, this stock might have good potential..........</p>

              <p>Guppies are always so nice to look at...............LOL</p>
              <p>i think if Noble bounce down off 3 bucks, next stop should be 1.8 bucks...........strong resistance turn support.............can grab a quick and goodprofit before heading down again.........</p>
              <p>but with Dow heading to new low below 6,000pts, that 1.8 area also will eventually break..............</p>

              <p>I use charts in a different way... They are just telling me not to buy, or when is the best time to buy whenever I have a FA selected stock. My main indicators are trendline + moving averages. Other indicators are just to add on.</p>
              <p>Just these few days, I have also attempted to use volume distribution to check on whether accumulation or distribution is going on. Still testing it out...</p>
              <p>Anyway, on my radar are</p>
              <p>Starhub<br>CapitaComm<br>Cerebos Pacific<br>Aztech<br>GRP<br>SPH<br><br>Attempting to accumulate funds to slowly load them. Of the 6 I mentioned, I have 4 of them, so it's a top up for these.</p>

              <p>my insurance agent told me that in S'pore, insurance companies must have the funds to cover all insured sums before they can sell any policies, i find that totally ridiculous................consider this.............</p>
              <p>say AIA collects $2000 premium from a guy insured for say $100,000..................AIA would need to have $100,000 in the1st place................so why do they need to sell insurance when they already have the funds to do their investments...........plus they can keep all profits for themselves........</p>
              <p>they have hundreds of thousands of clients...............can you imagine the amount of money they need to have in the1st place ? you can tell the whole thing is a ponzi-game...................</p>
              <p>when all those trillions of derivative contracts are in trouble, they'll all collapse...........</p>
