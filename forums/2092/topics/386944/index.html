              <p>Old, but I think it would be appropriate to post in this forum still...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="postbody"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Investment strategy pays dividends </span></span> <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Imagine having a payout from your investments that more than covers your monthly expenses.</span> <br> <br> Canny investor Ng Wai Chung is in this happy position at the age of 34.
              <br> <br> Mr Ng, a senior IT manager - and an author of investment books -
              achieved this a year ago. But rather than retire, he stays in full-time
              employment.
              <br> <br>His investment income stream is the result of a plan he set in
              motion three years ago. That was when he decided to sell his
              investments in unit trusts and buy stocks that pay high dividends.
              <br> <br>'Today, I am able to yield about $24,000 a year on my investment
              portfolio, enough to cover my expenses in most months," he said.
              <br> <br>This enviable portfolio consists of real estate investment trusts
              (Reits) and shares that yield high dividends, such as mainboard-listed
              Singapore Press Holdings (SPH). Dividends are the portions of profits
              which a company distributes to shareholders.
              <br> <br>Mr Ng has an engineering degree and a master's in Applied Finance
              from the National University of Singapore (NUS). He obtained the latter
              part-time while working.
              <br> <br>The senior associate in IT governance at commodity and futures
              exchange Singapore Mercantile Exchange has published three books on
              finance: Growing Your Tree Of Prosperity (2005), followed by Harvesting
              The Fruits Of Prosperity (2007), and this year, Sowing The Seeds Of
              Prosperity. They are available in bookshops.
              <br> <br> Mr Ng is married to quantity surveyor Pang Yoke Loo, 31. They have no children.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Such investment always brings risks. No such thing as easy money in this world. The method he's using is through investing in various portfolios to lower risk, allowing a safe and constant dividend payout. Seems nice it may seem but it is not easy to create such a portflolio. Stocks are double edge swords. They can earn fast money and lose money fast too.</div>

              <p>If you view stocks merely for capital gain, merely as a tool for speculation, then you can earn fast and lose fast.</p>
              <p>Investing for dividends and long term growth is akin to investing in a property. There's nothing wrong buying blue chips during recession. How many of your friends were telling you to sell at the start of 2008? Were you buying back then? Did you have to courage to put money in when there's huge margin of safety although prices are going down? It's easy to say on hindsight, I agree. But the person in the article did that as well, bravely buying when STI was below 2000 when everyone was running away.</p>
              <p>Prudent homework have to be done. It's not easy money, because you have to know why and what you are buying. I have missed opportunities because I have not yet finished doing homework on it, but so?</p>
              <p>High risks? It's not when you have done sufficient homework.</p>
              <p>In short, if you are buying on speculation and hearsay, you are subjected to high risks. If you buy according to sound principles, risks are extremely low. i.e. I bought SPH at $4, $3.8, $3.14, before it went down to near $2, but I held all the way as it was for long term dividend investment. I have received quite a bit of dividends, and it is back to positive. The value does rise fast and drop fast, but as long as you know what you are buying for and stick to your strategy, the risks are very low.</p>
              <p>It's indeed weird that people run away from GSS in equities, but rush to GSS in shopping centres...</p>
              <p>Another example... Starhub... I still remember how people were complaining when it lost the BPL to Singtel... Look at the price now since the BPL incident.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stocks and equity markets are all risky in any terms. As the nature of leverage goes, the higher the risk the higher the earnings. As for long term scenarios, steady but low dividend shares combined with medium leverage shares tend to be good. Homework is always deemed necessary as such things tend to follow trends. Homework constantly needs to be done. People can use indicators such as MACD, RSI, Stochastic charts and even Fibonacci ratios to estimate the movement of shares. Nevertheless, it takes skill to do that and analyse with precision.</div>

              <p>At the moment, I still have spare funds, I can't find any more that are of value and are at good entry points. However, if you have long holding power like I did for SPH, you could still get it for it's yearly dividends.</p>

              <p>yup. But holding stubbornly does not apply to all stocks, e.g. Chartered. But Chartered was loss making all the way, so no point getting it at all in the beginning...</p>

              <p>UOB is quite irritating.. STI gain, it will drop. STI drop, it will drop even more.. that kind of thing.. few weeks back, uob was at least $5.20 higher than dbs, but recently, dba gained a lot ($15+) now, while uob still hanging at mid 19s.. DBS gained more than UOB in percentage wise imo..<br><br>the cheaper stockes were better winners like sembmarine swiber</p>
