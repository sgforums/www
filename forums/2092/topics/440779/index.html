              <p class="indent">Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- MF Global Holdings Ltd., 
              the holding company for the broker-dealer run by ex-Goldman Sachs Group 
              Inc. co-chairman Jon Corzine, filed for bankruptcy protection as it 
              seeks to reorganize after making bets on European sovereign debt. Its 
              broker-dealer unit, MF Global Inc., faces liquidation.</p>
              <p class="indent">The firm listed debt of $39.7 billion and assets 
              of $41 billion in Chapter 11 papers filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
               in Manhattan. MF Global's board met through the weekend to consider 
              options including sale, a person with direct knowledge of the situation 
              said. The filing came as MF Global told regulators of potential 
              “deficiencies” in some customer accounts, according to a statement by 
              the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures 
              Trading Commission.</p>
              <p class="indent">“They were trying to get a deal but at the end of
               the day the majority of their business is built on trust,” Scott Peltz,
               the national leader of RSM McGladrey's Financial Advisory Services 
              Group in Chicago, said today in an interview. “They had a huge position 
              in European debt, which led to a lot of the troubles. There will be 
              questions about that.”</p>
              <p class="indent">Corzine, 64, a former governor of New Jersey who 
              helped run Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999, sought to transform MF 
              Global into a midsize investment bank after arriving there in March 
              2010. He increased the firm's risk and used its own money to trade, 
              including investments in European sovereign debt that rattled markets.</p>
              <p class="center">Fifth-Largest</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global's filing is the fifth-largest 
              financial-industry public company bankruptcy by assets, coming after 
              Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Washington Mutual Inc., CIT Group Inc. 
              and Conseco Inc., according to BankruptcyData.com. It's the 
              eighth-largest bankruptcy by assets of any public company, according to 
              the research group.</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global owns $6.3 billion of Italian, Spanish, 
              Belgian, Portuguese and Irish debt, the company said in an Oct. 25 
              presentation. Concerns that it might lose money on the holdings amid 
              Europe's debt crisis led to demands from regulators to boost capital, 
              credit downgrades, margin calls and bankruptcy, MF Global President 
              Bradley Abelow said. The regulators today said they advised bankruptcy 
              as the “safest” course of action.</p>
              <p class="indent">“For several days, the SEC, CFTC and other 
              regulators had been closely monitoring developments affecting MF Global 
              Inc.,” in anticipation of a transaction, the SEC and CFTC said in their 
              e-mailed statement. “Early this morning, MF Global informed the 
              regulators that the transaction had not been agreed to and reported 
              possible deficiencies in customer futures segregated accounts held at 
              the firm.”</p>
              <p class="indent">The regulators said they determined that a 
              bankruptcy proceeding “would be the safest and most prudent course of 
              action to protect customer accounts.”</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global's Abelow said the company aims to 
              complete “a successful, rapid reorganization” of its finances in court, 
              while maintaining a “business-as-usual atmosphere.”</p>
              <p class="indent">The company's regulated U.S. broker-dealer unit, 
              MF Global Inc., which didn't file for bankruptcy, was sued today in U.S.
               District Court in Manhattan by the Securities Investor Protection Corp.
               The SIPC seeks to liquidate the unit so as to protect customer assets.</p>
              <p class="indent">Broker-dealers aren't eligible to file for 
              Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and need to either sell assets, as Bear Stearns 
              Cos. did in 2008 to JPMorgan, or liquidate, as did Lehman Brothers' 
              brokerage unit and Bernard Madoff's firm.</p>
              <p class="indent">SIPC trustee James Giddens was approved today by a
               federal judge. Giddens is also liquidating Lehman Brothers' brokerage 
              following its parent-company's bankruptcy in 2008, the largest in U.S. 
              history.</p>
              <p class="center">SIPC Suit</p>
              <p class="indent">The SIPC, which is overseen by the SEC, acts in 
              brokerage insolvency cases to recover investor funds. Liquidations are 
              overseen by SIPC so as to return or replace customer securities. SIPC, 
              created under the Securities Investor Protection Act, insures losses of 
              as much as $500,000 per customer in registered securities.</p>
              <p class="indent">“The defendant has failed or is in danger of 
              failing to meet its obligations to its customers,” the SIPC said in 
              court papers of MF Global. “Specifically, the defendant is unable to 
              meet its obligations as they mature.”</p>
              <p class="indent">The firm has drawn almost all of a $1.2 billion 
              credit line that was amended last year to give it more liquidity, Abelow
               said. The broker-dealer unit has borrowed about $210 million of a $300 
              million secured credit line, he said. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is the 
              agent for the two credit lines.</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global's finance unit, MF Global Finance USA 
              Inc., also filed for bankruptcy, listing debt of as much as $50 million 
              and assets of as much as $500 million. The holding company asked the 
              bankruptcy court for permission to continue intercompany transactions 
              between its bankrupt businesses and non-bankrupt units, allowing MF 
              Global to maintain its deposits, investments and bank accounts.</p>
              <p class="center">Protecting Assets</p>
              <p class="indent">“The boards of directors of both entities 
              authorized the filing of the Chapter 11 petition in order to protect 
              their assets,” the companies said today in a statement. MF Global U.K. 
              Ltd. separately entered administration in Britain with administrators 
              appointed from KPMG LLP, the Financial Services Authority said.</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global reported a $191.6 million quarterly 
              loss on Oct. 25 and Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings cut its 
              credit rankings to junk. Before the bankruptcy filing, MF Global was 
              suspended today from doing new business with the New York Federal 
              Reserve, according to a statement on the regulator's website, and 
              trading in the stock was halted.</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global declined 67 percent last week and its 
              bonds started trading at distressed levels amid its disclosures of bets 
              on European sovereign debt. MF Global held talks with five potential 
              buyers for all or parts of the company, including banks, private-equity 
              firms and brokers, said the person familiar with the situation, who 
              asked not to be identified because the talks were private.</p>
              <p class="center">Evercore Hired</p>
              <p class="indent">The firm was getting advice from Evercore 
              Partners Inc. as it sought buyers. Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher &amp; 
              Flom LLP is representing the company as bankruptcy counsel. The case was
               assigned to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn, who handled Borders 
              Group Inc.'s bankruptcy.</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global, based in the U.S. with offices in at 
              least seven other countries, has about 2,870 employees. Revenue was $2.2
               billion in fiscal 2011, with a net loss for the parent of $81.2 
              million.</p>
              <p class="indent">The broker of commodities, derivatives, equity 
              and foreign exchange had $7.2 billion of customer funds in segregated 
              accounts as of Aug. 31, according to the Commodity Futures Trading 
              Commission. It was one of 22 primary dealers authorized to trade U.S. 
              government securities with the New York Fed and is a member of more than
               70 financial exchanges, according to its website.</p>
              <p class="center">Unsecured Creditors</p>
              <p class="indent">A list of unsecured creditors filed by MF Global 
              includes New York-based JPMorgan, as trustee for holders of $1.2 billion
               in debt, and Deutsche Bank AG, as trustee for holders of more than $1 
              billion in notes due in 2016 and 2018.</p>
              <p class="indent">JPMorgan itself holds less than $80 million of 
              the debt, said Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank. JPMorgan 
              also has $26 million in collateral belonging to MF Global that “may be 
              subject to liens in favor” of the bank, MF Global said.</p>
              <p class="indent">Armin Niedermeier, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, declined to comment on the filing.</p>
              <p class="indent">Other unsecured creditors include Headstrong 
              Services LLC, owed $3.9 million; Comcast Corp.'s CNBC, owed $845,397; 
              New York-based law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP, owed $596,939; 
              Oracle Corp., owed $302,704; and Bloomberg Finance LP, owed $276,064. 
              Bloomberg Finance is a unit of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg 
              News.</p>
              <p class="center">Deadline Extension</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global asked for a Jan. 30 deadline to file 
              its full list of debt and assets, seeking a 75-day extension of the 
              usual two-week window given under bankruptcy law.</p>
              <p class="indent">The company “is one of the largest brokers in 
              markets for commodities and listed derivatives,” making it large and 
              complex enough to require more time, MF Global said in court papers.</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global's $325 million of 6.25 percent notes 
              due 2016 fell 1.25 cents to 48.75 cents on the dollar at 3:49 p.m. in 
              New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the 
              Financial Regulatory Authority. The notes, which were sold in August at 
              face value, dropped to as low as 35 cents on the dollar after the 
              company filed for bankruptcy.</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global's largest common shareholders as of 
              Sept. 30 were Pyramis Global Advisors LLC, with 8.4 percent, and RS 
              Investments in San Francisco, with 7.8 percent, according to court 
              papers. RS has sold its entire stake, Erin Burke, a spokeswoman for the 
              firm, said in an e-mail.</p>
              <p class="indent">Fine Capital Partners LP held 7.4 percent and 
              Cadian Capital Management LLC had 6.2 percent, the company said. J.C. 
              Flowers &amp; Co. owns 1.5 million preferred shares, MF Global said.</p>
              <p class="center">Sugar Brokerage</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global, formerly part of Man Group Plc, has 
              its roots in a sugar brokerage founded by James Man in England in 1793. 
              MF Global became a public company in a 2007 spinoff. It was built up 
              before the spinoff by acquiring the assets of bankrupt brokerage Refco 
              Inc. in 2005.</p>
              <p class="indent">Corzine reached out to Goldman Sachs about 
              selling all or part of the company, according to two people with 
              knowledge of the firm's deliberations. Macquarie Group Ltd. examined MF 
              Global's books, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. 
              David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman, didn't return a call seeking 
              comment. Paula Chirhart, a spokeswoman for Macquarie in New York, 
              declined to comment.</p>
              <p class="indent">Barclays Plc was among banks that looked at MF 
              Global, another person said. Kerrie Cohen, a spokeswoman for the U.K.- 
              based bank in New York, declined to comment.</p>
              <p class="center">Potential Bidder</p>
              <p class="indent">Hannah Grove, a spokeswoman for State Street Corp., which was also reported to be a potential bidder, declined to comment.</p>
              <p class="indent">“We're investing in the future of this business,”
               Corzine said in a May statement that announced new hires in MF Global's
               commodities and derivatives areas. In August, the company sold $325 
              million in senior unsecured notes to repay part of the $1.2 billion 
              revolving credit facility, according to company statements.</p>
              <p class="indent">MF Global increased net capital at the U.S. unit 
              after Finra raised concerns about the risks to its European debt 
              portfolio, it said in September.</p>
              <p class="indent">“We are confident that we have the resources, 
              capital, liquidity and expertise to successfully manage our European 
              exposures to their end date maturity of December 2012,” Diana DeSocio, a
               spokeswoman for the broker, said in an Oct. 24 statement.</p>
              <p class="indent">Along with the creditors holding millions of dollars in bonds are vendors owed much smaller sums.</p>
              <p class="indent">Tim Jones is the president of Cedar Knolls, New 
              Jersey- based Ticker Consulting LLC, which advises financial companies 
              such as MF Global on electronic-trading and risk-management systems. 
              Jones, who has an unsecured claim of about $22,800 for services he 
              provided to MF Global, said that in bankruptcy there's always a chance a
               debt can't be collected.</p>
              <p class="indent">“I'll move on,” Jones said. “My W-2 will be a little bit light, and hopefully I can find places to make that money up.”</p>

               in Singapore are scrambling on Wednesday to withdraw their funds from

               their investments after the Monetary Authority of Singapore ordered the

               investors said that they were reassured by the statement, and left 
              their money where it was, but spent a nervous weekend at home.<br><br>Then
               on Monday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) suspended MF 
              Global from taking on new business ahead of its parent company filing 
              for bankruptcy in New York.<br><br>The next day, some investors with Kim
               Eng, AmFraser and CIMB woke up to find their trading platforms on 
              Contract for Differences (CFDs) frozen. The brokerages had MF Global as a
               counterparty.<br><br>Mr LB Ho, an investor with Kim Eng brokerage, 
              said: "It is very unfair to us. For instance, this is an opportunity for
               me to close the position, and I should be able to make some gains (but)
               because of this I cannot do anything and the opportunity might be 
              lost."<br><br>Meanwhile, Kim Eng said it is confident that it will be 
              able to provide alternative market access for its clients on Thursday to
               unwind their open positions. Other affected brokerages have decided to 
              monitor the situation.<br><br>In a statement, MF Global Singapore said it has appointed KPMG as provisional liquidator to oversee its winding down.<br><br>This
               is intended to safeguard the interests of the customers of the company 
              and ensure that the company does not engage in any new trades, as well 
              as the equal treatment of all its creditors, it added.<br><br>It has also set up a hotline - 6866-6796 - for customers' queries.<br><br>MAS said it will work closely with the company to ensure equitable treatment of all stakeholders.<br><br>The
               Singapore Exchange said customers who have traded on SGX can close 
              their positions through MF Global or transfer them to other clearing 
              members. <br><br>The exchange added that it will continue to facilitate the orderly transfer of customers' positions.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>
