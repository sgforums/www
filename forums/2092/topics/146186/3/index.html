I'm gonna do a minor in econs, majoring in engineering. I'm not interested in life as an engineer, but im glad I stuck to engineering instead of switching to accounting or biz, I see so many ppl jumping to accounting or biz becoz it's the more 'hot' course. Singapore has such a small finance sector, you gonna compete with lot of ppl. Engineering jobs also alot of competition, but at least u are more versatile. there's alot of engineers in the biz and finance sectors. my friend's dad is a trader in UOB, used to work as chemical engineer. but if u no interest in science, or at least decent knowledge in science, then dont take engineering coz it's a very heavy subject.</div></blockquote>u noe, when i first chose my poly courses, i did the elimination method..<br><br>turns out that... i can survive longer in biz.. elaborate more later... can't think now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah u will study that.  its part and parcel of econs. u need to learn those coz they comprise the basis of economics. more interesting stuff will come later. what my lecturer told me is that alot of the nobel prize winners for econs didnt do econs as their first degree... they got interested in econs after perhaps being exposed to the subject during their first degrees. so they carry on a second degree in econs after that. whether u study engine or finance or biz u will definitely touch econs. coz it will help u understand many things and it's very good really, those who escape away from econs only have to lose. you can never be a great in finance if u never study econs. look at ppl like warren buffett, master in econs, george soros also studied econs. george bush jr if im not wrong. arnold schwaz also.</div>
