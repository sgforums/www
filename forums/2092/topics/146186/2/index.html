            <div class='col-md body'>im tokking bout econs as a degree...you gotta do both man! micro is more theory, macro is more interesting coz u can see the direct relation to the real economy. anyway, according to my lecturer, econs is only interesting in the 3rd-4th yr. that's where u start to study global developments, behavioural economics, etc. first 2 yrs are mainly theories, maths and stuff. I'm gonna do a minor in econs, majoring in engineering. I'm not interested in life as an engineer, but im glad I stuck to engineering instead of switching to accounting or biz, I see so many ppl jumping to accounting or biz becoz it's the more 'hot' course. Singapore has such a small finance sector, you gonna compete with lot of ppl. Engineering jobs also alot of competition, but at least u are more versatile. there's alot of engineers in the biz and finance sectors. my friend's dad is a trader in UOB, used to work as chemical engineer. but if u no interest in science, or at least decent knowledge in science, then dont take engineering coz it's a very heavy subject. but like how i always console myself....Real man study engineering....</div>
