              <p>I learn this morning that Dubai government delay their loan payment to several banks in the world.Is DBS bank one of the bank loan to Dubai government?</p>
              <p>Standard Chartered bank is also one of the bank that loan money to Dubai,and if my memory serve me right,i think Singapore government got invest shares in this bank also.</p>
              <p>What i want to know is,is our government going to lose money in foreign investment again from this Dubai Crisis?</p>
              <p>If we are going to lose money again in this Dubai crisis,then it will explain why our banks are paying low interest rate for Singaporeans who deposit money in bank,charge high interest rate for those who loaned money,charge $2 for those who have below $500 in their bank account,raise GST from 3%-5%-7%,put ERP gantry everywhere,anyhow raise electricity n water fees blah blah blah....All becoz of their poor investment abroad?</p>

              <p>Oh my goodness, you never been to Dubai meh??? It is like california ok, there are super tankers that need to be repair, repaint and rebunkering, I remember Keppel was there, i dunno whether if they are still around or just a small office representation left. Keppel was one of the pionneer yard to open up in Dubai, they also got yard in Brazil, and europe if i am not wrong.</p>
              <p>Typically those indians and bangalas workers who worked in Singapore went over to Dubai yards to get jobs, first it is being more nearly to their homeland, second, because dubai paid US dollars.</p>

              <p>Well, considering that in recent years, the government has been getting GLCs to invest in Dubai, I would think the exposure might be higher than what is reported in the media.</p>

              <p>We wil never know the extent of the exposure though, knowing how things work in sg.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese "hum" with the appetite of an "Attention Seeking Whore" have not visited Dubai to keep its recollection of Dubai being similar to California ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the men must have confused the memories of the Taiwanese "hum" to have it mixed up Duabi with California - when the Arabs are more fair skinned that the Afro-Americans in California, and the Caucasians in Dubai are rough and tough compared to the younger sets in California.</p>
              <p>Were there as many "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">indians and banglas workers</span></em>" in California too ?</p>
              <p>Why will the Taiwanese "hum" consistently and persistently display its meagre knowledge so publicly to achieve infamy in this Forum ?</p>
              <p>It should learn to keep its clitoris inside its shell so as not to get it repeated clipped, as there will be nothing left to satisfy its needs as an "<strong>Attention Seeking Whore</strong>".</p>
