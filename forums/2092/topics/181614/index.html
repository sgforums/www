I finally sold at 58cts, the stock is currently trading ard 64cts, My total gains is abt 18k+ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Tiongwoon, is a fast game I bought at 26cts when it exploded and sold at 31.5cts abt 5 days later(T+3 incl weekend) for a nice $900(approx) contra gain.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Wheellock despite they gave out $2 a share dividend, I didn't take it but went for the rights issue my cost base for this is now abt 53cts from $1.60 when I first bought it yrs back, if you factor in the dividends they paid over those years then it's even less, after the RT issue the share split into 3 it went down all the way to $1.41 from $4:30+  here I accumulated somemore, the share last few days jumped to $1.54, I think this share still has an upside price target potential of close to $1.86 but have to keep it for a while.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
