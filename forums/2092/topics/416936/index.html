              <p>Its all about purchasing power. Can u afford two or more pte properties? If u can, then surely u will make good $ from rental or sale. However, take note that the risks are greater if SG falls into recession....do u still have $ to service the loans? What if the rental ceased? There's also the risks of unable to sell the pte pty, then what?</p>
              <p>From what I know, those pte pty that can't sell are the same as those who can't rent out....beware.</p>

              <p>I read this somewhere and I think is nice:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span class="postbody">For those of you who bought investment properties
               between 2007/08 peak through Dec 2010, you will have approximately 6 
              months to offload your real estate assests.
              <br> <br> Why?
              <br> <br> 1. With a lower loan-to-valuation of 60% for any 2nd property purchase, 
              you can forget about selling your property to another buyer-investor for
               a while.  On the surface, a buyer-investor would have to top up 
              additional 10% of the value in cash if residential prices have stayed 
              flat. However, if the valuation of the unit has fallen from the original
               purchase price (even by just 10-20% - a highly likely scenario with the
               banks taking a far more cautious stance in dishing out mortgage loans),
               buyers would have to top up the difference between the declines on top 
              of the lower loan to valuation differences. The effective loan to 
              purchase price ratio could be as low as 50%.  Now which right-minded 
              property investor wants to put down 50% cash on a property in a 
              declining market?  Few and far between and only fools I am sure.
              <br> <br> 2. First-time home buyer demand is far lower than the supply 
              availability. There is only a finite number of genuine first-time buyers
               to go around, estimated to be less than 20k comprising of expat-PR and 
              new/young families.  On the supply side however, there is an estimated 
              16k units due for TOP this year and another 16-17k units schedule to 
              complete next year.  These are on top of the 10k completed vacant units 
              in the current supply pool.  So the unit which you bought between 07-10 
              could be in for a major price correction (crash is a more appropriate 
              word actually) in the coming 4-5 years of buyer's market. 
              <br> <br> 3. You can forget about getting profitable rental income for a while.  
              Rental prices.  Same rationale as 1 &amp; 2 above.  Falling prices + 
              ample supply = lethal combo for rental income.
              <br> <br> Your only option other than stuck with a non-performing ill-liquid asset
               for the next 4-5 years of your life is to quickly offload it to the 
              limited pool of pent-up demand, i.e. a genuine first-time buyer waiting 
              for the past several years to get into the market.       
              <br> <br> Hope this helps.</span></p>

              <p><span class="postbody">My projection:
              <br> <br> 1. Property prices across all segments (mass through high-end) will drop
               by 10% over the course of the next 6 months due to a combination of 
              several factors: lower LTV, lower valuation by banks, buyers sitting on 
              the sideline, and seller offloading existing units.
              <br> <br> 2. From Q3 2011 on, Sibor is expected to move up (by 500bps almost every
               quarter till it hits around 6-7%).  This coupled with ample supply 
              coming through and demand dwindling, we are now likely to witness
              <br> unprecedented declines for all private property segments starting from 
              Q3 2011.  Falling valuation, high interest rate, and lower loan quantum 
              could put significant downward pressure on all projects sold during the 
              irrational years of 07-10.  Therefore, I see mass through luxury 
              residential prices to decline by a further 35% from Q2 2011, bringing 
              about a total decline of 45-60% from peak.</span></p>

              <p><span class="postbody">What are the implications for the various parties?
              <br> <br> For existing owner-investors, you should seriously consider what I stated above and exit while you still have your shirts on.
              <br> <br> For first-time buyers or upgraders, you should not rush in if you have a
               choice.  This is going to be a buyer's market in about 6 months from 
              now.  Probably the best time to buy is between the next 12-18 months.
              <br> <br> For wannabe investors, buy only if you don't mind a non-performing piece of asset for the next 4-5 years.</span></p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p><span class="postbody">Sibor is positively correlated (or more 
              accurately tied to) the US interest rate.  With low growth, high 
              unemployment, high debt, and inflation, the US Feds preferences starting
               Q3 of this year will likely move away from low rate stability to one of
               hawish rate raising.  The reversal of the multiple serial rate cuts of 
              250-500 bps witnessed previously will happen soon enough.   This will 
              definitely impact Sibor for sure.</span></p>
