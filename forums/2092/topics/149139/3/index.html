IMO, it would take at least 2 years before they can rebuild their name again.<br><br>STATSchipac I say buy. If they become profitable next Quarter, the share is most likely to rebound to $1.50. I got mine at 90cents though.<br><br>perhaps you would like to ask forummer SBST275 on SMRT. Although I have believe that company has hidden potential, Sbst doesnt think so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>COmfort I say buy...but not at that price. If you missed it at $1.43 too bad. HOpefully, it drops to that level again. BUt ever since The Capital Group increased their stake in that company, I think the resistance level has been brought up to $1.48.</div>

The reason why most of the reits here are not sustainable is because in the future, they will be issuing new units to finance their debt. As more acquisitions are performed, more units need to be issued. This will dilute the value of the listed reit.<br><br>The only way for reits to raise enough money is through issuance of new units as they do not have spare cash to finance their acquisitions since more than 90% of income are distributed out.<br><br></div>

They are cureently overvalued and their net profit for the recent quarter slipped.<br><br>SP land used to be $4....other than that I say SP land is good value. NTA per share is $6.<br><br>Unfortunately look at the BOD of the company. Wee cho yaw and John Gokongwei are the 2 people that controls the most number of SP Land shares. IMO, these 2 are currently not seeing eye to eye. They are only eying the company's asset and money and fighting for further control of the company...this leaves me wondering about the future of SP land...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>stats is another company i fail to understand.  the share was steadily climbing at 2.70 then came the merger.  the share dropped to 1.80<br><br>why?  synergy?  what purpose does the merger serve?  just to be the biggest chip testing company in the world?<br><br>since the merger they never have a single good result to show.  the share price keeps dropping.  now below $1.<br><br>singapore has a lousy stock market.  there are just not enough people trying.  our market is not volatile enough.  it takes years for prices to go up but one bad news to drop to 3 yrs low.<br><br>chip industry is cyclical.  i seriously doubt stats can recover to 1.80 let alone 3.60 that they used to be.  same goes for all other tech companies.<br><br>tech stocks are mostly hopeless.<br><br></div>
