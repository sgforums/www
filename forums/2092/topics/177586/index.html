The job of a stock analyst is just to express an opinion on their views of the share which they are researching.<br><br>Whether the stock goes up or down, nobody can tell. Stock analyst usually back up their recommendations with fundamental data and personal interpretations. Therfore, what looks good to one may not look good to others.<br><br>As usual, one must always exercise their personal judgement before investing in a stock. So dont blame the stock analyst if you follow them blindly.</div>

It simply is DO NOT HAVE A HOLY GRAIL MENTALITY TOWARDS STOCKS. There is no such thing as a 100% accuracy when it comes to investing. Even Warren Buffet accuracy is not even 100%.<br><br>The purpose of research reports is to give the reader a basic idea on what the researcher feels of the share based on fundamental data. In order to increase the odds of you being a winner, SOUND and personal judgement must be exercised. Ultimately, you are responsible for your own investments.<br><br>Heng vs sway probably occurs in situation when there is a market depression or a financial crisis.</div>

I agree with this. But when following him, allow some room for unexpected events outside his modelling.</div>
