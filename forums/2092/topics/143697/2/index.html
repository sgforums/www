            <div class='col-md body'>Property:<br><br><blockquote>SINGAPORE Land yesterday posted a 31 per cent jump in second-quarter group net profit to $28.3 million owing mainly to a $7 million gain on the sale of Atrium Court, a six-storey conserved office building in Glasgow.<br><br>As a result, SingLand's parent, United Industrial Corp (UIC), also saw its group net earnings for the quarter ended June 30, rise 39 per cent to $27.6 million. UIC's bottom line was also lifted by gain from the sale of another investment property, Eau Claire Place II in Calgary, Canada.<br><br>UIC's first-half net profit was up 4 per cent to $46.6 million, while SingLand's bottom line for the same period increased 7 per cent to $46.6 million.</blockquote><blockquote> HO Bee Investment's second-quarter group net profit jumped from $1.2 million to $8.3 million, on the back of a near-tripling in revenue from $12.9 million to $38.3 million.<br><br>The revenue surge was due largely to contribution from The Berth by the Cove condo project on Sentosa. Ho Bee listed this as one of four projects that will contribute substantially to the group's revenue and earnings over the next few years.</blockquote><blockquote> CITY Developments yesterday reported a 36 per cent drop in second-quarter net profit, bogged down by increased tax expenses and the inability to book strong residential property sales.<br><br>Upbeat: Mr Kwek, with CFO Ms Goh Ann Nee, is sure that the convergence of positive factors will lift the Singapore property market.<br><br>The group's revenue was almost flat, registering a 0.1 per cent gain to $584.9 million, while net income came in at $23.5 million. Tax expenses grew 175 per cent over the same quarter of last year to $23.3 million, effectively negating the group's strong hotels results.<br><br>Despite strong sales of its properties such as the wildly popular The Sail @ Marina Bay and City Square Residences - amounting to close to $1 billion - City Dev can only start recognising profits from those projects from the next quarter, as they are still in the initial stages of construction.</blockquote></div>
