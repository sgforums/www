Qantas-backed Jetstar Asia and Valuair said they would continue to operate their normal routes under their own brands "for the foreseeable future, with little or no change to the service offered by either airline".<br><br>...<br><br>However the Business Times newspaper said last week the deal was expected to hinge on the injection of more than 50 million Singapore dollars (30 million US) in fresh capital into the new entity, largely to be provided by Qantas.<br><br>Investment company Temasek Holdings, which owns 19 percent of Jetstar, could also put up fresh capital, the report said.<br><br>Shareholders of Valuair, including airline industry veteran Lim Chin Beng, Malaysia's Star Cruises and Asiatravel.com, would become minority shareholders in the merged company, according to the paper.<br><br>Jetstar Asia flies between Singapore India, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Manila and Taipei. Valuair flies between Singapore and Hong Kong, Jakarta, Perth and Bangkok.<br>---<br>Southeast Asia's fledgling low-fare airline industry has been under pressure to consolidate amid tough competition, soaring jet fuel costs and reluctance by governments to open up their domestic aviation sectors.<br><br>Kevin Scully, MD, NRA Capital, said: "I think AirAsia, Tiger Airways (backed by SIA) because of their parenthood and because of their listing status will probably be two of the three survivors."<br><br>The single biggest impact to hit budget carriers this past year was rising oil prices which is seen as having raised Valuair's operating cost by between 20 to 30 percent.<br><br>The other was the aggressive and protracted price war among budget airlines and full-fledged carriers in their fight for market share.<br><br>Mr Scully said: "I think that had an impact on the yields, I think that's what probably meant that the losses they sustained were a lot higher than what they expected. And probably the money which they have set aside for the 3 years probably now shortened to 1 to 2 years or 1.5 years."<br><br>- Source <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/159604/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/159604/1/.html</a></div>

Its first-half turnover also dipped 3.3 per cent to $183.8 million from $190.1 million. Fu Yu said the poor results were due to price pressure from customers, increase in costs due to rising oil prices and increase in labour cost in China subsidiaries.<br></blockquote>Bad signs of things to come in the mfgr industry. Other mfgr results out within this 2 weeks.. watch out for it. Fu yu down 5c to 0.540<br><br><blockquote><strong>Exceptional gain lifts S'pore Shipping</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE Shipping Corp posted a more than six-fold rise in first-quarter net profit to $45.7 million from $7.3 million in the previous corresponding quarter. The earnings include a $41.3 million exceptional gain from the disposal of a vessel, a subsidiary and an an associated company. <strong>Without the exceptional items, its Q1 earnings dropped close to 40 per cent to $4.4 million.</strong> Its quarterly revenue dipped 8.3 per cent to $23.2 million from $25.3 million previously. It said operating results will be affected by the sale of the vessels, and the favourable impact from higher charter rates for its car carriers will be felt mainly from the third quarter of this financial year.<br></blockquote>I was thinking how can a shipping coy post such profits with oil prices rising so much! exceptional gains..
