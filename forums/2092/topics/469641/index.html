              I was invited by my friend to invest in what they call "saving plan" by the Jiki Life group. I know they are dealing with some magnetic braclet products and renting it out on behalf of the owner (which is us). I also learn that Jiki life group is facing financial problems. I didn't recieve the interest which was promised for a few months now.
              
               Anyone faces the same problem as well? Tell me your experience and do advise. 
              
              As for the others who are being approached by Jiki Life, Asayo, Japan life, try not to buy any of their investment plans till this problem is solved.

              <p>Hi, I joined JIKI to invest in 2011 by my friend who is an agent. Fr the first few months, the monthly rent was deposited into my account. But last year, it did not come in so when I checked with my friend, she said that a fellow agent who was in charge of the rent did not do so and she will check on it for me.. At that point, I know something was not right.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After a while, she got back to me and said that the company is having trouble and I told her that I want to be out. Last month, she got back to me saying that the company has stopped their business and will pay back all of my money. There's a letter by the director about it given to me by my friend. I told her that if I do not get back my money, I would have to take legal action. She agreed with me and promised to ensure everything is settled accordingly by the end of the year. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Im trusting her to settle it for me cos she is a very close friend of mine and a few of my friends also invested and we kept updating each other on the situation. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My advice to you and the rest is to contact your agent quickly and ask them about the closure of the company. And cancel any monthly withdrawal of money from your account. Inform your bank if need to. If you don't hear from your agent, I think it is best to complain to CASE or something. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I was an agent under them. Joined last year and after closing a few deals (supported by my closed ones), I decided to sit back and watch the company's growth before deciding what to do.<br>Currently, they are unable to fork out the monthly interest. I have decided with my clients to withdraw and get back the cash. Due to contract obligations, I am unable to reveal the details, otherwise my clients don't get their money back.<br><br>Honestly, I doubt they will <strong>want </strong>to pay back the amount they have earned. If it comes to the worst, I will seek ah-gong for help.<br>Anyone who intends to seek legal action, please inform me. We can share lawyer cost.

              <p>Hi I've also encountered the same scenario as you guys but for me I won't share legal cost because it may be more than my initial investment with jiki life. But now I'm considering the following options which may be of use to you:</p>
              <p>1. Go to CASE- usually action will be taken if more consumers complain,as advised by my friend in sg police force. So we'll have a stronger case if we group together and go to CASE directly</p>
              <p>2. Go to magistrate's court, defend yourself and try to get your money</p>
              <p>3. CAD- however jiki life must have contravened the mlm act for action to be taken. Not repaying us may not be substantial evidence that they've contravened the act. Hence may be difficult for cad to take action.</p>
              <p>4. Wait for the letter by the co with the proposed repayment plan( pls be reminded that they've breached the original contract with you already in the 1st place, but failed to inform till you discovered it yourself)</p>
