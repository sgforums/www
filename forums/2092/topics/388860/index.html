              <p>an. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. investors overwhelmingly see
              <span id="lw_1264165043_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">President Barack Obama</span> as anti-business and question his ability
              to manage a <span id="lw_1264165043_1" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">financial crisis</span>, according to a Bloomberg survey.</p>
              <p>The global quarterly poll of investors and analysts who are
              Bloomberg subscribers finds that 77 percent of U.S. respondents
              believe Obama is too anti-business and four-out-of-five are only
              somewhat confident or not confident of his ability to handle a
              financial emergency.</p>
              <p>The poll also finds a decline in Obama’s overall
              favorability rating one year after taking office. He is viewed
              favorably by 27 percent of U.S. investors. In an October poll,
              32 percent in the U.S. held a positive impression.</p>
              <p>“Investors no longer feel they can trust their instincts
              to take risks,” said poll respondent David Young, a managing
              director for a broker dealer in <span id="lw_1264165043_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">New York</span>. Young cited Obama’s
              efforts to trim bonuses and earnings, make health care his <span id="lw_1264165043_3" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">top
              priority</span> over jobs and plans to tax “the rich or advantaged.”</p>
              <p>Carlos Vadillo, a fixed-income analyst at Wells Fargo
              Securities LLC in San Francisco, said Obama has been in a
              “constant war” with the banking system, using “fat-cat
              bankers and other misnomers to describe a business model which
              supports a large portion of America.”</p>
              <p>Europe, Asia</p>
              <p>Outside the U.S., Obama continues to get high marks with
              three-quarters or more of investors in <span id="lw_1264165043_4" class="yshortcuts">Europe</span> and Asia viewing
              him favorably. These rankings bring his global favorability
              rating to 60 percent among all poll respondents.</p>
              <p>When it comes to his ability to manage a financial crisis,
              55 percent of Europeans say they are either mostly or very
              confident; Among Asian respondents, 59 percent say they are
              somewhat confident or not confident; 38 percent expressed
              confidence.</p>
              <p>Unlike other recent presidents, Obama hasn’t selected a
              leading business executive for his cabinet or a top advisory
              role. One year after taking office, he is coping with a <span id="lw_1264165043_5" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">jobless
              rate</span> hovering around 10 percent and a <span id="lw_1264165043_6" class="yshortcuts">federal deficit</span> that rose
              to $1.4 trillion last year. In response, he has proposed a fee
              on as many as 50 large financial firms and yesterday called for
              limiting the size and trading activities of financial
              institutions as a way to reduce risk-taking.</p>
              <p>‘Near Collapse’</p>
              <p>“While the financial system is far stronger today than it
              was one year ago, it’s still operating under the same rules that
              led to its near collapse,” Obama said yesterday at the <span id="lw_1264165043_7" class="yshortcuts">White
              House</span> after meeting with former <span id="lw_1264165043_8" class="yshortcuts">Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
              Volcker</span>, who has been an advocate of taking such steps.</p>
              <p>The poll was conducted Jan. 19, before Obama unveiled the
              plan. Yesterday, after the announcement, the Standard &amp; Poor’s
              500 Index fell 1.9 percent, its biggest loss since Oct. 30. The
              <span id="lw_1264165043_9" class="yshortcuts">S&amp;P 500</span> has risen 39 percent since Obama’s Jan. 20, 2009,
              inauguration.</p>
              <p>The U.S. investors’ perceptions of Obama stand in contrast
              to those of their European counterparts, most of whom say the
              president strikes the right balance when it comes to managing
              business interests. Europeans, however, are more confident in
              Obama’s leadership on financial matters than Asians.</p>
              <p>The quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll of investors, traders
              and analysts in <span id="lw_1264165043_10" class="yshortcuts">six continents</span> was conducted by Selzer &amp; Co., a
              Des Moines, Iowa-based firm. It is based on interviews with a
              random sample of 873 Bloomberg subscribers, representing
              decision makers in markets, finance and economics. The poll has
              a <span id="lw_1264165043_11" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">margin of error</span> of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1264165043_12" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Geithner</span>, Summers</p>
              <p>Obama’s 71 percent unfavorable rating among U.S. investors
              is almost matched by two members of his economic team. Both
              <span id="lw_1264165043_13" class="yshortcuts">Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner</span> and <span id="lw_1264165043_14" class="yshortcuts">Lawrence Summers</span>,
              president of the <span id="lw_1264165043_15" class="yshortcuts">National Economic Council</span>. U.S. respondents
              give Geithner a 63 percent unfavorable rating and Summers 67
              percent. In October, 57 percent held a negative view of Geithner
              and 66 percent said the same of Summers.</p>
              <p>Like Obama, both men do better with Asian and European
              investors.</p>
              <p>One financial figure to find favor among U.S. respondents
              is <span id="lw_1264165043_16" class="yshortcuts">Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben S</span>. Bernanke, who garners a
              68 percent <span id="lw_1264165043_17" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">approval rating</span>, which is in line with his marks from
              non-U.S. investors and the rating U.S. investors gave him in the
              October poll.</p>
              <p>There is one other figure U.S. and international investors
              agree on: former <span id="lw_1264165043_18" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Republican vice presidential candidate</span> <span id="lw_1264165043_19" class="yshortcuts">Sarah
              Palin</span>, a potential candidate for her party’s nomination in 2012.</p>
              <p>Palin Rating</p>
              <p>With a net favorability rating of 15 percent among all
              investors, Palin does best in the U.S., where she has the
              support of 27 percent of respondents. In Asia, it’s 14 percent,
              and in <span id="lw_1264165043_20" class="yshortcuts">Europe</span> just 5 percent of investors view her favorably.</p>
              <p>“She revealed a complete lack of any global awareness,”
              said Anthony Gibbs, an agency broker at Vantage Capital Markets
              in London.</p>
              <p>Investors outside the U.S. are more unified about Obama’s
              approach to business, with 67 percent of Europeans saying he
              strikes the right balance and 56 percent of Asians who agree.</p>
              <p>“He is managing well a position he took over under great
              uncertainty,” said Sivanesan Muthusamy, <span id="lw_1264165043_21" class="yshortcuts">senior vice president</span> of funding and investments at Alliance Bank in <span id="lw_1264165043_22" class="yshortcuts">Kuala Lumpur</span>.
              “American leadership is again guiding the <span id="lw_1264165043_23" class="yshortcuts">global financial
              markets</span> into stability.”</p>
              <p>The U.S. investors’ overwhelming characterization of Obama
              as anti-business stands in sharp contrast to the results of a
              Bloomberg National Poll in December, when 52 percent of U.S.
              adults said the president had the right balance in his approach.</p>
              <p>Geographic Divide</p>
              <p>The January poll shows an especially dramatic divide
              between U.S. and global investors when it comes to Obama’s
              overall favorability rating.</p>
              <p>In Europe, 81 percent of respondents have a favorable
              opinion of Obama. In <span id="lw_1264165043_24" class="yshortcuts">Asia</span>, that number is 73 percent. The
              polarization is far greater by geography than by occupation, the
              survey found. <span id="lw_1264165043_25" class="yshortcuts">Sales executives</span> gave Obama his highest
              unfavorable rating, at 53 percent, compared with 28 percent of
              researchers and analysts and 35 percent of traders.</p>
              <p>Globally, other central bankers are slightly less popular
              than Bernanke. <span id="lw_1264165043_26" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Jean-Claude Trichet</span>, president of the <span id="lw_1264165043_27" class="yshortcuts">European
              Central Bank</span>, has a 60 percent favorable rating globally, with
              45 percent in the U.S. and 78 percent in Europe.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1264165043_28" class="yshortcuts">Zhou Xiaochuan</span>, governor of the People’s <span id="lw_1264165043_29" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Bank of China</span>, who
              gets a 42 percent favorable rating overall, gets 39 percent in
              the U.S. and Europe and 51 percent in Asia.</p>
