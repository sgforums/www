You do some light reading on the company and you like their Business. So you think its a good company and you want to invest in it. But you need more info.<br><br>So you go and read the annual report of the company. Be sure to check the balance sheets and analyse all financial statements. You may also like to know how much the directors are paid. I wouldnt invest in a company that pays their director(s) fat salaries unless its justifiable.<br><br>Things to look out for are the company's revenues, assets, earnings per share, debt...etc etc.<br><br>After that, if you need more info, you read the business times or whatever business periodicals to give you an idea of which direction the company's industry is heading.<br><br>That is what fundamental analysis is all about. The above is not exhaustive, there are many other ways to approach it as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
