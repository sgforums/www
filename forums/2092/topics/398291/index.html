              <p>Banks have the right to "vacuum" ur bank accounts to settle your outstanding CCD bills. This is stated in the CCD card agreement. It's also not as if the bank clawed ur cash the first few times you miss payment. You had money, and you obviously choose not to pay back, naturally the bank will take action. I am also sure that the bank had sent many reminders and called you before taking action to freeze ur assets. It is most inconsiderate of you for being irresponsible and yet blaming others.</p>
              <p>Bank is unlikely to unfreeze your monies, unless you can prove you can pay them back. If u have other asset maybe insurance or FD that is not matured yet, sometimes, the bank may accept that, meaning you sign off the proceeds of your insurance or FD to the bank.</p>
              <p>Just FYI, your credit rating will be drastically affected. Credit rating will affect your eligibility to take loans of any kind in future.</p>

              <p>You cant blame the bank. Its your poor financial management that leads to what you are today. <br><br>The only way is to stay poor. Be humble. Stop all the thoughts about your extravagant spending bad habits in the past. <br><br>Get help from your immediate family members to support your family first, and slowly pay your immediate family members the money you owe them through your salary.</p>
