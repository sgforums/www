The increase in the producer price index was twice what had been expected.<br><br>However, economists discounted the jump in vehicle prices as a statistical hiccup that didn't reflect the reality of massive discounting during July by General Motors Corp.  and other automakers.<br><br>"There is nothing in this report that suggests any intensification of inflation pressures at the producer level," said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist for MFR.<br><br>Adjusted to exclude volatile food and energy costs, the core rate of inflation rose 0.4%, the Labor Department reported. Excluding cars and truck prices, the core rate rose 0.2%.<br><br>The July inflation reports show acceleration in energy prices but few signs of inflation in other goods and services. Nothing in either report should alter the Federal Reserve's view that short-term interest rates need to move higher, at a measured pace.<br><br>Stocks traded narrowly mixed in the aftermath of the PPI report, but the data hurt the Treasury market, which abhors inflation because it reduces the value of fixed-income instruments. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note last was recently down 5/32 at 100-5/32 with a yield  of 4.230%.<br><br>The dollar was benefiting from investor conviction that the Fed's likely to keep lifting rates, following the latest inflation reports. The dollar was recently up 0.02% at 109.75 yen, while the euro fell 0.05% to $1.23.<br><br></blockquote></div>

See Economic Calendar.<br><br>The leading indicators increased a revised 1.2% in June, up from 0.9% reported last month. The leading indicators were flat in May.<br><br>The coincident indicators rose 0.1% in July, while the lagging index rose 0.3%.<br><br>The leading indicators are designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months ahead.<br><br>Six of the 10 leading indicators increased in July, led by jobless claims, the interest-rate spread and stock prices.<br><br>Three indicators declined, led by vendor performance and money supply.<br><br>Over the past six months, the leading indicators are up 1.1%, with six of the 10 indicators increasing over that time, "consistent with the economy continuing to expand moderately in the near term," the Conference Board said.<br><br>"The spike in energy prices is one factor in this outlook," said Ken Goldstein, chief economist for the private economic research group.<br><br>"Of more concern is the level of business executive and consumer confidence. Both investment and hiring intentions reflect a level of caution over both pricing and profit strategies," he said.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Manufacturing improves in Philly area<br>Philly Fed index rises to highest level in 4 months</strong><br>Last Update: 1:38 PM ET Aug. 18, 2005<br><br>WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Manufacturing activity improved in the Philadelphia region in August, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said Thursday.<br><br>The Philly Fed index rose to 17.5 in August from 9.6 in July. It's the highest reading since April.<br><br>It was "another report which suggests that manufacturing activity has strengthened in the third quarter," said John Ryding, chief U.S. economist for Bear Stearns.<br><br>The Philly Fed is of interest chiefly because it can help predict the national purchasing managers' survey to be released in two weeks, which in turn is seen as the best single real-time gauge of economic activity.<br><br>Readings over zero indicate most firms surveyed said business was getting better. Thirty-six percent said business was getting better, up from 28% last month.<br><br>The new orders index jumped to 19.8 from 5.0, while the shipments index rose to 17.8 from 12.4. Unfilled orders rose to 7.2, the first positive reading in eight months. Employment rose to 6.3 from 3.4.<br><br>The prices paid index dropped marginally to 25.9 from 26.5. The prices received index fell to a two-year low of 3 from 12, indicating little pricing power.<br><br>"The data still suggest that inflation pressures have moderated from the sharp acceleration in 2004," said analysts for Action Economics.<br><br>In a special question, 76% of firms expect energy prices to rise by an average of 5.4% for the remainder of 2005. In addition, 65% said raw materials prices will rise, by an average of 2.8%, while 52% said intermediate goods prices will rise, by an average of 2%.<br><br>Looking ahead, the six-month outlook rose to 33.4 from 15.3, the highest since December. Over the next six months, 36.7% of firms expect their own pricing power to improve.<br><br>In other reports released Thursday, the Conference Board said the index of leading economic indicators increased 0.1% in July, suggesting moderate growth.<br><br>The Labor Department reported weekly initial jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 316,000 last week, with the four-week average rising by 2,750 to 312,750.<br></blockquote>In short.. US market - Economic activity is up, but moderate growth in the coming 6 months expected.</div>

'This isn't a great surprise,' he said. 'Prices are still going up according to expectations.' A more aggressive tightening of monetary policy would be, in his view, unnecessary.<br><br>Song Seng Woon, economist at GK Global Securities, had predicted a rise of 0.7 per cent. 'It's nothing much to wave a flag about,' he said. 'We expected inflation to come back in July.'
