              <p><img class="attachment-single-post-main wp-post-image" title="400afp_onlineshopping" src="http://yfittopostblogsg.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/400afp_onlineshopping.jpg?w=400" alt="400afp_onlineshopping" width="400" height="250"></p>
              <p>Trust a savvy Singaporean shopper to sniff out a good bargain — even if it’s online.</p>
              <p>In what seems to be a perfect example of true Singaporean 
              bargain-hunting spirit, an increasing number of people are jumping on 
              the online shopping bandwagon to take advantage of the 
              strengthening Singapore dollar.</p>
              <p>Online shopping concierges and internet payment providers report an increase in buying activity from Singapore.</p>
              <p>A spokesman from online payment provider <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=PayPal&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">PayPal</a> told Yahoo! Singapore that it saw an 11 per cent increase in 
              transactions to the UK in May, and a 13 per cent increase in 
              transactions to the US in July.</p>
              <p>“The increases in PayPal online shopping transactions in Singapore 
              correspond very closely to the appreciation of the Singapore currency 
              against both the British pound (GPB) and the US dollar,” said the 
              spokesman.</p>
              <p>Online concierge services, which help with payments to overseas 
              retailers who do not accept credit cards issued here, and ship the 
              purchases to Singapore, also said business has increased this year. </p>
              <p>At <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=CitiGlobeshopper&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Citi Globeshopper</a>,
               an online shopping portal for Citibank clients, the number of shipments
               from the US and UK have increased by some 20 per cent from January to 
              September, as compared to the same period last year, said Mr Vikas 
              Kumar, head of portfolio management and sales at <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Citibank+Singapore&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Citibank Singapore</a>.</p>
              <p>At <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=HopShopGo&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">HopShopGo</a>,
               an online shopping site that allows Singaporeans to buy from US online 
              retailers and launched by comGateway and PayPay, top US merchants 
              include <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Ralph+Lauren&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Ralph Lauren</a>, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Kate+Spade&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Kate Spade</a>, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Drugstore.com&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Drugstore.com </a>and <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Walmart&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Walmart</a>.</p>
              <p><a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Singpost&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">SingPost</a> also reported a ”double-digit increase in our shipping volume year-on-year for both vPOSTUSA and vPOSTEurope”.</p>
              <p>“Several factors have contributed to this, including strengthening of Singapore dollar and greater awareness of <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Vpost&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">vPOST’s</a> online shopping and shipping service,” said a spokeswoman for the local postal service.</p>
              <p>“Shipments from Japan remain relatively flat as the yen 
              strengthened,” she added, perhaps one telling sign of the role a more 
              favourable exchange rate played in increasing consumers’ online shopping
               activities.</p>
              <p>The latest Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) exchange rate show 
              the Singapore dollar has gradually strengthened throughout this year.</p>
              <p>At the start of the year in January, one British pound was going for 
              S$2.26. That fell to S$2.02 in May, and is at S$2.04 for the week ending
               on October 22, according to latest available exchange rates from MAS.</p>
              <p>It is a similar tale for the US dollar. In July, one greenback was 
              going for S$1.40 before dropping even further to S$1.29 last month. In 
              the latest MAS figures, it’s now S$1.30.</p>
              <p>Forex dealer at <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Philips+Futures&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Philip Futures, </a>Samuel Tay, highlighted the US dollar being at a historical low against the Singapore dollar.</p>
              <p>“Compared to last year, the Singapore dollar has risen more than 10 per cent against the US dollar,” he said.</p>
              <p>Economist at <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=DBS+Group&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">DBS Group</a> in Singapore, Irvin Seah, forecasted that by the end of next year, it will take only S$1.22 to buy one US dollar.</p>
              <p>United Overseas Bank’s analysts forecast that the Singapore 
              will reach S$1.27 by year-end against the US currency, and strengthen 
              further to S$1.23 by the end of 2011.</p>
              <p>Industry players expect the online shopping trend to continue.</p>
              <p>“We definitely see the stronger Singapore dollar accelerating this 
              online shopping trend, especially for purchases from the US which is the
               no. 1 online shopping destination for Singaporeans,” said the PayPal 
              spokesman.</p>
              <p>He pointed out, six out of every 10 purchases by Singaporeans through PayPal is for an item from a US retailer.</p>
              <p>Citibank’s Mr Kumar added, “Due to the upcoming festive shopping 
              season, we expect that the number of shipments will increase over the 
              next few months.”</p>
              <p>Undergraduate Clarissa Low, 22, who never shopped online previously, 
              is a recent convert because she wanted to take advantage of the good 
              Sing dollar exchange rate. </p>
              <p>“It is much cheaper to buy clothes from abroad now, and it is so much
               more value for money,” she said. Ms Low now buys from US and UK sites 
              at least once a month.</p>
              <p>However, manager Kathryn Ng, 33, said time constraints make it hard 
              to shop online more and take advantage of the possible “savings”.
