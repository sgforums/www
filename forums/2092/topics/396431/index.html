              <p>don't fall the pumping of the markets by the banks and hedge funds.............the risks far outweighs the gains !</p>
              <p>problems of 2007 and 2008 are still there and it's getting far bigger.........</p>
              <p>in 2009, major banks announced multi-billion dollar profits but they admitted that their profits came from trading (hence the skyrocketing Dow and commodiites) and not from banking activites.</p>
              <p>the banks said their bad loans actually grew ! so you can imagine how much money they made from stocks, etc from retail investors...............</p>
              <p>economy not recovering as well - in US, there are 2-3 banks closing every week since 2009..........not bank branches but whole banks due to bad loans................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this bear rally has gone on far too long...................when it falls, it's gonna be killer..................you can try selling silver since you get paid for shorts...................then when it has gone really low, buy again.............</p>

              <p>I am also in an agony now. Should I sell my current holding or buy more?</p>

              <p>I am in fear that my current profit will suffer, if the bear comes suddenly, as the stock seems to be overvalue and yet financial tools indicates it is bull.  </p>

              <p>depends on what sector you're looking to buy into. I recently made a lot from calling an option on citigroup and bank of america, but now is probably not a good time to go into the financial sector.</p>
              <p>The healthcare sectors looking good, since Obama's healthcare reform passed into motion; however, i dont know if it's too late already. I havnt looked at my portfolio in a while. you know what might be a gamble that may pay off? Super risky, but look into Greek companies.</p>
              <p>Also, because China is going to inflate their currency to slow economic growth, look into large consumer companies, like coke; with the American dollar dropping, and the yen increasing, exports from america will be cheaper while imports to china will be cheaper. So big companies that have offshore stations in China will be a key stock to have in your future portfolio. I mean theres like 1.5billion people in China, look into those developing markets.</p>
              <p>Also, our dependence on oil isnt gonna go away for the next few years, look to invest into oil based companies in developing markets; since oil prices are guaranteed to rise.</p>
              <p>These are just my thoughts. Again i've been rather out of it due to final exams; so im not caught up on current events. but, i'm predicting a double dip to occur sometime in the future. </p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>i've been saying things will collapse since 2004..................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yeah, it's crazy but the thing is the next round of the derivative time bomb should be close..............</p>
              <p>right now, it's basically a casino...............no bad news &gt; risk on.................got bad news &gt; risk off........</p>
              <p>as long as there's no bad news, the banks and funds can continue to pump the market................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i don't see how they can get out of trouble with ever-rising bad loans.............and over 1400 Trillion USD derivative ponzi game time-bomb....................Alt-A, Prime and commercial properties defaults should be in the news this year..............among other bad loans..............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i don't know if it's true but i once read that  different stocks in the DOW has different weightings and opening/closing times so it's possible that the big guns can easily manipulate the DOW to go up/down.............i recall reading that a couple big stocks like micosoft, ibm can already move it up or down becoz their weightings are much heavier than other companies..........</p>
              <p>and of course, the DOW affects everything from other indices, commodities and currencies.................a pretty neat way to manipulate world markets by just controlling 1 index.</p>

              <p>1.  Buy if you can predict that prices will rise further</p>
              <p>2.  Sell if you can predict that prices will fall further</p>
              <p>3.  Buy if you can predict that prices has reached bottom</p>
              <p>4.  Sell if you can predict that prices has reached the top</p>
              <p>The problem is no one can predict accurately 100%.</p>
              <p>Some have used technical analysis, some have used fundamental analysis, some have resorted to "so called insider information" from very reliable sources, some have used advanced software progammes to exploit the rapid changes in stock prices in a matter of minutes or even in seconds, some resorted to lucky charm in different forms, some have resorted to become big players with huge capital to manipulate the stock prices of the companies that they own or targetted.</p>
              <p>Playing with stocks is a game of luck, manipulation, skills and emotional IQ.</p>

              <p>ah yes, the big boys were using neural networks but now they using a dirty trick they call ''high-frequency trading'' or they simply all gang up together.</p>
              <p>most of the big US banks are jewish banks...................no surprise if they work together.............they're also the big players in forex market...........US banks selling the USD.............many of the big hedge funds are probably run by jews too................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but insider info is the best, just imagine if you have close friends working in big companies telling you info ............or friends in the FED, they know all the figures before released in market............</p>

              <p>JPMorgan Chase
              &amp; Co.'s first-quarter profit easily beat expectations Wednesday as &gt;&gt;&gt;
              trading gains helped offset consumer loan losses. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p>JPMorgan Chase,
              the first of the big banks to report earnings for the January-March
              period, said it earned $3.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion a year
              earlier.</p>
              <p>JPMorgan Chase
              said its nonperforming loans, those that are in default or close to
              being in default, totaled $2.7 billion, up $946 million from a year
              earlier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so they actually made 6 billion dollars ??? no need to guess who lost all those money..............i recall reading an article that when oil was at USD147, JP Morgan was the main culprit in the price jump................and also a main player in manipulating the gold/silver markets.</p>
