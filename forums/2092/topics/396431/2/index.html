              <p>Firstly, I don't think you should ask such a question here. You're risking blood and sweat on a forum. Economy now is like a time bomb. usually there will be alot of waves (highs and lows) in after downturn and mere folks like us really cannot predict how it will go. So, high chance of you losing than winning.</p>
              <p>In my general opinion ( I'm not sure right or not, so don't bet on what i say), Japan and China are the 2 most dangerous market right now. Especially baidu.com . Japan is sinking soon and China is still going up. Heathcare is safer, but there's alot of opposition going on, and it takes another few months for the plan to be formalised. If you want to buy shares now, read the news few months back and seek consultation from brokers. Or you might as well wait for second crash.</p>

              <p>Indeed, I do not use TA or FA in buying shares.</p>
              <p>I only buy blue chip company's shares and average down the share price when the prices of these companies fall sharpy during crisis times and collect dividend at other times. At times, when I get very reliable information from very reliable sources, then I will invest. Other times, I just watch people make lots of money from shares as I am very risk-averse.</p>

              <p>Ya lor, I don't mind missing out the opportunities of making more profits. I prefer slow and steady.</p>
              <p>I started investing in blue chips companies' shares more than a decade ago and so my average cost is relatively low. The chance of losing all the money is very small unless these blue chips companies collapse suddenly.</p>
              <p>I sold some shares and locked in the profits during boom times and average down the cost during the crisis times. So, I believe my investment is relatively safe lor though return not very high lah.</p>

              <p>of course the really rich guys can buy a lot at low price they just collect dividend enough liao lor.................but must be at low price otherwise the dividend can't cover loss in share price.</p>

              <p>Hi RM,</p>
              <p>Buying shares when they are falling means buying throughout 2008?</p>
              <p>Instead, we should buy whenever value is present, and economic recovery is in sight... i.e. buy throughout 2009 (which incidentally is what I did). Think about this... throughout 2009, shares were rising (since Mar 09)... If we buy when shares are falling, then you wouldn't buy then... It was the time where shares were rising!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But to me, there's no right or wrong in shares. There's only earning money or losing money... being right does not mean you earn.</p>
              <p>The above is only a simplified view of my way of determining whether to buy... which incidentally isn't that complex either...</p>
