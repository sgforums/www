            <div class='col-md body'>Group revenue in 2Q FY2006 increased 5.6 per cent or S$9.7 million to S$182.1 million due to growth in revenue from all businesses, except buses.<br><br>Operating profit rose 260.8 per cent to S$37.6 million. Excluding the change in the estimated useful life for selected bus models, severance payment in 2Q FY2006, the write-back of retirement benefits provision and impairment loss on goodwill in 2Q FY2005, operating profit for 2Q FY2006 would have been S$35.8 million, an increase of 17.8 per cent.<br><br>PATMI for 2Q FY2006 declined by 50.8 per cent. Excluding the one-off items mentioned above as well as the gain on disposal of an investment and the write-back of deferred and current tax provision in 2Q FY2005, PATMI for 2Q FY2006 improved 14.7 per cent over 2Q FY2005.<br><br>SMRT's President and CEO Saw Phaik Hwa remarked: "SMRT was able to sustain its profitability in a higher operating cost environment, particularly fuel costs. The fare increase partly mitigated the fuel cost increase. SMRT's profitability continued to improve due to the growth of our non-fare businesses."<br><br>The Group declared an interim gross dividend of 1.5 cents per share less 20.0 per cent tax equivalent to a net dividend of S$18.1 million.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Wow...operating profit from buses increase by 45% compared to Q2 2005 even though revenue remained the same.
