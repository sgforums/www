            <div class='col-md body'>renting is actually cheaper than buying a property.. esp for private property. coz supply is greater than demand, owners are willing to lower the rental these days. it is possible to find rental for 4 room condo for less than $1500 these days. few yrs back, my family rented a 3 room condo for $1500 at the highest floor in highview and we only rented for 6 months. that time is when the property mkt was declining.<br><br>but i guess the thing is ppl feel a sense of accomplishment and security if they own the house even if they have to play thousands every month for the mortgage payment. I think it depends alot on your financial situation, what you intend to do and stuff.<br><br>im thinking like during good mkt times sell house, then go rent. and when the property value drop, go n buy. but it's hard to time the mkt. plus watever profit u made from the sale during good times, my be eaten away by the rental. so it's not an easy game</div>

If primary, then of course buy lah.<br><br>Renting is only for.....1) not enough down payment or can't afford mortgage; 2) not sure where to buy, so rent first and then scout for permanent residence; 3) temporary accommodation, like awaiting to emigrate or awaiting closing of your purchase.<br><br>Rent for sure is money down the drain.  In my whole life, I have only rented twice and for a year each time.  First was we bought a newly built home and waiting for closing.

E.,g. the higher the return the higher the risk, which also mean higher opportunity cost.<br><br>At the moment, I think it is hard to find any low risk investment that will give you 20% to 100% returns. Yes, investing in stocks and equities you can get this kinda of return, but for 4 years in a row, I am not sure.<br><br></div>

I was thinking on a long term basis..<br><br>say, there is a 4-rm HDB apartment. Mr A wants to buy it, Mr B wants to rent it.<br><br>Mr A buys it at 300k plus 10k renovation. Pay 20% downpayment, and gets a bank loan at abt 5% interest over 25 years. The downpayment and reno will be spread over the loan period. Means he has to pay abt (liabilities) -&gt; 13k per year.<br><br>Mr B rents it at 1.1k per month (expenses) -&gt; Pays 13.2k per year<br><br>Both have to pay utilities anyway, so that is out of the question. In any unfortunate downturn of economy, both will be sacked from their jobs and evicted from their houses anyway.. so that's out oso.<br><br>The thing is, after the 25yr Loan period.:<br>- Mr A owns the flat,<br>- while Mr B has nothing, has to continue paying rents, and constantly worry about being evicted by the land lord in the meantime.<br><br>Since you are annually spending the same amt, if you intend to live in it for a long time, how is renting a house better than buying? Or have I left out some hidden cost?<br>(My analysis may be wrong.. please feel free to comment <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )</div></blockquote>u forgot about insurance, n town council stuff n the tv license</div>
