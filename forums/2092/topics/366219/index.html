              <p>KUALA LUMPUR, June 30 - Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Tuesday
              unveiled new measures to boost investment in the country's slumping
              economy which has been hit hard by a global economic downturn that has
              sapped demand for its exports.</p>
              <p>Najib told an investment conference on Tuesday that it will end a
              ruling requiring that the Foreign Investment Committee , a government
              authority, approves investments in non-strategic sectors.</p>
              <p>He also
              said property deals not involving companies owned by the majority
              Malays, who are seen as "sons of the soil" or bumiputra, will no longer
              require FIC approval.</p>
              <p>"We have become a successful middle income
              economy. But we cannot and will not be caught in the middle income
              country trap. We need to make the shift to a high income economy or we
              risk losing growth momentum in our economies and vibrancy in our
              markets," Najib said.</p>
              <p>The Southeast Asian country also plans to
              raise foreign ownership in investment funds and stock brokerages as
              well as address the issue of increasing the liquidity in the stock
              market. For a list of reforms, click [ID:nUSN008111]</p>
              <p>Malaysia,
              once one of Asia's leading economic reformers, has seen its business
              model of low value electronics exports and commodities exports hit hard
              by the rise of China and investment flows have dried up as other
              countries have liberalised faster.</p>
              <p>At the same time, strict
              government controls that reserve a certain proportion of the economy
              for ethnic Malays, the so-called bumiputra policy, has hurt growth and
              fostered corruption, critics charge.</p>
              <p>"There is a sense that the
              liberalisation measures fail to excite the markets but it all boils
              down to the need for the government to toe the line between attracting
              foreign investment inflows and keeping the pro-bumiputras part of the
              population satisfied," said Joanna Tan, economist with Forecast Pte Ltd.</p>
              <p>"Stocks
              which are already buoyed by today's improved sentiment and possible
              window dressing should also find support on the news. Further pressure
              on the USD/MYR is expected."</p>
              <p>The Malaysian ringgit &lt;MYR=&gt;
              gained 0.6 percent to 3.517 per dollar after the announcement. The
              benchmark KL Composite index &lt;.KLSE&gt; inched up 0.4 percent to
              1,080.23 points</p>
              <p>This is the third reform announcement since Najib took office in April.</p>
              <p>Earlier,
              he announced measures to liberalise some sectors of the service economy
              as well as banks and insurers, although both of those previous
              announcements were measures that had already been promised already but
              not implemented.</p>
              <p>Even though investors have recovered from
              jitters caused by the global financial crisis, foreign portfolio
              investment is still pulling out of Malaysia, a Southeast Asian country
              of 27 million people.</p>
              <p>In 2008 there was an outflow of 92.3
              billion ringgit in portfolio investment &lt;MYFLO=ECI&gt;, starting in
              the second quarter of the year when shock electoral losses for the
              National Front coalition that has ruled Malaysia for 51 years coincided
              with the build up of the current global financial crisis.</p>
              <p>Those
              flows still haven't returned and investment bank HSBC is forecasting
              there will have been another outflow of portfolio capital to the tune
              of 50 billion ringgit ($14.14 billion) when first-quarter current
              account data is published later on Tuesday.</p>
