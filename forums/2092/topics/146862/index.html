Per capita gross national product, or GNP, rose from US$528<br>($871) in 1965 to US$25,191 last year - an increase of over 47 times.<br><br>...<br><br>Per capita income comparisons suggest that there is still plenty of room.<br>Ireland, with a population of four million, has a per capita income of<br>US$34,280. Finland, with a population of 5.2 million, has US$32,790 per<br>capita, while Switzerland, with a population of  7.4 million, has<br>US$48,230 per capita.<br><br>Singapore has a high competitive ranking of third place, according to the<br>Switzerland-based International Institute for Management Development<br>(IMD), but it ranks 28th in per capita income. Something is clearly amiss.<br><br><strong>What's wrong?</strong><br><br>Unlike advanced economies, Singapore is investment-driven, particularly by<br>foreign investment. Investment in machinery and equipment (38 per cent of<br>total) is closely correlated with the electronic cycle. Investment in<br>construction and works (47 per cent) is languishing because of the long<br>downturn in the property sector.<br><br>There was therefore negative growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation for<br>1998 to 1989 and 2001 to 2003, which resulted in poor economic growth.<br>Consumption spending did not help, as the wage share of GDP is only about<br>42 per cent, unlike the advanced countries share of over 55 per cent.<br><br>Fiscal policy is normally deflationary because, in view of the openness of<br>the economy, counter-cyclical deficit spending is regarded as ineffective.<br><br>Monetary policy is the outcome of exchange rate policy, which tends to<br>favour a strong Singapore dollar. The theory is that, weakening the dollar<br>would not be helpful, because the import content of manufacturing exports<br>is high at 70 per cent.<br><br>The strong dollar policy is also deemed to be necessary for a major<br>financial centre. Other services tend to be neglected in the scenario and<br>consequently, business services, tourism and the medical sectors suffered<br>in the aftermath of the Asian Currency Crisis.<br><br>Small countries like Singapore will face increasing economic volatility<br>due to the accelerating pace of globalisation, quickened by the rapid<br>ascent of China, the liberalisation of the Eastern European countries and<br>India.<br><br><strong>A giant in the neighbourhood</strong><br><br>The rapid rise of China alone poses severe threats: It took the United<br>States 130 years to increase its share of global GDP from  1.8 per cent to<br>27.3 per cent but China will take only 35 years to increase its share from<br>3.2 per cent (1980) to 20.3 per cent (2015).<br><br>What China offers the world is a huge internal market but Singapore's<br>non-oil exports are mostly electronic semi-manufactures, which can be made<br>elsewhere, especially in China and India.<br><br>What we need to develop is branded goods for the huge consumer markets<br>that are developing in China and India.<br><br>Singapore has opted for high-tech and highly capital-intensive investments<br>such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Unfortunately, the<br>job creation capability is very limited and the input-output linkages with<br>the economy small.<br><br>Moreover, much of the research and development, or R&amp;D, talent has to be<br>imported. In the meantime, established companies such as Creative<br>Technology and Maxtor pulled out their factories, causing about 5,000 job<br>losses each. The high-tech lab left behind by homegrown Creative<br>Technology is no consolation.<br><br>Herein lies a lesson in growing our own multinational corporations (MNCs):<br>Their bottom line, and not patriotism, dictates the location of<br>production.<br><br>If this is so, then the investment in our external wing will not assure<br>Singapore of jobs and dependable income from abroad, as production moves<br>abroad and even headquarters may not be here for long, as foreign tax<br>incentives prove irresistible.<br><br><strong>Don't think small</strong><br><br>Singapore has to brace itself for an industrial hollowing-out process. The<br>current account surplus amounts to over 30 per cent of GDP, which is<br>unprecedented!<br><br>Profits of MNCs and foreign nationals not re-invested here mean an outflow<br>of capital. Has Singapore reached a stage where such firms and foreigners<br>are pulling out more than they bring in? The Government needs to monitor<br>the situation carefully.<br><br>Singaporean investors have taken the Government's "Go regional, go global"<br>message too seriously. There are Singapore firms that, after establishing<br>a foothold in China and learning the ropes of doing business there,<br>re-locate their Singapore factories overseas.<br><br>It is time to sit down with our businessmen and talk about what to invest<br>and how to create jobs here. If everybody thinks that Singapore is too<br>small, it will grow even smaller.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">We also need to learn from other countries like Switzerland about how to<br>keep unemployment down (4 per cent) even with low economic growth. Foreign workers comprise one-quarter of Switzerland's labour force.</span><br><br>When there is a downturn, foreign workers with short-term permits absorb<br>the impact. Finland, on the other hand, has only  45,000 foreign workers:<br>Its structural unemployment is consequently more severe - 8.8 per cent.<br>The Finnish economy is high tech but very volatile: Its fortunes depend<br>very much upon Nokia. It should also be noted that much of its research is<br>industry-oriented rather than the frontier type.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Singapore has to move towards "value innovation" rather than solely<br>patent-producing type innovations.</span><br><br><strong>Value innovation</strong><br><br>Dell Computers is a good example of value-innovation, based on a concept<br>of zero-inventories and removing the middlemen role. "Singapore girl" has<br>been a highly successful Singapore Airlines value-innovation. Toyota's<br>Lexus is another example: Providing premium quality at less cost than BMW<br>or Mercedes Benz.<br><br>As the China and India markets grow there will be great opportunities to<br>exploit, but Singapore has to be nimble enough in policy-making and skills<br>to take advantage.<br><br>The issue of immigrant labour has to be examined carefully. We need<br>foreign talent but we should not destroy Singaporeans' morale in the<br>process. It would be an irony if, because of discouragement, homegrown<br>talent migrates abroad while new talent comes in. Somewhere in there is a<br>balance. We also need young immigrants to alleviate the ageing problem<br>without exacerbating structural unemployment in the process.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To sum up, for Singapore, the halcyon days of depending largely on the<br>MNCs of the world to generate rapid growth are over. They have greener<br>pastures now and Singapore has to discover niches for itself quickly or<br>else adjust painfully to a new era of much slower growth.</span><br><br>Structural unemployment can only get worse in a slow-growth environment<br>and the ageing of the population will compound the problem<br><br>To alleviate these problems, the Government will have to manage<br>immigration policy carefully, use macroeconomic policies judiciously, and<br>draw down the dividends of the problematic external wing to re-distribute<br>in ways that will not erode the work ethic.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The writer is a Practice Professor of Economics at  the School of<br>Economics and Social Sciences in  Singapore Management University (SMU).<br>His views do not necessarily reflect those of SMU.</span></div>
