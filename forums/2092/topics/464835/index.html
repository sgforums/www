              <p><span>Low 
              interest rates certainly make housing an attractive asset class. After 
              all, the 30-year fixed mortgage in the United States is around 3.50 
              percent, the 15-year fixed mortgage rate is 2.94 percent. These are all 
              time low mortgage rates and many investors and potential home owners are
               trying to take advantage of these attractive interest rates. The 
              Federal Reserve is also buying approximately $40 billion worth of 
              mortgage backed securities to help inflate the housing sector.</span><br><br><span> As many of you know, in 2002 the Federal Reserve Bank cut the fed funds
               interest rate down to 1.00 percent. This rate cut by the central bank 
              helped to bring mortgage rates down from 8.0 percent (2000) to roughly 
              5.8 percent in 2003 and 2004. This move by the central bank was done in 
              order to stimulate the stocks and housing markets from the technology 
              bubble and the 9-11 tragedy which sent the country into a severe 
              recession.</span><br><br><span> Well, the low interest rates worked for a while causing the United 
              States to have a five year economic rebound. People in the United States
               went crazy buying and selling homes. Banks were lending money to anyone
               that could sign their name on the dotted line. No documented income 
              loans soared as the house became the greatest investment to man. I 
              remember going to a street carnival and seeing the real-estate booth 
              with more people around it than the cotton candy stand. That was a sure 
              sign of a top in housing, but it lasted longer than anyone could 
              believe. Unfortunately, as we all know this housing bubble lead to the 
              greatest credit crisis since the Great Depression. The stock markets 
              plunged and many leading investment firms such as Lehman Brothers, Bear 
              Stearns, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Merrill Lynch, Countrywide, and 
              countless other firms either failed or were bought for pennies on the 
              dollar. The taxpayer had to bailout most large banks and financial 
              institutions so theoretically the entire financial system as we know it 
              failed.</span><br><br><span> Now the Federal Reserve (U.S. central bank) has lowered the fed funds 
              interest rate down to zero percent. The rate has been this way since 
              December 2008. The central banks have also implemented three 
              quantitative easing programs (bond buying programs) since that time in 
              order to inflate stock markets and to add liquidity to the financial 
              system. In all fairness, the major stock indexes have mostly recovered 
              all of the losses from the decline in 2008. Unfortunately, we all know 
              that you can print money forever, and inflation is usually a byproduct 
              of this so-called stimulus.</span><br><br><span> The housing market has been rebounding. Traders can simply look at a 
              chart of the leading housing stocks and see how the sector has been a 
              major winner since October 2011. Leading housing stocks such as Toll 
              Brothers Inc (NYSE:TOL), Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN), D R Horton Inc 
              (NYSE:DHI), and KB Home (NYSE:KBH) have been some of the strongest 
              stocks in the market recently. If this important and leading stock 
              sector starts to give up its gains and go into correction it will be a 
              sign that the major stock indexes will probably start to falter. The 
              Federal Reserve is certainly trying to cause another housing boom. This 
              will generally help companies such as Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD), Lowe's 
              Cos (NYSE:LOW), Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW), Mohawk Industries Inc 
              (NYSE:MHK) and many others. So sure, the central bank is definitely 
              trying to keep the housing market strong. More construction workers will
               be needed and this added workforce trickles down to other sectors just 
              as it did in 2003 through 2007. </span><br><br><span> Is there another housing bubble developing? No, there does not seem to 
              be a housing bubble taking place this time around because the banks are 
              doing their job, they are now only lending to qualified borrowers. 
              Unfortunately, it takes a crisis for these financial institutions to do 
              their job. So another housing bubble is unlikely, but a commodity and 
              stock bubble is certainly more probable down the road. </span><br><br><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.inthemoneystocks.com/images/stories/Nick/mhk%201.22.13.jpg" alt=""></p>
