            <div class='col-md body'>Special Thanks go out to: Mr Hata-San for giving me the image of the Pacific Coffee Company to base this story on, A good friend who shared a song with me, Pacman for egging me to post it, M. Scott Peck's "The Road Less Travelled" and a girl who broke my heart  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>0845 hrs. 17th November 2001. Steve climbed out of bed. Â“Damn, late for work againÂ…Â”, he muttered half<br>heartedly. Half an hour later he was out of the apartment.<br><br>Steve didnÂ’t really want to go to work actually. Everyday has become such a chore now, but yet strangely,<br>the routine was addictive to him. Almost like a drug. Slowly, it killed him both spiritually and mentally. His<br>routine- wake up late, work, return home and sleep late was only disturbed by the weekends, which he<br>would spend either at home or out wandering the streets.<br><br>On the train, Steve never sat down, even if there was an empty seat. Â“ThereÂ’s probably someone else who<br>needs it more then meÂ”, he always told himself. Every morning, he would feel as if part of him was rotting<br>away into decay.<br><br>He found joy, sometimes, in observing the on-goings in the train. Little acts of kindness, little faces of<br>innocence of children and most of all, he was fascinated how couples clung on to each other tightly for<br>support in the crowded train.<br><br>Â“They seem like they need each other so much, as if they were one. As if one were to be gone, the other<br>would cease to exist.Â”  He always thought to himself. No one really ever seemed to need him so much. And<br>he never seemed to need anyone. Such was his life. Â“29 years old and still an eccentric loner.Â” He smirked.<br><br>He rubbed his unshaved chin. He hasnÂ’t bothered to shave anymore. Â“Save money on shaving cream and<br>shavers.Â” He always said whenever his friends bugged him. He was beginning to bother less about his own<br>appearance now. Day by day, he was giving up a little by little on himself.<br><br>Steve decided to stop going to work again. Â“I need a break today lah.Â” He always told himself. He knew it<br>was wrong but then again nothing seems to be going right in his life.<br><br>Perhaps it was by fate that he stumbled upon this cafÃ©. This Pacific Coffee Company. This little coffee<br>place which would change his life forever.<br><br>He took his mug of coffee and sauntered to the most comfortable looking seat. He never sat beside the<br>windows anymore. He just didnÂ’t want to face the world anymore. All the chaos, all the frantic pacing and<br>all the people always in a mad rush to get nowhere.<br><br>He sipped his aromatic coffee. Â“AhhhhhhhÂ…Â….Â” At least there were still some things in life that he enjoyed.<br>The bitter yet sweet taste of coffee. He could smell the sweetness and aroma of the coffee but yet he<br>could only taste bitterness.<br><br>Kind of like his perspective of life. Steve could always see the hope and happiness that his dreams and life<br>would bring him. But yet, all he could experience was the bitter loneliness and sadness of life. Â“HappinessÂ”<br>he thought, always seemed to elude him.<br><br>Gazing into his half empty mug, he recollected memories of his last love. He still loved her dearly. Or was it<br>foolish pride which just refused to let her go? He gripped his mug tightly. Her enchanting smile and sparkling<br>eyes flashed in his mind again. As much joy as this images brought, they also brought him excruciating pain.<br><br>It only served to remind him of how he would never possess them. What did he do wrong? He was as<br>sincere as a little boy who would kiss her mommy goodnight. But yet, it seemed to him, that sincerity never<br>worked in situations like this. Never had he wanted someone so badly before, never had he tried so hard<br>before. Still, he would never reach the finish line no matter how hard he tried. She was always out of his<br>grasp.<br><br>Tears welled up in his eyes as he thought of her. Â“Silly meÂ” He thought. Â“Why is my life in a mess?? Why do<br>I feel like a piece of shit?Â” He screamed at himself inwardly. Â“You bloody coward! Stand up and fight for<br>your dreams!Â” He shouted inwardly again.<br><br>His mind was a whirlpool of swirling thoughts right now. Outside, a heavy shower started to fall.<br><br>He started to wonder why he stopped caring for himself. Why he always craved for the concern of others,<br>as if hoping that he would start caring for himself again if others did. Â“My parents never really cared for me,<br>no one ever didÂ” He thought bitterly.<br><br>For once in his life, he wondered if he felt worthless because of the way he grew up. How much self worth<br>could someone feel if he always felt uncared for and unneeded whilst he grew up? Was it his parentÂ’s fault?<br>Was it the worldÂ’s fault that he became the man that he was now? Indeed, he had always grown up a silent<br>and obedient boy. Always oppressed and suppressed by his much rowdier and popular sibling.<br><br>In school, he was always the quiet one. He looked studious and nerdy but inwardly, he always hated<br>studying. Thus he grow up into a misfit. Someone who looked like a nerd, behaved somewhat like one but<br>was never one. Â“Shit, I even donÂ’t fit into the most unpopular speciesÂ” He always lamented as a kid.<br><br>Back in the cafÃ©, people were wondering why there was his strange man clutching his head in his hands<br>mumbling to himself.<br><br>He sought to seek some order from all this chaos and confusion in himself but found none.<br><br>Â“Sir, would you like a refill?Â” A bright chirpy voice said. A warm smile greeted him and it melted his heart.<br>Â“Y-yesÂ….Â” Was all he could mutter. Linda. Linda was her name he noticed as he spied her nametag.<br><br>Â“HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!Â” He guffawed loudly all of a sudden, much to the amusement and disgust of the<br>many other people in the cafÃ©. Why had he been so silly all this time he thought. All it took was the warm<br>smile of a stranger to banish all those dreadful thoughts away.<br><br>Against that smile radiating warmth and love, all his troubles had seemed so insignificant.<br><br>Â“If all it takes is just one sincere smile to banish a lifetimeÂ’s worth of agony, maybe life isnÂ’t so bad after<br>all.Â” He chuckled.<br><br>The rain had stopped as Steve stepped out of the cafÃ©, the warm rays of light shone on him. Â“Maybe love<br>is the answerÂ” He thought to himself again. All it took was one smile to rejuvenate him.<br><br>Â“I wonder what one kiss would do to me?Â” He grinned broadly as he stepped off into the busy streets and<br>away from the cafÃ©.<br><br>This little cafÃ©, by the roadside of imagination. This Pacific Coffee Company.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I punched the backspace key furiously. This is not good enough. I know I can do better than this. Where is all the inspiration in the world when I need it most? Why are the creative cells born in me retiring when I need really them to work? I cannot find a reason and I just blame it on the howling of the aircon.<br><br>I lie on my bed. I have decided to take a break from writing. Maybe I am just trying too hard, but then I thought it would be worth it since it is for her. Yes, her, and that perfect smile of her's materialise in my mind. There, let it stay there, I hope she is smiling now too, it always makes me happy to know that she is smiling.<br><br>I got up, breaking myself from the enchanting hold she has on me, I think I go get myself a cup of Earl Grey, I always think better when I drink Earl Grey. I hate coffee, they give me gastric cramps. I opened the cabinet, and to my dismay, the little box in which I keep my twinings is empty. OH I forgot, I already had 3 cups tonight. I cursed under my breath into the lonesome night to remind myself to buy some at Cold Storage tomorrow.<br><br>I have been thinking that I am addicted to the drink, most probably, maybe I should buy Ceylon tommorow instead. Then, I think of her again, she first drank Earl Grey at the cafe when we first met. Then Dajeerling the second. She told me that she prefers tea to coffee, "COFFEE SUCKS!" I remembered her saying it with a frown on her pretty little head.<br><br>I sat down again, settling for a cup of Milo instead. This time, I am determine to write something for her. It is her birthday after all, and try as I might to act as if I am not that much concern, I can't, I simply have to do something, at least a poem to satisfy my yearnings to please her. Tired though I am, I find energy by bathing in the memories I have of her, every movement and evey smile, every scent and every glance, I remember them. It would be too difficult to forget them, for I know I purposely think of them at least once everyday so that they be engraved deep into my mind. I thought maybe this would be a good way to test if I will get tired of them easily, but so far, I seem to enjoy them more and more.<br><br>Tonight is going to be a very enjoyable one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought I was a pretty open person as far as physical intimacy goes. But they sure were not shy in displays of passion in public. He positioning himself behind her, and she wasn't moving at all. At least not before he made himself comfortable behind her. They didn't even notice me. Or perhaps they did, and decided I was insignificantly irrelevant. Was that thrusting? I wasn't sure as I left my glasses elsewhere.<br><br>I flicked the two horny houseflies humping on the table in front of me, in the direction of the tea drinkers. I really didn't need pests to remind me how lonely and bored I am. In fact, they should count themselves lucky that I didn't try to help by leaving them alone. For ten minutes under my muggacino.</div>

What the fuck~! Go stare back at your own screen, I thought fiercely.<br><br>And I reserved the fiercest stare at the woman who was sitting beside me. Why can't she just go and get a decent haircut? Doesn't she know that her "fly-away" hair is such a bother!?<br><br>Such hot weather and I am practically on fire, yet she still wanna flick her hair towards me and that was making my blood boil even further.<br><br>I took a deep drag and tried to concentrate on my own stuff... I couldn't help lighting another cigarette although I promised my husband to quit... I was just too pissed.<br><br>Putting down the ciggy in the ashtray, I flexed my fingers and started typing rapidly on the keyboard. I needed to finish this quickly before my next appointment.<br><br>I didn't expect the commotion Â½ hour later.<br><br>Everybody was staring at the woman with the super long hair running around the cafe shouting...<br><br>MUAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA~<br><br>Her hair was SMOKING~!<br><br>I looked into my ashtray and found my stick gone. I bit on my lips to prevent myself laughing and watched as the waiters came to her rescue to put out the "fire".<br><br>I packed up my things and paid my bill at the counter. I bet she will never ever flick her hair all over again after this incident.<br><br>------------------<br>You are poison... poison running through my veins...<br><br>Poison...

Good tools even though they don't bite. Provides her with some security. No matter how much others stared, they were afraid of her dogs.<br><br>Today is yet another day where she is enjoying making a nuisance of herself again.

            <div class='col-md body'>darn it! now iÂ’ve a dilemma, do i still go for coffee thatÂ’s terribly overpriced when heÂ’s not there anymore, i asked myself. as i passed by a mirror, i took an instinctive look at myself and grinned to myself and on seeing the wrinkles, i grimaced. geez, iÂ’m getting more vain by the day, i realized. these days, any reflective surfaces i chance upon, i never fail to look at them, i never used to do that all the time when i was younger. hmmm, i pondered, am i getting insecure? then i remembered someone telling me that to her, itÂ’s a duty that she must look at any reflective surfaces and sheÂ’s only 21, so i feel kind of comforted.<br><br>as i neared the coffee jointÂ’s entrance, another thought struck me, should i take down my glasses? i was told that i look prettier that way, friendlier and thus more approachable. hmmmmm ... getting desparate for any manÂ’s attention, my conscience mocked me? nay and i decided to leave the glasses on because without them, iÂ’m as blind as a bat and all guys would look extremely attractive even if they actually suck big time. they would have to be within kissing distance for me to know if theyÂ’re yandao or not. hmmm ... guy watching is not such a bad idea after all.<br><br>i entered the cafe as nonchalantly as i could, gave it a quick lookover and went to the counter to order a cup of iced blended mocha. i think iÂ’m acquiring a taste for this since i was last suckered into trying a free cuppa by Borders cafe. as i waited to be served, i sighed deeply: lean pickings, lean lean pickings. whatÂ’s wrong with people? the people here are so young, in the mid twenties tops, donÂ’t thirtysomethings drink coffee no more?<br><br>i can see the beautiful back of a long straight hair gal typing furiously away at the keyboard and that narrow waist. another sigh, long beautiful hair. i had that once, as i ran my fingers through my current short crop. narrow waist? i donÂ’t even want to go there.<br><br>finally, my mocha is ready, taking it, i walked to the only window seat available and settled myself comfortably into a chair and looked my fill of the occupants within the cafe again.<br><br>duh, lean pickings and my eyes settled on the lone guy sitting two tables away from me. he was morose looking enough and what's so interesting on the table? look up, look up, so that i can see if youÂ’re yandao or not. cÂ’mon, look up! duh! another moron engrossed in his own thoughts. i flicked my eyes to the others and got more depressed as time passes. clear skin, unwrinkled, sparkling eyes and long luscious hair, what made me cut mine off in the first place?<br><br>i turned my attention to my mocha and fished out a book from my bag, might as well read, Get a Grip on Philosophy, dull, dull, dull. i need a grip on life, not philosophy and threw the book on the table in digust. i looked up just in time to see the guy opposite me flicking his hand and something flew. my goodness! were those houseflies? iÂ’ve a good mind to tell on this joint to the health department.<br><br>i returned my gaze to the guy, hey, not too bad looking but definitely no Brad Pitt, pity. and duh, heÂ’s way too young and whatÂ’s he staring at? doesnÂ’t he know that itÂ’s rude to stare? what was it that someone told me once again? oh yeah, staring with no romantic intent should be outlawed and doesnÂ’t he know that staring in Singapore can be a deadly exercise? pissed at being stared at, i prepared myself to outstare him and then a thought crossed my mind, is he shortsighted as i spied his cool sunshades by the side of the table? hmmm ... and why isnÂ’t he as cool as his sunshades, was my second thought.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 11 November 2000).]</div>

I thought I was successful.<br>I thought I had known love and all that love can bring.<br>But the gentle breeze, blowing softly through the leaves, carries the smell of wild flowers and still wilder beasts, and what you brought into my life can never be assessed.<br><br>We are so very different, you and I. And yet so much the same.<br>And our differences merge with our similarities,<br>giving rise to something special and unique.<br>We talk.<br>Of all the things I value about this thing that is us,and there are so many I often lose count,<br>I value most the way we talk about any thing any time any where.<br>And each time I listen to you, each time I ponder what you`ve said,<br>I learn something new.

So hurt.<br>You changed that, as you`ve changed so much else.<br>You taught me how to love.<br><br>I wish you knew the me of before,<br>as you know so well the me of today,<br>so you could see the difference knowing you has made.<br>You`ve changed my life in so many ways,<br>in ways small and ways important,<br>in ways you`ll never know nor understand.<br>The impact you`ve had on me,<br>on the way I feel and think and act,<br>will endure forever.

            <div class='col-md body'>anticipation.<br><br>anticipation tantalizes, anticipation heightens, anticipation kills.<br><br>it had been two months since she last saw him, her hearts pounds with anticipation as she awaits his presence in the cozy cafe. she recalled their first meeting with great pleasure. she had been sent to Hong Kong on a project just this summer and discovered that she loved Hong Kong and its Pizza Huts, they are so much cheaper over there that she indulged in eating that for lunch and dinner for the first few weeks of her stay almost daily, the only grouse she had was that they donÂ’t stock on the red chilli pepper they have in Singapore.<br><br>that night as usual, she was having dinner alone and after placing her order of personal Hawaiian pizza, soup, Pepsi and ice cream, she sat back to wait for them to be delivered. suddenly a voice asked, Â“youÂ’re from Singapore?Â” she turned her head in the direction of the voice and her heart skipped a beat, Â“yeah, how did you know?Â” she asked as she stared at the most gorgeous face she has ever seen. Â“a wild guess. iÂ’m from Singapore too.Â” he replied. Â“i would have never known, you donÂ’t speak like one.Â” she answered. Â“how so?Â” he asked. Â“you sound Caucasian and your voice is really melodious.Â” she said shyly, trying very hard not to stare. Â“do you mind if i join you? it sucks having to have meals alone, iÂ’ve been doing that for the last week.Â” he asked politely. she couldnÂ’t believe her luck, a most gorgeous guy asking to join her, a brown mouse, for dinner? casting her usual reserve aside, she said yes meekly, almost happily, certainly happily.<br><br>Â“honey, iÂ’m sorry iÂ’m late,Â” an achingly familiar voice cuts into her reminiscence. she turned her head and looked into the eyes of the one man she loves beyond life. she was almost choked with emotion and barely managed a Â“itÂ’s alright, youÂ’re not late, it was me whoÂ’s early.Â” there was a slight awkwardness before he said Â“iÂ’ve missed you so much these two months.Â” he took her hand and dragged her closer to him, necessitating her to move her chair closer to him. Â“i love you,Â” he continued. Â“i love you too and iÂ’ve missed you too,Â” she replied, staring deeply into his eyes, trying to gauge his reaction, he shifted his glance, she tugged her hand away and he let her.<br><br>Â“whatÂ’s your decision?Â” she asked the dreaded question. Â“i love you, i need you and i want you, for always.Â” he replied, looking earnestly into her eyes, trying to convince her of his sincerity and love, she kept silent, felt a cold hand wrapping round her heart. unable to stand her silence, he went on Â“weÂ’re getting married at the end of the year.Â” he looked at her, pleading for her understanding. outwardly she maintained a facade of quiet dignity and strength, in truth, her heart felt the cold grip of reality and she wondered if people who suffered heart attacks felt as much pain as she did.<br><br>Â“why did you ask me out today?Â” she questioned. Â“i missed you badly and i just needed to see you again, wonÂ’t you reconsider?Â” he implored as he grasped both of her hands. she was tempted to laugh in his face, instead she decided to do something else. closing the gap between them, she kissed him, gently and felt his response, it was to be the sweetest and most poignant kiss sheÂ’ll ever have. after kissing for what seemed like minutes, she leaned slightly back, looked into his eyes she whispered softly against his lips, Â“i love you too, i need you too and i want you too, youÂ’ve no idea how very much and i want you to know that and always remember it.Â” she could see the relief in his eyes and continued huskily Â“and when you burn with aching desire for me in the stillness of the night and seek release, i pray youÂ’ll never, ever, ever find it. you were not free to love me, why do you make me love you so?Â” she narrowed the gap between them again and gave him the most passionate kiss ever, putting all her love and passion into it, caught by surprise, he too gave in to the pleasure, oblivious to the gasps and stares of other fellow coffee drinkers. finally, she gave his lower lip a sharp nip but it didnÂ’t draw blood before breaking the kiss. she stood up, picked up her handbag and walked away without a backward glance, her broken heart crying as she exited the cafe.<br><br>summer fling, was it a summer fling? how apt. her name is summerfling too. she recalled their last conversation in Hong Kong two months ago when she happened to answer a phone call which shattered her world, they had been lovers by then and so she had told him, Â“when you choose me to be your love, call me, if you still intend to marry her, please donÂ’t contact me again. ever.Â” when she found out too late that he was already betrothed to another.<br><br>she has never felt more desolate, lonely and stupid for being hopeful as she did when she walked out that cafe.<br><br>[This message has been edited by summerfling (edited 11 November 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A slight drizzle, a cold gust of wind. And what have we got here. A new cafe?<br><br>I proceeded into the cafe and looked around. The first thing that caught my attention is this piece of paper lying so blatently ahead of me. Bending down for a closer look, I realise that it was a cheque...... *delights*, drats, a crossed one, with such a long signature as well. Sighz, is there no cleaner for this cafe??? I continued and ignored the litter as did the rest of the people.<br><br>I got my cup of hot chocolate and proceeded to my terminal. As I got seated, an overpowering scent, of barbequed stingray (???), caught my attention. I quickly scanned the whole cafe to find out where the smell was from. Hmm......<br><br>Sitting ahead of me was this lady, should be around her early thirties......not too bad looking......would have looked better if she had longer hair. Oh shit, she is staring at me now. Should have kept my shades on. What to do what to do.......better look away.<br><br>Caught a glimpse of another lady, seems to be making a scene for herself with another guy. Dunt really know what she did, but she has that spiteful look in her eyes. Pity. Especially since she looks quite good...... oh well...... better not fantasize......<br><br>The dragging of the seat, a woman with pale features making her way out of the cafe. Such sorrow apparent in her face. My heart goes out for her. If there was something I could do for her, I would. I pray that whatever that is weighing her heart down will disappear as she steps out of the cafe.<br><br>Oh well.......what am I doing. Wasting precious time when I could be surfing the net. What do I see??? Liverpool thrashes Manchester United 10-0. Gosh.......Manchester United is such a loser.

            <div class='col-md body'>I walked towards the cafÃ© with thunderstorm brewing behind me. The weather reflected my mood exactly, and darn, why canÂ’t I answer those questions to my satisfaction, I thought morosely. The door appearing in sight of me, I swing it wildly, hopping to catch somebody in the face. That was how mad I wasÂ…until I saw her, with him.<br><br>Â“Oh, hiÂ’ she exclaimed when she saw me at the entrance.<br>Â“Hey, I am surprise to see you here!Â” I meant it sincerelyÂ…that is, until I saw that guy beside her.<br>Â“Hi, how are youÂ” he grinned, rather nastily if you ask me, while slipping his arms around her.<br>Â“Surviving, and you?Â” I grinned back, with a twinge of malice in it.<br>She noticed and grabs hold of his hand, and make an excuse that they need to run off for a show nearby.<br>Â“ Sure, no problem. Hope to see you againÂ” I muttered to them as they walked past me.<br>Â“Yeah! Will do that!Â” She grins back. How much of that is courtesy is beyond me. All I know is that I am hopping mad.<br>God is so unfair to me. Why does she have to end up with that asshole? I am a thousand times better than he is and I can give her so much love than what he can ever give. God, what an assholeÂ…<br><br>As I stepped into the cafÃ©, I see a bloody mess. ThereÂ’s this big and long spillage of coffee all over the place. I heard the staff mentioned some idiotic guy who looks drunk on American beer dropped it. God, there sure are a lot of assholes around. I reached behind the queue and there was this lady in front of me. As I was looking at the gal hunched over the PC, I heard a sweet husky voice asking for iced blended mocha. Sigh, at least there is some remedy in this world after all. I smiled at her as she walked pass me but I think her attention was elsewhere.<br><br>Â“Give me my regular will you?

            <div class='col-md body'>"Everyone needs a bar in which they can hang out," according to a Taiwanese bartender/ writer.<br><br>As a boring guy I never enjoyed loud places. On my 4th visit to this cafe it struck me that perhaps this would be the place where I can finally feel at ease. Bright cheerful place full of people of the same age enjoying intimate chats or just enjoying the company of friends. Computers to cater for interaction of another kind. There was no pressure to impress with physique, no smoke, no need to shout to be heard.<br><br>"Everyone needs to find a drink that they enjoy, something they can trust to bring them a satisfaction everytime they sip it."<br><br>While the writer was talking about Scotch, I don't think he would mind me adapting that to coffee, since I don't like alcohol. The cuppacino here is good. No sour taste, no coffee breath lingering after a mouthful, just the right amount of froth and generous cocoa powder. I can easily indulge in this as any fine single malt scotch.<br><br>I just heard someone order his regular. This is somewhere the staff actually know what their customers like. Impressive. A toast to you too, while I carry on observing the fellow patrons, imagining what they might be up to without the pressure to leave like I need to make space for more attractive people. Can't say the same for the poor people limited to 15 minutes on the computer though.</div>
