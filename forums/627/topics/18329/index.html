Have you any idea why you can do that so easily? Its because I have decided never to reveal how much what you do affects me anymore. To my grave, thats what I told myself.<br><br>What was it they use to say about.... nah, come to think of it, I haven't heard what people say about this. Plenty talk about first loves, first break ups, first nights, but none talk about people naive in relationships facing rejection as their first experience.<br><br>It has been a long time since that day you told me you would rather remain friends. Friends, that interesting and exasperating grey area between girls and boys. This ambigious state that is used and abused both as a refuge for confusion or fear, as well as a convenient frame of mind for whatever feelings people haven't figured out yet. No matter. I accepted your decision long ago.<br><br>Had it not been your assumption that I handled it well, we would not be talking like this. You telling me again about your new boyfriend. I bet from my expression you will never in a million years guess what I'm thinking about. And thats the way it will stay. Like I said, to my grave.<br><br>Looking around this coffee place I bet everyone has their own story. Like that guy who nearly got a faceful of whatever he ordered. The way that waitress flung it at him you would think he tried to grab her behind. Or that funny looking guy at the corner sniggering to himself. No matter. Keep your thoughts to yourself, as I do mine.<br><br>If they had a jukebox here, I would know exactly what song to play. But as it is there is only the incessant tapping of keys, and your voice. I will be happy to just listen. Whatever I think, I'll keep. To my grave.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>August. 3pm, right in the middle of a hot summer's day. It's been a whole afternoon since we were out. As I slinked into the comfort of one of the coffee jointÂ’s couch, I couldnÂ’t help but think to myself for a second Â“God knows how dirty this is! Look at those coffee stains!Â” But I didnÂ’t care; I was tired and flushed from the scorching sun outside. Shining down mercilessly on our little islandÂ… Â“AhÂ… thank God for air-con!Â”<br><br>Sipping my little cup of iced mango juice (or is it slush?), I was disappointed that it didnÂ’t quite turn out as I had imagined it to be. But what the heck! ItÂ’s chill was enough to snap me out of my drowsiness already. Looking around me, the cafÃ© was fairly crowded for a weekday afternoon. Probably because NDP was coming up real soon and there were lot of preparations going on at the nearby Padang. Chuckling to myself, I wondered how many of these people were Â“taking an unscheduled coffee breakÂ” from their jobsÂ…<br><br>The laughter from the next table jolted me back to reality. I couldnÂ’t hear what they were talking about, but it was in a language that I couldnÂ’t be mistaken about. An accent so strangely familiar yet comforting. YesÂ… itÂ’s been a long time. I smiled to myself and turned to my pal, who had been complaining about her drink and the service from the poker-faced server at the counter for the last few minutes. What about, IÂ’ve no idea.  Interrupting her, I said: Â“Sure feels good to be home againÂ…Â” and she stared in confusion. Then she smiled. It was a common sentiment we both shared. No explanation needed.<br>-------------------------------------------<br>November. Late fall. The trees are bare now. Staring into my computer screen as I typed, I wondered how many more days before I'll be lounging in that coffee joint again.... how many more days before I am home again.  Summer... Surely it ain't that far off?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here I am again, sitting in my room with my mind filled with many question marks.  Wanting so hard to find the answer, but yet can not.  A sigh released...<br><br>????? Isn`t it an ironic world that we live in ??????<br><br>I harbor the valid fear that I may never meet someone who "loves me for who I am". Someone that will accept my idiosyncracies, laugh with me during my "blonde" moments, and share my embarrassing secrets.  In a way, however, I do this to myself.  I sometimes hesitate to reveal my true self while hiding behind my ideal image of myself.  I want to be loved unconditionally, yet do I truly love myself?!  Do I accept myself minus the shopping marathons, make-up, and all else that is superficial?! The world around me can be as superficial as I make it to be. Sometimes amidst all of this craziness - I tend to forget who I truly am - and though outer appearances do matter to a certain extent, (the cynical truth) what is it about me that truly make me a unique and a  special individual?  I have always been concerned about the state of my appearance.  Can I truely be as passionate, grounded, articulate, intelligent and beautiful (inside and out), I idealize myself to be?!<br><br>And yet another meaningless question mark on my mind....<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...sting like a bee...</div>
