            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday I saw this postcard by AWARE with a similar statement to the topic sentence. "He's a stud, but she's a slut."<br><br>Is it true that no matter how open-minded we conceive ourselves to be, we're still trapped in our own minds? Do we really hold double standards as suggested above? That when a guy sleeps with a girl, he scores; when a girl sleeps with a guy, she's cheap.<br><br>As Singaporean women are slowly breaking down the barriers previously laid before us, as we are slowly gaining equal rights and equal opportunities, why are we still unable to gain equal respect?<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think women often sabotage themselves whenever it comes to reifying stereotypes. all the male-designed outfits like the femme fatale, slut, SPG, docile maiden etc. have been happily filled by numerous women. the identity they adopt for themselves are constructed by the patriarchy and they don't even know it. even if they have some inkling, many persist in constructing the Self in this mould since there, as yet, has been no female construction of herself, at least not in s'pore.<br><br>its easy to say women are hapless creatures unwittingly categorised by men's labelling but it goes deeper than that. as long as women desire men's attention, to get ahead of the other woman, many are willing to play the game. participating in this game may be a female subversive play of power but it will continue to give labels a hint of truth.<br><br>its almost impossible to neutralise the concomitant 'values' of manhood and womanhood when it comes to sexual matters. perhaps one way to skirt around this would be to preach against promiscuity on both sides - hence lowering the 'status' of the stud and reducing STD, killing two birds with one stone.<br><br>cheerio</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About women filling in categories perfectly, I personally feel that there were always such women and men just created names for them. Furthermore, perhaps men desire for women like that, i.e. it gets the blood rushing down to the nether-land, but if you're that kinda girl, you ain't worth spending your life with. I say it's narrow-minded and a very flawed perception.<br><br>Females having to hide their sexuality just for the sake of reputation appears unnatural to me. It's not promiscuity that bothers me, but it seems that any girl who is sexually confident or just plain enjoys frolicking in bed isn't a lady. Instead of being appreciated for her confidence and straight-forwardness, i.e.: knowing what she wants, she's labeled a whore.<br><br>I know few Singaporean men who actually think this way. Mostly, this treat women with equal respect and as equals thing has worked out quite well. But I still have friends who call girls "good-time girls". My friend told me that the guys will always like to have you around, but once you leave, they'll say horrible things about you.<br><br>What I'm trying to bring up here is not the issue of sex, hymens or promiscuity. Rather, the issue of double standards all over the place. There's still this tint of sexual discrimination in Singapore. As a daughter of Singapore, I feel it, and I think it's pretty screwed up.<br><br>------------------<br></div>

Why ST highlighted their show of independence?  And those Japanese women are not even defensive about it.  They say, matter-of-factly, they have good jobs that pay well, good girlfriends, ability to travel and generally enjoy life on their own, why bother to marry.

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence, you're too cynical.  That song is nothing but another version of "girls just wanna have fun".  I don't think it attacks men, it just says in a breezy way, yeah, we celebrate being women.<br><br>Hmm, wait till I get the lyrics to be posted here, okay.  Meanwhile, I still say that it's no use devoting life to attack men.  I think right now women have enough freedom not to be bothered too much by labels like promiscuous or sluttish.  I am not well acquinted with what the feminists or neo feminists are up to.  But if they really care about women they will find their time better spent if they do something about kidnapping of girls in Vietnam to be sold as prostitutes in Thailand, or how some Indian women are treated after their marriage by their inlaws and even their husbands, there are so many things to do yet why do we bother about being called sluts?

You said that women should have a female reconstuction of themselves and not what the patriarchal society pigeonhole women into.  I think really enjoying being women and stop looking at marriage as something that has to happen is finding a new self already.  The stigma attached to these new women are still strong enough and as you said if we were to believe that some forumnites were really sincere when they acted like neanderthals, the ride will be bumpy.  Passerbies like them should not matter much if one is really determined to change, one cannot please everybody after all.

            <div class='col-md body'>The way I see it, if you want the rainbow you have to put up with the rain -- Dolly Parton<br><br>Terence:<br><br>When you mention women who fit themselves into the various stereotypes for their own benefit, the immediate thought is that cunning, or selfish, a woman will change her facade into something the 60's feminists would love when it suits her.  Hopefully, men will see enough of these women not to fall for the old tricks again but I think the fact that they are manipulating men using things that men invented can be seen as being resourceful instead of detrimental to perception of women in the society.<br><br>Besides, it's very hard to please everyone.  The new feminists mark themselves with saying to &lt;sic&gt; flozzies with super mini skirt &lt;/sic&gt; "Your skirt is so short I can see your tampon string".  Being overly judgemental and closed minded about mini skirts (the wearer may like the skirt only  because it's mini and it's fun wearing so little) is not being helpful to women at large, too.  I agree with that statement that women are their worst enemies.<br><br>While you have so much faith in education, I reserve mine only for the informal education one gets at home.  Schools (at least those over here) don't seem to be able to inculcate any values trying as hard as they might.  As for the new generations with the chauvinistic ideas, clearly what they have is received from education in their own homes and the company they've been keeping up with.  They may grow out of it if they encounter more modern women in the streets.<br><br>Finally, if modern women want a rightful place in the world where they can *be* without any prejudice, they have to fight for it.  Maybe this is not a politically correct example, but if the Jews had merely proclaim from German or the U.S. that their land occupied by the palestinians are the Jews' land, the Palestinians would simply laugh at them.  To get their own ountry, Israel, the Jews had to physically occupy the land and brave the unhappy arabs.  If modern women want any acknowledgement, they have to proudly exhibit their existence first, no matter what other people may say about it.  Seeing them live on the streets is a better way of educating then talking about them in schools or even homes.<br><br>------------------<br>Sex is not the answer.  Sex is the question.  Yes is the answer.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 08 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maya,<br><br>you seem to be leaning heavily on conceptual notions of a modern woman. tell me, what is a modern woman? how do you identify her? what does she want? how must she go about getting it whilst remaining being modern?<br><br>fight for it? sure. how? doing whatever they please? ok, can do. doesn't that mean sacrifice? you don't see men complaining about not being able to spend time with little julian because he is spending 16 hr days at the office because he is free from the social 'burden'. lets see the modern woman do that. 16 hr days and still managing to raise little julian without a nanny is not an issue for a woman who wants it all. something has to give - the choice she makes defines her - like it defines the man. hence, the fight you so badly want is not a win-win situation.<br><br>cheerio</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>rae-lyn,<br><br>Remember the recent anal sex case. The public prosecution was smart. They charged the poor guy under the penal code for unnatural sex, and not for use of force, for the was no use of force at all. Indeed, it was anal sex between consenting adults. The couple had sex regularly, and had anal sex on 2 occassions (about a fortnight apart). And the gal only reported to the police after she found out that the guy was two timing her.<br><br>Now I dont think the judge was wrong in finding the man guilty of anal sex. If the law was wrong, thats another matter and something for parliament to decide , not the courts. So the judge wasnt wrong to find the man guilty. But what about the gal? Since there was no force involved, why did the gal get away scot free? Shouldnt she be punished since she also engaged in anal sex. Where is justice and equality? Bring me justice bao.<br><br>This isnt the only instance. Many times in the past, when a man was wrong accused for rape or molest, he got aquitted while nothing happened to the gal (she should rightly be charged for perjury of the courts). The poor man would have a doubt cast over his reputation inspite of the acquittal while the gal (whose identity wasnt revealed) got no punishment for making false accusations.<br><br>Just very curious about this anal sex case. The man was found guilty of having anal sex with the gal. There wasnt any use of force. Since it was anal sex between 2 consenting adults, isnt the girl guilty of breaking the law on unnatural sex as well? Why did the public prosecution single out the man only? Any lawyers here care to comment?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, u can't have your piece of cake and eat it, can you? *LUFFZ* No matter how the society advances, there can never be gender equality! Traditional values still stay and there are MANY who EXPECT women to behave this way, to talk that way and blah blah blah.<br><br>It's like ladies want the guys to be more GENTLEMANLY and yet expects EQUALITY, kinda absurb huh? And weirdly, guys will wanna screw some gals but EXPECT their gals to be UNtouched! *LUFFZ* That's the irony of it all!<br><br>Anyway, hopefully as the society improves, there really CAN be gender equality??

Rather, the issue of double standards all over the place. There's still this tint of sexual discrimination in Singapore. As a daughter of Singapore, I feel it, and I think it's pretty screwed up.<br><br></div></blockquote>Believing... In the eyes of the beholder.<br>Pretty much good debates going on between Maya and Terence... &lt;- Sorry but don't really have time and sure is regretful that I'm missing out alot of interesting information.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Rae-lynn: Since it's YOUR TOPIC and your subject here, let me point my arrow to YOU. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>HISTORY: Dates back to the past. When women have no say and no status in this society.<br><br>But women LEARNT to break through fairly quickly.... I must admit that before all this discrimination craps came out AGAIN, women were doing fairly well for a CHANGE, for a START.... If fact, many still ARE...<br><br>Women were no longer like they used to. They dressed up, take control, gain independence.... But only to be going in the wrong direction.... The direction that they wanted to break free from. The ATTENTIONS of the guys. They were WRONG in the sense that they went for POWER and ATTENTION.... So what's with all the beauty and outstanding status if there're no one to appreciate it? the TURN of direction was from there.... They went back to from they started from, headed back for the same direction... GUYS were LOST when the women FIRST rebel....<br><br>Now guys TOO have LEARNT.... They too have 'upgarded' their looks.... And caught up.... But YET, they also SET UP another CONSPIRACY at the same time. The NAMING game. To group and categorised women in the way the GUYS wanna see them. BLIND women went on into believing in the GUYS' categorising just because the women shown trends or likes of the categorising... Also women WANTED attention... AND they did not wanna be LEFT OUT of this GAME... The game of ATTENTION... Let me CLARIFY something at this point... NO MATTER how close you sound like a particular category OR class, you're NEVER the SAME... Because if a category is to put MORE than 2 'subjects' into the same grouping... Then I'm telling you that NO 2 WOMEN would ever be the SAME PERSON.... And that's just how it works.... By allowing yourself to be categorised you are DISCARDING yourself and fitting into the MOULD that the GUYS want you to be IN.... And the RULES of the GAME is you'll NEVER WIN.... Cause you're playing a GUYS' GAME......<br>Rae-lynn, for your answer.... Discrimination DON'T HAPPEN just like that... The people who discriminate you are the ones PLAYING the GUYS' GAME.... They can be WOMEN who are believers of the GAME themselves... OR GUYS who just ENJOY the benefits of the GAME..... Don't be LOST... Be YOURSELF.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Don't forsake the GUYS... But don't LEAN against them neither... For a moment there I thought you girls were doing pretty well for a change...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Please don't let me down?<br><br>LAST thing to add... There're ALSO some VERY SMART WOMEN out there (You know who you are? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) Using the GAME of the GUYS against themselves.... To allow themselves to fall into category (Or at least seemingly SO), and yet still having their own STYLES, THINKING and WAYs.... Dangerous babes....<br><br>Guess LIFE just ain't the same anymore..? ANYWAY, I'm tired of all these GAMEs...... I'm OUT... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> GAME OVER.....<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
