            <div class='col-md body'>Education, is it really neccessary?<br>Which of the stalls in the coffeeshop do u think will earn the most?<br>Coffeeshop owners? All they have to do is to setup a drink stall, collect rents and they can earn a lot more than many of us here.<br><br>Or chicken rice sellers? who can easily afford a merz than those who works in office with a degree or a master?<br>Or Wan Ton Mee sellers? who wears gold rings, gold chains and gold necklaces mroe than other people?<br><br>Are they really educated people? Do they also have a piece of paper like many of us but decided to open a coffeshop and work in a hot and noisy environment rather than sitting comfortably in the office?<br>Or, they are just the ones with not much education but they are lucky enough to have the capital to open up a coffeeshop?<br><br>Someone told me, he knew a friend who carrys rice sacks those days in boat quay (oh well, those were his days, so, it's obvious that he's not ard our age!). How much do u think they can earn? One who is very poor and with no education at all?<br>He's lucky. He's rich now...even richer than his boss who hired him. His boss likes him a lot and gave him a lot of work to do, followed by management level of work. How many people can get such luck?<br><br>Is education really necessary? Somehow i felt that only those with good academic results will excel. Those with no education, but has the luck will also excel.<br>How about those with good education but still sits in the office earning $2K to $3k per month? Even a cook in the coffeshop can earn more than them!! (those Zi Char stalls)<br>No such luck? Too bad..<br>Maybe i should consider setting up a chicken rice stall..<br>But of coz, business must be good. or else, it will definitely close down in 2-3 mths time, considering the fact that money has to be spend on helpers, rents, etc.<br><br>Sometimes, i wish i can go and interview those stall owners and have a deeper understanding of each and their individual life stories.<br><br>------------------<br>JuzTheGal, JuzHer, JuzMe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Churra:<br><br>This irony of income differentials only exists only because of your premise that paper qualification is causal to high income. It correlates but is not causal. Your economic worth is in your knowledge, not the piece of paper. And just because you have a piece of paper does not mean you have the knowledge. This fact is compounded by dubious firms which advertise distance learning degree/diploma programs with attractive bylines like "complete your degree in 1 year" or "register now and get a discount". To me they are just selling the piece of paper for a modicum of effort on the students part. Show me a firm which says on their add "Stringent and rigorous selection criteria, after which be prepared to suffer continuous drilling and at the end of it all only the top 30% will graduate."<br></div>

There is no such thing like working few hours,earning big money theory. Whatsmore, this is Singapore. Unless U R talking about Reggie Boys Land Jamaica or Australia. We dont have our natural resources and everyone is required to work hard in Singapore to be successful. If U R still dreaming, maybe U could migrate to the slow lifestyle of Australia or Jamaica where U could just sit at the cafeteria cutting fingernails as U watch the bikini babes walking pass the beaches, U could even spend all day blowing wolf whistles and attract their attention while working as a waiter or whatsoever.... Thats why some jeolous people call them beachbums.<br>Back to Singapore... C'mon. U want to earn big bucks in Army, work hard. Earn big bucks as a hawker, work hard. Earn big bucks in the IT industry, work hard. Earn big bucks in the Financial Sector, work hard. U can't fuck and suck here and there in the dreamland and expect to get big money.<br><br>------------------<br>There is the need all around for kindness for the ideal of love.
