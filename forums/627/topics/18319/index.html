            <div class='col-md body'>Whereever you go, whenever there's a big group, politics are sure to happen. I can't find a better word, so politics will have to do. Ever since I joined Sgforums, it has been an eye-opening experience, learning about how to del with so many people. After dealing with another kind of people in the army, no offense there, I've entered into yet another realm of people types, so to speak. Now, the people in here are from such a wide range of age groups, from 15 all the way to 35, 40? I guess I'm not that much of a street smart guy, I'm a naive romantic, heeeheeee, easily kena bluffed wan, and yet it is from here that I've learned the ropes of wheeling and dealing....<br><br>Now is it me or that sgforums has it's own clans and groups etc? hmmm, should i mention names, I don't wanna start a war here, but what the heck! Taboo or not, here goes!<br><br>First there's the infamous SCB clan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> infamous or not, some of you might go har?? who's that? well, i guess it comprises me, oldman, asure, and kj. We been going out and stuff, go cheonging, eat etc, and basically it's pretty fun!<br><br>Then there's the 3 'bitches'or the "ALL MEN ARE BASTARDS!!" gang, ie eeriegal, tindongal and tet plus i tink recently some more new inductees or 'bitches' hiak!<br><br>The flirtees, reve, sparkle, colette<br><br>Of cos lest we forget, there's lexelle and her gang too!<br><br>and the most famous, FNU and his gang! heehee<br><br>If i were to remain the same as i was after the army, and joined the sgforums now, i'd think wow wat a happening bunch! Yet, there are always dark undercurrents aboutdont' you think? Hmm, I may be setting myself up for the fall, what the heck.<br><br>Like recently, there's been the impostor thread on tdg, pheonix, humblepie and hatasan. why leh? what's the point? to ruin someone's reputation? on sgforums? is sgforums that big a deal? why do some people get so jealous over something so little. i've to say that some people in this forum aren't as friendly as they seem, cos underneath, they can be very very cunning. harsh but true. the moment i started posting agin, people from certain groups started swaying me wif their idealism. that certain so and so is doing this etc etc etc. now after two months in here i gotta say i hate it alot, all this winding here and twisting there. if you don't like someone why don't you just say it out? why hide behind a veil of secrecy? who gives anyone the right to point fingers at another person in the first place? are you God? no one says you have to like everybody you meet, just chill and relax ppl. sgforums is  a place to air your questions, grievances, thots etc. if u wanna be serious, then say so, else is just all in the name of fun! to turn this place into a flaming ground, or a place of people pretending to be other people just plain sux. you want to have mutiple identies? go ahead, but just don't mislead other ppl!<br><br>even with the gorups i mentioned above, bickerings within the group remain. then ppl start asking me abt how i feel about this issue or how i feel about this person. argh! so wat does it matter how i feel? if i say i hate that person, does that mean i will become your ally or what? duh! sgforums isn't meant a place for personal attacks, you hate that person you tell him straight if u can't keep it to yourself, you don't have to broadcast to the whole world or start a personal vendetta against that person.<br><br>jeez, i think i 've rambled on enuff, the bottomline is, spare me the politics and bullshit, i just wanna have fun in the forums, i dun wish to have to become a politician just to have fun<br><br>that is all<br><br>cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have entered into this forum, engaging in discussion in less than 4 major topics and the latest one being the saga of humblepies. Being old history, I have no wish to re-open sore wounds. What I wish to mention is, in my humble opinions (pun unintended) I noticed the way cliques seems to form in this forum.<br><br>Understandably, most people will galvanise towards their own "kinds", people who share similar traits with them and common intellectual level. With this in mind, I tried to categorise the forumites here into cliques and why they seem so comfortable with one another.<br><br>Being purely academic in nature, I hope I do not offend anyone in here with my sweeping generalisation. This is merely something that I thought of do feel free to point out my errors. I draw extensively from the originator of this thread, atreiu, as well as adding in some opinions from my close friend and classmate, hata san.<br><br>I shall foremost classify people in this forum into 4 major class. The first one I termed the intellectual bunch. They consist of scholars and students in foreign lands like Terence, Revelation, Rinoa, NaÃ¯ve girl, qwerty and Prodigal. Local students have their fair share in this class too, people like sparkle, hata-san, Maya and liquid. Common point? Their ability to abstract threads and articulates their views across. They are more comfortable chatting among themselves and indulge in the occasional flirting while seeping espresso in front of their laptop beside Thames. They will occasionally cross into the other class, when the topics are interesting enough to warrant their attention and think nothing of hijacking that thread to furnish it into their own cocoon. Of course, degrees are not the criteria into this posh classÂ…the ability to hold his/her own and flirt outrageously is another plus point. Case in point, pacman, tet and colette. Successful men in their working field ngkaihoe, littleman and Alex contributed to this class of clique too.<br>Most famous hunting ground is the Singles Thread, in which they shamelessly hijack to conduct their own club and in which lesser class were reluctant to step in.<br><br>The second class is what I termed the kopi tiam gang. Ah, we have the cosmopolitan in the above class and the HDB heartlanders in this class. Several names pop to mind but suffice to say, FNU and his gang (as described atreiu) will be the most appropriate for this discussion. (Gang members can be ascertained by looking at FNUÂ’s own forum) Members ranged from NS boys to working class girls. In fact, flirting is not conducted over the forum but in real life where outings are frequently organised. It will not surprise the author to know that there are couples among this class as she is writing this. We can straightaway identify a thread conquered by them with the Â“famousÂ” one liner answers and the incessant small talks among themselves. Intellectual bunch fear to thread into their threads as they might be overwhelmed by the numerous nonchalant postings. Nothing scares them more than to be swallowed by singlish one liner.<br>Most famous hunting groundÂ…all outing threads.<br><br>The third class of people is a bunch of warriors who thrive in fire and brimstones. To call them lamers would be an understatement. They are as smart as a bunch of raptors and they can smell a prey from a mile away. Twinkle is the master of them all while Adam&amp;Eve is a manipulator. Iamatwat proves to be the perfect foot soldier and cyberahmad is the agent provocateur in this forum. Moreover, a new bunch of warriors are arising from the ashes of the oldÂ…namely, any alternative sounding names.<br>Most famous hunting ground, any vulgar sounding threads and inflaming topics.<br><br>The last class is what I called the interest groups. They gathered from the above 3 classes to form into their separate cliques based on their common interest and hobbies. We have seen a CS clan, bitches groupie and the females desperate group SCB.<br>Most famous hunting ground is self-explanatory. CS screamed their war cry over their threads while the bitches goes Â“another wild niteÂ”.<br><br>Read this with a pinch of salt and over a cup of expresso or kopi Â–o kao. Sometimes, generalisation is needed to provide a comic relief and as I mentioned, this is not a rigid class structure. Who knows, most likely the forumites will end up as the last class of peopleÂ…although I doubted it. There will always be cliques and there will always be warriors.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everywhere there is politic. When there are people "boi song" about other people, politics and conflict occurs. Gossip and unture issue flying all over the place. This is human nature. Everybody can only see other mistakes but never realise own mistakes.<br><br>After going out for few outings. I realise there is indeed plenty of politics going around.

            <div class='col-md body'>to coco , thanx for ur insightful report but like u say i belong to the kopitiam group. For me if everything i look into the samll print, boy i will be death by now. come on ppl, this world is already full of restrictions y force the forum into a place where we can go wild. No physically but mentally. Let u creatitive flow.... oh yes if u concern to much abt wat others say abt u, u should read fairy tales. oni there will u find ppl always say good things.. u can forget it here....<br><br></div>
