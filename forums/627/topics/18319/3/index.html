            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, indeed politics happen.  It happens everywhere, not only on IRC, the forum, but also at work, in school, everywhere in our daily life.<br><br>We are humans, we tend to side with the group that we share similar characteristics with. Nothing wrong with it all at...<br><br>I see a lot of you guys here are unhappy to see politic happen.  Have you guys ever asked yourself what is the root of this problem?  Is it jealously that one forumite has against another? Is it anger?! Is it envy?! Is it the rumors or gossips?!  What is it?!  Not that easy to tell...But I can tell you that it's is everything I have mention if not more.  Arguement happens, one forumite tells his/her friend and the friend will side w/ them.  Same goes for the other side of the party.  Is this how we bond with our clique?! A rumor is started, one forumite will think that another formite is against him/her.  But is it the truth that the person is speaking?! As human, once we know someone is attacking us, we will defend ourselves or fight back.  So they also start to say something too and not to forget that there are people that like to watch shows.  They are the people that add oil to the fire, the bigger the fire, the more there is to watch.  Gossips, he/she did that, you better be care of him/her.  If they can do it to him/her, it can also happen to you.  Someone tells you something bad about another person, should you wonder about their intention?!  Can it be because they are your friend and they just want to let you know?!  Or can it be because they want you to have a different or a certain perception on this other person?!  What is their intention?!  Turth get twisted, sooner or later it will no longer be the truth.<br><br>Do we blindly side with the one we hang out with more often?  Do we judge one another too swiftly?!  We are all humans...we make mistake.  God, I know that I did!  80% of politics happen with rumors.  With forumites being unhappy about one another.  With people being sore over little things, or misunderstandings.  Who is to tell what is the truth and what is not?!  It's just too troublesome for someone to find the truth.  To a point it's nearly impossible!  I myself have gone numb to a lot of politics here.  I know that I can never find the truth, nor do I want to.  Is it worth my time?  How will I know what I have found out is the truth?!  Therefore, I have decided to read everything that is given to me with a pinch of salt.  Not to think about it too much.  Doubts?! Sure, I will have it...but I will also give the person the benefit of the doubt and believe that he/she will not lie to me.  It's more peaceful to be naive at times... =D<br><br>Just an advice...try not to judge a person too swiftly, not until you know that person in real life.  That you have actually witness them in doing what the rumors stated.  Sure, if it's said that this person is very dangerous, then it's only human's nature that we have cautious over this person.  But, bear in mind that the thing you heard might not be true at all.  Give the person the benefit of the doubt.  Have you, like me, once proven someone guilty before giving them a chance?!<br><br>Keep in mind that there are two sides to every story.  If you really feel that you need to take a side, put yourself in another person's shoe and think...<br><br>"My views may not carry a single sense of validity.  But it doesprovide food for thought" (quote from a dear friend.  Actully all of these has crossed my mind when this dear friend of mine emailed me about the recent happenning of something in the forum.  Thank you my dear friend.  You know who you are. *wink*)<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I post my reply in a matter of opinion to what I have read and heard so far. I want to start the reply by a Chinese saying "When there is people, there is bound to be politics (in the actual quote, it is "Jiang Hu", or puglist world), because people created politics."<br><br>There are two questions which come to my thoughts when Coco mentioned about the different classes : the first being this artificial classification" inducing a kind of inequality and the second, people bring politics to the forum by creating titles and groups for themselves.<br><br>First of all, to me, any form of classification induced a certain inequality among people. However, I believed in equality, and would think that it is a matter of choice of an individual or any forumite who would engage in a thread. Different people have different tastes. The mere fact that people are not interested in replying a certain thread does not necessarily implies that there are any different. For example, to those who think Singles thread is a clique kind of thing, I doubt very much so. Someone once suggested a name to us, and even getting a leader of the clique, and my response is that it should not be this way. It should be free, and people should be feel free to participate. Suppose if cliques ever formed in Singles thread, then it loses the spirit of freedom of speech in the forum. I would be inclined to agree with Maya and others that one should not hijack a thread.<br><br>The second point has been described by NaiveGirl and a few other forumites in detail. Some people post in the forum to meet people. They meet and they go out for gatherings, and if they clique, they clique, and if not they will start taking sides. What naturally makes it weary and horrible for people who trusted others, is that there are constantly people who manipulate others to their own ends in order to take sides, and hurt the feelings of other people, betraying their trust. It is nonsensical to see such things happening. One could spread a rumour or pass a lie around the cyberspace, but why? Some people want to seek attention or want to fulfil their sense of egotism to pass the message that they are always right. But why should we be always right? Can't we even acknowledge that we are wrong at times? I can condone egoism and whiners, but that does not mean that these people have the right to manipulate peoople or even make noises which seems to me as artificially trivial.<br><br>I prefer to approach people in the forum with a true and sincere heart, than be a hypocrite  claiming some set of ideals and yet do something else which, to me, are disappointing and painful.<br><br>Nevertheless, this is how I looked at the issue of politics. Politics only happens, when people wants to take sides, want to prove that they are better than someone else, or want to satisfy their attention seeking and egoism, or people who refused to believe that they are wrong. In any case, I would call that bigotry and hypocrisy. Although I am not directly involved in any kind of politics here, I have heard and seen so much that I hope to still have faith in people in my interaction with them..<br><br>My two pennies worth.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal.<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>
