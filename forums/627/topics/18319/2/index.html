Thither let us tend<br>From off the tossing of these fiery waves,<br>There rest, if any rest can harbour there,<br>And reassembling our afflicted Powers,<br>Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br>Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,<br>How overcome this dire Calamity,<br>What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,<br>If not what resolution from despare.<br>Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate<br>With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes<br>That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides<br>Prone on the Flood, extended long and large<br>Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge<br>As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,<br>TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE,<br>BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den<br>By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast<br>LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works<br>Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:<br>Him haply slumbring on the NORWAY foam<br>The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,<br>Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,<br>With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind<br>Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night<br>Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:<br>So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay<br>Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence<br>Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will<br>And high permission of all-ruling Heaven<br>Left him at large to his own dark designs,<br>That with reiterated crimes he might<br>Heap on himself damnation, while he sought<br>Evil to others, and enrag'd might see<br>How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth<br>Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn<br>On Man by him seduc't, but on himself<br>Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.<br>Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool<br>His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames<br>Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld<br>In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale.<br>Then with expanded wings he stears his flight<br>Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air<br>That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land<br>He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd<br>With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;<br>And such appear'd in hue, as when the force<br>Of subterranean wind transports a Hill<br>Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd side<br>Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible<br>And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,<br>Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,<br>And leave a singed bottom all involv'd<br>With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole<br>Of unblest feet.

Be it so, since hee<br>Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid<br>What shall be right: fardest from him is best<br>Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream<br>Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields<br>Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail<br>Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell<br>Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings<br>A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.<br>The mind is its own place, and in it self<br>Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.<br>What matter where, if I be still the same,<br>And what I should be, all but less then hee<br>Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least<br>We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built<br>Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:<br>Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce<br>To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:<br>Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.<br>But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,<br>Th' associates and copartners of our loss<br>Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,<br>And call them not to share with us their part<br>In this unhappy Mansion, or once more<br>With rallied Arms to try what may be yet<br>Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?<br>So SATAN spake, and him BEELZEBUB<br>Thus answer'd. Leader of those Armies bright,<br>Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,<br>If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge<br>Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft<br>In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge<br>Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults<br>Their surest signal, they will soon resume<br>New courage and revive, though now they lye<br>Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,<br>As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,<br>No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.<br>He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend<br>Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield<br>Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,<br>Behind him cast; the broad circumference<br>Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb<br>Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views<br>At Ev'ning from the top of FESOLE,<br>Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands,<br>Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.<br>His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine<br>Hewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the Mast<br>Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,<br>He walkt with to support uneasie steps<br>Over the burning Marle, not like those steps<br>On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime<br>Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;<br>Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach<br>Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd<br>His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't<br>Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks<br>In VALLOMBROSA, where th' ETRURIAN shades<br>High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge<br>Afloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm'd<br>Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew<br>BUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie,<br>VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu'd<br>The Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheld<br>From the safe shore their floating Carkases<br>And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown<br>Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,<br>Under amazement of their hideous change.<br>He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep<br>Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates,<br>Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,<br>If such astonishment as this can sieze<br>Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place<br>After the toyl of Battel to repose<br>Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find<br>To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?<br>Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br>To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds<br>Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood<br>With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon<br>His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern<br>Th' advantage, and descending tread us down<br>Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts<br>Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.<br>Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.<br>They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung<br>Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch<br>On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,<br>Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br>Nor did they not perceave the evil plight<br>In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br>Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd<br>Innumerable. As when the potent Rod<br>Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evill day<br>Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud<br>Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind,<br>That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung<br>Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of NILE:<br>So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br>Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell<br>'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;<br>Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear<br>Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br>Thir course, in even ballance down they light<br>On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;<br>A multitude, like which the populous North<br>Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass<br>RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons<br>Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread<br>Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands.<br>Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band<br>The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood<br>Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms<br>Excelling human, Princely Dignities,<br>And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;<br>Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now<br>Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd<br>By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.<br>Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVE<br>Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,<br>Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,<br>By falsities and lyes the greatest part<br>Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake<br>God their Creator, and th' invisible<br>Glory of him, that made them, to transform<br>Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd<br>With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,<br>And Devils to adore for Deities:<br>Then were they known to men by various Names,<br>And various Idols through the Heathen World.<br>Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,<br>Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,<br>At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth<br>Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br>While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?<br>The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell<br>Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix<br>Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,<br>Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd<br>Among the Nations round, and durst abide<br>JEHOVAH thundring out of SION, thron'd<br>Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd<br>Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,<br>Abominations; and with cursed things<br>His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,<br>And with their darkness durst affront his light.<br>First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear'd with blood<br>Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,<br>Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud<br>Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire<br>To his grim Idol. Him the AMMONITE<br>Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain,<br>In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream<br>Of utmost ARNON. Nor content with such<br>Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br>Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build<br>His Temple right against the Temple of God<br>On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove<br>The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence<br>And black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell.<br>Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons,<br>From AROER to NEBO, and the wild<br>Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON<br>And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond<br>The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,<br>And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool.<br>PEOR his other Name, when he entic'd<br>ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE<br>To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br>Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd<br>Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove<br>Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;<br>Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.<br>With these came they, who from the bordring flood<br>Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts<br>EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names<br>Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male,<br>These Feminine. For Spirits when they please<br>Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft<br>And uncompounded is their Essence pure,<br>Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,<br>Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br>Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose<br>Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,<br>Can execute their aerie purposes,<br>And works of love or enmity fulfill.<br>For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook<br>Their living strength, and unfrequented left<br>His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down<br>To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low<br>Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear<br>Of despicable foes. With these in troop<br>Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'd<br>ASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;<br>To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon<br>SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,<br>In SION also not unsung, where stood<br>Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built<br>By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,<br>Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell<br>To Idols foul. THAMMUZ came next behind,<br>Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'd<br>The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate<br>In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,<br>While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock<br>Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood<br>Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale<br>Infected SIONS daughters with like heat,<br>Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch<br>EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led<br>His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries<br>Of alienated JUDAH. Next came one<br>Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark<br>Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off<br>In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,<br>Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:<br>DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man<br>And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high<br>Rear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast<br>Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,<br>And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds.<br>Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful Seat<br>Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks<br>Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.<br>He also against the house of God was bold:<br>A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,<br>AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew<br>Gods Altar to disparage and displace<br>For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn<br>His odious offrings, and adore the Gods<br>Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear'd<br>A crew who under Names of old Renown,<br>OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train<br>With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd<br>Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek<br>Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms<br>Rather then human. Nor did ISRAEL scape<br>Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd<br>The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King<br>Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,<br>Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,<br>JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass'd<br>From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke<br>Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.<br>BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd<br>Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br>Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood<br>Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee<br>In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest<br>Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd<br>With lust and violence the house of God.<br>In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns<br>And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse<br>Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,<br>And injury and outrage: And when Night<br>Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons<br>Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.<br>Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night<br>In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores<br>Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.<br>These were the prime in order and in might;<br>The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,<br>Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held<br>Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth<br>Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'ns first born<br>With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd<br>By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE<br>His own and RHEA'S Son like measure found;<br>So JOVE usurping reign'd: these first in CREET<br>And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top<br>Of cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle Air<br>Thir highest Heav'n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff,<br>Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds<br>Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old<br>Fled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields,<br>And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.<br>All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br>Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd<br>Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief<br>Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br>In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast<br>Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride<br>Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br>Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd<br>Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears.<br>Then strait commands that at the warlike sound<br>Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard<br>His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd<br>AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:<br>Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld<br>Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't<br>Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind<br>With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,<br>Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while<br>Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:<br>At which the universal Host upsent<br>A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond<br>Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.<br>All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br>Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air<br>With Orient Colours waving: with them rose<br>A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms<br>Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array<br>Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move<br>In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood<br>Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd<br>To highth of noblest temper Hero's old<br>Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage<br>Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd<br>With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,<br>Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br>With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase<br>Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br>From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they<br>Breathing united force with fixed thought<br>Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd<br>Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now<br>Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front<br>Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise<br>Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,<br>Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief<br>Had to impose: He through the armed Files<br>Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse<br>The whole Battalion views, thir order due,<br>Thir visages and stature as of Gods,<br>Thir number last he summs. And now his heart<br>Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength<br>Glories: For never since created man,<br>Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these<br>Could merit more then that small infantry<br>Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood<br>Of PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd<br>That fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each side<br>Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds<br>In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son<br>Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;<br>And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel<br>Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,<br>DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND,<br>Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore<br>When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell<br>By FONTARABBIA. Thus far these beyond<br>Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd<br>Thir dread Commander: he above the rest<br>In shape and gesture proudly eminent<br>Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost<br>All her Original brightness, nor appear'd<br>Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess<br>Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n<br>Looks through the Horizontal misty Air<br>Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon<br>In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds<br>On half the Nations, and with fear of change<br>Perplexes Monarchs. Dark'n'd so, yet shon<br>Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face<br>Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care<br>Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes<br>Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride<br>Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast<br>Signs of remorse and passion to behold<br>The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br>(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd<br>For ever now to have their lot in pain,<br>Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't<br>Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung<br>For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,<br>Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire<br>Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,<br>With singed top their stately growth though bare<br>Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar'd<br>To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend<br>From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round<br>With all his Peers: attention held them mute.<br>Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,<br>Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br>Words interwove with sighs found out their way.<br>O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers<br>Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife<br>Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,<br>As this place testifies, and this dire change<br>Hateful to utter: but what power of mind<br>Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth<br>Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd,<br>How such united force of Gods, how such<br>As stood like these, could ever know repulse?<br>For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,<br>That all these puissant Legions, whose exile<br>Hath emptied Heav'n, shall faile to re-ascend<br>Self-rais'd, and repossess their native seat.<br>For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n,<br>If counsels different, or danger shun'd<br>By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns<br>Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure<br>Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,<br>Consent or custome, and his Regal State<br>Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,<br>Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.<br>Henceforth his might we know, and know our own<br>So as not either to provoke, or dread<br>New warr, provok't; our better part remains<br>To work in close design, by fraud or guile<br>What force effected not: that he no less<br>At length from us may find, who overcomes<br>By force, hath overcome but half his foe.<br>Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife<br>There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long<br>Intended to create, and therein plant<br>A generation, whom his choice regard<br>Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:<br>Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps<br>Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:<br>For this Infernal Pit shall never hold<br>Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse<br>Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts<br>Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,<br>For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr<br>Open or understood must be resolv'd.<br>He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew<br>Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs<br>Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze<br>Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd<br>Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's<br>Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war,<br>Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n.<br>There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top<br>Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire<br>Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign<br>That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,<br>The work of Sulphur. Thither wing'd with speed<br>A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bands<br>Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd<br>Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,<br>Or cast a Rampart. MAMMON led them on,<br>MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell<br>From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks &amp; thoughts<br>Were always downward bent, admiring more<br>The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold,<br>Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd<br>In vision beatific: by him first<br>Men also, and by his suggestion taught,<br>Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands<br>Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth<br>For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew<br>Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound<br>And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire<br>That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best<br>Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those<br>Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell<br>Of BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings,<br>Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,<br>And Strength and Art are easily outdone<br>By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour<br>What in an age they with incessant toyle<br>And hands innumerable scarce perform<br>Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd,<br>That underneath had veins of liquid fire<br>Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude<br>With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,<br>Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross:<br>A third as soon had form'd within the ground<br>A various mould, and from the boyling cells<br>By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,<br>As in an Organ from one blast of wind<br>To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.<br>Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge<br>Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound<br>Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,<br>Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS round<br>Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid<br>With Golden Architrave; nor did there want<br>Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,<br>The Roof was fretted Gold. Not BABILON,<br>Nor great ALCAIRO such magnificence<br>Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine<br>BELUS or SERAPIS thir Gods, or seat<br>Thir Kings, when AEGYPT with ASSYRIA strove<br>In wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pile<br>Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores<br>Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide<br>Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth<br>And level pavement: from the arched roof<br>Pendant by suttle Magic many a row<br>Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed<br>With Naphtha and ASPHALTUS yeilded light<br>As from a sky. The hasty multitude<br>Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise<br>And some the Architect: his hand was known<br>In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high,<br>Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence,<br>And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King<br>Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,<br>Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.<br>Nor was his name unheard or unador'd<br>In ancient Greece; and in AUSONIAN land<br>Men call'd him MULCIBER; and how he fell<br>From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry JOVE<br>Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn<br>To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,<br>A Summers day; and with the setting Sun<br>Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,<br>On LEMNOS th' AEGAEAN Ile: thus they relate,<br>Erring; for he with this rebellious rout<br>Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now<br>To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape<br>By all his Engins, but was headlong sent<br>With his industrious crew to build in hell.<br>Mean while the winged Haralds by command<br>Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony<br>And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim<br>A solemn Councel forthwith to be held<br>At PANDAEMONIUM, the high Capital<br>Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd<br>From every and Band squared Regiment<br>By place or choice the worthiest; they anon<br>With hundreds and with thousands trooping came<br>Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates<br>And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall<br>(Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold<br>Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair<br>Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry<br>To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)<br>Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,<br>Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees<br>In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,<br>Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive<br>In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers<br>Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,<br>The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,<br>New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer<br>Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd<br>Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n,<br>Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd<br>In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons<br>Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room<br>Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race<br>Beyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves,<br>Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side<br>Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,<br>Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon<br>Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth<br>Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth &amp; dance<br>Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;<br>At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.<br>Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms<br>Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large,<br>Though without number still amidst the Hall<br>Of that infernal Court. But far within<br>And in thir own dimensions like themselves<br>The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim<br>In close recess and secret conclave sat<br>A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's,<br>Frequent and full. After short silence then<br>And summons read, the great consult began.<br>END OF BOOK I</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Class 1 Â– wellÂ… returning to states to continue my studies soon enoughÂ…. And oh, I donÂ’t flirt on the forumsÂ…. I do it on IRC (*winks* at NaÃ¯ve ehehhe).<br><br>Class 2 Â– heyzzzÂ… I like to hang out at both cafes and kopi-tiamsÂ… eheh as long as I can sit down and chat incessantly with a group of friends, while enjoying my coffee of course        <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Class 3 Â– OhÂ….

Yes yes the SCB !!!   whatever that means to anyone, but I can ASSURE that we are not desperate (oh wellÂ… except maybe one.. U KNOW WHO U ARE DEARIE !!  Hahahaha)  We juz like to have fun together among ourselves and im sure the rest of the members can attest to it, tho i spot some jealousy here (NOT HERE) and there at times.. hehehe    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ah wellÂ…   seems to me that many here are taking the virtual world too seriously, to the point that it is even affecting some pplsÂ’ daily lives.   You can impress everybody, but at the end of it, what do u really get? Delusions of grandeur?  Does anyone really care?<br><br>Life goes on as they sayÂ….   The cyberworld is but a place of role-playing and fun (wudever Â“funÂ” means to you).  You leave this place achieving nothing much except self-inflated ego, or with a dented one.  ThusÂ….. since I *think* I can fit into all the so-called categoriesÂ… does that make me anything more or less?  Or in retrospect, am I just an outcast not really belonging to any classes ?        :pÂ… ehÂ….. who the hell cares anyway heeheeÂ…as long as im happy with it.<br><br>Politics or not, its not an effect of the forums but one of the symptoms of human behavior, thus it happens everywhere, whether one likes it or not.  The forums is simply a tool...  Life sucks, so bite on it heheeh.<br><br>ItÂ’s difficult to please everyone, if not impossible.  Sometimes we flame or flirt in the name of fun, but when someone else starts doing it, ahhhhhÂ… self-righteous ppl then start imposing judgments on "atrocious acts", even among ourselves.  All these Â“IÂ’m holier than thouÂ” attitudes are but a big joke whether virtual or real.  Live for yourself, and not for others.<br><br>The world does not revolve around forums and IRC, so do set your priorities right and have fun!!  There is bound to be cliques, as well as bickering Â… but we are still all friends after all        <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Take a seat backÂ…. enjoy the drama... and laugh it off        <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>NowÂ…Â…Â…Â…..after all these Â… u can take this posting as bull-crap heehhe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>IM SERIOUS!!!!!!!<br>(OpppsÂ….

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Coco has put in her views based solely on what she reads from the posts, and just because its based on what she reads, that post was no mean feat. Excellent. Down right erriely close to what I suspect goes on in the forums.<br><br>Can I just suggest that there is a chance that the observations are not accurate because I disagree that everyone project their true selves onto forums such as this.<br><br>Everyone has their own agenda, or perhaps a better word would be priorities, so some people post when they are sad, others when they have something to say, and yet others post to socialize (so as to proceed on to meet in real life.)<br><br>At the very least, what I think we post here is just a snapshot of who we are as a person, so its easy to misunderstand the person behind the posts.<br><br>Please, this is not a critism, its a personal view that I want to share.<br><br>Lastly, I think that post could have done a lot more damage in exposing our true evil selves (joking lah). Sometimes we don't know how we appear to other people and it can be scary/ enlightening to suddenly find out how we appear to other people --- "what? thats what he/ she thinks of me?"<br><br>But she didn't.

            <div class='col-md body'>Was it virtuality taking over our life so much so that it has become a representation of part of our real life or is it that our virtual identity and behaviour has become too serious or intense that it is expected of us to behave like that in real life?<br><br>This is the question I have had a discussion with over a bottle of  Tequila with a friend. We might be high from the tequila, but I think we still makes sense in our discussion. We concluded here that unless you have a specific purpose to create a virtual Identity for yourself, you would still have parts of your behaviour characteristic in your virtual Identity. I cannot quote a better example than myself. (Trust me guys I am trying to be serious here.) I am known as a buaya, in fact the king of buayas, this was never given to me when I was in another forum, no flirting, no desperado there, instead just plain thoughts and intense discussions. But I notice a change in my online behaviour after sometime in sgforums. I became flirty, I love to charm women(If I did at all), a partial side of me manifested, the flirty and playful side. I have to admit that I am a flirty person by nature, and was pretty wild in my old days, in fact, I tried to pick someone in the forums up (apologies again gracious lady) on the first outing I went to, but it is just out of pure fun. But nonetheless, that being my only manifestation of what I use to be in real life, reinstate this sense of myself in virtuality.<br><br>The environment was also great to promote the growth of this virtual self. There were ready flirtees, populated by many others who supported and fed this small virtual self into a full grown identity I have here. I hate to say this, but I am already sterotyped by the people here even before they meet me. This is sad, but I did some little experiment her and there, and when I dun flirt online, or I dun pay much attention to the gals, they will like become suspicious that something is wrong with me. Hell! This virtual identity that I have, even brought me "fans". Believe it or not, I get peopel who I do not know and never chat with before coming up to me in IRc in private, saying that they miss me, and asked why I did not come online for so long. They would sometimes express that they like my style and stuff. Some even told me that he/she would just log on to #sgcafe and park there and observe my antics. I even have a few coming to me asking for tips on buayaing. And I have to repaeat this, I do not know them nor have I chatted with them at all. when asked how they got to know of this notorious self I have online, they said that they were from another channel and that they got to know of me from their friends who frequent #sgcafe...blah blah blah. so to all who help to spread the words, a big THANK YOU to you!<br><br>Of course I did experiments in real life too, I behave intensely desperate, trying to pick up the next gal I meet every moment, and spewing my flirtatious words to the new gals I meet on the forum. And they all believed that I am so, so are even not surprise. It makes me wonder, if this identity is a disaster itself. I might not be so universally hated in the forum, but I believe there are some out there who hate my guts, but I learn a few things here too, I learn that sometimes you just got to be nonchalant, you got to be able to differeitate virtuality and real life. Did any gals out there fall for my virtual identity? Some people ask me before, I replied, "hopefully not", (I dun think so anyway...it is just too unreal.) The simple reason being, I know they will be dissapointed at not being able to match my real self to my virtual self. I suppose if I have to come up with a equation for my virtual identity, it would be...<br><br>Virtual self = 10 X charming X suave X buaya X Real self.<br><br>So what has got my long lecture about my virtuality and real life got to do with politics in a forum? Well simply, I think the cliques here are more than just the forums alone, it is a representation of the people in real life, you will find 2 person of immersely different virtual identity in the same clique, but you got to know them in real life to find out that, they are rather similiar in real life. And as for the cliques here, I believe that people can be anyone they want, it is a matter of how good you are at image building. The virtual world provides a good breeding ground for the likes of shapeshifter and dopplehangers, for here they are truly faceless, and can assum anyone they want to be by just plain mere words, and I have always said words is a powerful tool, for it plays with the mind.<br><br>Who knows? I might just be one of the shapeshifters, trying to create an image with this post right now, you will never know, unless you know my true self.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

This thread, I believe, was started by atreiu to complain about being swayed and cajoled by some people to join their cliques.  I would have complained, too, but noone has ever tried to drag me around.  Honestly, I don't like being categorized into one of your classes and my "innards" displayed as public fodder.  True that what you have there are things which I have written myself in this forums but hey, I don't need the abstract (and the publicity?).<br><br>By the way, to think that hijacking a thread is something worthwhile enough to mention in 1 short paragraph.  The way it is written makes the so called 1st class people sounds like there is nothing "we" do beside hijacking threads.  Personally, if I have anything to reply to that person I would have replied, talking to the same people all the time can exhaust the mind.  But please, creating a new thread is just one simple click of a button, had I known that this will go down as hijacking I would have not posted there.<br><br>Okay, this is the free speech world, anyway.  But just in case you'd like to know what I think about your post, I can live without it.<br><br>------------------<br>My notion of a husband at forty is that a woman should be able to change him, like a bank note, for two twenties.</div>
