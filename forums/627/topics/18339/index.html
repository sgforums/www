            <div class='col-md body'>According to an article, we are genetically programmed to believe in something. As we feel uncomfortable abt the inability to control many events in life, we begin to construct smthg (e.g. religion) in order to avoid the paralysing uncertainty.<br>When we cultivate a superhuman object, we remove the anxiety and this enables us to adapt to the tough environment. We then benefit from the placebol effect of religions. And along the evolution process, this gives us the selective advantage. As research has shown, religious pple are generally more healthy than those who are not.<br>We have the fundamental need to make sense of our lives, abt life &amp; death issues. Religion gives us the security we all need.<br>Unlike other belief systems, science is universal and cultre-free. Hydrogen will always be hydrogen, DNA will always remain as the genetic material. Our understanding of science, however limited it can be, will remain right forever. Thus, science is not exactly considered as a "belief".<br>So, what am I trying to say here? I am just wondering if I choose to believe in God because of all the benefits, (placebol effect, selective advantage) am I then still considered as a faithful, loyal Chirstian? (if I happen to choose Jesus as my God?) Or will I become a science-based, calculative pseudo believer? Can God tells the difference?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... Interesting 'article' you've mentioned here... I've read bits and pieces of that kinda stuff and somehow the idea sychronised in me too...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Just for interest sake... What's the 'article' you're talking about here...? Any reference...?<br>Personally, I think that it's still possible for you to utilise the advantages of sciences despite the fact that you've got a religion... And though the idea of the 'hypothesis' you've mentioned may be contradictary to your religious belief, I would like to phrase out some simple facts...<br>1. Yes. Even if you believe in the 'hypothesis', you should know that it's beneficient to have a religion... And hence, I see no reason for you to give it up?<br>2. No. You don't believe in the 'hypothsis', then carry on with your religion.<br>3. It's just a 'hypothesis'. Otherwise well-proven to be, you shouldn't take it too seriously for now WHETHER it should be accepted cause TECHNICALLY speaking, there won't be much of a difference...<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It a good topic what you choose to belive is important. Who to belived you also must know alot of religious is bring out by teacher you need to find out more on different  religious , and see what you need than you choose wisely you, do not follow what your friends belived , you need to set what you want from GOD frist . Like me i choose to thank GOD than ask GOD to give want i want , one of my teacher told me that if you keep ask from GOD , did you all thank GOD when you get what you want ...if GOD don't give what you want you will scold GOD not giving you one . So what i belived GOD will give you what you  want when time right even you don't ask .So be Thankful to GOD even you are not in any religious...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>------------------<br>SUS<br>-------------------<br>Woman is to be love Woman not to be hurt Don't made me cried,<br>Don't said thing bad<br>So be good to me and<br>don't hurt me bad !!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that religion is illogical on its own. It cannot be explained by reasons alone, and it shall not be. It truly is an act of faith for one to worship one's god. So, I think if all of us are clear headed, facts oriented and extremely honest with ourselves, religion may not be able to exist at all. However, because of all the "other" benefits we can derived from the belief of the supernatural, because of the innate inclination towards the existence of such, religion is created, and it will continue to thrive among us.<br><br>Personally, I chose Christ as my god. Nevertheless, this is an extremely personal choice as I always say, faith is smthg that is very personal (&amp; irrational) while religion is smthg that is not. Religion is like faith, but more corporate-like, more structured, And it also aids the cohesiveness among the similar minded pple. As I understand this is a personal choice, I never preach. To be honest, I can't. I am not against preaching, just that it's not me. Maybe I still don't have enough faith now.<br><br>okay, I got that article on "You have to believe in smthg" here.... <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et?ac=000647321007942&amp;rtmo=VkZlumFx&amp;atmo=99999999&amp;pg=/et/01/1/25/ecfbelif25.html" rel="nofollow">www.telegraph.co.uk/et?ac=000647321007942&amp;rtmo=VkZlumFx&amp;atmo=99999999&amp;pg=/et/01/1/25/ecfbelif25.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to mention one of the many inconsistencies mentioned and erroneous reasoning used. You wrote: {Personally, I CHOSE Christ as my god. Nevertheless, this is an EXTREMELY PERSONAL CHOICEÂ…}<br>So how can you be programmed?<br><br>There are a lot of different concepts or worldviews that oppose your own faith. The major ones:<br>Atheism = there is no God e.g. Karl Marx, Ayn Rand.<br>Deism = God exists but does not perform miracles e.g. Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin.<br>Pantheism = all is God and God is all e.g. Hinduism, Taoism, Scientology, New Age.<br>Panentheism = God is developing along with the world e.g. Alfred North Whitehead.<br>Finite Godism = God exists but is limited or imperfect e.g. Rabbi Kushner.<br>Polytheism = many gods e.g. Mormons, ancient Greek and Roman gods.<br>Take your pick. Many have done so already.<br></div>

This includes atheists, whom you conveniently left out, that is, another group of people are Â‘programmedÂ’ NOT to believe in ANY of these gods. By admitting Â‘we are programmedÂ’, you have already struck off a few of the different worldviews I mentioned, that obviously includes atheism. Theism for example says God Â‘createdÂ’ (you mistakenly described as programmed) man with free will (PERSONAL CHOICE).<br>Well, at least you agree with me that an Â‘intelligent being or causeÂ’ exists, though this would be a right answer for the wrong reason or argument.<br></div>

But he is enlightened to all the mundane stuffs. Which means he sees thr life and death and his wisdom is no longer bound by the states of life(death is a state of life, jus that it's in it's inactive state. jus like water in it's gaseous state is all around you though you can't see it but it's there. when it's in it's active state, it then becomes visible, jus like water in it's liquid and solid state.)
