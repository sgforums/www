            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Sparkle,<br><br>Consider Qwerty's track record, I am not surprised that he has lost. However, both of you posted so many, that I really cannot tell who win or lost. Besides he has not played squash for years, does that provide the answer?. I would be playing squash soon with my college mates, since they are insistent that I should take it up other than my kendo and dancing. Otherwise, I will spend my time playing pool instead...<br><br>Well, I suppose that I would not be having such luck again, perhaps because the trip has been bizarre, dangerous and exciting. I think the blonde babe was looking for excitement to have sex in the airplane anyway. I can see the grim look on her face, imagining how liberal when we were chatting about love, marriage and sex, when I flatly refused her with an innocent smile, saying something along the lines that I don't mind one night stand, but I guess I would not do it. If it ever happens to me, expect me to say "How stupid I am again."....<br><br>Have a good time.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal</div>
