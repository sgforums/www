            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Qwerty,<br><br>I need to make it obvious to you. The fallacy of argument, ad-baculum, appeal by force of argument. I have use the consequence of being successful to not adopting it. If u still don't see it, let's forget and stop here. Check out some websites to what appeal to authority means, and it would do u more good than harm.<br><br>I am trying to illustrate that life is not a simple thing, yet there are some conceived notions to how things can be made to be asthethically pleasing. The context of my discussion and I don't think that we are arguing, is that there is something which is more abstract and beautiful in form, and yet some of us condemn it by making it realistic. Nope, u totally missed the point. We have different mechanisms in pursuing perfection in something we liked, our passion. And the common agreement that we need to adopt a perfectionist attitude. Kung-fu is merely a mechanism or analogy to illustrate how one should continuously train and upgrade himself to be better in the area. It is not the mechanism but the form. We are seeking the form and not the mechanism. Your comment about it being silly is that u don't see the meaning behind why it is useful.<br><br>I have not implied that I am right and u are wrong in all cases. The students whom I can teach, have proven me wrong before, and I gladly learned from them, after a long discussion and thinking about the issue. I don't mind being wrong at times, because I can grow with it. One thing I learned about people in Singapore, is that when they are proven wrong, they have hard feelings, thinking that it was out to get them. There are some things which u must learn and that is how the training goes and u refuse to. That is wrong, because I have advised and warned u against it.. If u choose not to take it, it does not mean that I am a bad teacher, it just means that u did not want to listen. If I have ever believed that I am right, I would not have sent u to elsewhere to learn from other people who I feel that they could be more suitable to teach u. Like I said in the previous post, I am afraid that I am a poor supervisor because I cannot teach u properly. I am willing to say it in the earlier post that I am a bad supervisor because I cannot teach u, but I doubt you could ever lower your ego and pride and said that u did not listen.<br><br>I don't see the point of saying anything more on this issue, if u are carrying on a course of arguing for the sake of arguing. That is not the point if the discourse has been used this far. If u don't know latin, spend some time learning. No harm learning something new. That is advice.<br><br>Do take care.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>"Fear is the path to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering."<br>- Yoda</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by prodigal:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, Qwerty,<br><br>I need to make it obvious to you. The fallacy of argument, ad-baculum, appeal by force of argument. I have use the consequence of being successful to not adopting it. If u still don't see it, let's forget and stop here. Check out some websites to what appeal to authority means, and it would do u more good than harm.<br><br>I am trying to illustrate that life is not a simple thing, yet there are some conceived notions to how things can be made to be asthethically pleasing. The context of my discussion and I don't think that we are arguing, is that there is something which is more abstract and beautiful in form, and yet some of us condemn it by making it realistic. Nope, u totally missed the point. We have different mechanisms in pursuing perfection in something we liked, our passion. And the common agreement that we need to adopt a perfectionist attitude. Kung-fu is merely a mechanism or analogy to illustrate how one should continuously train and upgrade himself to be better in the area. It is not the mechanism but the form. We are seeking the form and not the mechanism. Your comment about it being silly is that u don't see the meaning behind why it is useful.<br><br>I have not implied that I am right and u are wrong in all cases. The students whom I can teach, have proven me wrong before, and I gladly learned from them, after a long discussion and thinking about the issue. I don't mind being wrong at times, because I can grow with it. One thing I learned about people in Singapore, is that when they are proven wrong, they have hard feelings, thinking that it was out to get them. There are some things which u must learn and that is how the training goes and u refuse to. That is wrong, because I have advised and warned u against it.. If u choose not to take it, it does not mean that I am a bad teacher, it just means that u did not want to listen. If I have ever believed that I am right, I would not have sent u to elsewhere to learn from other people who I feel that they could be more suitable to teach u. Like I said in the previous post, I am afraid that I am a poor supervisor because I cannot teach u properly. I am willing to say it in the earlier post that I am a bad supervisor because I cannot teach u, but I doubt you could ever lower your ego and pride and said that u did not listen.<br><br>I don't see the point of saying anything more on this issue, if u are carrying on a course of arguing for the sake of arguing. That is not the point if the discourse has been used this far. If u don't know latin, spend some time learning. No harm learning something new. That is advice.<br><br>Do take care.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>"Fear is the path to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering."<br>- Yoda</div></blockquote>Okay now its my turn to explain things to you in simple singlish .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Authority.. by mentioning your friends who have suceeded who believe in your so-called idea . Arn't you associating their position and success with your idea ? Arn't you using their authority to validate your statement ... their authority being their position in the academic field as you mentioned . I hope this is clear enuff for you to understand . If you do , it would do you more good than harm ... haha<br><br>Anyway I agree its quite bohliao to argue about the way to argue .. quite meaningless don't you think so too ? .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.. YAHOO!!<br><br>So you are saying the point of kungfu is the form not the mechanism .<br>Well by linking maths to kungfu.. arn't you saying that maths is more form than function ? Well.. then I guess I've been studying the wrong maths all these while.. becoz to me maths is a tool to do my job .<br>As for the analogy about continual improvement.... isn't that about life in general.. you can find the issue about continual improvement in all endevours you seek... might as well compare maths to a marathon or to marriage etc... Like I said just because certain things resemble other things in certain respect doesn't make them a perfect fit in analogies . Hope you get this point too .<br><br>As for wheither there are some things for me to learn or not.. thats for me to decide . Did I tell you of the time , I once encountered a jehovas witness dude who told me that there were some things I had to learn but refused to accept..hahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Well I considered what he had to say and ignored him... why ? Because no matter what he said I did not believe him and he believed he was right.. since neither side can reach an agreement.. aiyah no point tokking lah..<br><br>Yup!! I dun see the point arguing for the sake of arguing since the topic is quite boh liao anyway.. I rather flirt wif my cutie pie...hehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But quirky qwerty has a feeling that you're tempted to have the last word...hahahaha in which case I'll rebutt .<br></div>
