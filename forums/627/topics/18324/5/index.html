So, it is not of big deal if u want to mock at my 3 "laws", virginity or sexuality. I have a good laugh at myself when getting snubbed.<br><br>People who cannot handle serious issues like adultery, cohabitation, virginity and sexuality and make a bigger fool of themselves, ends up losing their credibility and destroying themselves in the process. I know of one such idiot (not you, before u start speculating) who has achieved this by being obnoxious and amoral, and totally lose credibility even he thinks that some of his friends think like the way he do, and backstabbing him to others about his credibility. Condoning something does not necessarily mean implementing it.<br><br>The people who share my philosophy on relating the analogy of mathematics to kungfu are the people who have already written 1-3 research papers before they even do PhD, and come up with interesting means to learn and understand the subject and help me to think of new ideas to teach u in your supervisions so that you can understand the subject. They adopted my philosophy and think that it is a means to appreciate the subject and push themselves to higher heights. They may not be as hippy as the other supervisor of yours who goes around sleeping with undergrads in other colleges. At least, they get respected as true academics, and not muggers, geeks and nerds who study for the sake of examinations. It is like a fencer trying to achieve the perfect swordsplay (I know A shares the same idea as I do), science is the same. If u can't see the simple analogy and adopt the correct learning attitude, u would not be able to reach as far as those who I know do, and they would be the leaders of this field in the future. In that notion, I came to  understand why Singapore can never produce a Fields medalist or a Nobel Prize winner.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br></div>

Naive seems to see it as a sort of contest, is there anything worth fighing for there?<br></div></blockquote>Well, Matahari,<br><br>Hmmm, I guess I will be serious since I have been getting quite sarcastic and mean with the amusement of Qwerty, James and Sparkle out of having fun.<br><br>That is a good question. I have conjectured possible scenarios to break the first law<br><br>1)The guy she is with, ill-treats her and she wants to leave him. If there is no future, the gal must make the decision. The third party should not interfere at all.<br><br>2)The guy has betrayed her, by going with another gal behind her back, and I see it.<br><br>3)The gal is the One, and I really fall in love with her, and would do anything to get her, but that is also compromising between possession and love, since how would one know that he love a person by possessing her? This case, I am still in the grey area, but I will leave it open, till the situation arises. I have no answer to this.<br><br>I suppose that NG is just joking when she is determined to break my 1st law. (some things she said was just out of fun and to piss people off) If in real life, she is doing it for that reason, then I would say that it is a very sad thing, because the value of a relationship between two people has reduced to a challenge. Perhaps, I will just let her reply to you, than to make any speculations....<br><br>Above all, are my possible hypothetical cases of breaking the first law.
