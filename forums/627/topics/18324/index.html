            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>It has been some time that I wish to really write about the so-call Three "Laws" which I have formulated, and why I decide to adopt them for the time being. The first disclaimer                         for me, is that they are just "laws" or rules, you may call it, and they are not meant to be dogmatic or even be fixed for the rest of my life. These are not silly little principles which I have to abide at all times, but nevertheless, it keeps my sanity at check. Since I am not a very good guy, I need some rules to check my honour at times. Since rules are meant to be broken at times, I would perhaps end up breaking one of these laws but that does not mean I actively seek to break it. I will try to abide it at all                      times, and would break it if there is circumstantial reasons to believe that it should be violated. The second disclaimer is that I would say that I don't have a rational reason in writing these  three laws, but perhaps stem from a personal perspective on my way of life.<br><br>Let me state the three laws in the following order and discuss about them individually :<br><br><strong>Law 1 : Never go after attached or married women.</strong><br><br>This law is straight-forward and obvious, and of course, not all men abide by it. Why do I adhere myself to such a law? The first and foremost reason, is personal : I do not want to see another guy feeling the same way as I did, when my ex-girlfriend was "snatched" away by another man. I know how it feels, and how much it hurts and pains me at that moment of time. In short, <span style="font-style: italic;">do not unto others if you do not want others to do the same thing to you.</span> The second reason is more about being honourable since the Chinese has a saying that a gentleman should never take away a loved one from another. My self-reflection tells me that I am not a gentleman, but I just merely to try to keep myself in tabs.<br><br>Of course, there are so many occasions where I ought to violate my first law, because I have an unusual affinity with attached and married women, since they love hanging out with me or date me out casually, as I am mostly harmless to them. I feel comfortable with them around to guide and advise me. Well, many times, I feel tempted to break the first law, yet the living thought of bringing someone a horrible situation is still fresh in my mind, hence I decided not to do it, and in that aspect, I feel that my conscience is clear. It is perhaps a tragedy in a long run                        or a comedy in a short run, to never be able to impress single woman on the good side of me. I have given up trying in that light, and decided that all women whom I am to know in the future are attached. That saves a lot of trouble, trying to get away with blind dates which ended in disasters or in futile state.<br><br><strong>Law 2 : Beauty x Brains x Availability = Constant</strong><br><br>Well, this law is very analogous to Newton's 2nd law of motion, only with one catch : the interpretation of women. Originally, it was circulated on the net with the original           equation : Beauty x Brains = constant, which suggests women are either bimbos, or they have brains but no beauty. I did not agree with that judgement, and decided to modify the equation with an additional factor called availability, since I have met women with brains and beauty but they are no longer or rarely available at that point of time when I met them. Of course, the hardest problem was to determine the value of the constant. Various estimates have been given by using population statistics arguments, but the attempts failed because it is very difficult to quantify them. Sometimes, I ponder if it is the inadequacy of intellect as one might put it which makes so many women worry too much over trivial things. I don't think so, and I believe it is the triviality of soul - they really care about little things than about big ones. I suppose that it is one of                       the cynical lessons one learns in regard to most women, that they care more (or as much) for a smaller picture than for a big picture. I don't think it is intellect which is lacking in them but proportion in desire.<br><br><strong>Law 3 : What u give to a gal is never equal and opposite.</strong><br><br>Sad but true, and be realistic. It does not work that way. I have learned that thru many failed attempts. Yet, I still prefer to be the one giving. As I put it, love is not about possessing but about devoting your heart and soul to someone. Sometimes, I seek not to compel, but I felt that I lost out a lot, because I was not insistent enough. Perhaps, the secret key in winning a gal's heart is to be insistence and persistence together. Still, I will try to do my best to court a gal as much as I can, until I know that she has hit the "attached" status. Hence this law is to tell myself that I should not expect anything from trying to court someone. Of course, no expectations would mean no disappointments.<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 03 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear prodigal,<br><br>It is always a pleasure to read your thoughts and debate with you on your theories. Rules and regulations, havenÂ’t you had enough of those over here or is it really so lacking over there that some semblance of order is needed? Live and let live, as I say and to hell with these self-imposition rules!  They are meant to be broken and since someone snatches your gal away, you should do likewise to others too. As the saying goes, do not do unto others what you do not wish others to do onto you. The motto has changed to since others did shit to me, I shall did shit back to others. Welcome to the real world buddy. Mother Theresa sucks and Machiavellian rules.<br><br><strong>Law 1 : Never go after attached or married women.</strong><br><br>What a bull of crock. It has never deterred other man from straying or coveting his neighbourÂ’s wife and it should not be a hinder to you too! Remember, this is a very ruthless dog covet another dogÂ’s bone world. You will only lose out if you do play by your own rules and hey, THERE IS NO RULES! To the winner goes the spoilt and my dear friend, the winner will be decided by the gal involved Darwinism works best in humans and there is nothing more evolutionary than mating and choosing the right one. Go! Chase! Pursue! Hunt! The moral lies with the gal, she is the one that has to make her choice, and you donÂ’t. You are only following your instincts, genes and love. Nothing could be more wrong than that. The maxim is survivor of the fittest. Thus, I shall decree the first law as,<br><br><strong>THERE IS NOBODY YOU CANÂ’T CHASE.</strong><br><br><strong>Law 2 : Beauty x Brains x Availability = Constant</strong><br><br>This is the most annoying law. Why? Because it is so true! Beauty and brains, it is by right a rare occurrence, the rarer still if it is still left on the shelf. This is a very cruel world my friend, you must always treasure it when you nab such stuff. I did, long time ago and my self-destructive tendencies stepped in and boom, all over. Up to this day, I am still cursing myself and I wondered hard if I will ever self-destruct in front so horribly again.<br>One thing though, you forgot to factor in Lady Luck. One never knows.<br><br><strong>Law 3 : What u give to a gal is never equal and opposite.</strong><br><br>My dear friend, of course! There can never be an equal and opposite reaction AT THE SAME TIME! Such things simply doesnÂ’t happen or why you think the guy got to take cold showers all the time and the gal grumbling that he is always more interested in the plastic black and white balls than her pinkies. Simply put, there will be a time when she loves you more than you does her. And vice versa. The trick to such thing is remembering itÂ…that both parties are capable of such strong emotions.<br><br><strong>What u give to a gal is never equal and opposite at the same time.</strong><br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear James~,<br><br>What an interesting parody and perhaps a counter-argument to my 3 "laws". Perhaps, it is interesting to note that the difference in paradigm seen in people of today vs the people perhaps not far, but in our parents time. Let me first made clear that the three "laws" are not laws, but merely a set of guidelines which I choose to follow. I am sure that you have your set of guidelines. As I have said earlier, rules are meant to be broken, and one must not look at this set of "laws" of mine as some form of dogma, because when something becomes dogmatic, one forgets the meaning on why it is there for the first place.<br><br>More or less, I think that only the counter-proposal to the first law seems justified. Because the 2nd and 3rd law are more like observations than making really it look like laws. The 2nd law is merely a corollary saying that in this world, there exist a woman with both beauty and brains and the 3rd law, the action-reaction is not equal and opposite. So, there is no contention for that either. Hence I viewed your attempts to counter the 2nd and 3rd law were pathetic, because the statements are invariably clear as descriptive observations about things around us.<br><br>Let me take a step back and go back to the first law again. There is a different reason on why people chose to do it or not to do it. I am very clear why I adopted it, because I don't want to let someone suffer what I have been thru. For one thing, I think that it is not a matter of morality, but a matter of karma and retribution. One could approach the first law in a version that goes like this. Since u can snatch a woman away from a man like this, it is also likely that someday she will run away with another man in the same light to u. I am sure that you are going to say that it's not going to happen to me, or advocate a seemingly cruel world out there. However, when we are subject to the situation, are we really ready to accept the reality. Some people say yes and some people say no.<br><br>Recently, I have a very interesting discussion with my friend on this first "law", since I am reviewing a possible hypothetical scenairo of a couple breaking up because of difference in education level, and the third party is possibly more suitable for the gal, and the gal in the scenairo knew it as well. An immediate consequence of the law, for me, is that I would not break a couple up, as the Cantonese have a saying which goes like "I would rather teach a father to beat his son in order to educate the son, than to break up a couple" or  "Ning Jiao Ren Da Zi, Mo Jiao Ren Fen Ci".<br><br>Well, the lucky thing is that I am the observer, so my friend posed the question to me : are u going to facilitate the breakup and would do anything to allow it to happen at the price that it has violated your first law? Then I realized what he is trying to say, because when a law becomes too dogmatic, a person forgets why he started believing in it in the first place. More or less, it led me to re-evaluate my own principles and come to a conclusion. In my own capacity, I would not ask my friend to break up with her bf, even though I feel that she is not compatible with him (and note that I may be wrong in making that value-judgement). I would say that to stay or not to stay is her choice, even if I know what is best for her. That is the point, we cannot stop people from making their choices on what kind of life which they want to live.<br><br>It is like saying something like this, let me construct an hypothetical case. Suppose I am interested in this girl, for example, our dearest Daddy's Little Girl, since she has a horde of suitors going after her, and finally I met her in real life and unfortunately she was attached, because I was at the wrong time in the wrong place, I did not manage to win her heart. I could choose to use all kinds of dirty tricks to win her heart and break her up with the other guy. But the problem is when we are finally together, and when she sees that I am not really the person whom she wanted, it would be hurting to her.<br><br>To breakup a couple is very simple, but to be with the person u love then and truthfully is difficult. If people really believe in true love, why do people have to resort to such tricks to win a person's heart? It is no longer because I love her, it is more likely because I want to possess her, and take her as a plaything. Using Colette's most powerful flaming argument known as the archivist technique, I recalled that u also said something about woman not being a plaything in your thread about "The Art of Pursue". Honestly, if I have to resort to win a r/s like this, I would rather stay single, at least, I am accountable to myself and my conscience is clear. I may feel bad about why I never did it, and envy the couples walking in the street, kissing and doing whatever they pleased. Nevertheless, it is better the sorrow of doing something wrong vs the long and impatient wait. That is the spirit of true love, because u love her, you choose to let go.<br><br>I can bitch or whine to you about the terrible situation which I was in when someone did this to me, but I learned to see it in a different way as I spent the year going thru a recovery period. Sometimes, I do ask myself the same question, perhaps, she has lost the love for me, and after all the chain reaction happened and caused irreversible damages, I realized that now, if I am still going to say I did love her at that moment of time and perhaps now keeping her a part of memory of me, I think I should let her go as well, because in the same way, letting go also meant that I let myself go and not dwelling in the past. Perhaps, I might be an unlucky guy to have it happening to me again, and I don't know how I would react to it again, but at least, I know one thing, I never did anyone any wrong and I can still live my life without being fearful to my own sins. But using your Machievellian or Nietzsche reasoning, can you? I don't think so.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Bohemian, my old friend,<br><br>*grin* Welcome back. Well, I would use a more modernized way to deal with James' statements on his might being right, by using Sokal's claim that an idea is irrefutable does not necessarily imply that it is true in the first place.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>what if there is mutual attraction between you and an attached girl. she is in an unhappy relationship but chooses to remain in the relationship for reasons such as history with the guy, loyalty and long sufferingness? will you still think its right to abide by your 1st law?<br><br>and when you say 'never go after an attached or married woman' will you allow for unmeditated circumstance? do you think you have broken your law if a sexual act is committed without prior planning?</strong></blockquote>Let me tell u a story of mine, but perhaps, it provide my answer and perhaps it might not.<br><br>Years ago, I have met a girl who possessed what I wanted in my life. She has beauty and brains and she and I cliqued very well. However, there is a problem. A close friend of mine and I were both interested in her at the same time, but we hang out very well. Finally, she was having difficulty in choosing. But I figured out that she is happy with the other guy, giving that their backgrounds in terms of wealth (they both came from very rich families) are pretty similar. So I dropped out of the race. We still hanged out as good friends.<br><br>Until one day, the guy did something really wrong to the gal, by sleeping with another gal. They broke up and being the family friend, I have to counsel both of them. There was a night, where she drove me up to a hill, because she needed someone to talk to. So, I accompanied her, and we both started drinking. There was a point of time where something almost happened, and I could have been with her in the end. (I will leave u to imagine what happened). The ending is that, I  was only high but not drunk, and I dumped her into her car, and took her keys, and let her rest inside while I slept on the bench outside the park. I would not tell u the remaining part of the story but what I did eventually was to patch them up together and they did get back because they loved each other, but there was always a time when I ask myself whether I should have violated my first law because I could have seized the chance and did something, and I chose not to. U may call me stupid and my answer is that I never regret what I did, because on some level, I did love her, and to love someone is not about possessing it. Hence more or less, I think that you know what my answer will be if it has ever reached the point where the gal is attached, since in this place, the gal was technically not attached at that point where something can be done.<br><br>Actually, I don't know the answer myself, because I am still searching for answers myself. Perhaps, someday, I might violate my first law because of what u proposed as a hypothetical example. That would mean that one, I am very sure that she is the One for me or two, I just loved her so much that I could not let go of her. Nevertheless, I still hope that I will not hurt the other guy in the process.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 04 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Dear prodigal,<br><br>Forgive me if my arguments lack coherency and sounds like I am stepping all over my foot. I am tired and it is near 0200 over here. I am sick and tired of everything the world has throw me in my miserable 23 years of existence and worst still, my tutor is asking me to write an essay on Marx, Engels and historical materialism. I still persist my Bismarck theory ALA by iron and blood, that it is either them or me. I will not suffer gladly what heaven, gods or destiny has thrown me and I will be dammed if others broke the rules on my expense.<br>Sorry pal, the cynic in me believes in selfishness. ItÂ’s me versus the world and I owe nobody any explanations for my actions. Any consequences of my actions are not predetermined. You never know until you tried.<br><br>cheerio<br>james<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by prodigal:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear James~,<br><br>What an interesting parody and perhaps a counter-argument to my 3 "laws". Perhaps, it is interesting to note that the difference in paradigm seen in people of today vs the people perhaps not far, but in our parents time. Let me first made clear that the three "laws" are not laws, but merely a set of guidelines which I choose to follow. I am sure that you have your set of guidelines. As I have said earlier, rules are meant to be broken, and one must not look at this set of "laws" of mine as some form of dogma, because when something becomes dogmatic, one forgets the meaning on why it is there for the first place.<br><br>More or less, I think that only the counter-proposal to the first law seems justified. Because the 2nd and 3rd law are more like observations than making really it look like laws. The 2nd law is merely a corollary saying that in this world, there exist a woman with both beauty and brains and the 3rd law, the action-reaction is not equal and opposite. So, there is no contention for that either. Hence I viewed your attempts to counter the 2nd and 3rd law were pathetic, because the statements are invariably clear as descriptive observations about things around us.<br><br>Let me take a step back and go back to the first law again. There is a different reason on why people chose to do it or not to do it. I am very clear why I adopted it, because I don't want to let someone suffer what I have been thru. For one thing, I think that it is not a matter of morality, but a matter of karma and retribution. One could approach the first law in a version that goes like this. Since u can snatch a woman away from a man like this, it is also likely that someday she will run away with another man in the same light to u. I am sure that you are going to say that it's not going to happen to me, or advocate a seemingly cruel world out there. However, when we are subject to the situation, are we really ready to accept the reality. Some people say yes and some people say no.<br><br>Recently, I have a very interesting discussion with my friend on this first "law", since I am reviewing a possible hypothetical scenairo of a couple breaking up because of difference in education level, and the third party is possibly more suitable for the gal, and the gal in the scenairo knew it as well. An immediate consequence of the law, for me, is that I would not break a couple up, as the Cantonese have a saying which goes like "I would rather teach a father to beat his son in order to educate the son, than to break up a couple" or  "Ning Jiao Ren Da Zi, Mo Jiao Ren Fen Ci".<br><br>Well, the lucky thing is that I am the observer, so my friend posed the question to me : are u going to facilitate the breakup and would do anything to allow it to happen at the price that it has violated your first law? Then I realized what he is trying to say, because when a law becomes too dogmatic, a person forgets why he started believing in it in the first place. More or less, it led me to re-evaluate my own principles and come to a conclusion. In my own capacity, I would not ask my friend to break up with her bf, even though I feel that she is not compatible with him (and note that I may be wrong in making that value-judgement). I would say that to stay or not to stay is her choice, even if I know what is best for her. That is the point, we cannot stop people from making their choices on what kind of life which they want to live.<br><br>It is like saying something like this, let me construct an hypothetical case. Suppose I am interested in this girl, for example, our dearest Daddy's Little Girl, since she has a horde of suitors going after her, and finally I met her in real life and unfortunately she was attached, because I was at the wrong time in the wrong place, I did not manage to win her heart. I could choose to use all kinds of dirty tricks to win her heart and break her up with the other guy. But the problem is when we are finally together, and when she sees that I am not really the person whom she wanted, it would be hurting to her.<br><br>To breakup a couple is very simple, but to be with the person u love then and truthfully is difficult. If people really believe in true love, why do people have to resort to such tricks to win a person's heart? It is no longer because I love her, it is more likely because I want to possess her, and take her as a plaything. Using Colette's most powerful flaming argument known as the archivist technique, I recalled that u also said something about woman not being a plaything in your thread about "The Art of Pursue". Honestly, if I have to resort to win a r/s like this, I would rather stay single, at least, I am accountable to myself and my conscience is clear. I may feel bad about why I never did it, and envy the couples walking in the street, kissing and doing whatever they pleased. Nevertheless, it is better the sorrow of doing something wrong vs the long and impatient wait. That is the spirit of true love, because u love her, you choose to let go.<br><br>I can bitch or whine to you about the terrible situation which I was in when someone did this to me, but I learned to see it in a different way as I spent the year going thru a recovery period. Sometimes, I do ask myself the same question, perhaps, she has lost the love for me, and after all the chain reaction happened and caused irreversible damages, I realized that now, if I am still going to say I did love her at that moment of time and perhaps now keeping her a part of memory of me, I think I should let her go as well, because in the same way, letting go also meant that I let myself go and not dwelling in the past. Perhaps, I might be an unlucky guy to have it happening to me again, and I don't know how I would react to it again, but at least, I know one thing, I never did anyone any wrong and I can still live my life without being fearful to my own sins. But using your Machievellian or Nietzsche reasoning, can you? I don't think so.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal</div></blockquote>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, james~,<br><br>I think you mix up principles with morality. Morality, to me, is just a social code which is conditioned by the society at that point of time. However, there are some values which people still adhere to. U c, despite I have my three "laws", I am also looking at the other side of the argument, and perhaps, give it some grey area to look at. A lot of times, in r/s, whether what happens or not, are complicated and not necessarily black or white. Hence, to me, your arguments just only expand the horizon of the framework which I tried to work on, and hopefully, find a hybrid system which is more adaptable. That is how Darwinism would work for a pragmatic idealist, by allowing the grey areas within a constrained framework. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, it is still the gal who made the choice, not us.<br><br>Contrary to your perspective, I don't find myself in any case, having a lot of morals. My belief is that there are things which people should do and people should not do, and those things people should not do, are to hurt others while trying to pursue their own self-interests. But if there is no choice, then we should just do it, and care about consequences later. Words are merely cotton fabric.<br><br>When reading your argument, a quote from the movie "Soong Sisters" came to my mind, where Michelle Yeoh was telling Maggie Cheung why their sister should marry the "bad" guy (notice the quotation marks) : "Men are not distinguished by good and bad, but by strong and weak."<br><br>Have a good sleep....<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>"Words don't mean anything in the end, but action.
