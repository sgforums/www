Don't even get me started on that it was my "mistake".

            <div class='col-md body'>zut, now it's getting personal.<br><br>dear prodigal, i learn when i want to learn. somebody may point out to me that i should be learning something when it is of no interest to me and i have to say no.  you are my friend, i know i have things to learn from you but i'd rather pick it up myself.  i guess the same is true for other people.<br><br>this is not a tuition centre where i enroll myself and obligated to hear what the teacher says, no matter what syllabus she is teaching.  i'm learning about life, there is no syllabus and though you say it resignedly that people in the end decide what they want to do, perhaps it will be better if that resigned tone is not there in the first place<br><br>-----------------------------------------------<br>ask and you will be given. don't ask...and?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Matahari (edited 12 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Matahari,<br><br>I will use this one post (it's my 1299th post and I reserve the next one for a special occasion) to defuse all the bomb which u have been accumulating. I don't see why u are getting so personal and angry over this. In a very bad sense, the discussion has degenerated into almost a rant. I suggest that you should cool down and think about what you have written.<br><br>As for shadeofgrey's entrance, I will leave it as such. Perhaps, I should not have used the word mistake in the first place. My apologies. I was merely pointing out to him that one could compromise instead of adhering to higher standards. If u want to wallop me up, then I can always fly off to somewhere for a holiday.<br><br>I am not getting angry at your repeated insistence over certain issues, but it is making u pick up the wrong kind of signals and inferences, if you ask me. If u want to talk over this, I suggest that email would be a better device here to throw out your rant, and what u want to say.<br><br>Cool down and see the bigger picture.<br><br>Do take care.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In this world of utter nonsense, in trying to convince others we convince ourselves. In the face of others we see ourselves... In different forms and different shapes. We thought, we knew... We knew, we don't....<br>In an attempt to argue, we find reasons. We save, we kicked. Our view, our windows..... Different. In an attempt to believe, we do not stick our heads into other people's windows. We pull their heads and stick them up into ours. Yes we see, we listen... But we don't care. We feel, we care... But we don't do. We laugh at others, we look at others.... But we'll never see ourselves. Though we're all mankind, not one of a kind. We think, we thought, we fear......<br>Don't be afraid to admit. Don't be afraid to be weak. Afterall, it's just the thing that made us so human.<br>You think you know? You don't.... You think I know? I think I do.... But the real question is.... What is the 'subject' we're talking about here? Do you know? I think you do....<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....<br><br>[This message has been edited by Devil1976 (edited 17 October 2000).]</div>
