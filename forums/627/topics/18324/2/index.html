            <div class='col-md body'><br>bohemian,<br><br>Of course, you are right in saying I am impertinent in using the holocaust as an example. They suffered so much throughout history that they will not tolerate any more racism against them, using might to equal their relationship with the rest of the world. I had enough of poverty and abused from the rich to know where power lies and what power can bring me. ItÂ’s a matter of degree but the argument is the same. To put it crudely, once you have tasted shit, you wouldn't want it anymore.<br><br>I have not read everything Hegel had written but his words on Napoleon strikes me deeply...""It is a truly wonderful experience to see such an individual, on horseback, concentrating on one point, stretching over the world and dominating it".  It was a profound impact for him and one for me too. His acknowledgement to power and might is unmistakable. And so does his sucking up to the Prussian government, an organisation whose authority derived from might.<br><br>Is might right? I can't profess to answer that, although I might have inkling that it might not be so under a jackboot. The world is changed and moulded by great men, hard men even. It can hardly be right when might is all about forcing people to do things your way. We see it everywhere, from the most liberal US of America to draconian North Korea. States forcing their policies on their people and on other states, leaders dictating their orders to their people, managers asking their workers to do this and so on. I always scream murder when might are imposed on me and I know that realistically, the only way out of this is to acquire might myself. I will be the arbiter of whether it's right or wrong.<br><br>I agree with you that caffeine is what drives the human spirit in times of difficulty and I tried not to think too much of Freud (inevitably crediting everything to his rival.my fault), cos he gives me wet dreams with his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality.<br><br>"Sometimes a cigar is only a cigar."<br>Sigmund Freud<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Bohemian:</div><div class="quote_body">james,<br><br>you mean freud to psychoanalysise you - jung doesn't deal so much with sexuality. i'm getting a clearer picture of where you're coming from. and if you are a hegel fan, you'll know that since governments are the highest form of civil order contemporary man can throw up, and its with this apparatus that will-to-power may be channeled constructively.

            <div class='col-md body'>How could there be no such thing as a bad experience? There are experiences and experiences, some simply are more pleasant than others. I do not need to be burnt to know that fire is hot, thus, sometimes it is better to avoid some experiences if circumstances allow it for they bring nothing but pain, even if during their course, happiness is experienced, but the pain always outlast the brief happiness. Life is already quite a pain when unavoidable events take place, why add to its misery by consciously choosing experiences that may just up the stakes in experiencing pain?<br><br>[This message has been edited by certifiable (edited 06 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To all,<br><br>Since loading a SGforums page takes me a very long time in India, this is perhaps one of the post which I will write long here in reply to various people, in no order of preference, using one reply in one go.<br><br><strong>Dear Bohemian and perhaps to James</strong>,<br><br>First of all, I am not really that good as you have spoken of me. I have been a bad boy before, otherwise, I would not have avoided the forum, trying all means and ways to hide who I am, now that it no longer matters.<br><br>I believed in Darwinism, that there is a survival of the species. I believe that there is strong and weak and only the strong will prevail, and I believe that it is a dog-eat-dog world because someone once said, when there are people, there are always turbulence and conflict, because humans would by nature make them happen. But that does not mean that I am cynical to hide behind some mask and be ugly. Because I feel that cynicism is a loser's mentality, and cynics can never achieve anything or make a difference in life. I used to believe in Kant in total enlightenment, but now I prefer a mixture of Nietzsche and Kant, to give myself more space to grow, to be expanded to more experiences and have a balanced view to things. I believe that experience is the name which everyone gives to their mistakes. Experience only allows me to re-adapt and select what is useful and not useful to me, and some painful ones change me and kills part of me.. If someone thinks that I am still the same as ever, then he or she would suffer the consequences later. I believed in constructive competition, people help each other to grow, to work for a greater course. I don't see any point in destructive competition, because it is not economical and pragmatic at all.<br><br>I can choose to be evil and ruthless, if I want to. Don't think that I will stick to the first law as if it is some religious dogma. If things change, and I change as well, I may just break it because things become dogma, when someone forgets why he or she believed in it the first place.. But there is no need for me to do that now, since I am still living in a idllyic world of academia. I prefer to be kind and nice to people since I think that it is the right thing for me to do. Maybe after 2 years from now, I think that I will be change as well, since I have more or less know what I am going to do next. However, I am aware that there are people who take that for granted, and think that I can be bullied around or I am too nice to be pushed around. If one attempts to stretch my tolerance to the point which I finally get mad and angry (which has not happened yet), I would not hesitate to pull punches on anything, meaning that I would pay an eye for an eye, if not 10 times the treatment to some moron who attempt to hurt my family. One should take kindness from me as weakness since I know that I have acquired my fair share of adversaries thru confrontation as well...<br><br>My passage to India was quite bizarre. I was chatting with an American blonde who sat next to me on the plane to Calcutta. I was telling her that I still could not believe that I am now heading to India and know what I would be doing exactly or expecting there since everyone painted negative pictures of the place to me. Going to Calcutta was a new experience for me, and it is now an exciting adventure for me to be in a world different from ours which we take it for granted, from the clean water we drink to the clean streets we have in Singapore, and to the wide disparity of wealth from the rich to the poverty.<br><br><strong>Dear NaiveGirl</strong>,<br><br>I would just do my best to prevail your tests, in view of your attempts to stretch my limits. Like I said before, if you are like Jennifer Anniston or Gong Li, saying that "I am worth it" and if u are the One, I would push myself to persist or even break my laws for you. If you are not, then I would not be bothered anymore but still be a good friend who can support and help u whenever u need me..
