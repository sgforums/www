The goddess by the name of Manchurian Pearl, speaks in riddles with her fantastic one-liners hence, perhaps, it is our mortal minds which cannot fathom her implied meanings. *hahahahahahahahahahahahahahah*<br><br>Well, try ask her out.... but don't be surprised if her bodyguard is there to protect her from your lust over her....
