            <div class='col-md body'>ah james~,<br><br>PLEASSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEE don't bring back unhappy memories for me leh, i'm still recovering from the pain of that rejection. i was emailing with someone for months hor, in fact up to July and i don't mind letting you and the whole wide world know that it's someone from this forum hor, and then one day, i made the mistake of asking for his number, then hor, he disappeared from my life you know, just like that *snap fingers*. all that after spending hours writing long, long, long emails. mind you, should i print it out, it runs into 3 or 4 pgs type of mail hor. *poof* just like that, he never answered me again, it hurts. that, that, that ... no, i shan't be rude and call him names.<br><br>okay, enough about narcissistic me, getting a person's phone number should be easy. you just ask for it, of course not on the first ICQ session, you'll come across as a creep. actually, it depends on the level of chemistry and how comfortable you feel with a person, sometimes two people just click and an exchange of numbers seem logical whereas sometimes, people may be chatting out of politeness, so even if you have been ICQing for weeks, months or even years, you're not likely to get the phone number.<br><br>but i can understand if the gal is unwilling to give it to you, it's always a hassle changing numbers, especially if it's the house number or even mobile number, ditto for the guys. well, you could simply give her your number, if she's curious about how you sound like, she'll give you a call. er, just pray that you don't get a clinging vine, then hor, you'll curse the day you ask for her number or gave her your number. hahahaha ...<br><br>er, btw, did i ever tell you that i'm like poison ivy?<br><br>hehe...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ah james,<br><br>THANNNNNKKKKKKKSSSSSSSS for your level of sympathy. *sniffs*<br><br>from reliable sources, i know that you're short and ugly, thus, falling real short from being a hunk.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> hahahaha ... er no offence meant hor.<br><br>regarding the level of chemistry and comfortability achieved by either partner, i think it's a matter of luck or maybe if someone is on a caffeine rush, chemistry level may just shot up sky high. i know of someone who was so high on caffeine once that she just give her pictures away and boy does she regrets it now knowing how close the guy is living near her, talk about bad karma.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>for me, initial chemistry is instinctive, whether i like the person or not, long term chemistry will vary upon his/her behaviour, whether they're consistent with their words and actions, nobody can fake for long.<br><br><blockquote>So how do you achieve that level of comfortability with a person?

U reminded me of the poor Indian granny in the streets of Chennai begging for money...<br><br>*evil laughter* muahahahahhahahahahahahahhaha<br><br>Anyway, Shadeofgrey is not Terence, and I can bet one million US dollars with you confidently that he is not. Get to know him and u know that he is not Terence.
