            <div class='col-md body'>Today was the passing out parade of the batch of recruit whom i was with for the past 2 months. It marks the end of the Basic Military Training (BMT) phase of their National Service life. This is one of the few days the men actually get to bring their loved ones into and around the camp ( how is that so immensely attractive, i have no idea ). Also a time for the rest of us to wonder once again why is it that other people's girlfriends and sisters are always prettier, but that's another story.<br><br>The day's events were divided into four parts - the contingent march pass and the speech by the obligatory VIP, a demonstration by the winning platoon of the drill competition, a bayonet fighting demonstration, and mock attacks mounted on two of our 4-storey living quaters.<br><br>And so went the speech about how the drill competition fosters teamwork among the men and obedience to the commanders. Do what you are told and do it well ? So much for thinking soldiers..<br><br>Teamwork ? Hardly. Men held together out of fear of being punished for the one wrong turn or step. Men getting paid wayang money to do wayang shit. Brainwashed into thinking what little they are taught in this army of ours in the two years they are stuck here will make a difference when the time of judgement comes.<br><br>Bayonet fighting one-on-one. Bayonet fighting one-on-two. Parry. Thrust. Bash. Slash. Stab. Enemy makes feeble attempt at blocking attack. Enemy falls. Enemy dies. Audience claps. In the real life, the enemy fights back. In the real life, death is not very entertaining, not to the sane ones at least.<br><br>Parents whose sons are plucked from the cradle, barely out of school, and taught how to kill, applauding their children's prowess at delivering death. It's a beautiful world we live in, isn't it ?<br><br>Shortly after, sounds of gunfire and thunderflashes signalled the start of the mock attack. Charge up, charge in, fire some blanks, throw some flashes, declare the zone clear. Lots of loud noises. Lots of drama. Lots of applause. Lots of cheers. I wonder if these are the same people who laughed when they saw the one-armed soldier picking up his detached arm when SPR came to Singapore.<br><br>And I thought I was mad.<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>IMPORTANT NOTE: The above text was not written by me, I got it from a friend. But I found it interesting enough to put up here.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Jason (edited 07 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey ppl,<br><br>jason good for you, enjoy the rest of NS.<br><br>i was previously an officer cadet instructor in combat engineers.<br><br>not gonna worry too much about the philosophies surrounding NS and killing or whatever cos i am too over it by now.<br><br>anyway not trying to sound like i am putting anybody down but i think i was fortunate not being stuck in infantry. don't wanna elaborate too much but i think any combat vocation is more fulfilling than infantry cos whatever it is, the sense of "wayang" is greatest when you are a foot soldier.<br><br>furthermore, support arms seriously have a lot more fun becos when mucking around with heavy machinery and high explosives etc you really feel like you are doing something at least, however pointless.<br><br>also, in engineers the "family" is small when compared to infantry so with our cross training, especially as an officer and instructor, nearly everyone knows everyone so we feel much closer. ooohh mushy.<br><br>yeah but still good bad and ugly ns is ns for whatever anyone can say we all have our own experience right? i don't think it was that bad but then again, i already ORD!!!<br><br>but at the end of the day, one good judge of what Ns has done for you is simply to ask yourself the following question (considering only ONE of the reasons for an armed force):<br><br>"are we gonna win any wars?"<br><br>Nope.<br><br>incidentally, i laughed the loudest when the poor guy couldn't find his arm in SPR. shock and battle fatigue is funny to WATCH. and when a bunch of soldiers got ripped to bits by a flak gun. is it what, a 2-inch round? f@#k!<br><br>see my next post for "Nazi SAF"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"NAZI SAF"<br><br>ok this is just a silly observation i made during NS, based completely on limited knowledge and examples:<br><br>In world war two, the colour of the German Army individual and vehicular uniform, in most theatres of the war was grey, or German Grey.<br><br>Well, look at most of the vehicles in SAF, whether freshly painted of even after a period of fading, the colour starts to resemble a green-grey shade similar to die Nazis...<br><br>Even today, German combat engineers are called "Pioneers"; the term in this context was first used by Nazis in World War Two to describe the "first in, last out" engrs who paved the way.<br><br>SAF combat engineers - they are refered to as "pioneers" too. you get pioneers, infantry pioneers, armour pioneers etc. ya real kool.<br><br>Name of Offical SAF magazine? "Pioneer" magazine.<br><br>Though most modern armed forces use the same US kevlar helmet, the colour of the one adopted by SAF makes us look even more like Nazi troopers.<br><br>aww look i forget the rest. when i remember i'll beback. anyone else noticed similarities?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, interesting comparision to the German army but i seek to point out 2 things.<br><br>1) the present SAF is kind of soft and Ku-niang. Look at the kind of bed the recruits get in BMT and the kind of welfare they got.<br>I just ORD not too long, but i belong to the rather unfortunate old SAF type BMT and unit.<br>the creaky beds and Tekan sessions  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but thats another story  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>2) to compare us and the elite Panzars and German troops is similair to comparing our infantry units to the US 101 ABD. A hell of a difference.<br><br>Anyway i think our comparision wise is a little off<br>the kevlar helmet we are using is similair to the American GI issued ones. The reason why its like a German Helmet is cause it is meant to cover the top and sides of U ears and offer U some protection. thus the German look.<br><br>The paint they use to paint military vehicles is dark tan if i am not wrong, a rather old type of camo which is good for the jungle.<br><br>as for the Pioneer thing, hmm, i think american engineers are also called pioneers during WW2.<br><br>As for similarities, I would hope that Singapore move more into the direction of the IDF, Israelies Defence Force which is combat proven during the many wars in the 60s and 70s. Following the Germans is not a real good idea.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok this a last post about the nazi thingy.<br><br>well like i said it was a silly groundless observation and simply poking fun at nothing. hahah in fact to me its really funny if we did look like Nazis. yah. with their baggy (chicken drumstick) officer pants and monocles and skinny canes to whip the soldiers with, all which i will have no part of. ok one more - Hitler vs LKY... one man regime.<br><br>btw, i think hitler is seriously misunderstood. right shall i attempt an explanation in the next post? oh the temptation is tooooooo greeaattt......<br><br>anyway, it is obvious singapore has in its infancy some decades back, looked for a model through which we could shape our military. in those highly volatile and vulnerable times, the isrealis were called upon to help us. yah them jews. i think many of us know why israel was perceived to be suitable, but i shall not elaborate unless someone asks.<br><br>well by now, things are more stabilised in the region the SAF is totally revamped. the SAF looks to all sources and no longer takes it precedent from just the israelis. and observing the current situation in the Security Zone (Israel and Palestine), i think  it not wise to model ourselves after israel, however indebted we are. hahahaha unless the women volunteer for NS!<br><br>Not just me and you,<br>but NS for girls too!<br>So let's do,<br>Some hebrew.<br><br>ok anyway germany today is different from WW2  and nothing wrong now (neither are the japanese), their technology is often recognised as first class, and the SAF invest in german equipment as well. hell, even russian hardware was once seen as a possibility.<br><br>i think the SAF has gotten over 'following' another armed forces or relying on others. i mean, the organisation has even tried to produce its own equipment where feasible, attempts which are well er... commendable. it sucks, but let's be fair. you gotta start somewhere right?<br><br>anyway. just saying we shouldn't follow the israelis cos whatever happended then doesn't apply now. anyway, does anyone think our SOF ever going to get the fearsome reputation as the Israeli... uhhm... shit ... the what? ok i forget, who knows the name of the Israeli commandos? help me out!<br><br>You know i read somewhere that those crazy nutheads got 1:1 scale plans of most major airports with which to train in anti-terrorism... that is too much and too absurd. leave it to customs heheh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok real quick. i gotta go. so point form.<br>Please don't take offence. I am bored. so just kidding here ok!<br><br>Hitler - "I am short fat and ugly."<br><br>(BACKGROUND - many ppl know this, courtesy of a friends e-mail: Hitler doesn't smoke, only has an occasional beer, and i think it was he excelled at school, or some other meritorious deed, compared to many other less well-behaved Allied Power leaders).<br><br>a. Hitler third reich -  world domination plus ethnic cleansing to produce a superior race.<br><br>b. Visions of Ideal race; perceived to possess classic 'Nordic features' - ie, high brow, sharp nose, solid cheeks, Blonde, blue eyes, athletic, healthy, etc.<br><br>c. To produce superior race - Beautiful Women chosen to propogate with his Army of 'elite' men. Systematic killing of Jews/disabled/diseased.<br><br>d. His method is wrong, but his intentions are arguably good, despite being fundamentaly racist.<br><br>e. e.g look at human gene pool today. all medicines made ensure long life, everyone desire to start family, etcetcetcetc. bad genes are passed on, but only suppressed form, not eliminated. There are far less cures than we think!!! all cos everybody gets a chance. i am not saying that is wrong, but simply stating an existing situation.<br><br>f. Look at Hitler. He was clearly not the ideal/superior race quality. Almost opposite in all aspects. He was pure ugly. In school he was bullied and made fun of. Exposed to overwhelming trauma. Parental abuse. Low self esteem. early involvement in politics to project his frustration.<br><br>g. i think in a freakish way, he never wanted another child to ever have to go through what he experienced as a child. he was full of self hate. He despisd himself, and his flaws.<br>he was sin.<br><br>h. therefore, to produce a superior race for humankind so there would be no more suffering. by clearing the bad grapes, you are left with good ones. genetic 'engineering' at its most primitive form.<br><br>i. before the calm there is the storm and vice versa. if hitler had succeeded, there might be only one race to day.<br><br>i believe then that hitler was a poor abused man with so much self hatred that in a twisted state of mind wanted to help cleanse the world and act as God (using the term objectively cos i am not religious). if self hepl programmes today were around back then he would have turned out to be a religious minister. or genetic engineer/doctor.<br><br>j. where he is wrong - killing is not the way, or so we are told.<br><br>k. if darwinist theory, then we would not benefit from diversity, but yet, if bad chickens are removed, then only good eggs are left. but still again, don't the chickens suffer in terrible conditions? not necessarily. who heard of "free range" eggs? healthy chickens produce healthy eggs.<br><br>if hitler had won, with proper education the human race migh have been better off. the calm before and after the storm. i.e storm troopers and luftwaffe panzer etc.<br><br>there gotta go. take it light heartedly. just joking.</div>

I asked him what will he do if war comes, he said, he will still go and fight even though the superiors and leadership is F up cause only by fighting can we save our loved ones  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well, i am encouraged by it, even though this dude is always being tekan and bullied by the Regulars but he dun give a shit abt them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Cause the flag is still Your Flag and mine  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Your Eyes In Their Deep Heavens<br>Possess Me And Will Not Depart<br>A Sea Of Blue Thoughts<br>Rushing And Flowing All Over My Heart..........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is an excellent discussion Jason has raised. His feelings that went through his head in the POP which seemed so artificial to him. Guys, don't be too caught up with this meaningless dicussion of the what is going to happen to the SAF regulars or, for that matters, to the fate of Singapore should war comes to us. REMEMBER...JUST TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF! Because, nobody is going to gave a d*$%@ whether u live or die. It is S'pore for you.</div>
