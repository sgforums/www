            <div class='col-md body'>Internet romance and then True love is possible. you just have to meet the right person at the right time. However, recently internet meeting has being misused as a sex-seeking tools. More and more singaporean esp sex-crazed guy go online just to seek out entertainment, fun and sex. they never think about the future. Maybe this is how the singapore society had shaped them. "Live just for today" Don't be surprised these youngster can be damn young.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree that pple in the internet are also normal pple like you or me...but some of them may be shy in real life and unable to make friends in real life and when they go into the internet to relieve their boredom, they share their feelings to those whom they feel  they can trust.<br><br>But sometimes, this trust may be misplaced on the wrong pple who abuse this power...<br><br>For myself, I have been online since 1997 and have met up alot of pple from internet since I started... an unbelievable amount of 100+ pple..believe or not but sad to say many of them I known are hi bye friends whom I saw once or twice but cont. on with their offline life after meeting up..<br><br>I feel that internet chatters are just normal pple with normal looks. It is only with rare cases that they are ravishing beauty or handsome hunks so when we meet up with "normal" pple like you or me, do not place too high an expectation on them and develop this relationship as time goes by..<br><br>who says our friends have to be beautiful or handsome? If you are someone who is like that, who are you to judge a person by their looks......<br><br>:-))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))<br><br>No matter what my life is intertwined with internet...no matter what kind of rejections I face when I meet up with pple..I still love internet...so I guess i m "jian" in that senses..hahahahahah...<br><br>------------------<br>It's my life....<br>It's now or never...<br><br>[This message has been edited by babypink (edited 14 April 2001).]</div>

But in the 1st place why do those pple meet up? There must be some level of trust/communication/selection process between the 2 pple when u decided to meet up..unless meeting up for the sake of meeting up coz too bored<br><br>Dont know if you pple get what i say hahhaah<br>I mean to say u must "feel" safe with the person that you are meeting up with..<br>If not it will be like playing with fire..but of course the other party may abuse the trust you have in them......<br><br>Internet romance, heard a few..knew a few of success stories....tried before..but it really depends on what type of person you are, what type of partner you are looking at..as well how deep you are in internet poison(chinese saying- zhong du tai sheng)<br><br>For my case, even after I have a partner from the net I hope my partner will not/never go into the net again and be faithful to me..but on the other hand I went into the net chat with some strangers unknown to my partner..I guess that is what I called double standard..hahahaha<br><br>------------------<br>@~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~@<br>It's my life....<br>It's now or never...<br>I ain't gonna live 4ever<br>I just want to live while I'm alive<br>@~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~@</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br>I would like to share my story with those of U out there.  I have met a couple of creeps from the net before I finally met my current boyfriend.  It's kind of fate that we met each other through in IRC.  Normally when i logged in to IRC I would use the nick "Bluesky".  But on that day when I got to know him through IRC, I changed my nick and logged in as "Greysky" becos I had a bad day.  He sent a private message to me.  I was kind of surprise becos I have never seen his nick before and later he realised that he had gotten the wrong person.  He had a male friend whose nick was also "Greysky"  From then on, we started chatting with each other in IRC for over a period of 4 months.<br>I had never intend to meet him at first because I was sick of meeting those creeps again and I was no longer interested in meeting any guys from the net.  However unlike other guys, he did not press me for a date.  We can chat about everything under the sky.  I was comfortable with the friendship that we had and I did not want to change that.<br>I was having some problem with my PC and he offered to help me fix it.  It also happened that he was just staying a few street away from me.  At first I was apprehensive about the whole thing because I couldn't simply bring a guy whom i had never met before to my house.  What if he turned out to be a rapist or something?<br>I finally decided to meet him because I desperately needed to fix my PC.<br>He knew about my concern and he suggested that we met for dinner first.<br>That was when i first met him.  It was nothing special.  No fire sparks but I enjoyed his company and talking to him.  One week later, after making sure that my brother was at home that day, I invited him to my house.<br>We went out very frequently after that.  The greatest discovery that I had made was that he was actually one of my best friend's ex-boyfriend.  I didn't have the chance to meet him when they were together but my friend had mentioned about him before.<br>My friends found it quite unbelievable how we met each other. I'm glad to have him and I feel that fate has a hand in pulling us together.<br><br>Venice</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all..think love over the net is kinda far-fetched...esp since if the couple hasn't even met yet...have heard sweet stories of couples who met online and are still going strong even after 4 years..and also people who met up and then stopped contact later on.<br><br>Let's face it..everyone who goes online wish they are chatting to some chiobu and yandao..and are usually disappointed when the other turns out to be someone else. I am not suprised..I am one of these kind of person. However I don't judge entirely on looks..looks are juz a 10-min impression, but how you carry yourself and the way you behave tells a lot more. I know I won't be able to stand those ego-guys who are hunks yet can't speak/behave properly. I am more impressed by average guys who can actually go the extra mile to make a girl feel special. That is more important...<br><br>I met a few net friends..well, some still keep in contact while others have become the hi-bye type. I admit that I am not good-looking, that's y perhaps we are no longer in contact...well...there are many types of people in this world, juz glad that I haven't met any creeps yet...<br><br>But for now, I have retired from IRC liaoz, coz of sch work and well, sometimes it's kinda like wasting time to chat too...esp since it's always the same old thing...intro then blah blah...<br><br>Well, it ain't hard to find true love over the net, sometimes it juz takes cupid arrows to shoot both arrows at the same time...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>~I dun wanna feel the way that I do~<br>~I juz wanna be right here with you~<br>Will you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear michiko,<br><br>After after reading what you have posted...I felt sad for what you have encountered but I am glad that you have moved on with your life and did not linger on what has happened<br><br>I guess in life, if given a choice..we wld want to be pretty,rich, successful..blah blah~~~ but most of time, this is not the case and it is not your fault that you are ugly... btw, in any event I do not believe that you are ugly.... *hugz*<br><br>Like what iLuSioN has said, most of us wish to look for yandao or choibu when we are online (might not be true of course)eventhough we are not pretty or handsome in any case.... I guess it is kinda of excitement and hope when we are online coz we cant see the person face and will not know their facial expressions.....<br><br>Sometimes we cant even blame the other party who has rejected us because they do not know that they actually cant face it...they thot they can but when in actual fact they cant...and what you have shared with them in the past is forgetten.... I felt sad for them as well as they cant go past your looks!<br><br>Dont worry gal, I am sure in time to come, you will find a guy who will appreciate who you are and do not just judge you by the looks....<br><br>I am also ugly &amp; fat but i managed to find a bf...hahahha after so many disappointment... :-) I guess life is fair in some ways.......<br><br>Rgds<br>BabyPink....<br>*hugz* *hugz*<br><br>------------------<br>@~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~@<br>It's my life....<br>It's now or never...<br>I ain't gonna live 4ever<br>I just want to live while I'm alive<br>@~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~@<br><br>[This message has been edited by babypink (edited 07 May 2001).]</div>
