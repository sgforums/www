            <div class='col-md body'>Well<br><br>The point is that girls in Singapore are a bit too cautious ... they dont wanna take unecessary risks and they are a bit particular and choosy so initially when i did actually did offer to meet up instantly most of the girls considered me a physco therefore ... now that i have leart it the hard way ... to get net friends to meet up give u re self slowly and make sure you are clear about what u want dont ask 4 a date and expect anything more ... just the DATE .. elsewhere things are a bit different so all u need to do is be a easy going .. dun give em too much importance thats all i can say !<br><br>What i look for is subjective ....<br><br>:-P</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The minute when two person meets(online) n decides that they are goin to be so-called "meant for each other", its already the start of an illusive dream they're gonna work on n build. Of cuz everyone wants to have a beautiful dream, who wouldn't?<br>So from there on, tonnes of love and quality time is spent to flourish the relationship. Subconsciously, we'll allow all of the most beautiful things to happen to our "love" and at the same time havin the thot that he/she is also the most beautiful person... And expectations of the OUTLOOK hence increased. Despite the denial that looks does matters, somewhere within us DO mind the appearance. Juz bcuz we psychologically wants to be someone "nice', someone not judgemental, we made ourselves THINK that we wouldn't mind how he/she looks. However, (sad to say this but) truth is that, outlook does matter cuz afterall, its gonna be ur first time to see this person behind the monitor who shares ur online life. But if you're genuinely intrested to make friends with the other party, the importance of looks somehow fades after a while. If u do cherish the moments u've had with the other party, u wouldn't want to give it up juz bcuz of somethin that is less substantial.<br>Ask urself, why are we acceptable towards ppl of common looks in real life situation of making friends yet expectin alot more from those online?<br>Bcuz of mystery? or delusion? or perhaps, its jus us who placed our hopes too high up?<br>Be realistic, be true and never allow urself to fall into the trap of fantasizing the "perfect".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well it might be a bit too late for sending this post but might as well do so since i am so bored early in the morning.<br>At the very moment, i am on irc doing nothing.<br><br>Regarding the topic on net friends and lovers... I feel that finding lovers on the internet is pretty hard unless the cupid have really shot an arrow on you. Finding friends should be a more realistic stuff. Internet lovers are just short term because teenagers find life bored and wanted to find some people to accompany them. But teenagers are just too irresponsible and don't know how to handle the stuff well. I met a couple of friends through Channel outings in irc and have made couple of friends and some true friends who share the same interest with me. In fact i will be playing basketball with some of them tomorrow. Usually the hi-bye friends you met on net are usually chatters who don't share the same kind of thinking with you. So open your eyes wide and put on your thinking cap when you are doing some internet chatting. Know who you feel are going to be your next closest friend and who are your crushes and who are those hi-bye type.<br><br>Was wondering since i am here, i suppose i should do some spamming... haha<br>i am the owner of #tomodachi so do support me if you happen to be free .^_^.!<br>Live well!!!<br><br>------------------<br>Live your life well and learn to live it the way you want even if it does not turn the way it is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello...<br><br>I wanna to give my comment of internet meeting... The following is my experience with my 1st net meeting :<br><br>I started surfing net in 1998, then i discovered the so called IRC chat and start playing it until now(Then it was not so popular as now). After about 1Â½ years later in Nov 1999, i finally meet my one net-friend(1st time mah, damn curious how she look like and nervous. She is a gal from my neighbourhood school. She is a good and nice girl, however our relationship had developed too fast that we just broke off in just 3 months time. But we still contact each other and it is best to be just normal friends and it's work out this way. Until now(June 2001), it's have been another 1Â½ years, I dare to swear to heaven that i still love her. At first, i believe in the idea of finding a gf on net, but now i had knocked the idea off my brain.<br><br>Actually, it's very good to know more friends in real life or IRC. Why not in your next meeting, treat the guy/gal as a normal friend first, then if u find out that u two r actually a item, then start the sparks... Dun rush...<br><br>Okie lah, ended liao... A bit long winded rite? Sorry hor...<br><br>KeKeKe =)<br>Take Care...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was reading the forum from da top to the bottom .. i just wanted to add up something here .. Meeting up on and from the NET in a very subjective issue.<br><br>I have met girls who have been jerks and girls who have been really really gems of a life time .. i am sure i am gonna treasure their friendship.<br><br>As far as the issues are concerned mostly girls should choose to meet up in a more crowded place .. to avoid the guy freaking out. Otherwise if you really believe in the person its fine, there is nothing called fate or luck in meeting up a person from or on the net. Infact let me tell you that i do a lot of bagpacking and travelling to far off places .. and my idea of travelling is successful only when i make friends with someone out there and that person he/she shows me the place around.<br><br>Its suffices me in two ways first i get to see new places and culture and secondly i get to meet new and friends from all walks of life. There also has been some sick moments like for example there was this girl who was a friendly one and she used to send me one liner e-mails which i hate from the bottom of my heart, respecting her friendship i did digest that initially later i only found out that she would mail me only when she need her projects to be done ! SAD and PATHETIC. Its not that i have not helped people b4 , infact friends are the ones that help you in times of needs ... previously i have also helped 2 girls with their TOEFL.<br><br>So, likewise there are also guys who have a tendency of thinking sex and women synonymously.<br><br>PLEASE DONT BE SURPRISED IF I TOLD YOU THAT I HAVE NET FRIENDS FROM 20 TO 50 AND I AM 26 AND STILL SINGLE.<br><br>So, as i had started .. its completely subjective of how you look at net friends.<br><br>Certain things that i had deciphered in this short period are<br><br>Race wise all people are good.<br><br>The Malay girls - are a bit aggressive.<br>The chinese girls - are too calculative.<br>The Indian girls (expats) - are too lost.<br><br>The chinese guys - are good but a little flirtative<br>The Malay guys - are too possesive.<br>The Indian guys - are aggresive and kinda nasty on the Internet.<br><br>NO OFFENCE MEANT If this helps you ... !<br><br>Chiao<br><br>The thinker.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Read so many replies but most seem negative...<br>Is Singapore guys and Gals that bad?<br><br>I meet up with different people, found there is a mixture of people in the social,but in the practical world like sg everything is going by the dollar value or advantage.<br><br>So dun expect much of a romancer from sg guys, and dun expect the gals to appreciate what you do what them, they have the mindset of they can do themselves what why bother....so be smart in deal with Guys and Gals form sg..<br>overall most guys and gals from sg are not mature in the sensible way in emotions...but in the material and knowledge....This might be due to the flaw in education system that are more focus in the technical aspect of life without  EQ.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well i like to share with you some of my own experience. i have been a user of the PC since my young days as a kid when i would fight off my cousins so i could play my dad's 386PC.<br><br>now i am 23 and have been a avid user of the internet since 1997. alot have changed between then and now. last time for fun i would log on to alamak chat and try to impress some unsuspecting gal on the net...but today we have irc where i can log on and impress many unsuspecting gals on the net.<br><br>i'm not saying that i am the kind that logs on and dies if i can't get into the galaxynet servers...well i am basically the user that downloads mp3s and chats for the duration of the download.<br><br>i have met 2 girls from the internet. well one of the gals who was so intellectual that for a moment i felt that i was in love. she would chat with me basically about everything under the sun. it was only 7 mths later when we decided to meet that i realized that she was an indian. not that i have anything against indians(don't be offended) but it was just so sad cause i actually had romantic ideas. i was much younger then...19.<br><br>when i was 22 i met this really great gal. she was pretty, charming and really would have a great conversation with me. we could chat until wee hours in the morning...even after meeting we still chatted on the phone for months after that. i wanted so much to ask her to be my girlfren but just didnt have the guts to do so. i believe she felt the same...but i just could not be too sure...so i never brought up the topic...unfortunately for me...neither did she...we lost contact soon after when she went overseas to study. Initially i still chatted to her on icq...but we drifted further and further apart...<br><br>well...thats about all my experiences... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> anyone else??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My experience???<br><br>OK. I met my gf over at irc more than a yr ago and we've been together ever since. I know our relationship is one of the veri few that took off as a result of the internet but we have always based our relationship on truth and trust. Rite now, we both have stop using irc (the interest just died!!).<br><br>I tink its ok if u log on the internet in search of that someone special just as long as u know who ur looking for and that the expectations is not too great. My gf is no Miss Universe material (neither am I a Manhunt participant) but I have always look further than looks (we all got that minimum criteria, I believe).<br><br>OK. That's my experience....no....my life story...hehe. Anymore??<br><br>Oh ya...we're plan to get married after I grad.....yahoo!!!</div>
