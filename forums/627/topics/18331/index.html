            <div class='col-md body'>Can students fall in love anymore?<br>Let me rephrase that question again, can students, most notably the male species, complete for love in this vast changing climate of globalisation? Look at the students in Singapore, unless their papas sit in the DBS directorÂ’s meeting, most of them are struggling to make do with their vocations and hurry out to meet their destiny with the virile green dollar and the kinky yen.<br><br>Marx decreed that society revolve around class structures. I couldnÂ’t agree more, but itÂ’s not the working class against the capitalist, but in my case, the students against the working class! And what are they competing for? ItÂ’s the golden 4 letter words, LOVE<br><br>I am speaking on behalf of my fellow poor male students. As part of our vocation, we canÂ’t support ourselves full time, (the burden of academia pursue) let alone go on a dutchless date! My fellow brothers in pen, how can we pursue love when we cannot even pay a decent meal for 2? Love letters and fanciful prose? I say, this can all go down the gutter when the word Visa and Mastercard appear!<br><br>I welcome fair competition among my peers with their fanciful blue BMW and the sleek silver Porshe. But darn, these are not my honourable brothers in pen but working class people driving those vehicles and chasing the gals in our school! I cry foul and those gals flick their beautiful hair at me and tell me pants are much sexier than jeans! I say, is love doom for us students? I do not even wish to go into foreign talents and their (male) impact on our (love) society! This is oppression and an infringement into our human rights (to love, on the male student part anyway)<br><br>Again, the great guru M mentioned the evil cycle of capitalism and I say the old man canÂ’t be truer! I am so bitterly exposed to this oppressive (depressive) phenomenon such that it had an adverse effect on my psyche. I endeavour to become part of the working class (rich jerk) so that I can repeat the trauma afforded to me during the heady days of school. And this, my fellow brothers in pen, is the evil cycle that we (male) students for generations are doomed to.<br><br>Revolution is in the calling! We must eradicate this evil and establish a classless (level) society (playing field). No longer must we suffer this indignity! The government wants more babies? I say, they must look into this problem promptly for if not, there will be no more willingly participants (male students) in their grandiose social project. WhatÂ’s the point of building more halls? Give us dating welfare (money)!  Arise I say! The time is ripe for us to revolt against this unfair system! No welfare (money) will more than not results in us not making more babies (sex). Thus, I say,<br><br>Male students of the world, Unite!<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically,we are all animals who subscribe to Darwin's theory of evolution where the fittest survive.In today's context in Singapore,the female of the species select the male who they think will be able to provide a stable environment to procreate and pass down the family line so as to ensure their dynastic line is continued.The signs the female of the species look out for are signs of financial security eg car,condo,cash in wallet etc etc as these provide a sign that the male is able to provide for the female.This is akin to the peacock who preens himself to look his best to captures a peahen's attention.As students seldom are able to exhibit the signs of security that the females in Singapore are looking out for,it is ineveitable that they are destined to be extinct unless they do something to attract the females attention by garnering themselves a car,cash in wallet etc which can most probably come through entering the working world.That's life,a constant struggle to survive in this world<br><br>ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, James... Money is not everything. Success is not everything. of course enough to be comfortable or like wat Tet describes is pretty damm goot already.<br><br>You'll discover soon that the money doesn't matter much in whether u cna get a girl or not.<br><br>Getting gers to like u is a process only those with the right stuff can do. ppl who have the killer insinct. PPl who are basiocally assholes. how many assholes do u see who r single? Unless they are obscenely ugly, they'll most likely be attached. I've seen it, you've seen it as have all of us here.<br><br>y?<br><br>Because they make the girls feel insecure. Although security is somethign that women want, what they crave is something altogether different.<br><br>Assholes have the best of luck with gers.<br><br>Let me give you an example. My ex ex ex GF admitted to me that she didn't trust me even after she agreed to go out with me. It wasn't until we went together that she discovered that I was trust worthy. It  was then that she appreciated my stability.<br><br>But in general, gers tend to get attracted to guys which are off limits. Very few will ever get attracted to the nice guys lah.  Where do u think the phrase, nice guys finish last comes from?<br><br>We tend to not bring ourselves to lie, cheat, and be devious...things which gers are attracted to. that's where the fault lies lah. Who in their right minds will go and look for someone who is stabel and long term unless they are going to get married?<br><br>Noone. Not students or salaried ppl. Admittedly, the cars and money help to glitz up and bring attention to these ppl, it's their ability to lie so well that unnerves gers subconsciously that gets them the gers.<br><br>So go and get the killer instinct. You only need a bit of money my man. Trust me. If you can manage to giff off the image that you are shifty, most likely you stand a better cance of gers liking u.<br><br>But just a note&gt; It doesn't maintain a relationship though. maintenance of relationships can only be achieved by ppl who trust each other...<br><br>Aiyah Dun listen to me lah.

            <div class='col-md body'>tet - high five girl. Or woman. Know exactly what you are talking about.<br><br>It's amazing to read postings where girls say that love comes over cash. at the end of the day, all girls want a sense of security. Does money give them security? Duh. Money can do alot. it might not buy love but it buys security. I have been dating a guy for almost 3 years. WE just broke up. Guess at the end of the day I was just tired of being HIS security blanket. I want to be taken care of, to be looked after too. To be able to receive flowers, and as tet said walk into restaurants without having to mentally remember "cannot order over 15 bucks".<br><br>Guyd out there might call me materialistic..god Im so sick of that word. Im a girl who knows what I want. hey I dun need a guy to buy me a Prada wallet and bring me to fancy restaurants to eat. I can do that myself. No problem. But if you want to be my bf, you must give me a sense of security. By security I dun just mean money. If you are seriously dead broke, thats cool. Do little things to show me you love me. Make cards, email me. Whatever. Dun sit there and whine about how broke you are and if you haf the money what you would do for me.<br><br>Dunno if anyone understands what Im rambling on about. haha.  NaiveGirl, You might love someone even though he is broke. Would you love him enuff to stay with him is another question. If your answer is yes, you are one of those wonderfully selfless people in the world. I admire that.<br><br>My ans would be No by the way. Not coz Im materialistic. But I am not selfish enough to expect a guy to keep me in the lifestyle I am used to if it means making him work 20 hrs a day and not eating. i believe I can keep myself in that lifestyle. Am I right believing what my ex told me? That if a guy loves a girl he wld do anything for her? Even if it means working 20 hrs a day and not eating juz to provide her with the things she want?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Women are the stupidest things on Earth mext to cows" - quoted from a SURVIVOR participant.<br><br>I agree. 'Stupid' not as in 'intellectually', but more like that 'aarrrggghhh' feeling you get when dealing with them.<br><br>They want it all, even though they say they don't. The best of ALL worlds - money, love, security... blah blah blah. When they find their bf lacking in any aspect (which they surely will), they whine, like they are the sole victim in the relationship. And some may screw up their bf for not being 'what they are supposed to be', while others may move on, trying to find their "white knights". Those that stay on are probably just too insecure to make the break. But they will keep on whining about the guy's deficiencies. When they get older, they still whine, but keep it more on the inside, coz they know if they keep it up, they will soon be buying cats for companionship.<br><br>Isn't this supposed to be an equal society where both sexes chip in EQUALLY huh? Why put so much expectations into guys? Women better be prepared to give, instead of always waiting to be pampered and soothed. GET REAL!!! And so many of you wonder why men become so different after marriage... Hahaha! payback time!!!!!<br><br>(These are the views of a soon-to-be-misogynist, and do not represent the views of more normal males who prefer chasing skirts)<br><br></div>
