            <div class='col-md body'>The pilot is ALWAYS responsible for his plane. When the control tower gives a pilot instructions, it is his job to make sure he follows those instructions precisely.<br><br>Pilots are trained to avoid "mix-ups". Why do you think pilots are usually portrayed as "elite" and "cream of the crop"? Their job comes with immense responsibilities, and that is why they are usually held in such high regard.<br><br>At the heart of the matter is this... the pilot and his plane were not where they should have been, despite instructions given by Control. All other issues are peripheral.<br><br>------------------<br>Cya,<br>Praetor<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arbiter, the pilot is ALWAYS responsible for his plane. I agree on that part. But the controller is also ALWAYS responsible in ensuring the pilots follow their instructions. This is a two way thingie.
