            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings to everyone here,<br><br>We all know how Singapore has failed to achieve any medals as yet. But tell me, does Singapore _deserve_ to win any medals? Has it spent enough money promoting sports? No, sorry but I don't think so. It has preferred to spend more money on education, on worthless things like new equipment for the army(SAR21), on trying to get people to have more babies (i will touch on this at another time)<br><br>However, We have not spent any money on developing sports. I believe many of us are very talented in the area of sports. However, our talent is never developed and our potential, put to waste. I do not believe that all those athletes in Sydney, Maurice Green, Marion Jones, Lenny Krayzelburg, Ian Thorpe, were all born knowing how to run and swim. I believe that they had talent in them, which was developed further, thus letting them achieve their full potential.<br><br>Now, as we zoom back to Singapore. Do you see any of our young children being trained in sports? Teenagers ? Teenagers are supposed to be at their peak, with the most stamina and faster recovery rate. However, the government does not realize this and only puts those students in school to study, study and study. PE lessons in schools are only 2 periods a week. Let's compare this with the amount of time we spend in school. I believe that more time can be taken out of the curriculum for sports.<br><br>Next, our government could spend more money on sports and encouraging people to do more sports. No, I am not talking about sports for life here, but _really_ developing sports by spending more money to finance those sportsmen who have shown potential. If we really want Singapore to be outstanding, we have to excel in all areas and not just Academics. Not that I'm saying that we're not outstanding enough yet.<br><br>Look at Goal 2010. The most unrealistic Goal set by Singapore.(pun fully intended) Just look at the standard of Singaporean football. If we really want to make it in 2010, we should already have taken some action on this. Why 2010? Why not the Olympics in 2004? Wouldn't it be much better? Isn't the Olympics much better than a world cup, having 22 men chase after a round ball in a cage? Remember my friends, the ball is round. But for olympics, if you're good and there's no one better, YOU will have the gold in your hands.<br><br>Now that we're in this sorry medalless state, what has the government to say? Sorry to the people? No no. Not even that word. Only Coca Cola Corporations have offered the cash prizes to Jing Jun Hong. Our only hope presently. I hope this will seriously wake the government up.<br><br>Thank You</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Road bike racing? I am afraid that is not the list of core sports in Singapore which the government wish to promote. Perhaps you might have a better chance in the 22 man and a ball club or the a man swimming round and round club. Either way, you are all alone in this arena. All the best for your dream and by the way, remember to pick up a good degree on the way.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the reason that Singapore hasn't put in a comparable effort in sports is because it doesn't quite fit their grand scheme for survival.<br><br>I subscribe to the view that Singapore, with its limitations in size and economy amongst other things, needs to focus most of its efforts on the economy. So, we pour money in the infrastructure, education (or propaganda depending on how and what you are discussing) etc.<br><br>I think sports in Singapore, as far as most of those outside soccer are concerned, will not be able to promote a robust trade, domestic or otherwise. It would thus be difficult to convince people to pour money into it. Not that there has been zero effort I think, but I am no expert in this area.<br><br>Sports is big in other countries because of many reasons. Some ascribe it to tradition (Swimming and Australia), others are due to it being big business (atheletics in the US) to name just a few examples. Personally, I think as far as olympic sports are concerned, Singapore does not have the tradition or the scale of economy to substantiate that sort of environment. At the moment any way.<br><br>As with any hot blooded human, if you really love something, you pour spirit and energy and blood and sweat into it. I'm sure there are people in Singapore who are ferverent enough about their favourite sport to sponsor/ support themselves to train and participate. Just for the heck of it. I'm reminded of a friends uncle who sponsors himself in race car driving, along side the professionals who are sponsored by Ferarri and the lot. One bump on his car and 2 months pay gone, compared to other people having one or two spare cars (complete with engines.)<br><br>Such dedication. Woohooo! And thats what we should all admire and appreciate. People like that could do with a lot more sponsorship and support from people with money.<br><br>I'll agree that the PE lessons in schools are a joke. I was just thinking when watching the olympics how ridiculous our track and field lessons were (in my time anyway.) Sian PE teachers looking at a bunch of sian students, just letting them run some 100 metre dash and timing them for show. And the faster boys charming all the girls while fat idiots who run slower than 15 seconds get laughed at. WHATS WRONG WITH RUNNING SLOW? I DON'T HAVE THE GENETICS YOU BUNCH OF...  never mind.<br><br>I do digress.<br><br>To have more money for sports, you need to have people willing to spend them. Sponsors, spectators, supporters. No question about that. It will be just like in the academic field. Only the best of the best getting the support, and competition will be fierce.<br><br>Meanwhile, whatever sport you like, practice hard and have fun. Just as importantly, as Mr Hata San has said, you still need a good education to give you alternatives when you hang up your helmet.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 23 September 2000).]</div>
