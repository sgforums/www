Does that make you a Taipan? Relax man its just light hearted fun. No flaming intended okie?<br><br>Oh yes I have a question. Does having a Japanese passport make you Japanese by racial categorization?<br><br>And you mentioned your gf has a Japanese passport. How did you two meet because I haven't met much Japanese girls in Singapore.<br><br>By the way, where are you going shopping? How are you getting there? Who are you going with? Why did you choose this day to go? What is your budget? Do you prefer feeding your dog biscuits or dog food? Do you use checks or cash? Or credit card? NETS? Do you use plastic or paper bags? What color is your hair? Does it affect your ability to shop? If you were part of a tree, which part would you be? Why? Are you happy that this string of questions are ending? If yes, why?<br>If no, why? Please answer these questions in letter format.<br><br>Oh yes Shogun, I'm too lazy to ask who you are and why you know my name, so don't worry about trying to unfog the 'mystery' of your identity in my mind.

I myself have a Japanese gf too! She speaks English, a bit of Italian, French and Chinese. i speak poor Japanese too. but that's not the point.<br><br>Personally, I feel that Singapore girls dress up worse than any other girls in the Asia Pacific region. A female friend from HK once told me that her male HK friends got the hots for SG girls cos they wear the least! Which is quite true. Besides, lots of SG girls are also proud, materialistic and egoistic people! Ok, there're some who don't fall under this category but still...<br><br>Also, whenever a guy just glances at a SG girl, usually that girl will think that she's so hot or desired after to have men looking/staring at her when all we're doing is laughing inside at her outrageous hair, or her extremely think makeup, or at her lack of certain attributes which she's trying to flaunt!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hMm......first of all, a big hi to everyone, i'm new to this forum, this is my very first post on this thing...<br><br>anyway, got some words to say here,<br>personally, I found out that mishima is only giving a point of his personal view on some dress sense here... so, why are those two guys(eRr... i forgot their name, dun bother to either) got soo offended ? he's not even pointing his finger at u...well, guess they're these ppl who like to grab attention by flaming others..<br><br>well, as i've been staying in S'pore for the past two years, i noticed that S'porean gals has been trying to adopt fashion trends from Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong.. to me, these does no harms.... though it might look silly if some of them wearing "washing powder instructions" (am i rite?) well, it's just a new design of those fashion designer's.<br><br>Well, can't be denied that S'porean gals wear the least in Asia Pasific region... I've been to HK and Taiwan, gals there are forever fashion up-to-date. but they dress up more decent...not say S'porean gals not undecent,during some occasion, for example, when u come to skol, in mind chilling air-con room, dun u gals feel cold wearing sooo few ? though, no all S'porean gals falls under this category... most of these gals to me, i think they're just trying to grab attention and try to look "HOT" to others... may b, S'poreans has a mentality that they must b "IN", "PPL HAS, I MUST HAF" and therefore creating this fashion disaster, just bcoz they dun wan other ppl to laf at them. Well, i'm not trying to be critic.. but, that's the mentality of most of the S'poreans. (no hard feelings yeah, pls..)<br><br>Some of the fashion here i think are too exgerating, agree ? I mean, it's not a foul to try to follow other's trends, but, just dun exxegerate lor... i found some of the guys here in S'pore are..... (hmm.. dunno how to say) to me, i would like to wear watever i feel comfortable but not out-dated. khakis and T-shirts suite me most..<br><br>Personally, i've this close fren hu's also a half jap/half chinese (sorry mishima, japanese is too long for me, i just write jap for abbreviation, no hard feelings) they r nice.. whenever i visit them back in KL, whOa... his mom, who is a jap, soooo nice to me.. and her sushi taste real good ! haha.. anyway, i haf a few japanese frens in Uni too... they're sooo polite and kind hearted.. well, i like Japan.. haha...<br><br>so, i've been wondering that y u guys are soo heated up here ? i thot Internet is a place where freedom speech is encouraged ? cool down, read others' point of view, u haf something to say, type it out, post it. U feel offended ? write and email and flame him, Nothing to say ? Buzz Off !! dun waste resources...<br><br>one more thing to say, pls hor.... wat's the problem with dress sense of Johore bahru ? although they might not haf any dress sense, but as i said, they feel comfortable and happy about wat they are wearing...so, wat's wrong ?<br><br>------------------<br>| /\/\ /\/\ 0 R t a |_    5 0 u |_<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Look Into your palms,  what do you s33 ?<br>I see my own faith in my palms<br>i Believe everyone do, so do hold on to Your own faith<br>no Others can conTrol YOurs.<br>FOr it shall Be dUll or lIghtened, depends on Yourself !<br><br>-- KEN, 1998<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a BORN-IN-JOHOR, BROUGHT-UP-IN-SINGAPORE guy who can never seem to blend in well in Singapore. If you ask me, I have this thing about Japanese girls, the cute ones. But it's like idolising a female celebrity, I don't really have a preference for Japanese girls when it comes to BGR or marriage matters. Honestly, I really like Singapore girls, but some of them I really think are the worst of the female species......ok these I avoid.<br><br>Ask any SG guys if they'll ever marry a Japanese girl.......the first thing that pops up in their minds will be th image of a cute and demure girl who will turn into a sex crazed machine( I'm sorry, it wasn't meant to be defamatory, but you people know that's how some of us think...) at night and the rest is up to their imagination. The answer will most probably be no. He will choose a local. The thing is he does not view the Japanese girl as something that he can identify with like he does a local, and to a certain extent he will view the Japanese girl as an object, of desire, a poster, something.....unreal, and therefore to be left only to the imagination. I have seen Japanese girls, on my monitor and on the streets of Singapore, in Thailand where I was thrashed competing with them in an archery match. The mass media made bitches out of them, to cash in on us. I wouldn't say they are perfect either.......humans are humans......not too good, not too bad. You just have to concentrate a bit more on the good part. And guys, get the dirty thought out of your brains, I am trying to get serious......@_@<br>As you know Singapore is like rojak......anything they find tasty they mix it into the bowl. From Mandarin stations that play J-POP to washing powder instructions (hahhahahah now I know.....), its Japanese occupation once again, in another sense of the word. I just hope that this generation knows what they are in for, and know that no matter how peaceful things might seem, the threat never shows itself until the very end. The person who started this topic, or some extreme right wing Japanese might damn me, but I still recall in history lessons and from my grandfather, that the Japanese brought hell to our region. Also known to me is the fact that the terror and the oppression that happened about half a century ago has been played down in the Japanese history texts. Some Japanese politicians warned that bringing up the past will spoil relations......I'd say, admitting your own mistakes will make your friends less wary of you.<br><br>You know, perhaps the Japanese are right, The Rape Of Nanking did not happen.......we were probably duped into thinking it did happen by a FEW MILLION surviving Chinese..........<br><br>OKok, enough of politics and history......I can sense the fury. Hmm, botom line is: Japanese girls are cute, Singapore girls wear least, and fashion sense is just fashion sense......there is no good and bad to it. BTW being ugly intentionally is a type of fashion  too. I hereby end my jibberish.......good luck, and peace be with you guys @_@*</div>
