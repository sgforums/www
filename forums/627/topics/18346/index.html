            <div class='col-md body'>When I was younger, I grew up on a copious dosage of what seems today to be irreverent cartoons. One of my favorites, and I had many, was Transformers. The cartoon, incidentally enough, was my first introduction to the hazy realm of good and evil. I never minded the fact that there were a lot of robots running around blasting each other to pieces. The important thing was, the robots, especially the good guys, never died, and was up and about in the next episode to kick some serious bad guys ass.<br><br>That was my primary escapade from tedious homework and chores on Wednesday evenings. For some odd reason though, my mother hated the cartoon. To her, the screeching noise of lasers blasting was just, well, noise. To me though, it was my way of understanding how to deal with the bad guys of the world...Gimme a laser cannon anytime, honey...<br><br>But my mother's disapproval was an inconvenience I had to live with. It was no small thing, I tell you. I had always been a slow learner, and the numbers on the clock remained very much a mystery to me even when I was in Primary Two. I had to depend on either my mother or my sister to tell me the time. (My sister is two years younger than me!) So let's say Transformers came on at 6:30pm, I would ask my mom what time it was, and she would never tell me the correct time. It would be 6:30 on the clock, and she would tell me it was 6pm on the dot. I guess that this was a very fun and meaningful activity for her, but it left me with an extremely foul disposition. I love my mom to death, but I just could not understand why she did this. It was a calculated act of cruelty, I always thought.<br><br>Well, if you were to put a child in front of Transformers today, they would laugh out loud at the primitive animation, and the childish storylines. But they will have missed out on the essential theme of the series. It is about a group of robots, called Autobots, who crash-lands on the Planet Earth. Following them across the millions of light years is another group of rogue robots, called Deceptacons, who are bent on enslaving the planet for their own devious ends. And the story goes on to describe the generations of robots who wage war across the planet. The characters are nothing but memorable. With cool names like Optimus Prime, Megatron, Soundwave and Starscream, who can go wrong? They were the precursors of such inane heroes like the Power Rangers and Captain Planet.<br><br>So let us give thanks to the makers of these violent and brainless cartoons...I grew up okay, so that should always be a comforting thought to all those parents who overreact when it comes to letting their deprived kids watch these sort of entertainment...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Mom disapproved me from watching the Transformers. She dislike me wasting time with those robots and forced me to study during Transformer showtimes.<br>It was really painful experiences to be locked in the room to study every Wednesday when I know all other kids are watching the cartoon.....all i've got was the kind of misery, sad and disappointed feelings while hearing the voice of Megatron, Optimus Prime shouting at each other from the neighbour's TV while I forced myself to look at the book..<br><br>If next time I have kids who love to watch a cartoon, i will let them watch ...I wont want to make their heart feel depressed, bcoz I love my kids. If they feel happy, i will be happy too .    ^_^<br><br>I still have a few Transformers with me since young -  3 Triple Changers ( Springer, AstroTrain, Octane)  and 1 Target Master (SureShot)<br><br>They are with me for more than 13 years liao !!<br><br>I heard the old series of Transformers are back for sale! But they are 3-4 times more expensive !!<br><br>[This message has been edited by SilverWings (edited 21 August 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Transformers was the best, especially the first few seasons, when they kept it simple.  I watched the very first episode and was glued.<br><br>And does anyone remember "the Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers"?  It was awesome too, but didn't last very long.  The heroes are more "real" and cool.  Not to mention the voluptous heroine.<br><br>Visionaries was not bad also.<br><br>And one of my fav is the feature movie "The Flight of Dragons".  Although not a series, it was one of the best cartoon movie.</div>
