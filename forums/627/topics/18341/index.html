            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bangkok</strong>(Thailand):<br><br>A nice place to shop. Local goods are cheaper than what we can get in Singapore. Roadside stalls have interesting and exotic local dishes, but ain't for the weak-stomached. Restaurants' food prices are very cheap. The World Trade Centre there is much bigger than what we have in Singapore. The BRS(Bangkok Rail Systems, if I remember correctly) is worth a ride. Quite different from Singapore's own MRT. Leather goods are cheap too and you might wanna check those items with exotic skins out. Night activities are abundant. U can go and watch a Ah Gua Show or Tiger Show if u want and can take it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>Tioman</strong>(Malaysia):<br><br>Food is similar to Singapore Zhi Char, unless u wanna have some western food, but sure taste better than a lot of places I have tried on local grounds.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Snorkelling near the Coral Islands is no longer that interesting as a lot of corals are dying due to pollution. The fishes however, are most interesting when it comes to feeding them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Not much of night recreation though.</div>

Disneyland was an experience i won't forget.<br><br>Japan, was too boring for me. Walking around, freezing in the cold.

Yeah haha no amount of pretty girls would overcome the feeling of boredom...and well, there aint any pretty girls there at all.<br><br>Best bet for a holiday - HongKong, US.<br>P.S: Not honeymoon though.<br><br>The ultimate place i want to go:<br>Moon.<br><br>------------------<br>-=^Wynternight^=-<br>None as blind or deaf as those who refuses to see or listen.</div>
