            <div class='col-md body'>it depends.<br><br>is that someone (the dull one) once fun too? if he was, i'll stick with him. it's probably because i've been with him for sometime now that he doesn't seem that fun. if i can communicate well enough with him and i feel safe with him, yes i will marry. hey don't knock a nice, stable and peaceful life. we probably have to find a way to re-inject the sense of fun into the relationship.<br><br>why do i say that? because every new relationship is fun, it's the rush of new discoveries which make a stable relationship seem stale, but give it time enough, the new guy will be like the first guy, so when will it end? on the con side, you don't have the secure feeling like you do with the first guy, feelings of insecurities will easily destroy any relationship.<br><br>and lastly, unless of course, you don't love the first guy, then it's a moot point.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think of a boy and a girl in love as two flat rectangular plates. At any moment in time given the 2 plates are at two different locations they will have a tendency to be horzontal, lying flat on the ground. If however one of the plates is miraculously strong enough to stand on (his) own, and let the other plate lean on it, the structure should be able to remain vertical, and withstand tremendous vertical loads. Now we all know that is it not possible for two equally dimensioned plates to have one of them standing on its own, without the other leaning onto it, and vice versa. It's called mutual support, where the whole idea is to be there for each other, so that both may stand, or 2 shall fall.<br><br>Yes I am an engineering undergrad.....and I hate my life.........</div>
