But think again, is that the kind of government that you want?? The kind of government that let people suffer just because they dont vote for them?<br>Government is supposed to service for the country and her people, not to make them suffer! They might as well declare Singapore being an Empire, in this way they dont have to waste their time letting the people vote since they die die also want the people to vote for them .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>...... If you realised that you're having CANCER, and there's still a CHANCE for SURVIVAL.... You'll have to get rid of that tissue of yours THOUGH it's really part of your body... I'm not only talking about how PAP thinks... But also how the people in Potong Pasir think....<br><br>Just like what you people have said... "If you're NOT with us, you're AGAINST us..." But DO CONSIDER these FACTS...<br><br>1. EVEN IF this is a BOSS-EMPLOYEE system. Anyone who is PART of the WORKING FORCE should be looked after. DESPITE the FACT that they might not be very cooperative or willing parties. TRY slashing your OWN flesh, and see IF it HURTS?<br><br>2. Potong Pasir is a STRONG HOLD which shown GREAT DISMAY against the RULING PARTY. BUT that DOESN'T mean that it's the ONLY ONE. There're STILL ALOT of UNTESTED MINE FIELDs out there.<br><br>3. SINGAPORE is 'HEALTHY' for now. That's why MOST of the 'organs' would still like to remain as PART of the BODY. Think about a situation whereby things have gone WORSE? MUCH WORSE? Would Singaporeans really be WILLING to fight for country? I can ASSURE you ALOT would be determined by how 'Singaporeans' are TREATED.<br><br>4. Could a NEW SYSTEM be introduced to break through this 'empire system'? (Sorry to say this but this is all TOO OBVIOUS?) Maybe the IDEA IS with such a STRONG and STRICT hold over such a SMALL ISLAND it's ALMOST unlikely? Singaporeans all too civilised and KS? Day by day the HOLD would STRENGTHEN. BUT one day IF Singapore ended up like Indonesia what would happen? Indonesia is BIG... Singapore is SMALL... TOO SMALL... EASY to control with most of the guys belonging to the SAF? THINK AGAIN... Heard of militia? And SINGAPORE simply CAN'T AFFORD to have that happening... If SCENERIO is to this stage whereby there is a CIVIL WAR.... It would END UP pretty much like the other small countries as its 'defence' relocated to 'offences'... ISN'T it LIKE saying... "HEY, I HATE the LOOK of my RIGHT ARM..." Eventually chopping it off.... Seeing yourself bleed... Getting HELPLESS... Who's NEXT? Or should you scream for help? Wait... No right arm... What to do...?? Hmm..... Nice way to get yourself KILLED in a sense...? THINK ABOUT it... Issit gonna WORK on the LONG RUN...?<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't mean to sound like I'm flaming but this is a really not news. The PAP has always been doing stuff like this and it'll be foolhardy for anyone to think they'll stop behaving like this anytime soon.<br><br>The PAP is probably just making an example of Potong Pasir. And did I hear democracy? Come on man....the voting we do is just to pay lip service to our own empty promise of "building a democratic society, based on justice and equality." Most foreign observers consider our government a very friendly dictatorship. I can't remember who told me that or where I read that so that might not be true. But if it is true, I wouldn't be surprised at all, and neither should any of you be.<br><br>Most Singaporeons just blindly vote for the PAP, just for the sake of security. When I say security, I mean things like economic stability, low crime rates, etc. Complain as much as we may, we're still much, much better off than a lot of other countries in terms of those factors.<br><br>In a way, Singaporeons are willing to trade off some of our freedoms and other niceties in return for the kind of security the PAP gives us. Granted, for all we know the SDP might actually do a better job but because of the political non-competition in Singapore, no one will know for sure; Being as kiasu as we are, we'd rather play safe and stick with the PAP.<br><br>Ever heard of "give an inch, and they'll take a foot?" Same goes for the PAP. They give a bit of room for political competition, and before they know it the opposition would use the slack that the PAP cut them, to choke the PAP. Once they let the ball start rolling, it will be near impossible in a political context for them to stop it, and they'll be out of office before they know it. In a way, the PAP is just as kiasu like the rest of us Singaporeons, and would also rather play safe.<br><br>With the current hullabooboo about more free speech and political competition, the PAP is just letting opposition have a go at it just for show. In reality, the opposition is nothing more than cannon fodder to the PAP. As a side note, the General Elections is more or less the PAP's turf, so what makes the opposition think they could win a fight in the PAP's own backyard? If any of you have noticed, most of the opposition candidates are those that probably have been deemed as non-threatening by the government. Those that did pose a threat have all been jailed, sued to bankruptcy, or been given free air-conditioned rooms at you-know-where.<br><br>I guess you could say the recent General Elections was just one big successful PR stunt the PAP managed to pull off, and the people living in Potong Pasir were none the wiser. Lets just hope those constituencies that voted for the opposition learn their lesson in time for the next General Elections, and don't repeat the same mistake.<br><br>That is, if they're still allowed to vote. Since the PAP has the mentality that not voting for them is grounds for the revoking of "privileges" like the upgrading of HDB flats, building of MRT lines, etc, considering not voting for them as grounds for not being granted the "privilege" (anyone remember that one?) to vote isn't really that far-off, is it? The consequences are all the same anyway; vote for PAP or...actually you don't really have a choice. You just have to vote for them.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Food for thought, anyone?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by chamenos (edited 24 April 2002).]</div>
