              <p>how do dogs communicate?  </p>
              <p>My ex boss (HKGer) had his dog since puppy....so he taught his dog to understand cantonese...sound reasonable. But we lived and worked in a soly spanish speaking environment.</p>
              <p>So when the dog bark at other dogs in the neighbourhood or interact with neighbors how does the dog communicate other than pee pee on trees and lamp post?  </p>

              <p>I would think that the dogs only recognise the particular cantonese word as being associated with a wanted behaviour and couldn't really tell the difference between cantonese and spanish.</p>
              <p>I mean if you repeat a spanish word enough and indicate to the dog the wanted behaviour enough, it would eventually be able to understand what the speaker wants. Spanish or Cantonese, it's just different sounds to it.</p>
              <p>I don't think dog's barks are as sophisticated as spoken language, but it is enough to communicate "this is my territory" "Let's play!" "Stay away from me!" much the same way a smile or a frown would work.  </p>

              <p>I quite agree with Stevenson</p>
              <p>From what i read from books and stuffs, Dogs do not really listen to words. They listen to our verbal tones and observe our guestures. They will lock in a our 'repeated' patterns to a reaction. Eg for my dog, whenever i get back home and take off my clothes to change, she will be damn excited, thinking i wanna bring her out for walks (which i have this pattern very often) but she misunderstand sometimes that i just want to change only. Den she will be very dissappointed and walks away when i tell her 'no. you good her stay at home', in the same tone and body language whenever i reject her.</p>
              <p>the same thing. You come back finding her creating a mess and you said 'why! y you do this and that..' and you will see them hiding under the bed and cowers away. If you recall, you almost say the same stuffs with simliar tones and body gestures. So this is how they derive</p>
              <p>OWner screaming and shouting, waving frantically or pointing at me = i better try to please her by licking her or try to cower away and hope she dun see me <strong>because</strong> i dun wan her to ignore me later or beat me later. In fact they look like they know they are doing something wrong. But in fact, they dun. I just don't want the negative reaction from you later on.</p>
              <p>Everyday dog say their own same dog language. Our language never influence the way they talk to each other. They go by scent, markings and body language and of course their own barking language.</p>
              <p>Hope this clarifies</p>

              <p>Loloolololol....</p>
              <p>What you said is not logical......</p>
              <p>Dogs wont be able to communicate with other dogs in Cantonese or Spanish....</p>
              <p>So they just communicate with each other with gestures, growls, etc.</p>
              <p>If your dog pees too much everywhere, you can train him, guide his path (avoid poles etc) and so on.</p>
              <p>And also especially if he is not used to it, avoid walking too close with other dogs because they might fight.</p>
