              <p>Hi all pet lovers I just adopted one. 6 months old, very stubborn. Toilet trained by me initially and once it started raining heavily, he shits and pees in the house now. (Used to do the business in the garden) When i beat the dog (not hard, not soft) for jumping onto the sofa, the more he wants to continue his misdeed after that.</p>
              <p>He also does not bark at strangers....quite strange for this breed? I thought they are normally very protective of the house?</p>
              <p>Pls advise!</p>

              <p>yeh i think i shd use more love. He peed on my leg when I came back home...must be angry with me for leaving him alone.</p>
              <p>Min pins are toy dogs but they have big dog mentality....no? lol They were employed by German police in the 19th century as watchdogs. My in laws also have a mini pinscher which only barks at malays but not the chinese. It will also go check out the gate when it opens and will pounce on any unfamiliar chaps.</p>

              <p>When i just got my Corgi, my sister kept on telling me, if she does bad things, cane her so that she will learn. Never did she learn after we caned her but instead, she seems defiant and peed everywhere she loved if given the chance.</p>
              <p>Then i started doing scold, then praise thing..</p>
              <p>Take for example, if she peed at some places she is not supposed to, i would take her pee or poo to the litter, with her along. Then i would take the pee soaked tissue paper and put it in the litter while she smell at it.. then i let her stayed there for some time and kept on letting her smell it, then feed her. </p>
              <p>do that many times and once she starts peeing in the litter, praise her and feed her until she absolutely does it there..</p>

              <p>tks chingalvin, I do that too. Toilet part, these days i got no prob liao....I just take him out to the garden for walks a few times a day, play throw &amp; catch a few times a day and that settles it :)</p>
              <p>And those malay kids must be stomping their feet to get reactions from your dog? lol. We had a snake in the garden last night and my dog looked terrified, just staring on as I beat the snake to death. He saw a stick insect, played with it and then barked ferociously......I need to bring the killer instincts out of him.</p>

              <p>well, i have ever seen this documentary where a few little tiger cubs were bred in captivity. They had no idea how to hunt. When they grew up, they were given bloodied meat. One day, they were put in this enclosure with a deer. Funny thing was they made friends with it lol. Shortly after, they threw in another deer, this time with blood smeared over its neck and back. The tigers sniffed the animal for a few minutes before pouncing. The other deer wasn't spared either. Soon, they were released into the wild.</p>

              <p>We brought her back home when she is a puppy... she begin to bark at strangers not too long after that... I think its a natural instinct...  we didn't teach her anything, she behaves like this naturally. But she is a real pain in neck when doing her business coz she would sometimes delibrately pee/poo in the wrong place.</p>
              <p>You can try playing with your mini pin, like sorta irritate it to train the temper if you want it to be more aggressive. Like me i will hold on to her lowerback the place nearer to the back legs, just sort of cup ur hand there and do some aggressive noise; like grrr~~  normally this will irritate ur dog and it will want to counter back to stop you from cupping its backside xD!!! Then from there you can play around with it.</p>

              <p>ok will try lol. I have put him at my in-laws place now. They have a min pin which is a real guard dog, going to the gate at the slightest noise and barking at strangers. Those he has seen before, he will just quietly return back to the house.</p>
              <p>Hope mine will learn the ropes lol.</p>
