              <p>I know it must be very exciting for you to want to have a pet, esp. a cute, playful puppy. I'm personally an animal lover, and have many different types of animals (including adopting from SPCA) since I was very young, and always took care of every one of them till end of their lives.</p>
              <p>Before the euphoria of wanting a cute puppy takes over you, you may want to consider first:</p>
              <p>What's your main motivation for wanting a puppy?</p>
              <p>Is this your first time getting a pet? Do you know how long is the lifespan of a dog?</p>
              <p>Do you know how to take good care of a dog? Are you aware of the daily/regular chores of cleaning, feeding, exercising and taking care of a dog?</p>
              <p>How much time on a <strong>daily basis</strong> are you prepared to spend taking care of it, <strong>now and in future</strong>?</p>
              <p>Are you willing to take on the <strong>long-term responsibility</strong> of taking care of it, for the rest of its lifetime with you, even when it's old and very sickly, has problems eating/drinking/seeing/moving/peeing/pooing and of course, no longer cute like when it's a puppy?</p>
              <p>Too many people get tired of their pets when they are no longer cute, and feel they are more of a burden than fun, and end up <strong>abandoning them mercilessly</strong>. SPCA is filled with old animals who have outlived their previous owners' short-lived interest. Many abandoned pets end up dying on the streets, died of starvation, hit by cars, killed by disease, attacked by other stray animals or being put down by SPCA.</p>
              <p>If you are also a genuine animal lover, I'm sure you'll have lots of fun and joy, with your puppy/dog, throughout its life. Animals have the natural role of helping people learn about <strong>unconditional love</strong>.</p>
              <p>If you truly can take good care and love a puppy/dog well, you'll be able to find a puppy/dog that is meant to share its life with you, regardless of any pet shop or SPCA. Getting an animal companion is not the same as shopping for clothes or handbags in a mega-shopping mall. :)</p>
              <p>I honestly hope I'm wrong here, but your posting title of "<strong>In general :The problem with pets</strong>" seems strange for one truly looking forward about finding a long-term animal companion.</p>

              <p>Hmmm, similarly, i know it must be very exciting for you to reply to my post with such biting remarks included in between the lines. However, before you go about trying to find joy in throwing such crude comments at people, do consider the following first, yeah? (:</p>
              <p>Let's take what you posted as an example, since you were so eager about saying what you said in this post of yours.</p>
              <p>1. How sure are you that i'm going to find a puppy as a pet? I do not need you to beat about the bush and go round and round in circles 'giving advice' when in actual fact, you just want to get at me, whoever the hell you are. I was just asking for recommended places, that is all. if u have none, kindly get lost.</p>
              <p>2. Do not blame me for posting this post. You ought to have yourself mentally prepared after saying such things at people. Unless your purpose in this world here is to offend people, it's not right of you to tell people that "Getting an animal
                                      companion is not the same as shopping for clothes or handbags in a
                                      mega-shopping mall. :)" by the way, please remove that smile off your face when you're throwing crude remark at people.. At the very least, i'm being honest.</p>

              <p>The person who changed your title and moved your thread to another forum section is actually the boss here of the entire sgforums, FireIce.</p>
              <p>When she sees threads which she believes are in the wrong section, she will just change its name and put it somewhere else where she sees fit without any warning.</p>
