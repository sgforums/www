              <p>Hey!</p>
              <p>"Rent-A-Pet" is a student-initiated project which allows potential pet owners to "rent" (in other words, adopt) a pet from SPCA* for a period of 3 months, as the title suggests. Clients are to pay a 50% deposit of the total cost of the animal for the adoption fee. The remaining 50% will be paid if he/she decides to take care of the animal for good. However, once he/she returns the pet, he/she will not be receiving any refund. He/she must not mistreat the pet during these three months. </p>
              <p>Anyway, the rationale of this scheme is to instill in pet owners a sense of responsibility and ownership in taking care of their pets. With animal abuse and neglect on the rise, it is important that pet owners know what they have signed up for when they choose to have pets. We also hope to increase adoption rates by allowing pet lovers that are unsure about their ability to care for the animals to have a go at it without taking on the full responsibility. This way, a wider audience will be more willing to adopt the pets. </p>
              <p><strong>So, what do you think about this scheme? Do you think it's feasible? Do you think it requires more improvement? If so, leave a comment! </strong></p>
              <p>Thank you!</p>
              <p>*SPCA has not approved of this scheme. As stated above, this is a student-initiated idea and this post is intended to gather views on "Rent-A-Pet". </p>

              <p>What about the pet's feelings? How does it feel to have one "family" and discarded the next just so that potential pet owners have the chance to test themselves?</p>
              <p>Novel idea to instill some sense of animal care responsibility though.</p>

              <p>Please consider the feeling of animals and the goal of SPCA before coming up with this. I highly suggest you speak to SPCA before even posting this.</p>

              <p>This Rent-A-Pet scheme will failed.</p>
              <p>Because of a lot of fault factors which the student did not consider.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faults<br>1) Dogs in SPCA - are mostly stray or abandon dogs - not all of them suited for rental or even handle by strangers. Usually Dogs for rental need to be selected for the temper and other factors and had some former training.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) 3 weeks is too long !!!</p>
              <p>Why oversea rental works is because if they mainly rent out by hour or the day itself, the dogs usually are return at night. It is highly popular as it allow those people spend time with pets but do not know or need to take care of it. - leaving the major care to the professional. For animals, they usually get a day off between the daily rental - thus reduce their stress. Health and abuse can be spot fast.</p>
