              <p>Damn.. This video is sick and definitely not for the fainted hearted and dog lovers. Its as bad if not worse than the videos of the china peeps skinning dogs alive.</p>
              <p>This poor dog was literally burn to death by this group of idiots whom started off with pouring kerosene on the poor dog, and lighting it up.</p>
              <p>You can literally hear the dog scream for its life until its charred and dead. Even though the video is 54 seconds long, the dog die in less than 30 seconds.</p>
              <p>May these idiotic bastardsbe strike down with lightning or be bedridden for the rest of their fucking lives.</p>

              <p>Talking about cruelty to dogs, that time i still young i saw a dog being knocked by a car on AYE near the clementi stadium that side. That dog was still alive when i was knocked, but its hind leg was broken and though its able to stand up, it struggled for movement. So this poor dog was in the middle of the expressway. I was on the overhead bridge nearby. Yet, I saw no cars stopping to help the poor dog. Every car was zooming pass that dog. When the dog eventually too painful to move about and started lying on the road, one car went over the dog. The dog immediately gave a loud cry. Then the second and third car follow suit by going over the dog. Luckily got some good samaritans whom saw this quickly called the police.</p>
              <p>It was too much for me as a young boy to witness this, so i went away with my friend. Then we came back to the same spot 30 minutes later. And you know what?? The dog was dead. No police actually came. The dog suffered even more injury than when we first saw it. Furthermore, the interesting thing as when we say the dog initially it was at lane 2. Then when we came back later, it was at lane 4 or rather the lane next to the shoulder. The dog seems dragged by the cars over a distance, and it was confirmed dead.</p>
              <p>Its sad. I have also seen people slamming cats against walls, all happening in singapore. Haiz......</p>

              <p>This is the link to another video in which a bastard threw a dog off a bridge 12 metres down. Luckily and I dont know how, the dog survived. That bastard, maybe guilt ridden decided to hand himself over to the police.</p>
