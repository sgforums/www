              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>i found this forum while searching for other dog owners who had bad experience with this vet at Toa Payoh vet clinic, lor 8.  If only I had come across "purefaith"'s message (<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1228/topics/372371"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">www.sgforums.com/forums/1228/topics/372371</span></span></a>) here to learn from her experience, i would have been forewarned than to make the mistake of sending my dog there.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>let me quote purefaith's message where her dog's stitches was not done properly and all the internal organs start to fall out and the vet claimed the dog to had bitten it off. (other vet laughed it out at such a claim).  And when she confronted the vet he "denied everything and <strong>dared</strong> me (purefaith)".  Not surprised at such an attitude from a vet in defence and trying to 'dominate' by his so-called professionalism when he probably should be responsible for a bad job done?  Purefaith also said the <strong>helper at the clinic</strong> admitted the surgeon did not do the job properly.  (see, vet thinks dog cant talk but at least someone else with integrity spoke the truth).</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Similar attitude from the vet, who diagnose my dog when sent to Dr Sing, recently while I was away in HK when my dog fell ill under the care of my friend.  Such things happened and no one should be blamed.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, when I visited him to explain the blood test and urine test results because I had been so confused by his claim of this and that at different times (due to his speculative diagnosis – will make a separate post on this), he was so bloody rude.  He made (in a reprimanding tone, almost shouting) a remark : "Where were you when your dog were sick??!!!!  You were in Honggggg Kong, holiiiiiidaying!!!!!!!":  I was totally taken aback and have no idea where the hell did this come from.  I just stood there in a daze.  WTF is he doing???? <span> </span>What is his right to make such uncalled, remark???   He has NO position to speak to any paying client (in fact, anyone at all) in this accusation manner.  Not just unprofessional but TOTALLY out of line.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Anyway, perhaps my posting here is to warn owners NOT to allow any vet to over-power you like he’s the “top” dog (just because he’s the vet and u’re not?) to dominate you in his pack.<span>  </span>Don’t stoop so low in his level to allow him to do so. <span>  </span>Perhaps he thinks he’s not fit to be a human anymore, so be it.  so annoying to meet a vet applying dog-bullying tactics on us owners in this manner.  (Pui!!)</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>claimed my dog to have spinal disc prolapse - what a totally mis-diagnosis.  he cant convince my brother, my mother or me but continues to prescribed pain killers pill for my dog's back!  Can you believe this?  Of cos' I return the pill for a refund, right?  He refunded with reluctance by insulting me.  (will relate in a separate post).</span></p>
