              <p>A dogs life expectancy is about 15 years.</p>
              <p>Have you factored in the fact that the dog will shit and pee every day of the 15 years?</p>
              <p>For it to shit and pee every day, it needs to be fed every day.</p>
              <p>Thats fifteen years of feeding and clearing shit.</p>
              <p>How old will you be in 15 years time?</p>
              <p>Do you think you will keep the dog all those years?</p>
              <p>When have get married and are having children, the dog will be old, and smelly, and getting blind.</p>
              <p>A pet is for the life time of the animal. Not thrown away after a while, as is the case with people who always wanted a pet when they don't have one.</p>

              <p>I felt the same as you when i was younger. And i can understand how you feel and yearn for a pet. But as you grow older you may feel what i am feeling now so i shall take you and your feelings in life forward in time, to one of the many possibilities of how you might feel or behave and decide in future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all animals and pets get sick. some who live in the wild learn to hunt for their own medicines in plants and nature, to heal themselves. domestic or those which are raised by humans relies more on the owners' care. yes and without proper love, attention and nourishments they may even die from illnesses, accidents or slaughter (see how people ill treat or murder strays and pets?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>license is one time i believe, but may need sterilise for some pets or micro-chipping. check with the authorities. price on annual checkup may defer from different vets, though periodic checks are good to detect symptoms of ill health, just like humans. Dog food and treats and cost youhave to check out on your own, depends on the breed and if you will want to make it a habits or spoil them with treats. cutting claws, digging ears are part of grooming to maintain hygiene, there are extreme groomining to make they pretty and handsome too. But some pets clean themselves. E.g cats don't take shower, most dislike water. they clean themselves by licking with their tongue which removes fleas and pparasites from their furs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i suggest you start with smaller pets like fishes, hamsters or tortise. If you can keep them for a year or two and has the patience to love, care and clean their habitat you are ready for bigger pets.</p>

              <p>Hi Wiredex,</p>
              <p>If you truly wish to have a dog as a pet, it will be more appropriate for you to read up more about how to take care of them and things to take note of from the guide books in our community libraries.</p>
              <p>Only after you have understand all the basics of looking after a pet dog - including being able to answer all the questions which you have asked - then should you proceed with getting a dog.</p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>

              <p>You need to consider how to groom the dog, from training it to pee and poop at the right places, to training it to accept you brushing its teeth, cleaning out its ears and plucking the hair from its ears.  They also have to be trained from young to tolerate you bathing and picking out their shagging hairs from their undercoats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You also need to pee and poop proof your house.  Will your family members mind the smelly house they come home to, the damaged shoes, furnitures and mattresses/pillows? No matter how you bathe your dog.  Its going to have its own smell added to your house perfumes.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is also the issue of training and making time for it. Giving it walks and exercises and bringing your pet outdoors......Its a lot of commitment and even a change of lifestyle.  Understand that when you bring a pet into the household.  You should give up a lot more of your friends time or hanging out with friends time.</p>
              <p>Or in short.  Forget about going on holidays.</p>
