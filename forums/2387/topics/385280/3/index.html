              <p>Remembered this incident.</p>
              <p>Was in a police patrol car, called to a landed home district and attended to the call of a house still renovating, having a big alastian dog there.</p>
              <p>The big dog was quietly in the compund drinking from a makeshft bowl of water held out by the renovation contractor.</p>
              <p>The renovation contractor thought its probably a police dog, cos it looks like a police dog, so they called the police.  (I dont want to explain the logic....)</p>
              <p>Anyway, after having its fill of water, the dog decides to walk out of the compund, and two blangah workers standing at the side entrance chatting, was so startled by the big dog.  One of them practically scaled the side wall just to get out of the big dog's path.</p>
              <p>The dog got to the road, but didnt know where to go, so it stood there and whine at us.</p>
              <p>Some neighbours commented that they seen the dog jogging with the owner but they dont know where the owner stayed.</p>
              <p>So in the end,  Me and My partner took turns trying to jog next to the dog, so the dog will follow us.  Thats when I roughly got into the habit of always patting my knees so strange dogs will follow me by walking at my side.</p>

              <p>There was one time, really late at night and I was re-assigned to the dog unit patrol car.</p>
              <p>And when the driver pulled up, I got into his land rover and he was this really cute handsome looking fella, and we chatted while we drive around.</p>
              <p>Then on a stop.  He asked me whether I want to to see his dog. I okay that and got out of the landrover to go to the back.</p>
              <p>He opened the back and in this cage, a strange green glow surrounding the eyes of a really fierce alastian look a like (later I found out its a malamute) stare back at me.</p>
              <p>Its was quite a shock.  Cos the night is dark, and all I see is roughly green and black with a glinting eyes staring at me.</p>
              <p>Then my driver suggest I put my hands in.  I did that and offered the back of my hand.  Next thing I know.  That dog was lapping his tongue all over my hands!</p>
              <p>He is a softie!!!!!!!!  Like a teddy bear with waspy soft warm tongue bigger then my outstretched palms and fingers!</p>

              <p>On another note.</p>
              <p>This same handsome dog unit guy, I later met him again some years later.  And he told of one incident.</p>
              <p>He was ferryingsome3 police alastians in his landrover without aircon, so  he has all the windows of the landrover opened and they stopped at a location where they will be doing some dog shows of sorts.</p>
              <p>A obvious father, carrying a toddler girl went up to the land rover and suggested for her toddler child to put the hands thru the bars of the cage to pat one alastian.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, he was out of the landrover on the other side, heard the father speak and quickly shouted out to the father not to let his girl do that!</p>
              <p>He later was nagging and scolding that father about patting dogs that is military trained</p>
              <p>'You dont know whether the dogs have strange temperament and will bite off your hands!'</p>

              <p>And oh....I trained Ah girl to do tug of war.</p>
              <p>By rolling a doggie treat into a old towel and securing the towel.</p>
              <p>So the doggie will bite one end of the rolled towel and I hold the other and we engage in tug of war play, in the flat, during rainy days.</p>
              <p>Got to the point, when sometimes, ah girl will pick up floor rugs and bring to me.....hoping to play.</p>
