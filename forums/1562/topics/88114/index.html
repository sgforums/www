            <div class='col-md body'>So sad to mention this but I have to share it with you guys.<br><br>In the month of July 2004, one of the tuesday, my house kanna break in and all my mums jewelleries kanna stolen. My mum was very sad.<br><br>We lived in that corridor level flat for 20 years, never had this kind of thing happen till that day.<br><br>The irony is that: I saw one suspicious man at the corridor behaving wierdly. I stared at him to frighten him off, but he just pretend pretend stand there, looking at my door. As i was rushing for work, i hack care him. The very next day, our house kanna break in. Sigh... i suspect it could be that guy and i wish i have done something abt it on that day i saw him. Lesson learned<br><br>We only know that the houe was break in at abt 6pm, called police and then came abt 45min later, Wah pianz. First officer take picture halfway, run out of flim and have to drive back to station to get extra. Second officer take down the 'KOU GONG' and have call his fellow colleague through his mobile to ask him how to spell "bracelet". Wah Pianz X 2.<br><br>This event actually dampen my trust to my Neighbourhood police liao  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Depending on how far that car is from your said location, the traffic conditions on the roads, the number of mobiles put on the roads to serve your locality, and even the number of cases which they happen to be attending to at that time, it is difficult to guarantee that the car will reach you as soon as you expect them to.<br><br>So why not just get someone out of the NPP/NPC itself?

But two things to point out here. First, it is not advisable for officers to go alone outside counter duties, let alone responding to an emergency. Second, the ""eeyor eeyor car", or shall I call them them by their official name: Fast Response Car (FRC), dont just ferry officers.
