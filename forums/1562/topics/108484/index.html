            <div class='col-md body'>my dad instructed my mum to tell the newspaper deliveryman not to deliver papers on the days we were overseas because it's a sure sign we are not in. but she overslept and couldnt tell him.<br><br>and so we went on with the trip and the morning after we returned my mum called the vendor and they said they delivered the papers and apparently someone took it because the sat papers werent there when the vendor came to deliver sunday's papers.<br><br>at first i thought "which idiot stole our papers!!!" then at night my neighbour who stays opp my home came over and delivered our papers for the past few days to us. they kept it for us while we were away! i was quite happy when he delivered the papers personally to us because these days, few would do such things voluntarily.<br><br>though it's just papers and we would probably be lost for a few days, but it was really nice of them.<br><br>a stark contrast to the neighbour who stays right beside us...</div>

I too have great neighbours.<br>Once, while the entire family went on a vacation (I was stuck at home due to work), I came home sick, real sick.
