            <div class='col-md body'>History of the Nova's Eye:<br><br>Born a Genesis Engineering Corp Z7-9000L Series J Heavy Space Bulk Carrier from the Genesis Engineering Corp's Ship-Conyards, the Nova's Eye was aquired by the upstart transport company, StellarLine Co. The company was one of the few willing to offer shipping services to the area known as Rougespace. Rougespace is an area independent of Earth's control, formed millennias back by spacefarers who were left stranded after a routine charting mission went wrong.<br><br>Surviving members of the expedition were able to sustain themselves on habitable planet in the system they were sent to chart. But mission control on Earth never heard from them again, and the mission was assumed a total loss. It was another 3 generations before Earth could muster up the determination and resources to plan for another charting mission, due to the outbreak of civil war and a grab for power by different factions.<br><br>The survivors of the mission manage to colonize the planet, and began to flourish. By the time the new charting mission arrived in system, the descendants of the mission survivors had not only flourished, but advanced technologically beyond earth, a result of having to adapt to their new home. It was established that The descendants would remain independent, largely due to 2 factors, being that they have determined they do not want Earth's rule, and that rougespace, as the area will come to be known, was too far for a war ravaged Earth to effectively police and govern.<br><br>The Nova's Eye, then named SLC #27, was one of a convoy of 12 ships which made a bulk jump into the rougespace system, Centuri Nu. The convoy was interdicted on the fringes of the system by unknown forces, and several of the Heavy Space Bulk Carrier were destroyed. 7 of them, not including the SLC #27 managed to jump in-system to Centuri Nu. The SLC #27 suffered reactor damage and complete electrical destruction occured as a result. Its electrical and navigational systems shut down, along with the communications. With the electrics destroyed, and the reactor damaged, the life support systems malfunctioned, and pumped Carbon Dioxide through the ship's interior. Death came swiftly for the crew of 1300, and the ship drifted through rougespace, unmanned and unpowered. When a military response force from Centuri Nu arrived, alerted by the 7 surviving SLC ships, there was no trace of the unknown interlopers or the doomed SLC #27.<br><br>10 years later, a young salvage ship's Captain named HENG@ stumbled across the SLC #27, which had encountered an astroid field and crashed on on of the larger astroids. It was salvaged, and taken back to Centuri Nu for refitting and refurbishment. According to salvage rules, HENG@ was entitled to ownership of the salvaged ship as long as he paid the salvage tax of 20% for all salvaged materials to the Centuri Nu System Government, which he duely did.<br><br>HENG@ later started running supplies across rougespace from Centuri Nu to other rougespace systems, now colonized by the people of Centuri Nu. It was realised that negotiation problems often arose among the different rougespace systems, and that their individual governments were unable to trade peacefully. A war lasting 6 months broke out between the systems of Upsilon Gamma and Zeta 219, necessitating the intervention of several other systems. Full blown rougespace war was narrowly avoided when cooler heads prevailed, and it was then HENG together with several other merchants and traders decided to propose the formation of ICRC as a solution to avoiding inter-system disagreements on trade and commerce. Furthermore, in the recent years leading to the formation o the ICRC, several pirate gangs have sprung up, making space travel for unarmed merchant ships dangerous. The increasing number of pirating incidents and activity was one of the factors that led to the formation of the ICRC.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>History of the Nova's Eye Contiuned:<br><br>The Nova's Eye received a weapons upgrade, with her main armments taken from rougespace capital-class ships that were destroyed during the 6 months long trade war. The reactor and thrusters of a heavily damaged and decomissioned Sentinal Capital-class ship from the system of Zeta 219 was retro-fitted into the Nova's Eye. The shields from another Sentinal capital-class ship was also fitted into the Npva's Eye. By then, HENG@ had renamed her. As a result of her moddifications, the Nova's Eye looked nothing like the original Genesis Engineering Corp Z7-9000L Series J.<br><br>The Nova's Eye is now the flagship of the ICRC Fleet. Most ships within the ICRC are armed to a certain extant, following guidelines set by the ICRC's ruling committee. Recent designs for merchant-class ships have been produced, and production of merchant-class ships with weaponary incorporated into their design is expected to begain within the next few months. To a certain extant, these designs have drawn heavily on the Nova's Eye for inspiration. They are expected to have not more than half of the Nova's Eye's weaponary, and a speed factor of not more than 2/3 that of the Nova's Eye's, with an eye towards cargo space within the ships and maintenance costs.<br><br>The Nova's Eye will continue to serve the ICRC Fleet for years to come. It is rumoured that Capt HENG@ has recently been seen on a couple of occasions in Earthspace. It is believed widely that he is looking to set up an established trading network between Earthspace and rougespace. Although the sketchy reports coming from Earth indicated that civil war is ongoing at the moment, many believe that trade with Earth will be profitable, with sales of war materials topping the list of commerce. Several stories have been going around recently that HENG@ is actually allying himself with a powerful faction and lending them logistical support in the civil war on Earth, although this is widely dispersed as nothing more than malicious rumours.</div>
