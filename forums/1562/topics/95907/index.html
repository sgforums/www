            <div class='col-md body'>beanie's baby ( rhymes doesnt it?)<br><br>Anyway, this thread is set up to track the progress of her new baby, week by week, with permission from beanie.<br><br>Please do not crap in this thread and I will only unlock this thread for updating the weekly progress of lil' pukabeanie.<br><br>Week 17<br>Pukabeanie is abt the size of an avocado. He'll be playing with his umbilical cord and practising breathing by inhaling &amp; exhaling amniotic fluid through his lungs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Week 18<br>Pukabeanie is now nearly 14cm long and weighs approx 200gms. His movements are mostly gentle, fluttering sensations. But once a while, his kicks are more vigorous and obvious  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Week 19<br>Pukabeanie is now twice as big as he was last month. Although things may seem calm on the surface, he is kicking, flexing, reaching, rolling, and even sucking his thumb now. His hearing is now functiong and he will be listening to my heartbeat  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Week 20<br>Pukabeanie now measures around 15 cm long &amp; weighs abt 255 gm. Hair on his scalp is sprouting. The nerve cells serving the senses Â— taste, smell, hearing, seeing, &amp; touch Â— are now developing in their specialised areas of the brain  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Week 21<br>Pukabeanie now measures around 18.5 cm long &amp; weighs abt 400 gm. He's swallowing more amniotic fluid now which is good practice for his digestive system. And he's kicking more often and vigorously than before<br><br>Week 22<br>Pukabeanie's initial fluttering movements have turned into fully fledged kicks &amp; nudges, &amp; it's as tho' he is practising martial arts. I'm also starting to decipher a pattern to his activity (he's usu very active during my mealtimes).<br><br>Week 23<br>Pukabeanie's skin is still quite wrinkled cos he has so much growing still to do. But his face &amp; body are beginning to look more like those of a newborn. His tooth buds have also formed beneath his gum line.<br><br>Week 24<br>Pukabeanie's hearing and sense of movement are well developed now. His lungs are also developing to prepare for breathing. And he's also started blinking his eyelids  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Week 25<br>Pukabeanie's brain is growing rapidly &amp; he's filling up th space in my uterus. He's abt 22cm now and weighs abt 600gms. His taste buds are forming and so is his sweet tooth (that should explain my choc cravings :p)<br><br>Week 26<br>Pukabeanie is now weighs about 900gms and is approx 23 cm long. He makes breathing movements but has no air in his lungs yet. He is responsive to touch now and and his heart is beating so strongly that it may be heard with a stethoscope.<br><br>Week 27<br>Pukabeanie is becoming more sensitive to sound &amp; if daddy Pukadon talks to him now, he might learn to recognise his voice. He'll probably be abt 38cm long from head to toe &amp; weighs abt 900gms<br><br>Week 28<br>Pukabeanie is growing steadily and gaining weight rapidly in preparation for D-Day. He sleeps &amp; wakes at regular intervals and may be beginning to dream as his brain is active<br><br>Week 29<br>Pukabeanienow weighs approx 1.3kg and measures abt 42cm from top to toe. He can now open his eyes and turn in my tummy if he notices a continuous bright light shining fr the outside. His fingernails are also formed.<br><br>Week 30<br>Pukabeanie now weighs approx 1.3kg and measures abt 44cm from head to toe. His head is getting bigger and his brain is developing billions of neurons at an amazing rate. His bones are also growing at a faster rate which means I have to drink more milk <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Week 31<br>Pukabeanie's lungs n digestive tract are almost fully develooped. He continues to open n shut his eyes n can probably distinguish light from dark and even track a light source. He also now has eyebrows and eyelashes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Week 32<br>Pukabeanie probably weighs abt 1.8kg &amp; measures 45cm now. And he may be running out of space to move around in my tummy. But gosh, he still has plenty of growing to go. His organs r continuing to mature n he's passing water fr his bladder<br><br>Week 33<br>Pukabeanie may not be sucking its fingers and thumbs, preparing for the process of breastfeeding. He now measures approx 19.5inches from head to toe and approx 2.1kg.<br><br>Week 34<br>Pukabeanie now weighs approx 2.2kg &amp; measures abt 48cm fr head to toe. His skull is still quite pliable n not completely joined so tat he can ease out of the relatively narrow birth canal.<br><br>Week 35<br>Pukabeanie now weighs approx 2.5kg &amp; measures abt 49cm fr top to toe. He's filling out and getting rounder. And his hearing is fully developed which means he can now hear me very well <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Week 36<br>Pukabeanie now weighs approx 2.6kg and doesn't have much room to roam about. He's sporting fingernails and has a fully developed pair of kidneys. His liver can also process some waste products.<br><br>Week 37<br>Pukabeanie now weighs about 2.6kg and is just abt a week away from seeing this world. Can't wait to meet him face to face !</div>
