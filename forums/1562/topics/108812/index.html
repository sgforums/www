            <div class='col-md body'>just popped out of a lift in my sch's lib just now.<br><br>i was stuck in it for 15mins. frankly speaking, it was BORING!<br>i was left with nothing but my hp with games so predictable and nothing to sit on.<br><br>what happened was that i wanted to take the lift to the 5th floor to find a quiet corner to sleep as i woke up damn early and had little sleep last night. the lift closed it doors but i didnt feel it going up and the number didnt change (floor number) and took a few seconds before the door opened on the same floor i was at before. i pressed the floor again, thinking it could be someone wanting to catch the lift and the 3rd time, thinking it was some prankster.<br>but the 4th time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> the doors remained shut and didnt go up either.<br><br>i pressed all the buttons, floors, door open and door close but nothing happened. i pressed because i was bored actually. i didnt want to press the alarm button because it would look so stupid on me, but i pressed it a while later because i was getting impatient and i could feel my face turning red as i pressed the bell that gave me a fright because i didnt expect it to be so audible inside the lift.<br><br>called my friend to help notify the retarded lib staff and he tried with a few others to open the doors but it remained stuck. it was sometime later then i called the lift services number and they told me it would take like 30mins to come...(thanks,30mins)<br><br>occasionally someone would shout and see if i was ok but apparently those ppl outside seemed to have more fun than me...could hear them laughing and stuff.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>so i played my hp' games and it was damn boring, then 15mins later, the toothpick lift decided to open up...<br><br>i guess i had enough sense of humour to ask for food when i called the sch's estate dept from inside the lift.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>next time, ass-pee, pls install a farking chair for me to sit.....and something to do while getting stuck inside.<br><br>today must buy toto.</div>
