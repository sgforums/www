            <div class='col-md body'>this happened yesterday evening.<br><br>i planned to meet my dad at his workplace to sign a new starhub line as he had this hp voucher($200) at 5pm because he gets off work at 5. i was pretty anxious and excited to get the phone that day because i had waited for it for sometime already.<br><br>i called him to tell him i already arrived at the starhub office near his office but didnt get through (he later told me he was always busy during the last 30mins of the day, oops...forgot) i even called up my mum at home to ask how. ( it was abit pointless to ask her but i was too anxious anyway.<br><br>when he arrived he agreed to on my suggested hp line and the hp i wanted, damn i was on cloud nine. when my dad was signing the necessary documents he paused before signing the actual contract to see the hp numbers available and was immediately infuriated by the lousy numbers they offered.<br><br>i kept totally silent throughout the signing crap except to clarify the costs of some of the plans' features. my dad called it lousy because it all contained at least 1 '4' inside the numbers and even in the numbers starting with "8" (note, they only offered like less than 7 numbers starting with <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> you see, my dad's a stock broker, he loves all these nice numbers and not to mention 8s.<br><br>ok fine, i accept his preference because i agree that some are really nice and my previous nice hp numbers were chosen by him and most importantly, he's the 1 signing the line. he not happy, he cancel, i die.<br><br>the junior staff that attended to us was abit pissed(obviously) as my dad was raising his voice and making clear his displeasure and the staff called in his supervisor when my dad demanded more numbers. ( at this point, i even jokingly said to my dad that it was surprising if more numbers came up because last time, 1 virgin mobile shop lied to me that there were only a few numbers when their call centre staff told me there were loads there. but my dad didnt hear me as he was abit pissed too)<br><br>the supervisor came back with the same list and attempted to explain the situation calmly to my dad but he still blew his top and pronounced how badly the numbers would sound like in cantonese,etc. i was quite embarrased because he was like talking so loudly, if not shouting, in a public place!<br>he eventually rejected the line and wasnt charged a cent.  he asked me when does the offer cease and any alternative places. i told him it was fine with me if he decided to go there now or wait a week.<br><br>at this point of time, i was disappointed because i've been waiting for this for a while and when everything's well ( agreed price plans and hp) suddenly goes up in smoke. not that it was a great achievement or something i placed much effort in, but this anti-climax was abit of a disappointment.<br><br>at no time i was angry with my dad and because i was abit disappointed, i kept quiet throughout the bus journey ( i was sleeping mostly anyway) and on the walk home from bus stop. and i just replied " orh" when he told me he preferred taking bus because it's easier to sleep on bus(ok fine...)<br><br>i took a long shower because i was feeling abit sticky and wanted to relax abit. i went back to my room immediately and only came down for dinner and when i came down later to watch abit of tv, he suddenly screamed at me<br>saying things like, i didnt respect him, no matter what he is still my father, simple things flare up at him, give him attitude,etc<br><br>i was shocked! i told him like 3, 4 times that i was simply disappointed or feeling abit sian because i waited for this phone for so long and finally was going to get it ! i told him that he was shouting at that poor guy and he replied that he wasnt shouting and even apologised for being a tough customer and jokingly ended the deal there. he still screamed at me, i told him for the 3 and 4th time i wasnt angry! and he turned away to face the tv and refused to talk to me.<br><br>my poor mum came over to my room later that night and i explained the situation to her. didnt want to trouble her because she's really stressed but she appeared to blame me and i had to explain my stance. maybe i am wrong on this.<br><br>i dunno. i am quite tired.</div>
