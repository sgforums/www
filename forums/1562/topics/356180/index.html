              <p><span style="color: #008000;">Stretch your dollar with these fabulous all-you-can-eat buffets. By <strong>Baey Shi Chen</strong> and <strong>Theresa Tarpey</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/450/14-15-dining.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;">While many are cutting expenses in these tight times, there’s no reason to cut down on how much you eat. Get maximum mileage from your dough by checking out the best buffets in town. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ellenborough Market Cafe</strong><br><strong>G/F, Swissotel Merchant Court, 20 Merchant Court, 6239-1847/8.</strong><br><strong>The setting: </strong>The ground-floor café overlooks the Singapore River, with an outdoor dining terrace which is ideal for watching the world go by.<br><strong>The scene: </strong>With décor influenced by our local heritage, this café exudes an old-world charm, accentuated by polished rattan chairs and old-fashioned, white marble tables. <br><strong>The crowd: </strong>Ellenborough is a favorite haunt of the lunchtime throng comprising corporate professionals, families, and lunching ladies.<br><strong>The spread:</strong> Expect a wide variety of international cuisine and superb local dishes. Signature dishes include the steamed seabass in broad bean paste and the wok-fried slipper lobster in black bean sauce. The café is also famous for its selection of authentic Peranakan fare dreamt up by in-house Nonya chef Shirley Tay—think ayam buah keluak, babi pongteh and kueh pie tee, paired with freshly made sambal sauces. The yummy desserts include perennial favorites such as green bean soup, pulot hitam and the café’s famous durian pengat, a heavenly creamy dessert made of the finest D-24 durians. And oh, check out the Peranakan kueh dadar, chocolate fondue and delicious cakes too. <br><strong>The damage: </strong>The prices are pretty reasonable. Lunch is priced at $29 on weekdays; and $31 on weekends. Dinner costs $36 from Mon-Thu and $38 from Fri-Sun. <br><strong>Perfect for:</strong> A hearty meal with family and friends. Its proximity to Clarke Quay also means that avid clubbers hit the dance floors there to work off the meal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Garuda Padang Cuisine<br>#02-01 Cairnhill Place, 15 Cairnhill Rd., 6735-4111.</strong><br><strong>The setting: </strong>Classy Garuda from the folks at Tung Lok Restaurant is the only franchise serving up authentic Padang cuisine outside Indonesia. They’ve taken canteen dining to the next level, ritzing up the à la carte buffet experience with an all-white, uber modern furnishings. <br><strong>The scene: </strong>With its simple and refined décor, this place is the epitome of elegant buffet dining on the cheap. Its location away from the main part of Orchard guarantees hours of undisturbed grazing.<br><strong>The crowd: </strong>Over lunch, corporate types prevail. In the evenings, though, the place is packed with a much better mix of customers. Indonesian families can be spotted here at any time of the day.<br><strong>The spread:</strong> Indonesian soul food is the order of the day. Aromatic ingredients meld together to create a large variety of traditional Padang favorites. In line with the concept of chic buffet dining, guests point at desired dishes and then return to their table to await service. The beef rendang is braised to perfection—tender and well-balanced in terms of creaminess, texture and spice. The fried kampung chicken iss all about the yellow ginger and herb floss—which doesn’t taste anything like ginger, but damn is it tasty! And did we mention the lamb rack in curry? It’s to-die-for, fall-off-the-bone tender. As for veggie delights, the eggplant in sambal—smothered in chili-sardine sauce—is piquant and soft. <br><strong>The damage: </strong>The à la carte buffet will set you back $18 for lunch and $20 for dinner. We know what you’re thinking, “It’s good but so is the auntie-run Padang stall near work.” This is what we have to say to that: Student sets go for $6 which includes rice, meat, veggies, tempe and egg. They’ve also got an early bird special (11am-noon, 5:30-6:30pm), which is $5 for a bento set and includes rice, choice of meat, veggie and tempe. <br><strong>Perfect for: </strong>Those aiming to please a client, mother-in-law, friend or tourist with scrumptious Padang eats in a swanky, peaceful setting.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Hibiki<br>Cuppage Terrace, 21 Cuppage Rd., 6736-0326.</strong><br><strong>The setting:</strong> Nestled among alfresco eateries, bars and a spa in newly revamped Cuppage Terrace, Hibiki (one of two branches opened by Apex-Pal International) is tasteful and minimalist Japanese in terms of layout and style. Beige wood paneling, leather-upholstered seating and simple lines create a soothing atmosphere. <br><strong>The scene: </strong>The feel is sleek, toned-down izakaya. Whether dining or just sipping a cool beverage, this is a place to get some quality chill time.<br><strong>The crowd: </strong>It can be quite corporate but being just off Orchard, tourists and expats frequent the place often as well. <br><strong>The spread: </strong>This restaurant has an à la carte buffet which comprises a menu which includes all the usual suspects (sushi, noodles, tempura, sumiyaki) and that is available for groups of four or more. Come with a big appetite as portions are far from skimpy. Start off with the green salad with citrus-miso dressing, a platter sashimi and California maki (a bit mayo heavy). Next, treat your taste buds to some deeper flavors, such as the light and crispy assorted vegetable tempura and the grilled bacon wrapped cherry tomato, baby asparagus and enoki mushroom sumimaki skewers. <br><strong>The damage:</strong> For Japanese food, $20.90 for lunch and $26.90 for dinner isn’t too shabby. Something else we love is Hibiki’s fee for food wastage. If you’ve eaten at Sakae Sushi or any of Apex-Internationals restaurants before, this is not news to you. At $5 per 100 grams wasted food, it definitely helps stop your eyes getting bigger than your stomach. <br><strong>Perfect for: </strong>Those looking for a stellar place to chill after hours with workmates. You can start inside with a meal and then move it out for your evening drinks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>MELT the World Cafe <br>4/F, The Mandarin Oriental Singapore, 5 Raffles Ave., 6885-3082.</strong><br><strong>The setting: </strong>The vibrant, dramatic setting conveys the idea of dining as theater as the chefs display their skills at live stations. <br><strong>The scene: </strong>With rich colors and exotic decor, the café has a stylish and cosmopolitan look. <br><strong>The crowd: </strong>The café is a hit with working professionals for weekday lunches, but come evening and weekends, the place is popular with families. There’s a kids’ room furnished with toys and a special buffet for families with young children.<br><strong>The spread: </strong>True to its concept of being a melting pot of international cuisines, the café offers an eclectic array of food from various cultures, such as premium sushi from Japan, tandooris from India and seafood from Thailand. The dessert selection is undoubtedly the best part, and you will feel like you’re literally lost in a candy store as you browse sweets and goodies that are to-die-for. With delectable options like the chocolate pudding with a warm gooey center and freshly-made waffles topped with ice-cream, chantilly cream and fresh jams, you will be utterly spoiled for choice. <br><strong>The damage: </strong>The priciest of the lot, lunch here will set you back $54. Dinner is priced at $65 from Sun-Wed, and $70 from Thu-Sat. <br>Perfect for: Working professionals looking to pack in an exciting lunch.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Oscar’s Café &amp; Terrace<br>G/F, Conrad Centennial Singapore, 2 Temasek Blvd., 6432-7481. </strong><br><strong>The setting: </strong>Pristine and tastefully furnished, the café has an indoor and alfresco dining area. <br><strong>The scene: </strong>Decorated with a contemporary feel, the café is tranquil and elegant.<br><strong>The crowd: </strong>The café is popular with business associates. On weekends, it also attracts families and yuppies looking for long conversations and great food. <br><strong>The spread: </strong>With the kitchen helmed by award-winning chefs, the café’s unique international menu wows with its sheer variety. Just the salad bar alone offers up to 30 salads, with an equally wide array of condiments. Try the Caesar salad that is specially mixed for you in a barrel of cheese for added flavor, and whet your appetite with numerous quality cheeses. Head on to the crustacean station for fresh Boston lobsters and Sri Lankan crab; then chow down on the international main courses. A must-try is the soup and noodle bar that offers a selection of tasty Asian broths like tom yum, bah kut teh and prawn noodle soup—with a wide variety of noodles and condiments to choose from. Lastly, no self-respecting dessert fan should give the dessert bar a miss. Featuring authentic cookies from around the world and a mind-boggling array of pastries, ice-cream, sweets and tapas-style desserts, you won’t know where to begin. There is even a “Hot-Iron” station with chefs on hand to prepare delectable waffles and crumpets. For those looking for a truly indulgent weekend, try Oscar’s Amazing Graze Sunday Brunch, which offers free flow champagne while local sensation Maya Nova serenades you with soothing jazz hits.<br><strong>The damage: </strong>Prices are average by buffet standards. Lunch is priced at $45 from Mon-Sat. Dinner costs $53 from Sun-Wed; and $65 from Thu-Sat. The Amazing Graze Sunday Brunch comes up to $138. <br><strong>Perfect for: </strong>Business associates looking to close deals over power lunches in an elegant setting or those looking for a reprieve from the mad rush of lunch hour. It’s also an ideal for gatherings with family and friends on weekends.</span></p>
