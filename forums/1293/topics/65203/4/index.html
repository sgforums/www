            <div class='col-md body'>Well,if you are playing Final Fantasy 8 on your PC,then you dont need to get the savegame file on ur memcard or vice-versa.Just copy the savegame file in your install/emu directory,where there should be a folder named "save" or Memory Card" or something like that.Then,start the game and you should be able to load a game,directly in the debug room (playstation) or in ultimecia's castle (PC version).Its just a matter of logics.All you need is some knowledge in coding and conversion of files.Not that hard,i might say.Dont forget that you can always get help by asking me or anyone else.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U cant.At least not until u posess a special piece of hardware.U will have to download a emu and then play the game on ur PC (if u have a DVD-rom).DVD-Rom drives are required for DVD-based PS2 games.The hard thing will be finding the approporiate BIOS file.U cant download BIOS files unless u own a playstation/PS2 console legally.Failure to do so will cause severe civil penalities,bla-bla bla and all that legal stuff...Its easier to download a ordinary PSX emu with some BIOS files,though.I hope it has been of some help. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
