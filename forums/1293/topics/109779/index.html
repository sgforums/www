            <div class='col-md body'>The story takes place two years after the end of Final Fantasy VII. The planet has become a peaceful place, industry and cities seem to be in ruins. However most of the surviving people have been affected by "Star Scar" syndrome (or Seikon-Shoukougun in Japanese).<br><br>Cloud has been living alone, likely having lost those who were his friends and companions in FFVII. He feels some guilt as to what he had done in attempting to save the world.  Was it the right thing to do? Was it all worth it. He feels alone in the world as it is now.<br><br>In the trailers, we see Cloud riding through what looks to be the ruins of Midgar. He is attacked by an unknown attacker with what looks to be some kind of energy kind of weapon. A sword fight takes place between Cloud and this unknown enemy. The enemy has silver hair (although shorter than Sephiroth's) and wears tight black clothing.<br><br>We also see this unknown enemy bowing down to a person shrouded in a white sheet or cape from head to toe. He reaches out to take his hand and bows before him. A flashback of Sephiroth then appears on the screen.  Is there some kind of relationship here?</div>

We come to this conclusion as Square-Enix has listed him under the characters section of the official site.<br><br><img src="http://www.adventchildren.net/ff7ac/movie/images/char-enemy.jpg"><br><br>Kadaj<br>Role in FFVII: Not in game<br>Role in Movie: Main character [Enemy], Leader of Silver Haired Men<br>One of the three Silver Haired Men [SHM]. He is in opposition to Cloud and appears to be the leader of the group. Nomura has said that the story will begin to revolve around the SHM. It has been noted that he bares a striking resemblance to Sephiroth. He uses a weapon which has been confirmed as being a refined double sword and has exceptional sword skills.<br><br><img src="http://www.adventchildren.net/ff7ac/movie/images/char-loz.jpg"><br><br>Loz<br>Role in FFVII: Not in game<br>Role in movie: Main Character (Enemy)<br>One of the three SHM, although the oldest of the group, he is a crybaby. His combat skills have been noted for his fight in the trailer with Cloud, and he has an extremely fast attack. He uses a weapon called "Dual Hound" which is both a shield and a gun.<br><br><img src="http://www.adventchildren.net/ff7ac/movie/images/char-yazoo.jpg"><br><br>Yazoo<br>Role in FFVII: Not in game<br>Role in movie: Main Character (Enemy)<br>Another of the SHM, however, as with all of them, little is known about what role he will play in the movie. His weapon appears to be a kind of gunblade, and is most likely the weapon confirmed to have the name "Velvet Nightmare".</div>
