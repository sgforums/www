            <div class='col-md body'>To mend a broken heart?<br><br>Well, understand the cause of the prob. and accept it as a reality.<br><br>If your heart is broken due to being dumped, understand that if you have done something wrong, amend it.  If you did not and someone left you for another, then accept the facts, be strong and move on.<br><br>If your heart is broken due to being betrayed, learn to forgive and move on.  Being angry and thinking of revenge will get you nowhere.<br><br>If your heart is broken due to death of someone, well, the late person won't want you to be living in misery.. so move on and lead a better life.<br><br>Ultimately, you will need to give yourself the following..<br>1. Chances,<br>2. Time,<br>3. Motivation.<br></div>
