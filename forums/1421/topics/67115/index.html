            <div class='col-md body'><br>this morning i took a piece of ham from the fridge to eat because i was waiting for my mum to be ready to either cook or buy breakfast but i noticed it tasted funny and looked at the expiry date, it was expired. so i threw back the back in a hurry to spit the piece of ham and rinsed my mouth. i told told them clearly and loudly that the ham is expired. but my ultra intelligent mum said it was ok to eat. expired by 4 days u tell me it's ok?<br>my mum cooked something for breakfast for anyone to eat. because i didnt ask her to add an egg to my noodles, i took a piece of ham from that plate which she claims that is cooked only a few minutes ago. i didnt know where the ham came from and i ate it.<br>now, i got this bad discomfort in my stomach and my abdomen.<br><br>i went down and asked her did she use the ham from the pack in the fridge and she said yes and i pointed out the date to her and still had the cheek to tell me it's ok to eat. i argued back saying that there's something called an expiry date and a very good reason why ppl find ways and means to determine the expiry date of a certain product. even though u cook it and kill all the bacteria, there's something called heat-stable toxins<br><br>then my dad told me to shut up, when i am clearly the vic here. my mum still can tell me " the sausage is ok right " for all u know her hands are dirty.<br>oh...i am the vic here and my dad tells me to shut up. when someone else is in the wrong. then he shouts at me and keep mentioning abt my studies.whenever he wants to scold me, he no matter what will mention whatever things i cock up since the day i was born. from PSLE, o levels to 3mins before time of incident.<br><br>why not look at the mirror, DAD? if i am a failure, so are u DAD!<br><br>till now whenever we have a fight, he ends it all with my refusal to study medicine. yet he is the same clown who persisted in forcing me into this course i am in now.<br><br>what a loser.</div>
