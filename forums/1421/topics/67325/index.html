            <div class='col-md body'>today during a 2 hr break i went to take photos for a hongpao event for SP then, we were almost considered to be official photographers though there were no shortage of cameras.<br>after most had taken a bite at the yusheng, my friends and i wanted to take a bite also since there were loads of it left and so many ppl had left already.<br>then this guy came up to me, introduced himself as a staff frm the corporate comms, asked me and i told him i was taking photos under the photo club and he wanted my photos, almost to the extent of demanding it. then another lady came up and told me that they needed the photos today or something to publish it....blah blah blah...then he gave all sorts of reasons and suggested that i give him the memory card today and he pass it to me tmr or i follow him and wait for him to upload then give the card to me, which i refused because i do have a class now. i told him that i dun want to be disturbed during a class. he kept insisting and called in a coordinator b/w cca clubs and the sch and she asked me whether i was under this guy, which is my club's president. i eventually gave in and pass him my card after getting that guy's namecard.<br><br>my club president apologised to me when i was abt to leave and he said the ppl are like this. i told him that it's ok that they want the photos or anyone but it's the way they ask for it that i am very unhappy with because it affects my lessons.<br><br>later i got a missed call frm him and i called back and he asked me whether this lecture theatre is at this block. (duhz...he is a staff for heaven's sake, even a year1 student knows it). when i opened the door for that LT i saw him and he abit like still want to talk using the phone though we can see each other...not to mention can hear his voice.<br><br>i was damn pissed with this clown. he thinks he is frm corp comms he tua kee,his attitude damn arrogant, when he doesnt get what he wants, he calls in another staff then calls in a coordinator for the clubs. well frm the start i have nothing aganist passing the photos to them or surrendering the card to them because they organised the event, so they had the rights to it, naturally. nabez...feel like giving them a piece of my mind... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br></div>
