            <div class='col-md body'>sigh. if i were u, i'd rather go solo than group with her. I wouldn't bother if she had a group or not. Even if I die trying to finish my assignment, cos like you, I'd rather do the work myself, bear any consequences myself, than have a group member whom u have to worry about [whether she has work to do since she's a member, or whether she's doing it well enough].............  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
