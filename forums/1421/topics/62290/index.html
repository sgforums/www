            <div class='col-md body'>day 1 woke up late on that day because got a welcome meal at 1030.<br>had some finger food then we were whisked off to some place to meet up with a prof at a LT<br><br>then i attended this freaking lecture where i couldnt understand a freaking thing at all. anyway since i didnt have enuf sleep last night. so i had diff in staying up in the lecture while that guy was talking. but i saw this girl beside me who seemed to understand.<br><br>then we did this prac on proteins etc. a third year student came to help out and she like quite pretty leh.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> i couldnt understand what the hell was going on. waht are we testing and waht are we doing i also dunno what talking her.<br>then made our way back<br><br>......oh dear....forgot what happened liao....<br><br>Wednesday<br>Slept late into the damn day because we only have to be in the sch at 1pm for some crappy industry visit. Had some bread splattered with spread cheese which was niceÂ…The visit was super duper boring. Started with this presentation of the research centre we were visiting then he brought us ard talking abt all the equipment and facilities that were used for research. Along the way he told us some of the methods they used to make milk powder from liquid milk and how they processed meat to make it tender instead of adding papaya juice as a meat tenderizer as an alternative because ppl wanted food to be as natural as possible. There was this part of the research centre that was interesting. Within the centre, it is place where volunteers and some paid staff did food tasting and gave comments abt the taste,etc. I was still abit tired and yawning away when suddenly the word Â“chocolateÂ” was mentioned I perked up and almost volunteer myself for the chocolate taste testing.<br>Was told we cant bring a cam but funny thing is the rest of them brought cameras and took grp pics at the end of the trip.<br><br>Was damn hungry after the damn trip. Then after we went back to the damn apartment,was figuring where to buy dinner. Ended up going to mekong for a second round. This time round tried the beef with loads of chili. Damn shiok !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Thursday<br>Did this damn boring prac again. Then finally did something I understood. Plotting the results of the enzyme assay and determining some values for the prac. This part I understood because I did it before.<br>FinallyÂ…Â….<br>1 thing is that the whole prac thing was actually an experiment on us for their 3rd students, this was an untested approach or something, so they wanted some feedback from us.<br>BleahxÂ….finally itÂ’s over.<br>Oh godÂ…Â…time really passesÂ…..end of 2nd week liaoz.<br>Coming closer and closer to my results dayÂ…<br>Hope I donÂ’t failÂ….fuckÂ…..<br><br></div>
