            <div class='col-md body'>The most significant growth in international tourism took place after 1945, when the second World War ended. The growth, accompanied by changing patterns of leisure are shaped largely by factors such as the development of a structured travel industry, technological innovations in transport and communications, economic and political stability and the ease and fashionability of foreign tourism.<br><br>International tourism is largely dominated by Western Europe as both a receiving and generating region. A mere 10 European cities generates 60% of visitor arrivals, 50% of visitor receipts and 33% of global receipts. This is due to a number of reasons. For example, it has been an old tradition of Europeans to travel within the domestic region. This firm foundation propels international tourism as domestic tourism easily translates into international tourism. Also, as tourism has been active for a long time, there is the presence of a mature and developed tourism infrastructure such as transportation links and extensive provision of tourist accommodation. These greatly increase the ease of travelling, hence making Europe an attractive destination for tourists. Europe has a wealth of attractions. It has a rich historic and cultural heritage and tourists might desire to visit Europe for the ancient castles, for example, it has. There are also mountainous regions like the Alps that tourists visit for activities such as skiing. The range of climate favors both summer and winter tourism. This brings about an almost constant flow of tourists all year round.<br><br>In Europe itself, movement is largely north-south as tourists from the urban-industrial areas in cooler northern parts travel to the warmer Mediterranean south of, for example, France, Italy and Spain. Other flows of tourists within Europe include flows to the mountainous regions and all-season flows to major European cities for cultural, historial and business purposes.<br><br>While Europe dominates international tourism, there have been significant shifts in the choice of locations favored by international tourists away from the established tourism regions of Europe and the North America. This is especially since the 1980s, due to the shift of the manufacturing sectors to newly-industrialized countries, which brings about internal developments in the countries. The most dramatic expansion of tourism is found in East Asia and the Pacific, especially in places like Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore.<br><br>In conclusion, while Europe dominates international tourism at the moment, there is the potential of Asia and the Pacific region emerging as the new centres of tourism.<br></div>
