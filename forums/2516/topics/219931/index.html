            <div class='col-md body'>1 - He buys take Viagra in JB and takes one a few days later<br>2 - Does not realise it contains Ice and is arrested at Customs<br>3 - Wife is shocked when he calls her and says...<br><br>SHE found out that her husband had been taking Viagra only when he called her from jail.<br><br>Mr Lee Voot Seong, 51, had erectile dysfunction since 2003 but had kept it from his wife.<br><br>Mr Lee was also in financial difficulties and could no longer afford to buy Viagra.<br><br>So when he found a box of 'Indian Viagra' pills sold by street peddlers in Johor Baru in April, he grabbed it.<br><br>They cost him RM$20 ($8.50) for four.<br><br>Said Mr Lee: 'I saw it and I thought 'Wah, so cheap'. I didn't think about the side effects or if it's real. I just wanted to save some money.'<br><br>Unfortunately for him, not only were they fake, they contained the methamphetamine Ice, a controlled drug here.<br><br>A few days later, he took a pill before heading to Johor to make some deliveries. He was arrested at the Causeway on his return trip.<br><br>His wife, Madam Hazeline Lau, 50, described how she felt when the call came from Jurong Police Station, asking her to post bail for him that night.<br><br>'I didn't know how to react at first. I was angry because he kept the truth from me. I asked him 'Why did you want to take that medicine?'<br><br>'But on the other hand, it was more important that I bail him out first,' Madam Lau said in Mandarin.<br><br>Luckily for Mr Lee, his ordeal ended yesterday when he was acquitted of consuming the drug.<br><br>Their children, an 18-year-old and 16-year-old twins, had been kept in the dark about the whole affair.<br><br>Said Madam Lau: 'We didn't want anyone to know, especially the children. We didn't want them to worry.'<br><br><strong>GUY'S PROBLEM</strong><br><br>Mr Lee said he kept his medical condition from his wife because 'it was a guy's problem' and he didn't want her to worry.<br><br>The couple currently run a small home spa business.<br><br>Mr Lee said the family is in dire financial difficulties. He and his wife are both bankrupt.<br><br>He applied to the Law Society and was granted free legal aid to defend him against the charge.<br><br>But life was not always like this, said Mr Lee, a Malaysian who has been living here for more than 30 years and is a Singapore Permanent Resident.<br><br>He and his wife owned a profitable construction company for more than 20 years. It closed down two years ago due to financial problems.<br><br>The family used to live the high life when the company was at its peak in the late 1990s.<br><br>The company had more than 200 employees, some of whom were paid six-month bonuses and lavished with gifts of Rolex watches and company cars.<br><br>Back then, the family owned a number of properties, including two condo apartments, a semi-detached house, a three-storey terrace house and an HDB flat.<br><br>The children were chauffeured in new Mercedes and Jaguar cars.<br><br>Said Mr Lee in Mandarin: 'We were living like millionaires. My biggest indulgence was cars. I like Mercedes cars and used to change cars every four to five years.'<br><br>Back then, their combined monthly income was over $20,000.<br><br><strong>BANKRUPT</strong><br><br>Then the company suffered a severe downturn and the couple were declared bankrupt.<br><br>Their houses and cars were seized by the bank and the family downgraded to a four-room HDB flat in Woodlands, in which they still live.<br><br>To make matters worse, one of his twin sons needed a bone marrow transplant last year.<br><br>The medical bills came to about $100,000 and the family still owes<br>KK Hospital about $40,000 for the transplant.<br><br>The family's spa business brings in a few thousand dollars a month now, depending on, and they get by.<br><br>But Mr Lee has learnt one lesson - never buy medicine from the streets.<br><br>He said: 'I think I've gone through enough. I wouldn't buy from the street peddlers even if you point a gun at me. I think I'll steer clear of Viagra from now.'<br><br></div>
