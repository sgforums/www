              <p>These four drugs aren’t on Singapore’s official list of banned drugs, 
              but they are just as harmful. By Kurt Ganapathy and 
              Ramesh William.</p>
              <p>Go on, admit it. If you were in club a year ago and someone rocked up to ask 
              if you’d like some meow-meow, you would have thought him stark raving bonkers 
              for wanting to palm off a kitty cat in the middle of the dance floor. <br>But 
              late last year, things began to change. The mention of meow-meow—M-Cat to those 
              in-the-know—elicited excited glints in the eyes of those in the know. The street 
              name for the party drug known as mephedrone, this is fast becoming a clubber’s 
              new legal high. And the reason this harmful narcotic continues not to run afoul 
              of Singapore’s infamously stringent drug laws is down to a technicality—the 
              authorities here have it classified as a “plant food.” This makes it legit to 
              possess, sell and consume the substance. But be warned: The effects of 
              mephedrone are just as harmful as other banned drugs like cocaine and heroin. 
              Already, several deaths have occurred in Europe through its use. Germany, Sweden 
              and, just a fortnight ago, the UK, have all placed it under their list of banned 
              substances. <br>With Singapore’s tough stance on drugs, mephedrone is likely to 
              be reclassified in the near future—count on that. But the “mephedrone episode” 
              in Singapore shows how potentially lethal substances can slip through the 
              cracks—most here buy it off The internet, where it’s all too easily 
              available—and fly under the radar, with the authorities none the wiser. We give 
              you the lowdown on the sly M-Cat and a few other “drugs” that aren’t under the 
              list of banned drugs here. Remember, just because it’s legal doesn’t mean it’s 
              safe or that its use is condoned.</p>
              <h3><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/505/meph(1).jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">Mephedrone</strong></h3>
              <p>a.k.a. meow-meow, M-Cat, meph, bubbles</p>
              <p><strong>What</strong>: Synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine and 
              cathinone class of drugs. A white, powdery substance which also comes in 
              capsules, crystals or in liquid form, such versatility allows it be packaged in 
              many ways and sold as innocuous items like money-plant fertilizers and bath 
              salts (swim in that, sucker). According to reports, until recently it was sold 
              alongside mints and chocolates at the counters of newsagents in the UK. Sold on 
              the Internet—most originates from the UK, where it’s acquired from Chinese 
              sources in bulk. Sold for $30-$45 a gram in Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong>Taken because</strong>: An alternative to cocaine and ecstasy, this 
              drug reportedly induces euphoria, excitement and a state of openness. So look 
              out for erstwhile science lab buddies who were nerds two days ago and suddenly 
              can’t get enough of boogeying and chasing tail like the next Daniel Craig.</p>
              <p><strong>Taken how</strong>: Snorting it after you’ve arranged it in neat, 
              preferably parallel, lines. Drink it—the extra suicidal among you can put it in 
              energy drinks. Or wrap it in a piece of paper and swallow it. Now, most of us 
              have eaten cardboard in the bad old broke days of college life, but this is 
              ridiculous.</p>
              <p><strong>Why so serious</strong>: You could die. It may also cause 
              palpitations, blood vessel constriction, fits, nasty nose bleeds, teeth grinding 
              and trismus, which dear friends, is the inability to open one’s mouth. Still 
              sounds like a party drug to you? Nope, didn’t think so. Meph also turns your 
              fingers blue, which, unless you’re a member of the Blue Man Group, you should 
              have no business having. Also induces paranoia—please, like we need more 
              paranoid Singaporeans.</p>
              <p><strong>Banned in</strong>: Germany, Scandinavia, the UK and Israel, to name 
              a few.</p>
              <p><strong>Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) says</strong>: “Our current assessment 
              is that there is no widespread abuse of the drug Mephedrone here in Singapore. 
              Nonetheless, CNB is monitoring the situation closely and is studying the 
              possibility of listing mephedrone as a controlled drug.”</p>
              <h3><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/505/salvia.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="right">Salvia </strong></h3>
              <p>a.k.a. Diviner’s Sage, SCE, Salvia Extract, Sally-D</p>
              <p><strong>What</strong>: Part of the sage and mint family, the salvia 
              divinorum, to quote its full name, has been around for a long while. The Aztecs 
              have long been aware of it state-altering effects and its hallucinogenic effects 
              are among the strongest from a naturally occurring herb—stronger than even 
              cannabis, apparently. Like meph, this is also easily available online and its 
              price is seasonal.</p>
              <p><strong>Taken because</strong>: People want to tune out and use this as an 
              alternative to marijuana and hashish. Symptoms of highness include wavy walls 
              and blurry patterns—so you can rule this out as a clubbers’ drug because you 
              might just lose the plot if you come into contact with a disco ball in this 
              state.</p>
              <p><strong>Taken how</strong>: Smoked from a pipe.</p>
              <p><strong>Why so serious</strong>: The headaches are a killer. There is 
              long-term vision disability—in other words, you can get all Stevie Wonder and 
              shake your head rueing what an idiot you’ve been. Also known to cause cold 
              sweats and chills, and also excessive drooling. We think we speak for all when 
              we say, “Eww, yuck!”</p>
              <p><strong>Banned in</strong>: Australia, Belgium, Colorado, Croatia, Denmark, 
              Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden have controls on the drug—from a total 
              ban to a medical-use-only restriction.</p>
              <p><strong>CNB says</strong>: “(A) salvia divinorium (case) was first detected 
              in Singapore in 2003. We would like to highlight that it was a single and 
              isolated seizure detected by the CNB. There have been no such cases since.”</p>
              <h3><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/505/kava.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">Kava</strong></h3>
              <p>a.k.a. Kava-kava, piper methysticum, Kava Root, sakau</p>
              <p><strong>What</strong>: Popular in the South Pacific, where it is found as a 
              shrub. The root is where the “prized stuff” is and it is ground into a powder 
              form and then made into capsules, teas, drinks and various liquid extracts. 
              While the science of its “badness” isn’t clearly fleshed out, it is thought that 
              Kava messes around with the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain which 
              affects the blood. Its proponents claim it as an excellent antidote to anxiety 
              and insomnia—it’s claimed you’ll sleep like a baby upon drinking it. In Fiji, 
              it’s like a form of alcohol and used in ceremonies and official functions—the 
              country is dotted with “grog shops” selling the substance. In recent years, the 
              abuse of Kava has gotten so out of hand that Fiji’s President has told citizens 
              to “spend more time with the family, and less with Kava.” A packet of kava root 
              powder can be bought off the internet for about $45 a pound.</p>
              <p><strong>Taken because</strong>: It relieves stress and anxiety, making it a 
              very popular relaxant. Plus if you’re struggling for a good night’s sleep, this 
              thing will knock you out faster than a Manny the Pacman’s punch. So if you’re 
              thinking of taking it and heading for the clubs, don’t. You’ll feel relaxed 
              alright, but after a while you might find yourself snoozing under the DJ 
              console.</p>
              <p><strong>Taken how</strong>: Can take the form of pill supplements. The 
              powdered form can be consumed by running water through a cloth sieve.</p>
              <p><strong>Why so serious</strong>: Has subtle psychoactive properties; rashes 
              are another mild side-effect. The other extremely dangerous side-effect concerns 
              the liver, where prolonged or “over-enthusiastic” use is known to cause liver 
              damage—including cirrhosis, hepatitis and organ failure.</p>
              <p><strong>Banned in</strong>: France, Netherlands and Switzerland.</p>
              <p><strong>CNB says</strong>: “Kava is not listed on the Misuse of Drugs Act, 
              but the Health Sciences Authority lists it as a poison under the Poisons 
              Act.”</p>
              <h3><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/505/kratom.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="right">Kratom</strong></h3>
              <p>a.k.a. thang, kakuam, thom, ketum, biak</p>
              <p><strong>What</strong>: A native tree to the region, the leaves are where 
              you’ll find herbal stimulant properties. It has many medicinal properties (plugs 
              diarrhea pretty well, according to fans, and is a reliable painkiller) and is 
              also used recreationally.</p>
              <p><strong>Taken because</strong>: Users like its effects. This is fast gaining 
              popularity with clubbers here because it makes one alert, full of energy, 
              talkative and sociable, even boosting one’s sexual energy and endurance. Reports 
              and anecdotal evidence also suggest it to be a suitable accompaniment to 
              music—with people experiencing a euphoric state of “waking-dreaming” when they 
              kill off the lights in their room, lie on their bed and listen to their favorite 
              album.</p>
              <p><strong>Taken how</strong>: Boiling the leaves and making it into a tea. 
              Chewing is also popular. But most crush the leaves into a powder and consume 
              it.</p>
              <p><strong>Why so serious</strong>: Occasional users won’t find too much to be 
              concerned with but frequent users can experience severe weight loss, muscle 
              aches, muscle tics and diarrhea. And it’s a hard habit to break—so you start 
              using this at your peril.</p>
              <p><strong>Banned in</strong>: Controlled substance in Australia, Bhutan, Burma, 
              Finland, Denmark, Poland, Lithuania, Malaysia and Thailand.</p>
              <p><strong>CNB says</strong>: “Kratom is not listed on the Misuse of Drugs Act. 
              Many factors must be considered before going through the legislative process of 
              banning a substance.”</p>
              <p><strong>A spokesman for the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) had this to say 
              about banned substances:</strong><br>“The CNB watches closely the drug abuse 
              situation and developments both locally and overseas. The CNB will list abused 
              substances in the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) when it assesses that there is a 
              need to do so. However the decision is not lightly taken, as we need to assess 
              the possible impact on its legitimate<br>uses. In general, Singapore is guided 
              by the recommendations of the United Nations drug conventions. The extent of 
              abuse and impact of a substance in<br>Singapore is also taken into consideration 
              in deciding whether to list any substances as a controlled drug.”</p>
              <h3>Hands Up, Suckers! BANNED</h3>
              <p><strong>Drugs That The Law Caught Up With.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/505/subutex.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">S</strong><strong>ubutex (Buprenorphine)</strong> – Originally used to 
              treat opioid addictions, drug abusers soon discovered that Subutex itself could 
              be used to get high. To get their highs, abusers began taking Subutex with other 
              prescription medication, or they simply injected a form of the pill directly 
              into their veins. When Subutex is administered intravenously, it can clog 
              arteries and cause breathing difficulties. When a syringe is used to deliver 
              drugs, it is often shared, creating the risk of HIV and hepatitis 
              transmission.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Subutex was listed as a Class A Controlled Drug in 2006. </em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/505/erimin.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="right">Erimin 5 (Nimetazepam)</strong> – Once prescribed to patients suffering 
              from insomnia, the depressant Erimin 5 quickly became used as more than just a 
              sleeping pill. Touted as Ecstasy without the side effects, when abused, it 
              affects judgment, causes memory deterioration, and diminishes motor skills. 
              Abusers often combine it with other “harder” drugs, putting themselves in danger 
              of an overdose.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Erimin 5 was listed as a Class A Controlled Drug in 
              1992.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/505/ecstacy.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">Ecstasy (MDMA)</strong> – Due to its effects of opening people up to 
              intimacy while numbing their feelings of fear, stress and depression, Ecstasy 
              was originally used in psychotherapy. Ecstasy is one of the most heavily used 
              recreational drugs, and during the high, “good” qualities become amplified, 
              while “bad” qualities are suppressed. It is during the “come down” phase that 
              the problems start. Ecstasy can damage the central nervous system, and fatal 
              overdoses are not uncommon.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Ecstasy was made illegal in the mid 1980s. </strong></em></p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/505/LSD.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="right">LSD 
              (Lysergide)</strong> – Also known as Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds; the symbol 
              of 1960s culture, and the “inspiration” of countless songs, poems, and works of 
              art. First synthesized in 1938 from fungus, LSD was initially tested for various 
              potential medical uses. Administered through a blotting paper placed under the 
              tongue, LSD causes wild hallucinations, or “trips,” as users like to call them. 
              These trips can easily go wrong, and bad trips cause paranoia and panic.</p>
              <p><em><strong>LSD has been illegal for more than 40 years. </strong></em></p>
              <h3>Drugs you say?</h3>
              <p><strong>Yes, these are too. </strong></p>

              oldest vice, it’s a depressant and it affects the receptors for neuronal 
              activity. The result is reduced attention, slowed reaction, slurred speech and 
              clumsiness, otherwise known as drunkenness.<br><strong>The dirt</strong>: 
              Ethanol stimulates the production of insulin, which lowers the blood-sugar 
              level, making people irritable and that may lead to…yes, 
              fights!<br><strong>Fatal OD</strong>: Yes you can overdose on it, but the lowest 
              recorded lethal dose is around 20 shots of spirits for a person weighing 100kg, 
              as the vomit-reflex is normally triggered before dangerous levels are reached. 
              <br><strong>Fun fact</strong>: Michael Jackson, the renowned liquorologist, not 
              the Moonwalker, suggested based on archeological evidence that the drink 
              consumed at The Last Supper was not wine, but beer.</p>

              spiders lose their ability to build webs.<br><strong>The dirt</strong>: Caffeine 
              stimulates the central nervous system, warding off drowsiness by occupying the 
              receptors for adenosine (the body’s sleep promoter). Tolerance can be built up, 
              and long-term use can result in caffeinism, a caffeine dependency. 
              <br><strong>Fatal OD</strong>: A fatal overdose of caffeine is possible, but 
              only if you drink 80-100 cups of coffee within a short time. Another thing worth 
              noting, caffeine relaxes the sphincter muscles; so if you’ve begun to “hang 
              loose” lately, go for decaf. <br><strong>Fun fact</strong>: Caffeine was 
              discovered in 1819—the same year Singapore was founded.</p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/505/cigarettes.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">Nicotine </strong><br>Millions of people puff away daily to get their 
              nicotine fix. Nicotine is a stimulant, and like caffeine, it occurs naturally as 
              a pesticide.<br><strong>The dirt</strong>: Each cigarette contains about 1mg of 
              nicotine. Nicotine’s addictive characteristics are akin to that of cocaine or 
              heroin, which explains why smoking can be a difficult habit to kick. It works by 
              raising the levels of certain neurotransmitters and hormones in your system. 
              This produces the feelings of relaxation, euphoria, calmness and alertness 
              associated with smoking.<br><strong>Fatal OD</strong>: Your mouth is only so 
              big, so there’s a limit to how many cigarettes you can smoke in one go. But even 
              if you chain-smoke continuously for days, you won’t die. However, cancer and 
              heart disease will creep on to you after a while—just you wait. <br><strong>Fun 
              fac</strong><strong>t</strong>: Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew was once a heavy 
              smoker. He said in a dialogue at the Silver Industry Conference and Exhibition 
              in 2008 that he would puff 10 cigarettes offstage before making campaign 
              speeches during the election trail in the 1950s. He kicked the habit soon 
              after.</p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/505/betel1.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="right">Betel Nut </strong><br>This traditional chewable is made from the seed 
              of the areca palm, wrapped in a betel leaf with various 
              flavorings.<br><strong>The dirt</strong>: It tastes mildly spicy, warms up the 
              body, and the alkaloid arecoline stimulates the central nervous system, giving 
              higher levels of alertness. Its effect is comparable to caffeine or nicotine. 
              Although not really addictive on its own, tobacco leaves are sometimes added to 
              the mix, heightening dependency.<br><strong>Fatal OD</strong>: Betel nut is 
              known to have carcinogenic properties, and regular consumption raises the risk 
              of developing oral cancers. Most people prefer to leave this one to the older 
              generations, as the thought of walking around spitting everywhere isn’t very 
              attractive. <br><strong>Fun fact</strong>: Great for fighting bad breath. You 
              might have a red mouth, but hey you’ll still get to kiss the girl!</p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/505/nitrous-oxide.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="230" height="200" align="left">Nitrous Oxide </strong><br>Better known as laughing gas, nitrous oxide 
              is a common anesthetic used in many dental and surgical procedures. 
              <br><strong>The dirt</strong>: Its recreational use predates its medical value, 
              and today it is still used for the euphoria and mild hallucination it causes. 
              While only certified people have access to pure nitrous oxide, recreational 
              users can obtain a form of it from whipped cream canisters, where it is used as 
              a propellant.<br><strong>Fatal OD</strong>: You can die of asphyxiation if 
              exposed to large quantities.<br><strong>Fun fact</strong>: Discovered at the end 
              of the 18th century, the British upper crust used to gather for laughing gas 
              parties where people would inhale the gas and amuse one another with their 
              intoxicated antics.</p>

              <h3>Drug Therapy</h3>
              <p>The Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA) was founded in 1972. It was 
              established to assist in the rehabilitation of drug addicts. SANA counselors 
              Valerie Wong and Cynthia Chng respond to our questions.</p>
              <p><strong>What are some issues that lead people to resort to drug use? 
              <br>Valerie Wong</strong>: There is no single reason why offenders abuse drugs. 
              For some, drugs give them a false sense of security; often addicts also turn to 
              them when they feel stressed or lonely. There are also others who are drawn to 
              drugs out of peer pressure—to appear cool. <br>They are absolutely unaware of 
              the psychological affects of these drugs. They think it is only self harm, and 
              not harming others. But very soon, they’ll be chasing after this very same first 
              high, only to realize they’ll never feel the same way, so the doses get larger 
              and they turn to stronger narcotics.</p>
              <p><strong>Singaporeans have an above average quality of life, and there are 
              harsh penalties against drug use. Is Singapore a unique case? </strong><br><strong>Cynthia Chng</strong>: SANA will not be able to comment on 
              the differences between countries, however, it has been observed in our work 
              that there is a difference in the choice of drugs and substances used by the 
              younger and older drug users. A young(er) person would tend to use cheaper 
              products like glue to get a high but an old(er) person may choose drugs of 
              different types (e.g. heroin, ketamine, etc).</p>
              <p><strong>How do people generally view “legal drugs” (including alcohol, 
              nicotine and uncontrolled intoxicants)? </strong><br><strong>CC</strong>: In our 
              contact with young and old persons who have touched illegal substances 
              (including uncontrolled intoxicants), they generally view legal substances as 
              permissible because the usage of such do not carry with it a penalty.</p>
