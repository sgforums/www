            <div class='col-md body'>HE feels guilty for putting his family through this ordeal.<br>Mr Lionel Rudolf Zupancich, a divorced father of two teenage girls, said: 'They were extremely shocked, especially my family here.<br><br>'It was a good thing my daughters are not living here, because I wouldn't have known how to face them when I was handcuffed.'<br><br>Even his Thai girlfriend of several years, who was living at Oxley Garden with him, was clueless about his dark secret.<br><br>He said his girlfriend came to know of his arrest and the drug habit only when the officers went to search his home.<br><br>The two of them are still close, although she is now back in Thailand.<br><br>On the day he was arrested, Mr Zupancich was supposed to meet his sister and younger brother, Alex, at about 5pm.<br><br>When he didn't show up, they were worried and 'called all the hospitals and even the traffic police to look for me'.<br><br><strong>PRIVATE LIFE </strong><br><br>'At that time, I lived separately from them. So, outside of our family business, I didn't tell them much about my private life. Of course, they didn't know I was doing drugs,' he said.<br><br>'She too, was very worried, and was communicating with my brother. Both were trying to locate me.<br><br>'I felt extremely bad when I was eventually taken home in handcuffs early the next morning.'<br><br>His family paid him fortnightly visits in prison.<br><br>'I apologised to my family and have promised to clean up my act. I forgot about them, about what's important to me.<br><br>'Instead, I chose to chase success and use drugs in the process,' he said.<br><br>Mr Zupancich is now living in his family's Sunshine Plaza residence on Middle Road; it was also where he lived during his six-week home detention period before his release last Tuesday. During home detention, he was still monitored strictly.<br><br>He had to be at work by 9am and by 10.45pm, he had to be home.<br><br>If not, the electronic tag he wore would alert the authorities.<br><br>But when he was released, he got another shock.<br><br>He said: 'Although I had the necessary documents that allowed me to stay here with my family, I was sent for deportation,' he said.<br><br>'I was number 727 in the deportation queue that day. I was to be sent back to Britain for good.'<br><br>He panicked.<br><br>But his family and lawyers came and managed to get an extension while the authorities review my case.<br><br>'I am hoping the result will be favourable and that I can stay. Singapore is my home now.'<br><br>He was afraid that the family's closeness would change with his arrest and conviction.<br><br>'But we are even closer now,' he said.<br><br>Mr Zupancich added: 'The thing that I regret most is that through my arrest, I've dragged my family down with me.<br><br>'The first few hours when I was at the CNB office, I worried not so much for myself, but for the family and our business.'<br><br>He was also anxious to explain things to them, as they were 'totally in the dark about the drugs'.<br><br>QUITS FROM FAMILY BUSINESS<br><br>As they were running a business, the family had to distance themselves from Mr Zupancich when it came to their retail affairs.<br><br>'I voluntarily resigned, and the family started proceedings to remove me as a director,' he said.<br><br>'But as a family, I'm very grateful that they stood by me all the way.'<br><br>When Mr Zupancich was released on bail two weeks after his arrest, the family had a big homecoming dinner waiting for him.<br><br>'There was roast lamb, Yorkshire pudding, and all my favourite foods,' he recalled.<br><br>'Mum didn't lecture me and she was calm.'<br><br>But, after she hugged him and fussed over his health, she asked, quite sternly: 'What did you think you were doing?'<br><br>'There is no worse punishment than to know you've hurt your family members,' Mr Zupancich said.<br><br>Unlike many Western families, the Zupancichs live and work together.<br><br>They own a popular jewellery-making school at Sunshine Plaza.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>THE CASE</strong></span><br><br>THE drug bust in which Mr Zupancich was nabbed was one of two high-profile raids in the past two years.<br><br>Fourteen people, most of them foreigners, were arrested in that operation last December.<br><br>The CNB officers received a tip-off around October last year.<br><br>After some surveillance, they swept in and detained the drug users.<br><br>Eleven of the 14 - two Britons, a Japanese, seven Thais and a Singaporean - were charged with offences ranging from drug trafficking and consumption to drug possession.<br><br>Besides Mr Zupancich and ringleader Nipaporn, other expatriates sentenced to jail included Scottish engineer Jason Taylor, 33.<br><br><strong>He was jailed for 11 months for having 0.71g of cocaine.</strong><br><br>Jun Terashima, 45, a Japanese sales director of a pearl wholesaler and one of Mr Zupancich's business associates, was jailed for 10 months.<br><br>He had consumed Ice.<br></div>
