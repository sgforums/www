            <div class='col-md body'>DATA from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) since 2003 show more Chinese addicts being arrested every year than from the other races.<br><br>The figures for the first half of this year are sobering. Of the 446 drug abusers arrested, 74 per cent are Chinese, 17 per cent are Malays and 7 per cent Indians. The rest are from other races. The figures were about the same for the whole of last year.<br><br>Based on CNB data for last year, the typical profile of a synthetic drug abuser in Singapore is a Chinese man in the 20-29 age group.<br><br>He is likely to have primary or secondary education and is likely to be employed as a service, shop or market sales worker.<br><br>Glenn, 29, not his real name, is a typical example of a synthetic drug abuser.<br><br>He is clean-cut, has no tattoos, is soft-spoken and does not have family problems.<br><br>He started abusing drugs at 14. He is on a six-month drug rehabilitation programme at the Christian Care Services Centre.<br><br>He has just completed a five-year prison sentence for consumption of Ketamine. He received one-third remission for good behaviour.<br><br>At 21, he was jailed for three years for consumption of Ecstacy.<br><br>Glenn was introduced to 'goo', a Hokkien slang for marijuana, at a party. At 18, he turned to synthetic drugs such as Ecstacy, Ketamine and Ice.<br><br>Today, he's adamant about quitting. He said he has disappointed his family, especially his mother.<br><br>He said it would help if the Chinese community sees drug addiction as a problem within the community and tackles it head on.<br><br>He said: 'Yes, I think it would (help). To know the horrors that drugs can cause - to hear it in your own language and environment. It might frighten some kids away from taking them.'<br><br>Staff of halfway houses also worry that the classification of Subutex as an illegal substance may mean a comeback for heroin.<br><br>But the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) was quick to add that it has not let up in its fight against heroin trafficking and abuse.<br><br>A spokesman told The Starits Times: 'The supply of heroin remains scarce and there is no evidence so far of a displacement effect from Subutex.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL... majority of Singaporeans are Chinese. They make up a huge portion of Singapore. I won't be surprised at such a percentage. If this percentage is reversed, then it is a cause of concern.</div>
