Like Goverment ground marijuana the G-13  has a THC yield of 40%. Unless broken down chemically and harvested, it is of lliquid form pertaining 100% of the THC.<br><br>The reports not just goverment , official or what.. even the independant research have come to the conclusion that yes , it CAN be addictive, but it is still controlable by th eindividual.
