            <div class='col-md body'>THIS happily-ever-after real-life drama could be a script writer's dream.<br><br>It has all the ingredients for a good TV series - romance, marriage, child, drugs, prison, divorce and finally the happy reunion, which ended in the couple's remarriage last Saturday.<br><br>All in a decade beginning in 1996 when they first married.<br><br>And the dramatis personae: Valaitham Ravi, 35, and Maragatham Murugiah, 32.<br><br><strong>LOVE BLOSSOMS</strong><br><br>The story begins in the early '90s when they were working at the Ministry of Manpower - Mr Valaitham was a cleaner and Ms Maragatham an office assistant.<br><br>Eyes met, sparks flew.<br><br>'I loved her simplicity,' recalled Mr Valaitham.<br><br>They dated for more than two years before marrying in 1996.<br><br><strong>TROUBLED WATERS</strong><br><br>But the bliss didn't last. Within months, they began to drift apart.<br><br>Ms Maragatham said: 'He was always out late with friends. He would drink, take drugs and he wouldn't come home. I got more angry and hurt each day.'<br><br>She knew about his habit before marriage, but she said he had promised to kick it.<br><br>A few months later, he was caught for drug abuse.<br><br>His urine tested positive for drugs, but he was let off with a stern warning.<br><br>But his drug habit continued.<br><br>In 2000, he was caught for intravenous heroin abuse and jailed for a year.<br><br><strong>THE SPLIT</strong><br><br>At the time of his arrest, the couple had a 5-month-old daughter.<br><br>Ms Maragatham decided that enough was enough.<br><br>She said: 'I filed for divorce the day I found out he was arrested. I had given him so many chances and he said that he would change but he didn't.<br><br>'For our daughter, I did what I thought was best.'<br><br>Ms Maragatham, who joined City Gas as a clerk in 1997, and her daughter moved into her mother's flat in Upper Serangoon. The divorce was finalised in 2004.<br><br>She said she did not visit him in prison nor did she see or speak to him since 2000.<br><br>On his imprisonment, Mr Valaitham said: 'It was a chance God had given me to change. I often thought about Mara and my daughter. I realised that taking drugs was all for nothing.'<br><br>After he was released from jail in 2001, he said he only saw his daughter once. He visited her at his mother-in-law's place when Ms Maragatham was out. But he said that the visit was 'too painful', so he did not see her again.<br><br>He said he spent six months in The Ashram, a drug rehabilitation centre in Sembawang.<br><br>He began spending less time with friends, stopped taking drugs and refrained from drinking.<br><br><strong>CHANCE MEETING</strong><br><br>Six years went by. During this time, he did odd jobs to survive and stayed with friends and relatives.<br><br>Then in January this year, they bumped into each other in church.<br><br>Mr Valaitham and Ms Maragatham spoke for the first time in years.<br><br>She said: 'The first time I saw him, I was still angry, but I could tell he had changed.'<br><br>'I was so happy when a friend in church told me that Ravi had said that he wouldn't marry another woman and that he only loves me.'<br><br>They began meeting regularly.<br><br>Ms Maragatham said: 'I've seen a change in Ravi. I've forgiven him and I'm ready for a new start.'<br><br><strong>HAPPY ENDING</strong><br><br>Last Saturday, the couple remarried.<br><br>It was at the wedding that Mr Valaitham saw his daughter for the second time since his imprisonment.<br><br>'It's going to be difficult,' said Mr Valaitham, 'because she doesn't know me. But hopefully time will heal the hurt.'<br></div>
