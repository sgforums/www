            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DRESS CODE: </strong>It is advised that you come to work dressed according to your salary. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">If we see you wearing $750 Prada shoes &amp; carrying a $900 Gucci bag, we assume you are doing well financially and therefore you do not need a raise</span></span>.<br><br><strong>SICK LEAVE: </strong>We will no longer accept a doctor's statement or medical certificate as proof of sickness. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">If you are able to go to the doctor, you are able to come to work.</span></span><br><br><strong>SURGERY: </strong>Operations are now banned. As long as you are an employee here, you need all your organs. You should not consider removing anything. We hired you intact. <span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To have something removed constitutes a breach of your employment contract.</span></span><br><br><strong>PERSONAL LEAVE: </strong>Each employee will receive 104 days of personal leave a year. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">They are called Saturday &amp; Sunday.</span></span><br><br><strong>COMPANY VACATION DAYS: </strong>We are a good company that, on top of your entitlement to 104 days of personal leave a year, allows all employees will take their vacation at the same time every year. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">The company vacation days are as follows: Jan 1 &amp; Dec 25.</span></span><br><br><strong>COMPASSIONATE LEAVE: </strong><span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is no excuse for missing work.</span></span> There is nothing you can do for dead friends, relatives or co-workers. Every effort should be made to have non-employees attend to the arrangements. In rare cases, where employee involvement is necessary, the funeral should be scheduled in the late afternoon, and after work. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">We will be glad to allow you to work through your lunch hour and subsequently leave one hour early, provided your share of the work is done enough.</span></span><br><br><strong>LEAVING BECAUSE OF YOUR OWN DEATH: </strong>This will be accepted as an excuse. However, we require at least two weeks' notice <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">as it is your duty to train your own replacement.</span></span><br><br><strong>RESTROOM USE: </strong>Entirely too much time is being spent in the restroom. In the future, we will follow the practice of going in alphabetical order. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">For instance, all employees whose names begin with 'A will go from 8 to 8:20, employees whose names begin with 'B' will go from 8:20 to 8:40 and on. </span></span>If you're unable to go at your allotted time, it will be necessary to wait until the next day when your turn comes again. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">In extreme emergencies, employees may swap their time with a coworker. However, both employees' supervisors must approve this exchange in writing (and not necessarily on toilet paper).</span></span><br><br><strong>LUNCH BREAKS: </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">Skinny people get an hour for lunch </span></span>as they need to eat more so that they can look healthy, <span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">normal size people get 30 minutes </span></span>for lunch to get a balanced meal to maintain their average figure. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">Fat people get 5 minutes </span></span>for lunch because that's all the time needed to drink a Slim Fast &amp; take a diet pill.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Thank you for your loyalty to our company. We are here to provide a positive employment experience. Have a nice week!</span></strong></div>
