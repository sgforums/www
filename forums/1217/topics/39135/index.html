Their interests are in art, theater, music, and in their own career. Usually they are drawn to people who are intellectually stimulating and they seek a partner who will fit into their realm of life. They prefer to discuss serious subjects, however, will always be there to listen to a problem. People born under this sign appreciate luxury, although, they don't like splurging to make an impression. They feel that money is a serious issue that spells out security. Capricorn's tend to be dominating and are not easy to win over. They also expect to be pursued and not be the pursuers. If you're going on a date with this zodiac, make sure you're prompt. If you say you'll be there at a certain time, be there. They are intolerant to people who say something and do something else. If you have a tendency to let your emotions rule you, then you may want to keep looking for someone else, since the Capricorn can come across as cool and reserved. As they take a common sense approach in almost everything they do, it will be included in their relationship. They want to be cherished, honored, loved and respected. In return, passion will run deep and you will have a loving lasting relationship.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;">Aquarius </span></strong><br><br>If you ever met someone that appeared to be charming, funny, tantalizing, and intelligent, it was probably an Aquarian. They usually live in their own minds, filled with a world of ideas. Although they seem to possess a certain detached quality and may sometimes come across as removed from feelings, they are warm, outgoing, and very<br>concerned with others. These Humanitarians often are wary of emotion and like to deal rationally with life. Optimism is a big part of their nature, along with the knack of friendliness and the mastery of flirtation. If you want to get the Aquarians attention, you will need to intellectually stimulate them. Good conversations, including debates are a favorite past time of the Water Bearer. Open minded, Aquarius can accept criticism and understand others perceptions about things.<br>If you have a problem, they are always willing to listen, though after<br>awhile, enough is enough. Tolerance is a big part of an Aquarians<br>temperament. They are slow to take offense, never jealous and never over emotional. When planning a date with an Aquarius, you don't have to go out of your way to impress them. Just about anything pleases them. From sharing a picnic lunch to a candle lit dinner, Chinese or Mexican, it doesn't matter, as long as variety is on the menu. In time, a relationship can grow, built on trust. Never nag an Aquarius about a mistake. A mistake is unimportant to them, so don't harp on it. If they are constantly told what is wrong, they will begin to feel unappreciated and the relationship can get rocky. In any relationship, the Aquarian may find it hard to give of themselves but will always remain loyal and devoted to a worthy partner. When the Aquarius makes<br>a promise, it's usually never broken. However, if you become demanding, and critical, they may start to wonder elsewhere. They want a partner to share in the adventures, along with the challenges, that life has to offer. Life with them will never be boring.<br></div>

There is a part of them that needs love and security, and then there's the stronger part of them that needs stimulation and novelty. To remain in a relationship with a Gemini you must be able to satisfy their emotional, mental and sexual needs. They love to laugh, travel, spend money, and are eager for new experiences. Since they know a little about many things and almost everything interests them, you can make a great impression by discussing a topic in depth. The Gemini appreciates honesty and sincerity in a person, so make sure you speak your mind, even if you don't share the same point of view. Additionally, don't always stick to one topic of interest, since variety is something they<br>enjoy and find intriguing. These very social and energetic people tend to have a sharp tongue. They are quick to criticize and tend to use words as weapons, so if you're an emotional person that takes things to heart, you may want to avoid this relationship. When in love, they tend to be quite possessive and inclined to be jealous. Never give them reason to suspect that you're not faithful to them, they don't like to be deceived, and won't put up with it. Once a Gemini has found someone that they can trust and that fills all their needs, they will be an exciting and devoted partner.</div>
