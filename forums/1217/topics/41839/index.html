            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>marriage</strong></span><br><br>was instituted in Paradise when man was in innocence (Gen. 2:18-24). Here we<br>have its original charter, which was confirmed by our Lord, as the basis on<br>which all regulations are to be framed (Matt. 19:4, 5). It is evident that<br>monogamy was the original law of marriage (Matt. 19:5; 1 Cor. 6:16). This law<br>was violated in after times, when corrupt usages began to be introduced (Gen.<br>4:19; 6:2). We meet with the prevalence of polygamy and concubinage in the<br>patriarchal age (Gen. 16:1-4; 22:21-24; 28:8, 9; 29:23-30, etc.). Polygamy was<br>acknowledged in the Mosaic law and made the basis of legislation, and continued<br>to be practised all down through the period of Jewish histroy to the Captivity,<br>after which there is no instance of it on record. It seems to have been the<br>practice from the beginning for fathers to select wives for their sons (Gen.<br>24:3; 38:6). Sometimes also proposals were initiated by the father of the<br>maiden (Ex. 2:21). The brothers of the maiden were also sometimes consulted<br>(Gen. 24:51; 34:11), but her own consent was not required. The young man was<br>bound to give a price to the father of the maiden (31:15; 34:12; Ex. 22:16, 17;<br>1 Sam. 18:23, 25; Ruth 4:10; Hos. 3:2) On these patriarchal customs the Mosaic<br>law made no change. In the pre-Mosaic times, when the proposals were accepted<br>and the marriage price given, the bridegroom could come at once and take away<br>his bride to his own house (Gen. 24:63-67). But in general the marriage was<br>celebrated by a feast in the house of the bride's parents, to which all friends<br>were invited (29:22, 27); and on the day of the marriage the bride, concealed<br>under a thick veil, was conducted to her future husband's home. Our Lord<br>corrected many false notions then existing on the subject of marriage (Matt.<br>22:23-30), and placed it as a divine institution on the highest grounds. The<br>apostles state clearly and enforce the nuptial duties of husband and wife (Eph.<br>5:22-33; Col. 3:18, 19; 1 Pet. 3:1-7). Marriage is said to be "honourable"<br>(Heb. 13:4), and the prohibition of it is noted as one of the marks of<br>degenerate times (1 Tim. 4:3). The marriage relation is used to represent the<br>union between God and his people (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:1-14; Hos. 2:9, 20). In the<br>New Testament the same figure is employed in representing the love of Christ to<br>his saints (Eph. 5:25-27). The Church of the redeemed is the "Bride, the Lamb's<br>wife" (Rev. 19:7-9).<br><br>Source: Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from some email thingie... =P<br><br>5 Golden rules for finding  your life partner by Rabbi Dov Heller,A<br>&gt; &gt;relationships coach lays out his 5 golden rules for evaluating the<br>&gt; &gt;prospects of long-term marital success. When it comes to making the<br>&gt; &gt;decision about choosing a life partner, no one wants to make a<br>mistake.<br>&gt; &gt;Yet, with a divorce rate of close to 50 percent, it appears that<br>Many are<br>&gt; &gt;making serious mistakes in their approach to finding Mr./Ms.Right!<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;If you ask most couples who are engaged why  they're getting<br>&gt; &gt;married,they'll say: "We're in love". I believe this is  the #1<br>mistake<br>&gt; &gt;people make when they date. Choosing a life partner should  never be<br>based<br>&gt; &gt;on love. Though this may sound Not politically correct,  there's a<br>profound<br>&gt; &gt;truth here. Love is not the basis for getting married.Rather, love<br>is the<br>&gt; &gt;result of a good marriage. When the other ingredients are right,<br>then the<br>&gt; &gt;love will come.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Let me say it again: You can't build a lifetime relationship on Love<br>alone.<br>&gt; &gt;You need a lot more. Here are five questions you must ask yourself<br>if<br>&gt; &gt;you're serious about finding and keeping a life partner.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;QUESTION #1:<br>&gt; &gt;* Do we share a common life purpose?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Why is this so important? Let me put it this way: If you're  married<br>for 20<br>&gt; &gt;or 30 years, that's a long time to live with someone. What do you<br>Plan to<br>&gt; &gt;do with each other all that time? Travel, eat and jog together?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;You need to share something deeper and more meaningful. You need a<br>common<br>&gt; &gt;life purpose.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Two things can happen in a marriage. You can grow together, or you<br>can grow<br>&gt; &gt;apart. 50 percent of the people out there  are growing apart. To<br>make a<br>&gt; &gt;marriage work, you need to know what you want  out of life bottom<br>line-and<br>&gt; &gt;marry someone who Wants the same  thing.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;QUESTION #2:<br>&gt; &gt;* Do I feel safe expressing my feelings and  thoughts with this<br>&gt; &gt;person?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;This question goes to the core of the quality  of your<br>relationship.Feeling<br>&gt; &gt;safe means you can communicate openly  with this person. The basis<br>of<br>&gt; &gt;having good communication is trust -  i.e. trust that I won't get<br>&gt; &gt;"punished" or hurt for expressing my  honest thoughts and feelings.<br>A<br>&gt; &gt;colleague of mine defines an abusive person  as someone with whom<br>you feel<br>&gt; &gt;afraid to express your thoughts and  feelings.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Be honest with yourself on this one. Make sure you feel  emotionally<br>Safe<br>&gt; &gt;with the person you plan to marry.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;QUESTION  #3:<br>&gt; &gt;* Is he/she a mensch?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;A mensch is someone who is a refined and  sensitive person. How can<br>You<br>&gt; &gt;test? Here are some suggestions. Do they work  on personal growth on<br>a<br>&gt; &gt;regular basis? Are they serious about improving  themselves? A<br>teacher of<br>&gt; &gt;mine defines a good person as "someone who is  always striving to be<br>good<br>&gt; &gt;and do the right thing."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;So ask about your  significant other: What do they do with their<br>time? Is<br>&gt; &gt;this person  materialistic? Usually a materialistic person is not<br>someone<br>&gt; &gt;whose top  priority is character refinement.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;There are essentially two types of  people in the world: People who<br>are<br>&gt; &gt;dedicated to personal growth, and people who are dedicated to<br>seeking<br>&gt; &gt;comfort. Someone whose goal  in life is to be comfortable will put<br>personal<br>&gt; &gt;comfort ahead of doing the right thing. You need to know that before<br>&gt; &gt;walking down the aisle.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;QUESTION #4:<br>&gt; &gt;* How does he/she treat other  people?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The one most important thing that makes any relationship work is The<br>&gt; &gt;ability to give. By giving, we mean the ability togive another<br>person<br>&gt; &gt;pleasure. Ask: Is this someone who enjoys giving pleasure to others<br>or are<br>&gt; &gt;they wrapped up in themselves and self-absorbed? To measure this,<br>think<br>&gt; &gt;about  the following: How do they treat people whom they do not have<br>to be<br>&gt; &gt;nice to,  such as a waiters, bus boy, Taxi driver, etc. How do they<br>treat<br>&gt; &gt;parents and  siblings? Do they have gratitude and appreciation? If<br>they<br>&gt; &gt;don't have  gratitude for the people who have given them everything,<br>you<br>&gt; &gt;cannot expect  that they'll have gratitude for you--who can't do<br>nearly as<br>&gt; &gt;much for them!<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;You can be sure that someone who treats others poorly, will<br>eventually<br>&gt; &gt;treat you poorly as well.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;QUESTION #5:<br>&gt; &gt;* Is there  anything I'm hoping to change about this person after<br>we're<br>&gt; &gt;married?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Too many people make the mistake of marrying someone with the<br>&gt; &gt;intention of trying to "improve" them after they're married. As a<br>colleague<br>&gt; &gt;of Mine puts it, "You can probably expect someone to change after<br>marriage<br>&gt; &gt;... for the worse!"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;If you cannot fully accept this person the  way they are now, then<br>you are<br>&gt; &gt;not ready to marry  them.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;CONCLUSION<br>&gt; &gt;In conclusion, dating doesn't have to be difficult  and<br>treacherous.The key<br>&gt; &gt;is to try leading a little more with your head and less with your<br>heart.It<br>&gt; &gt;pays to be as objective as possible when you are dating, to be sure<br>to ask<br>&gt; &gt;questions that will help you get to the key issues.falling in love<br>is a<br>&gt; &gt;great feeling, but when you wake up with a ring on  your finger, you<br>don't<br>&gt; &gt;want to find yourself in trouble because you  didn't do your<br>homework.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br></div>
