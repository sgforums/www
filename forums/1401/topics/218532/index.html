            <div class='col-md body'>ST Nov 3, 2006<br>Undertaker donates $50,000 to needy kids<br><br>UNDERTAKER Roland Tay first learnt about The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund from the children of poor families for whom he had provided free funerals.<br><br>'I would ask the children how they got by at school for food and they would say 'school pocket money fund',' said the boss of Direct Singapore Funeral Services, who has organised several free funerals for the needy and murder victims like Chinese national Huang Na.<br><br>Yesterday, Mr Tay, 60, and his wife Sally dropped by News Centre in Toa Payoh to donate $50,000 to the fund. This sum is half of the $100,000 he received from the grateful widow of a man for whom he provided a free funeral recently.<br><br>On Monday, he received an envelope containing a thank-you card and a cashier's order of $100,000 as a token of appreciation from Madam Lim Sian Hua, who was inundated with donations after her husband was hit by a train.<br><br>Mr Tan Jee Suan, 46, died after he fell on the tracks at Chinese Garden MRT station on Oct 18. His impoverished family's plight drew about $500,000 in public donations.<br><br>Mr Tay, 60, donated the other $50,000 to five other charities. The couple dropped off cheques of $10,000 each to five groups that serve the handicapped and elderly sick.<br><br>The $50,000 donation is the single biggest individual donation to the pocket money fund since it kicked off its new fund-raising year last month.<br><br>The fund, which has seen a dip in donations compared with October last year, hopes to raise $2.7 million for its 2007 drive, so as to help 9,000 schoolchildren from low-income families.<br><br>'It was a timely coincidence that we could do something meaningful to help,' said Mr Tay.<br><br>'This fund helps keep poor children in school. With education, they can improve their lives.'<br><br>The Straits Times has raised $17 million since 2000, when the fund was set up. It provides children with $30 to $50 a month in pocket money.<br><br>To donate, call 6319-1016 or e-mail stspmf@sph.com.sg<br><br>To apply for funds, call 1800-838-0100.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

The point of the article was not to let people know that this Roland Tay fellow donated 50k. Instead, this article was posted here so as to fool people into thinking that the WWE's Undertaker was the one who donated.

I'm already betting that if I were to tell Mr. Tay that he 'Is not undefeated at Wrestlemania 14-0 like the Undertaker', he'd not even know what I was talking about. Even if he did, I'm pretty sure he'd laugh at the vague reference to his job, or because of the fact that he knows I'm playing around since wrestling is fake.<br><br>I never said that Roland Tay sucks, or that I didn't like him, or the job that he does.

Therefore, if anything is mentioned, it would be logical to think first about the WWE.<br><br>For example, if you join a forum about basketball, and somebody says the word 'basket', the first thing to pop into your mind would be the basketball hoop, wouldn't it? Not the basket you use to carry things around.<br><br>Therefore, in a WWE forum, when you mention the Undertaker, you think of the WWE Undertaker, and nobody else. Please tell me you know who the WWE Undertaker is. If you don't, I don't see any reason for you to even click on this post.<br><br>For your information, I do know what an undertaker is. "Undertake are not those who rise from the dead ^^".<br><br>Wow, NO REALLY?! WRESTLING IS NOT FAKE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN RISE FROM THE DEAD. QUICK, CALL RIPLEY'S! WWE's Undertaker is not a real undertaker? Oh noes, whatever am I going to do?<br><br>/sarcasm off<br><br>If you actually watched wrestling, noticed what this forum was about, and actually noticed the whole point of the article, you wouldn't even have said anything in the first place.<br><br>I repeat once again: This article was posted here as a JOKE. In a forum about WRESTLING, when you mention the UNDERTAKER, you think of the wrestler, not the profession. This article was posted here not to notify anybody that the Singaporean Undertaker donated $50k. Instead, it was meant to fool people into believing that the WRESTLER Undertaker donated $50k. No, I'm not saying the article was meant to fool people, just the TITLE of this whole post. And I repeat once again, specially for you, that a previous poster already mentioned, in jest, that 'they were quite similar'. I responded by posting, in jest, the differences between the WWE Undertaker and the Singaporean (real) one.<br><br>Would you consider "Never being WWE champion" an insult? Especially from something that we all know has fixed outcomes?<br><br>Do my research before posting? Exactly what research is there to be done? This post was intended to be a joke.<br><br>Please do not insult my intelligence.<br><br>By the way, looks like you need to do some research before YOU post as well. An Undertaker does not dig up corpses from the ground, my friend. A grave digger is the one who digs the graves, not the one who digs up corpses. An Undertaker's job is to bury the dead, and to oversee the funeral.<br><br></div>

I'd say you don't belong in a WWE forum if you said no. Yes, the article reveals that it's not Mark Calaway, but a Singaporean real undertaker.<br><br>I really really doubt the original poster posted that article here to notify us that the Singaporean undertaker donated the cash, but instead to fool us by means of the title of the post.<br><br>I suggest YOU keep your comments to yourself, since you apparently 'dunno'.<br><br>If you don't want this to carry on, I suggest you not post on this thread any longer.<br><br>In your words: "i suggest to keep the comments to yourself too thx ^^"<br><br></div>
