Fine, no problem with that.<br><br>Maybe you didn't read my earlier posts? I've already demonstrated that I know what 'undertaker' means.<br><br>Nicely correct me? Hey, yo, you've got to admit, your message comes off as a little bit insulting. "I bet u dunno what undertaker means do u ?" You know, that sounds like something a person calling another person stupid would say?<br><br>"I bet you dunno what this word means do you?"<br><br>"I bet you dunno what that thing is do you?"<br><br>It comes off rude. Your intentions may be good, but the way you express them is slightly insulting.<br><br>We reach an understanding now?</div>
