            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A BADSTREET PERSPECTIVE ON THE BROCK LESNAR SITUATION </strong></span><br><br>by Dave Whitaker<br><br>Well, well, what a mess we have here. Brock Lesnar, a WWE original creation and one of Vince McMahonÂ’s favorites, is upset with the company. It seems as if Brock is angry that he is going to be fed to the Undertaker after Wrestlemania. HeÂ’s also mad about having to face Hardcore Holly on the last WWE tour of South Africa, and his push down the card, not to mention the WWEÂ’s travel schedule. There are several angles to this story, ironies, and other things which need to be at least touched on.<br><br>I think the most important thing to ask is if Brock Lesnar has a point in his gripes. To that, IÂ’d say for the most part, yes. Brock Lesnar had been built up as a monster. He got a job over Hulk Hogan, as well as the Undertaker. HeÂ’s been in some of WWEÂ’s biggest matches. HeÂ’s given it 100 percent each time heÂ’s gone out there. When you consider that, plus the fact that Hardcore Holly is a midcarder, why is someone who could be the future of WWE being treated like a jobber? While Lesnar isnÂ’t the first wrestler to have his push scaled back suddenly (Kurt Angle comes to mind), he is certainly justified in being angry about it.<br><br>ItÂ’s also puzzling why WWE wants to feed Lesnar to Undertaker. Payback perhaps for the jobs Lesnar got over Â‘Taker while he was doing the biker gimmick? While itÂ’s understandable that Vince McMahon wants to allow Undertaker to go out in a blaze of glory because of the loyalty he has shown, why sacrifice your young stars? Especially one who could probably carry the SD brand if not all of WWE for months as champion if needed. How will Brock Lesnar benefit by having his moves which have put people down be no-sold by the Undertaker? Regardless of whether itÂ’s part of the UT character, Lesnar is being made to look less credible.<br><br>The travel schedule I have mixed feelings on. On the one hand, Lesnar should thank his stars he didnÂ’t come up in the 80's. You had guys driving by car from town to town, on the road 350 days a year. They risked their own lives and health, and in some cases, and didnÂ’t always get reimbursed for the travel. No chartered jets, none of the amenities provided for WWE wrestlers. But on the other, I can understand the frustration of having to do TV tapings and house shows, then flying across the globe for more shows. All because Vince McMahon wants to line his pockets with cash, not considering the physical and emotional toll it takes on the people he employs.<br><br>ThereÂ’s a rich irony that I must touch on. Brock Lesnar has voiced his disdain for the Internet in the past. At one point he threatened to Â“killÂ” anyone he saw talking on the Internet (something he later apologized for saying.) But itÂ’s smart marks whoÂ’ve expressed some of the same things heÂ’s saying now. About UndertakerÂ’s no-selling hurting the company. About a young talent being fed to him. About just how dull and unappealing Hardcore Holly is, all those things are thoughts smart marks have expressed. ItÂ’s so ironic that Brock Lesnar is pretty much agreeing with opinions expressed by people he seems to have very little respect for.<br><br>As to LesnarÂ’s career choice, I would say he doesnÂ’t know what heÂ’s getting in to. The NFL is a different animal. Yes, size and speed are important. But skill also matters. Does Lesnar have the skill needed to play pro football? Can he handle the practices, game tapes, and possible mocking from teammates because he was a wrestler? Not all football players are wrestling fans. Can he handle having someone else with even more control over him than WWE did? In the NFL, you canÂ’t pitch a fit and expect to play, you canÂ’t always do what you want, and get everything your way. While WWE may be more demanding, Lesnar was given much more freedom than he will see if he is signed by an NFL team.<br><br>There is one thing Lesnar does deserve credit for. He handled his departure the right way. He didnÂ’t pitch a tantrum. He was public, he shook hands with the management, and expressed appreciation for the opportunity given. He didnÂ’t burn the bridge. I would say then that if Lesnar decides he wants to come back to WWE, Vince McMahon would welcome him with open arms.<br><br></div>
