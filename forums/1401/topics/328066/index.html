              <p>just watched summerslam 08 last night, one of the best PPV this yr so far...</p>
              <p>the best by a mile was definitely The Undertaker vs Edge...10/10 match!</p>
              <p>Taker was speared atleast 10 times..yet he lives!! Both bled as flesh met the steel in the Hell in a Cell match...Edge made it into a TLC in a Cell match with all the steel chairs, ladders and tables...he even jumped off the ladder with a chairshot to Taker who was on the table and of cos it broked in half.</p>
              <p>Taker was beaten up by Edge quite badly and even tried to immitate Taker by giving him an Old School but of cos, the deadman fought back and gave Edge a chokeslam off the turnbuckle before Edge could give him the Old School into 2 tables stacked on top of each other(set up by Edge earlier in the match) and it broked Edge back for sure. Taker pulled Edge back into the ring and tombstone piledriver-ed him and went for the pin. 1,2,3 and The Deadman had won. Taker was really power even tho he took quite a beating from Edge.</p>
              <p>With Edge lying in the middle of the ring, Taker walked off and when he was at the steps to the entrance, he saw Edge squimming about. Everyone though Edge was dead beaten but he was struggling to breathe and Taker went back to the ring. He gave Edge a spear and a Con-Chair-To. Taker then set up a ladder and throw Edge on it and he set up another ladder and he climbed it and gave Edge a chokeslam into the middle of the ring and the middle of the ring broke and Edge was inside. Taker being tired dropped into the corner of the ring and SUDDENLY THE HOLE WHICH EDGE WAS INSIDE WAS BURNING!! OMFG THERE WAS FIRE!! THE UNDERTAKER HAD SEND EDGE TO HELL!!!</p>
              <p>truely a 5 Star match...only match that rival this was prolly the King of the Ring '98 where Taker vs Mankind/..</p>
              <p>seriously good match...would recommend all to watch Summerslam 08</p>
              <p>A shocking news: HBK RETIRES</p>
              <p>Shawn Michaels was badly injured by Chris Jericho over the past few months and due to his eye, back and knee injuries, HBK retires. He came up to the ring with his SUPER BEAUTIFUL WIFE Rebbeca Michaels and spoke to his fans for the last time and told of his retirement, but was interrupted by Chris Jericho, Y2J. Chris Jericho asked HBK to tell everyone he did not retire cos of all his injuries but because Y2J forced him to retire and asked Shawn Michaels to say to his kids and wife that he can't go to work anymore cos of what Y2J did.HBK says he will say that but he also asked Y2J to tell to him own wife and kids that DADDY WILL NEVER BE SHAWN MICHAELS! OMFG THIS WAS TOTAL PWNAGE! HBK walks off with his wife but Y2J attempts to punch Shawn Michaels but missed and sucker punched his wife instead. Rebbeca was knocked out for awhile while HBK was tearing and hugging his wife. The refs and medics came and Rebecca could stand and the whole of Indianapollis was cheering for her. Does HBK retires or will he make Jericho pay? I haven watch this week's raw but will do so tml and will see what happen</p>
              <p>in other matches..Cena vs Batista ok match lah quite competitive but not as nice as Edge vs Taker...Batista and Cena even out and Batista won as Cena did flying leg drop which was countered by a 1/2 batista bomb but Cena tapped out but Cena was not superman enough for the 2nd batista bomb and Batista won.</p>
              <p>Triple H retains his WWE Championship agains Khali in another good match..Good Job Triple H~</p>
              <p>CM Punk vs JBL, JBL lost to CM Punk but CM Punk's head was bleeding quite jialat as his head hit jbl's accidently..so CM Punk is still your World HeavyWeight Champ..</p>
              <p>Jeff Hardy lost to MVP as Shelton came to the ring just before Jeff was abt to Swanton Bomb MVP and Swanton-ed Shelton instead. MVP used this to his advantage and kneed Jeff in the head and went for the win.</p>
              <p>Matt Hardy vs Mark Henry for ECW Champ...Matt won by DQ as just into 30secs into the match, Matt gave Henry the Twist of Fate and went for the cover but was hit by Henry's manager and so it was a DQ. Matt was getting mauled by Henry and his manager and WOO HOO~ Jeff Hardy enters the ring and helps his brother. Together they gave the 400 pound Mark Henry a suplex and have the HARDY BOYZ teamed up again? THIS IS GOLD!</p>
              <p>Glamazon and Santiago are the new women's and intercontinental champs aft defeating Kofi Kingston and Mickey James...quite dumb match and Santiago is bullshit.</p>
              <p>CANT WAIT FOR SMACKDOWN TML!</p>

              <p>the HIAC was good! defintely one of the best match this year!</p>
              <p>I like the part Edge speared Taker and the cell came apart, Edge speared Taker through the announcing table, Taker chockeslam Edge through the two tables!</p>
              <p>Everything was running smoothly, the way they use the steel steps, the ladders, chairs, even the camera! One of the match I would love to see over and over again!</p>

              current strategy is to stay away from the "sleazy" label, and gear
              their content to a more family oriented audience. A prime example is
              the lack of blood shed at Sunday's Summerslam PPV. The goal is to
              attract a higher class of advertisers.</span></p>
