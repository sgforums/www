            <div class='col-md body'>BIG SHOW TAKES UP FOR BRADSHAW<br>By: Adam Lebow<br>6/12/2004 6:28:31 PM<br><br>The Big Show is in Toronto this weekened and after throwing the opening pitch at the Blue Jay game did a one-on-one interview with TSN.ca/Wrestling ( http://www.tsn.ca/wrestling/news_story.asp?ID=87297&amp;hubName=wrestling ) .<br><br>ZZzIn the interview, Big Show talks about his character changing from WCW to WWE as he believes he has done what creative has wanted him to do, from being the Big Scary monster to the Funny guy. When asked about his favourite character, Big Show breaks into his Hogan impersonation and then says that he perfers to be the persona where fans think he is crazy (Heyman). They move onto Bradshaw in Germany and show says that Bradshaw is a very intellegent and carrying person. Show says that Bradshaw was probably only doing what hs character is supposed to do and something Bradshaw must have thought would help his character but the rest of the world didn't see it like that. Show says he may have crossed the line but says Bradshaw wouldnt mean to affend people to that magnatiude. There is a difference between trying to piss someone off and actually hurting your fan, and they dont want the later because it is bad for the fan base. Show things it was a quick decision in the heat of the monent that turned out really bad and he doesn't think it was done with intent and it was just a mistake. Show says they have to push the limits but they are working towards going back to old school values. It is compared to when a heel comes out and makes fun of the home sports team, such as saying The Blue Jays sucks but it wares off on people now and isn't as effective so they have to do new and more interesting things. Show says that with all the things going on, there is no substitue for quality entertaining and Bradshaw didn't really mean what he did. He compares it to when you are a kid and you do something really bad and later upon reflection you can't believe you did what you did.Lastly about his health, Show said they had to drill his kneecap cause it was right down to bone on bone. Surgery was really good, he has lost 30 points and he is looking to come back in Augest or September. Show says he expects to be going back to Smackdown.<br></div>
