            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Is John Cena really the one to bring the WWE into its next era? How is it that McMahon still sees fit to keep John Cena as the man that represents the WWE when the 'white rapper' gets partially booed everywhere he goes, including his own hometown?<br><br>The booing may be because of his extremely limited moveset, and the fact that his old gimmick of being a ruthless, venom-spewing gangster has been abandoned in favour of the 'traditional face' gimmick. They seem to be trying to make him into a modern-day Hulk Hogan. Hulk's era is over. Nobody wants to see a person get beat down for 95% of the match, throw a couple of punches, shoulderblocks, hip tosses and finally finish up with the FU, and sometimes the STFU (i have no idea why they called it the STFU though, I know the announcers said that Cena was performing the STF, but that looks more like the STS to me). This certain chain of moves that he performs around this time has been coined as 'The 6 Moves of Doom'.<br><br>His mic work is average, formerly spewing out a bunch of rhymes, but now all he does is look serious and imply that everybody is gay. He has the charisma of Giant Gonzales. His slogan has gone from the spoonerism 'Ruck Fules' (spoonerism means you replace the first letters of the 2 words) to 'Hustle, Loyalty &amp; Respect'. What does 'Hustle, Loyalty &amp; Respect' have to do with a bad ass gangster who disses everyone in his path? Exactly. Nothing.<br><br>He can't wrestle, he's not good even as an entertainer, and has to win every single match because it will make money off the little kiddies who ask their parents to buy them John Cena merchandise because 'they want to grow up to be just like him' and they can relate to him because he stands for 'Hustle, Loyalty &amp; Respect' just like they do.<br><br>People may argue that a champion has to look good, but if championships were decided on looks, Torrie Wilson and Maria would hold the Tag Team Championships with Candice Michelle holding the world title.<br><br>Another argument for the Cena cause is that you do not have to be a good wrestler with a moveset akin to someone like Kurt Angle's to make millions. True, most of the time, wrestling ability has nothing to do with how much money a person makes. However, let's look at the facts:<br><br>Stone Cold Steve Austin : Fans loved him. He was anti-authority, and was, simply put, a badass sonofabitch. He did not wrestle much, but fans loved him because of the fact that he was the bad-ass, beer drinking, trash talking redneck. Cena is a man who turned the championship belt into a spinning pizza plate, only insult is to call everyone gay, and whose gimmick has gotten stale.<br><br>The Rock : I will even go as far as to say that The Rock's in-ring ability is almost comparable to John Cena's. However, the main thing that draws a huge line in between John Cena and The Rock is that the Rock is a god on the mic, and that he practically oozes charisma. The Rock did not get popular because of wrestling ability, he got popular because he spouted off catchphrases like 'Do you smell what The Rock is cookin?' and 'Check your ass into the Smackdown hotel!'. Cena's only skills on the microphone are spouting off ridiculous raps (he does not do that anymore) and calling all his enemies gay.<br><br>Hulk Hogan : Mr. America himself. Captain America, if you will. The Hulkster got popular in his era, not the Attitude era. People loved his size and physique, and how he was always defending America. Cena's in-ring abilities are slightly better than Hogan's, but this is not the 1980s anymore, this is the 2000s, and wrestling has changed since Hogan's time. Cena could have been massively popular back in the 80s, he had the physique and looks, and the right gimmick (the 'Hustle, Loyalty Respect crap), but not in the 2000s.<br><br>Cena cannot even match up to any of the people here. Sure, you can sell merchandise if your wrestling skills are not 'perfect', but you have to have something else to compensate, like gimmick or mic skills. Cena was able to have some good matches in the past with people like Kurt Angle when he was still using his heel gimmick, but that was then, and this is now.<br><br>I have no idea why McMahon, even after clearly hearing all the negative responses that Cena has been getting from the crowds, still wants to keep Cena as his top-tier face. Cena would have nuclear heat and draw just as much money (if not more) if they'd turn him full-blown heel. Millions of people want to see him get his ass kicked, which, according to all of the greats, is how a successful heel draws the big money, so Cena can capitalize on that. I always wonder if Vince is just being stubborn and refuses to accept that Cena might not be his babyface of the future, or if he thinks that he's worth more as a "controversial champion" than a heel. Either way, I think a heel turn is in order.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>good analysis...<br>champions of wwe are often people who either are charismatic...good-in-ring ability or someone who can connect to the average working american people...<br><br>80's...hulk hogan ruled...simply because he represented the american working class people...he told kids the good stuff..."say your prayers...eat your vitamins." and all those..he told the working class people...work hard...and u will make your day...probably they needed a guy who could be their hero...hogan was one...<br><br>90's...attitude era...people like shawn michaels(with triple H and DX)...steve austin...the rock ruled...they had pure attitude...they were the ones that represent those working class who were surpressed by their stagnant life...they needed to get free from the hands of authority...thus people like austin can relate to how they are...<br><br>2000...i not sure what era was this...but hip hop...rNb and rap...gangstas( as gangsters and known in america) definately played a part in this couple of years.<br>wwe's "creative" probably thought that hip-hop and black music was the 'in' thing...so they decided to follow this trend..the problem with this trend is that not everyone in the crowd can relate to this...imagine...those who follow wwe and the previous wwf since 1980...20 years on..they are probably 40 plus...would u see a 40 plus person dancing and rapping to hip-hop?<br>arguably..the largest fanbase generated was during the attitude era...this crowds were probably 10-25 years old during that time...10 years on...they are concentrating on their careers and everything...thus probably haven got much time for wrestling...<br>whatsmore...rNb and gangsta-ism isn't really the thing you should follow and be able to relate to...<br><br>with regards to cena's in-ring ability...yes its limited...but they aren't packaging him as the best wrestler...they packaging him as a new Rocky Balbo...the champion that will never back down...everyone loves a Rocky...this is the thing the fans can relate to...sadly...this plot has dragged too long...once in a while...everyone gets sick of the good guys always fighting back from the odds and winning against the bad guys...<br>wrestling has turned into a soap opera...its something evitable...with the can of worms that wrestling is fake being spilled out...the creative people have to think of new ideas to fit into the liking of the fans...<br>sadly...the good old days of great wrestling ability is not around anymore...where u need to be great wrestler...now...u only need to be a great entertainer...<br>thats why they call it SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

You have to be on crack.<br><br>...<br><br>Sure, he's young, but being young does not entitle him to being a future World Champion. How many more 'Legends' can he kill? By the time he hits 30, how many 'Legends' are still going to be alive, or even fit to step into the ring without breaking a bone?<br><br>Cena as future? Nah.<br>Orton as future? Nah.<br>Edge as future? Possibly.<br>Chris Jericho as future? Even better.<br>Kurt Angle as future?
