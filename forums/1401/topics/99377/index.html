            <div class='col-md body'>APRIL HUNTER IS BACK!<br>By: AprilHunter.com<br>10/20/2004 8:46:56 PM<br><br>How can something that looks SO good...NOW LOOK SO MUCH BETTER?<br><br>BECAUSE THE HOTTEST WEBSITE ON THE 'NET JUST TURNED UP THE HEAT WITH A WHOLE NEW LOOK - APRILHUNTER.COM HAD BEEN RELAUNCHED!!<br><br>WELCOME TO MY SPANKING NEW WEBSITE! http://www.aprilhunter.com/<br><br>Enjoy new freebies, including wallpapers, a sexy Halloween e-card, a video clip from England and a literal load of new photos! Red's Ramblings...<br><br>One of the cool things about living in CT is I'm right in the middle of Boston and New York City. Last night I met some friends at Hooters to catch the Sox/Yanks game and WWE Taboo Tuesday ppv. When the Yankees finally managed to score, half the restaurant chanted, "Let's go Yankees!". The other half responded with an even louder, "Let's go Red Sox!". This kept up all night, but suprisingly enough, everyone was having fun with it and no fights. Had this scenario happened in Philly with a PA team, someone would have died.<br><br>If you came out last weekend to 3PW, thanks! I had what I think was a bad match...and Team Underground lost the titles to the Shitbulls 2004 when Tod Gordon turned on us to make the 3 count; so it was a REALLY bad match. I also came out of it with a some broken bones in my hands due to unplanned chairshots winged at me. At the end, I grabbed a chair from a guy in the audience and nailed Gary Pitbull as hard as I could with a good shot as he was getting back in the ring for that one. Earlier that night, I was the redhead part of the 3pw diva shoot equation with beauties Talia and Jasmin St. Claire.<br><br>I'm changing my email soon. Have had Earthlink too long. If you're someone I talk with regularly, remind me to give you my new address.<br><br>My new centerfold video "From Mexico With Love" should be done this weekend and ready to send out. (It's available on DVD and VHS and features full nudity, so you must be over 18 to purchase!) Can you believe it? Sorry I am so late with it. This Autumn was pretty hectic for me, but if you order now, you should have it in just a few days! http://www.aprilhunter.com/merchandise/videos/<br><br>By mail: 994 N. Colony Rd. #163, Wallingford, CT 06492<br><br>I've been working on my new site and stuck in front of this computer since I got done shooting the movie earlier in the month . Scanning, writing, adding pictures, video, diaries...<br><br>Now, today, it's FINALLY READY. Go play!<br><br>- Kisses! April<br><br>You Can Sleep With A Blonde, You Can Sleep With A Brunette. But You'll Never Get Any Sleep With A Redhead!<br><br>Hunter Ha Ha...<br><br>Boston Fan Two boys are playing hockey on the pond on Boston Common when one is attacked by a vicious rottweiler. Thinking quickly, the other boy took his hockey stick and managed to wedge it down the dog's collar and twist, luckily breaking the dog's neck and stopping its attack. A reporter who was strolling by sees the incident, and rushes over to interview the boy.<br><br>"Young Bruins Fan Saves friend from Vicious Animal..." he starts writing in his notebook.<br><br>"But, I'm not a Bruins fan," the little hero replied.<br><br>"Sorry, since we're in Boston, I just assumed you were," said the reporter and starts again.<br><br>"Red Sox Fan Rescues Friend from Horrific attack..." he continued writing in his notebook.<br><br>"I'm not a Red Sox fan either!" The boy said.<br><br>The reporter says, "I assumed everyone in Boston was either for the Bruins or the Red Sox.<br><br>So, what team do you root for?", the reporter asked.<br><br>"I'm a Yankees fan!" the child beamed.<br><br>The reporter starts a new sheet in his notebook and writes: "Little Bastard from New York Kills Beloved Family Pet."</div>
