            <div class='col-md body'>The Electric New Paper :<br>Just like the 'real' thing<br>MOST of us know that the professional wrestling that you see on television isn't real.<br>By Ian Tan<br>08 December 2006<br><br>MOST of us know that the professional wrestling that you see on television isn't real.<br><br>From the cheesy drama to the outrageous acrobatic stunts, these matches are usually carefully scripted and choreographed to look as authentic as possible.<br><br>Now, a videogame based on World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) matches takes the fakery a little further.<br><br>Think about it - the Xbox 360 game known as Smackdown Vs Raw 2007 is actually a simulation of a simulated reality.<br><br>Who cares, you say, as long as it feels and plays like the real thing?<br><br>But what makes a real wrestling match? When was the last time you watched one?<br><br>The game is undoubtedly fun, but it made me ask myself the following questions incessantly.<br><br>1. Are the punches real?<br>Oddly enough, the showy lightning-fast punches to the face and knocks against the metal stairs are replicated in full in the game.<br><br>The same goes for those flying tackles, leg locks and sudden neck twists.<br><br>But is your virtual opponent feeling the pain? Or is it ultimately just for show?<br><br>What will really hurt is the maddening number of loading screens. Imagine having to wait two or three minutes just to start a match!<br><br>2. When is the next plot twist coming?<br>Roughly every two weeks in your season, the scriptwriters will introduce a plot twist that brings in new enemies (think ugly faces like Boogeyman, Ric Flair and The Undertaker), or make sudden allies out of your existing opponents.<br><br>Expect to be betrayed and slammed with a metal chair across your back by your best friend.<br><br>3. Do I actually have control over who wins the match?<br>Often, you will be set up for a handicapped match and have to watch helplessly as your WWE wrestler is brutally pummeled by two opponents.<br><br>A cut-scene at the end of the match gloats over your failure and conveniently moves the story forward.<br><br>So it's not about how fast you can twist those gamepad thumbsticks, dear.<br><br>4. Who are these weird wrestlers anyway?<br>Does it matter what their real names are?<br><br>With high-quality 3D reproductions of your favourite wrestlers, these beefcakes (and hot babes) look and strut creepily like the real thing.<br><br>Unlock loads of famous names from Hulk Hogan to The Rock, then enter every pay-per-view event like Wrestlemania to prove your worth.<br><br>It really feels like the televised matches, except you are in absolute control.<br><br>Or are you?<br>Rating: *** 1/2 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
