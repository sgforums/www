            <div class='col-md body'>First, let's define the term 'Heel'. A heel, as many of you already know, is a bad guy. A good heel, in the words of the wrestling legends, can make fans dish out money, whether it's to buy tickets or to order a PPV, so that they can see him or her get his or her comeuppance. In short, a heel's job is to make the fans pay to see him get humiliated or beaten up.<br><br>The Boogeyman could be so popular because he instills fear into his enemies' (all heels) hearts. Fine, so he doesn't really have that big of a moveset, the only moves I've seen him do are the Chokebomb and the Pumphandle Slam. But, the looks on his enemies' faces when his music hits, and the way he spits worms all over his enemies' faces at the end of every match humiliates them a lot.<br><br>Take the Booker T vs Boogeyman match for example. The look on Booker's face was priceless when Boogeyman came out. Booker was even scared out of his wits backstage (Booker was a heel back then). If you notice, during the match, there was dead heat. Nobody cheered, or shouted, or even booed. But, at the end of the match, when he kissed Sharmell with a mouthfull of worms, the arena exploded. He successfully humiliated his enemies, and what's more humiliating than to have a mouthful of half-eaten worms spat onto your face? Yes, there's always the Kiss My Ass Club, but half of the Kissers don't even do it anyway.<br><br>So, yeah, that may be why the Boogeyman is so popular. He's worse than Cena in terms of wrestling ability, but his ability to instill fear and to humiliate heels may be his drawing point.<br><br></div>
