            <div class='col-md body'>Traditionally, wrestling matches are one fall to a finish. In most cases, a finish is considered a pinfall, submission, countout or disqualification. However, there are <span style="color: blue;">various other types of matches in WWE</span>. These matches do not occur under the traditional one fall to a finish rules. Rather, they have their own unique set of rules. Below is a listing of many types of specialty matches that may occur in WWE.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

Very few times have two Superstars competed in such a competition. The rules are simple, as there is only one -- the winner is the first Superstar to place his opponent into a ringside ambulance and close the door. Everything else is legal. As a result of this, Ambulance Matches often find themselves flowing outside of the ring. In addition, the ambulance is very often used as a weapon and/or launching pad.</span></strong></div>

Other than that, normal rules apply and the winner is decided by pinfall or submission. The first ever Blindfold Match was at WrestleMania VII between Jake "the Snake" Roberts and "The Model" Rick Martel. Martel had blinded Roberts when he sprayed him in the eyes with his cologne, Arrogance. The action resulted in a temporary loss of sight for Roberts. So Martel could feel what being blinded was like, both opponents were blindfolded for the match.</span></strong></div>

However, prior to the "Attitude" era, which introduced much more ringside weapons into matches, the Boiler Room Brawl was used as a way to get such items as ladders and steel pipes into matches. As the name suggests, the Boiler Room Brawl takes place inside an arena boiler room. The winner is usually the first Superstar to escape the room.</span></strong></div>

Instead, it goes all the way down to the floor, leaving about six feet of space in between the cage and the ring. There is also a roof on the cage, so there is virtually no way out.

Atop that poll is an item (nightstick, pink slip, paddle...). The first Superstar to reach that item is declared the winner, and very often gets to use the item - if it's a weapon - on his opponent. </span></strong></div>

In a Ladder Match, the championship belt up for grabs is suspended above the ring. The winner is crowned once a Superstar grabs the belt. To get the belt, a Superstar must ascend a ladder quicker than his opponent. While the premise sounds simple, the match becomes much more complicated once the Superstars begin using the ladder as a weapon and/or launching pad.</span></strong></div>

There are no disqualifications or countouts. The only way to win is to incapacitate your opponent enough so that he cannot answer a 10-count. Once a Superstar is knocked down, the referee begins to count, and if the Superstar cannot get up in 10 seconds, the match is over.</span></strong></div>

A countout is almost impossible, however, as the ring is surrounded by other Superstars. Once someone is thrown out of the ring, it is the job of the Superstars around the squared circle to throw him back into the ring. Very often, the surrounding lumberjacks get in a few shots of their own.</span></strong><br><br></div>

It only happens once a year (January) and includes 30 Superstars from both RAW and SmackDown! Each Superstar selects a number between 1 and 30. The match starts with the Superstars that picked No. 1 and No. 2. Then every two minutes, a new Superstar enters the fray. A Superstar is eliminated when he is thrown over the top rope. The last man standing is declared the winner.</span></strong></div>

This type of match features an unforgiving steel structure that surrounds the ring. While inside the cage, the Superstars participating in the match usually use the steel as a weapon, throwing their opponents into it. A Steel Cage Match is won by pinfall or submission and/or escaping the cage (rules may vary depending on the individual match).</span></strong></div>
