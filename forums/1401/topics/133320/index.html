            <div class='col-md body'>GOLDBERG CALLS WWE MANAGEMENT "MORONS"!<br>By: Joey Styles<br>5/19/2005 12:53:05 PM<br><br>Bill Goldberg has nothing nice to say about his short tenure with WWE in his latest interview. Here are some choice excerpts:<br><br>"When I broke into the business, I had a number of friends in WCW that helped me out a lot," Goldberg said this week from his home in San Diego, Calif. "It was a matter of my being in the right place at the right time. I had the right looks, and I got great direction. The days in WCW were terrific."<br><br>But that time turned sour when World Wrestling Entertainment went out of business, and Goldberg ended up working for World Wrestling Entertainment, what was then the main competition for WCW.<br><br>"That was one of the most agonizing, excruciating and miserable times of my entire life," Goldberg said of his short stint with WWE. "I enjoyed the fact that that you could get 10,000 to 40,000 people screaming and chanting your name, but having to listen to these morons backstage and live with them was not good."<br><br>Particularly painful for Goldberg was his final match with the company, in which he faced off with former WWE champion Brock Lesnar. Goldberg's contract with WWE was ending, and Lesnar had announced he was leaving the company to pursue a career in the NFL.<br><br>Amid chants of "boring, boring," the two wrestled perhaps one of the worst matches in WWE history. "It was one of the most anticlimactic matches ever," said Goldberg, who won the match. "Here you had two of the most unbelievable guys in the business, and whether we were both leaving or not, why not make as much money as you can by giving the people what they want to see? It was like a public hanging."<br><br>"Being part of that (WWE) was like being part of the Hindenburg going down," Goldberg said. "It just left a bad taste in my mouth."</div>
