            <div class='col-md body'>WWE UNLIMITED REPORT<br>by Brian Richey @ 12:06:00 AM on 11/15/2005<br><br>WWE Unlimited Report for November 14th - RAW IS EDDIE<br>WWE Unlimited could be launched around 8:30. The screen said "Coming Up, WWE<br>Unlimited." The format has changed to a special Eddie Guerrero theme for the<br>night. The top section, 'Eddie Facts,' gave several facts about him<br>throughout the night. The first was that Eddie won the WWE Championship at<br>No Way Out on Feb. 15, 2004. The large, middle section, 'Fans Remember<br>Eddie,' displayed the testimonials from fans that they have sent in memory<br>of Eddie. The last section, 'WWE.com,' simply said: "Watch video tributes to<br>Eddie Guerrero on WWE.com after RAW."<br><br>Around 8:42 the sound from the crowd could be heard they cheered and chanted<br>'Eddie, Eddie.' It cut out about a minute later.<br><br>At about 8:54 they showed Eddie's lowrider on display to the right of the<br>stage. The superstars began making their way to the stage, beginning with a<br>group including Mysterio, Chavo, JBL, Triple H, and Chris Benoit. They<br>focused on Benoit who was choked up and visibly upset. HHH consoled him.<br>Many of the stars were wearing Eddie shirts or wristbands. The crowd, who<br>had been cheering as the superstars came out, began to chant 'Eddie, Eddie'<br>and loudly continued as the rest made their way out and clapped along with<br>chants.<br><br>Kurt Angle was shown and he said Eddie was one of the most loving, caring<br>individuals that he has ever met. He said that when he was on, Eddie was the<br>best in the world, possibly best ever. Eddie helped teach him about the<br>business and said a lot to help him professionally and personally. He called<br>Eddie a saint and said that he loved him and will miss him.<br><br>Highlights from Eddie's match against Rob Van Dam from Backlash 2002 where<br>he won his second Intercontinental Championship.<br><br>Eric Bischoff says that he last saw Eddie while they were waiting for their<br>bags at an airport last Wednesday. Eddie asked about his son and Bischoff<br>asked him about his family. They showed each other pictures and then hugged<br>and looked forward to seeing each other this past weekend. He said he will<br>remember Eddie and that his thoughts and prayers are with his family.<br><br>William Regal, with tears in his eyes, said that he hopes and prays that<br>anyone who ever spent time with Eddie knows that they were blessed, because<br>he was an extraordinary person.<br><br>Highlights of Eddie and Rey Mysterio winning the Tag Team Championship at No<br>Way Out 2005 against the Bashams.<br><br>JBL said that he and Eddie were great enemies in WWE and great friends in<br>real life. He started to get choked up as he explained how no one thought he<br>could be a main eventer and Eddie stood up for him. He said he owed Eddie<br>his career and they sold out the Staples Center in what was probably JBL's<br>biggest match. When he was going through his divorce, Eddie sensed something<br>was wrong and kept bringing him passages from the bible just for him. When<br>he met his current wife, he thought Eddie was just as happy for him if not<br>more so. He said the world was better with Eddie in it and then said to hell<br>with the world because he was a better person because of Eddie. JBL then<br>closed by saying thank you to Eddie's family for letting him be a part of<br>his life and he wishes them all the best.<br><br>Matt Hardy said Eddie was truly one of a kind and that he did everything he<br>could to battle his demons and won. He said Eddie was a great person and he<br>will pray for him and his family.<br><br>Trish tells us to love what you do and go for your goals because thats what<br>Eddie did as she watched him growing up and throughout her career. She<br>thanks him for everything he did for the business and as a friend.<br><br>Highlights of Eddie's WWE Championship celebration in his hometown of El<br>Paso.<br><br>The match continues as the ref does the count. The two get back in before<br>the 10 count and HBK chops Rey in the corner. Rey misses a splash in the<br>opposite corner and HBK hits a hard reverse neckbreaker for a two count.<br><br>Christy said that she had a lot of touching conversations with Eddie. What<br>really stood out was his love for the business and everyone in it. His love<br>for his family was most touching. She finished with, "We love you Eddie."<br><br>Booker T said that he and Sharmell's hearts go out to the family and his<br>daughters. As a believer in God, Booker knows that he'll see him again.<br>Sharmell said that she'll miss Eddie's smile the most and Booker agreed.<br><br>Highlights of Eddie winning the WCW Cruiserweight title at Fall Brawl 1997<br>against Chris Jericho.<br><br>Jerry Brisco said he was fortunate to know Eddie and his family from an<br>early age. Eddie proved himself to be one of the top Latino wrestlers in the<br>world. Eddie wasn't a giant physically, but was a giant in what he stood for<br>by becoming a success for those not huge physically and for his Latin<br>brothers. His sympathy goes out to Vicki and his entire family. He<br>brightened the world with his presence and was a shining light for many,<br>many people.<br><br>Ric Flair said he had a very controlled thing about him and had the ability<br>to look you in the eye and be sincere. When he put his fist to his chest in<br>respect, you knew that was real. He says Eddie will go down as one of the<br>greatest wrestlers of all time and was a great man, father, and performer.<br>He said that Eddie's legacy is so great that his stature will only grow<br>larger as the years go on and that his daughters will no doubt be very<br>proud.<br><br>Highlights of Los Guerreros winning the Tag Team Championship at Survivor<br>Series 2002 against Edge &amp; Rey Mysterio.<br><br>Teddy Long said Eddie was always there to do whatever he had to do to help<br>the young guys coming in and brought his character to life with his<br>personality and his comedic nature that made him a joy to be around.<br><br>Footage of the 'security camera' at Playboy headquarters when Eddie was<br>trying to stop the printing of then-girlfriend Chyna's Playboy pictorial.<br><br>Shelton Benjamin said it goes without saying that Eddie was a phenomenal<br>talent and everyday strived to better himself for himself and his family. He<br>and Eddie actually got into some arguments and Eddie always said that he was<br>doing this for his family and not to take that away from him. He said Eddie<br>was a great talent and thanked him for everything.<br><br>Highlights of Eddie's last match on SmackDown! against Mr. Kennedy.<br><br>After the show the message "Thank You for Watching WWE Unlimited," appeared.<br><br>I'm sure these tribute videos will be up on WWE.com sometime Tuesday if not<br>sooner. Reminder that tomorrow the MSNBC show Rita Cosby - Live and Direct<br>will have a tribute to Eddie at 9pm. I only had the chance to see Eddie<br>perform live once in his first match against Batista a few months back at a<br>house show in Raleigh. He did not disappoint and entertained the crowd the<br>way he has ever since I first saw him as a member of the Filthy Animals in<br>WCW. He truly was a great talent and one the WWE and the wrestling world<br>will never be quite the same without. My condolences go out to Eddie's<br>family and everyone in the business and around the world who was touched by<br>him and saddened by his untimely death.</div>
