Â– Once again, Raw is Jericho!<br><br>To the chagrin of WWE Champion Randy Orton, who planned a symbolic (and literal) torch-passing ceremony to celebrate his Survivor Series victory over Shawn Michaels, Chris Jericho returned to Raw to spoil OrtonÂ’s moment of glory.<br><br>Just as OrtonÂ’s torch bearer arrived at the BankAtlantic Center after completing his 35-mile run from Miami, the runner was attacked by an unknown figure.<br><br>While Orton fumed at his ceremony gone awry, the lights in the arena went dark momentarily before exploding into a flourish of pyrotechnics.<br><br>When the smoke cleared, the trademark cross pose revealed the one and only Chris Jericho to the roar of the raucously elated crowd. Watch the video...<br><br>"Welcome to Raw ... is ... Jericho," Y2J exclaimed.<br><br>The former WWE Undisputed Champion soaked up the ovation after being away for more than two years. Y2JÂ’s "second coming" was heralded in weeks of cryptic binary code videos on Raw, SmackDown and ECW that baffled announcers, Superstars and fans alike.<br><br>Messages buried in the lines of code hinted that the Â“Ayatollah of Rock Â‘nÂ’ RollaÂ” was preparing a Raw return Monday night. And Y2J did so in grand fashion, stealing the Legend KillerÂ’s limelight.<br><br>Much like his memorable Raw debut in 1999, Jericho reintroduced himself as both a savior and entertainer, coming back to rescue our fans.<br><br>"This is not a mirage. This is real. This is now," Jericho said. "This is the second coming of Y2J! ... The Sexy Beast is back, baby!"<br><br>But Jericho also announced that he was gunning for Raw's top prize.<br><br>"Most importantly Randy Orton, I'm here to save us from you," Jericho said "Because the first chance I get, I'm going to take that WWE Championship from you. And I'm going to put it around this gorgeous waist, and WWE ... will never, ever, be the same again!"<br><br>It seemed that Y2JÂ’s competitive streak and flair for the dramatic havenÂ’t diminished in his time away from WWE.<br><br>And for the WWE Champion, he watched as his night of glory was Â“torchedÂ” by the return of the newest threat to his title reign.<br><br><a href="http://http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/articles/5304642/jerichoreturns/url" rel="nofollow">Source: WWE</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TWO months ago, a mysterious promo full of computer code and Matrix-like graphics aired on Raw. It was not referred to by commentators and was written off by many as a Cyber Sunday vignette.<br><br>Eagle-eyed viewers, though, spotted a host of references to a man we had not seen since leaving the WWE after a Â‘youÂ’re firedÂ’ match with John Cena in July 2005.<br><br>It looked like it was the Second Coming of Y2J.<br><br>The following week, though, the clues seem to hint towards the absent Shawn Michaels, and the whole wrestling world was talking about the mysterious Â“Save_USÂ” code. Despite several PPVs, Wellness Policy controversies and high-profile stars leaving the company, the code was still a hot talking point.<br><br>But in recent weeks, it has become increasingly obvious that Chris Jericho was the focus of the viral campaign. Last Monday was all but confirmed as the return date, and surely the WWE were looking to this day to when the ratings would spike, and the return of the former Lionheart would save the company.<br><br>It was not to be. The Nielson ratings which determine the viewing figures for Raw stood, the week previous, at 3.5.<br><br>The return of Jericho put the ratings at...<br><br>3.5. No change.<br><br>To put that in perspective, the average rating this year has been around the 3.6-3.7 mark.<br><br>The return was left until the end of the show. WWE champion Randy Orton had been showing up on Raw all night, laying RKOs on Jerry Lawler, Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly while proclaiming that there would be a Â‘Passing of the TorchÂ’ ceremony, later in the night.<br><br>As the final segment aired, a long distance runner, complete with Olympic Torch, entered the arena. Before he reached the ring, though, he was clotheslined by a recognisable blonde figure, who then posed in a manner appropriate for the first Undisputed champion.<br><br>Of course, it was Y2J, and after the Â’JericodeÂ’ aired, we saw a familiar countdown and then the man himself.<br><br>When Jericho debuted back in 1999, he interrupted The Rock in possibly the most memorable debut ever. It was a shock to most, and his initial exchange with the proprietor of the Smackdown Hotel was simply electrifying.<br><br>MondayÂ’s return reminded us just how good Y2J is as a promo guy Â– as you can see below.<br><br>It is interesting to see that he has been thrust straight into a programme with Randy Orton, seemingly. It remains to be seen whether, after over two years in the wrestling wilderness, heÂ’ll be able to recreate the old magic.<br><br>And recreating the old magic is exactly what the WWE need to do. In their best period, between 1998 and 2000, shows were regularly filled with great action, twists in storylines and well written promos. Today, things are so much more predictable.<br><br>The slow decline in ratings is showing that people are increasingly switching off to this formulaic brand of television. Wrestlers, feuds and promos are interchangeable now. But there is light at the end of the tunnel.<br><br>Survivor Series was a decent Pay Per View, and saw a run-in from Edge which should spark a big angle with Undertaker.<br><br>It had two title matches in which guessing the winner was far from an easy task.<br><br>And, although it was during a Hornswaggle/Khali comedy bout, Finlay inserted himself into McMahonÂ’s business, and his involvement on Raw was a long way from making the situation any clearer.<br><br>The way forward for the WWE is not to promote big one-off returns and outrageous matches and then forget to deliver on the rest of the show. If promotion of events by virtue of short-term fixes is not working, then simply make sure that the product as a whole is solid.<br><br>The current audience is the core viewership. To get back the Â‘floatingÂ’ viewers, the WWE need to provide a high level of quality on a consistent basis, so that wrestling once again becomes a must-see product, and not something people can dip in and out of now and again, and nothing much has changed.<br><br>It isnÂ’t Y2J who will Save Us, it is consistently high quality programming.<br><br></div>
