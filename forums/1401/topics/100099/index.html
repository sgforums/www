            <div class='col-md body'>By: Press Release<br>10/28/2004 1:40:46 PM<br><br>BAM BAM BIGELOW RETURNS TO WRESTLING NOVEMBER 19th<br><br>Over the past decade, USA Pro Wrestling has been one of the most dominant independent professional wrestling federations anywhere. Established in 1993, by president and owner, Frank Goodman, USA Pro Wrestling has always brought a great mix of talent and great quality shows to its fans. Now, it is time to celebrate the 11th year of USA Pro. On Friday night, November 19th, USA Pro Wrestling presents itÂ’s 11th Anniversary Show. The show will take place at the Amazura Concert Hall, 92-10 144th Place in Jamaica, New York. The doors will open at 6 PM and bell time is set for 7 PM. Be sure not to miss out on this landmark event. President and owner Frank Goodman has already signed 6 huge matches! PLUS Â“The Beast from the EastÂ” Bam Bam Bigelow makes his return to professional wrestling! Bam Bam has had some back problems as of late, which caused his temporary hiatus, but on November 19th, Bam Bam is BACK!<br><br>WWE SUPERSTAR AL SNOW to defend his<br>USA PRO WRESTLING HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP<br>Al Snow, who is also a current WWE Superstar, is the newest USA Pro Wrestling champion. He joins a great linage of champions which includes legends like Tito Santana and Sgt. Slaughter, stars of today such as Shane Douglas and Raven, all the way to a young star such as Xavier. USA Pro Wrestling has always had a great champion. Who will Al Snow defend the title against on November 19th? We will announce it next week!<br><br>In the past, USA Pro Wrestling was always been known for bringing fans legends, the stars of yesteryear. As of late USA Pro has taken a different direction with the younger, more high flying and violent superstars. With this being the 11th Anniversary Show, USA Pro has decided to take a step back and return to its old formula by giving you, the fans, a LEGENDS MATCH! On November 19th, THE HONKY TONKY MAN, the self-proclaimed greatest Intercontinental champion of all times, will make his USA Pro Wrestling debut as he squares off against Â“The Ugandan GiantÂ” KAMALA!<br><br>November 19th is going to be a huge night in the lifeÂ’s of Buffe and Mace Mendoza, collectively known as the CHRISTOPHER STREET CONNECTION. Back in September at Mind Games, Buffe gave us all a scare when he was nearly paralyzed. We all feared the worst, hoping that it wasnÂ’t the case, and later in the night, Buffe returned to the building after signing himself out of the hospital. Buffe came out to let everyone know he was ok and to also to tell us all of something he realized. Buffe realized how much he loved Mace and that he would love to ask for his hand in marriage. Frank Goodman wasted no time in giving Mace and Buffe a place to express their love for one another, as on November 19th, Buffe and Mace Mendoza, will get married live, in the ring! Yes, we will host a SAME SEX WEDDING! In addition to getting married, Mace and Buffe will also get a chance at revenge as they will defend their USA PRO WRESTLING TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP, against the man who nearly paralyzed Buffe, Papadon, and his partner Havok, THE SOLUTION who will have Â“SURE THINGÂ” JOHN SHANE in their corner. Will Buffe and Mace walk out of Amazura as a happily married couple with the tag team championship or will The Solution finally win the big one and start earning the respect they feel they deserve? Find out on this historic night.<br><br>After putting on what might have been match of the year against Mike Kruel last month, CHRIS CANDIDO, WITH TAMMY by his side, is set to defend his USA PRO WRESTLING UNITED STATES CHAMPIONSHIP against TRENT ACID, with JOHNNY KASHMERE in his corner,  who is fresh off a very impressive victory over Jack Evans in his return to USA Pro, after a 3 year absence.<br><br>Back in May, USA Pro Wrestling brought back the womenÂ’s championship. APRIL HUNTER won the championship when she pinned POPPALISHUS. Then  in June, April defeated him once more. Now, theses two will meet, in what is PoppalishusÂ’ last chance to win the womenÂ’s title from April, in not just a USA PRO WRESTILNG WOMENÂ’S CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH, but it will have a special stipulation. It will be a BRA AND PANTIES MATCH. Who knows what will happen, especially with PoppalishusÂ’ running buddy, ANGRY YOUNG MAN, in his corner.<br><br>As of late, the hardcore king of New York, Â“LOW LIFEÂ” LOUIE RAMOS, has been wrestling Â“mediocreÂ” opponents. It has been a while since Louie challenged a real wrestling star and someone who specializes in the hardcore, no disqualification matches. Well thatÂ’s all about to change. After hearing of this, Â“The Hardcore Chair Swinging FreakÂ” AXL ROTTEN laid out the challenge and the match has been made. Theses two will meet in what is sure to be a bloodbath!<br><br>Ever since winning the USA PRO WRESTLING X-TREME CHAMPIONSHIP back in May, SLYCK WAGNER BROWN has been on an impressive role with victories over Reefer and Justin Credible. With APRIL HUNTER by his side, Slyck has the confidence that he can beat anyone. On November 19th, Slyck will be defending his X-Treme Championship!<br><br>ALSO SCHEDULED TO APPEAR: DÂ‘Lo Brown, Â“Modern MarvelÂ” Matt Striker w/ Becky Bayless, Balls Mahoney, Jay Lethal, Â“M-TizzleÂ” Mike Tobin, Mike Â“The ShooterÂ” Kruel, Deranged &amp; Reefer, Wayne, Masked Maniac, and many more.<br><br>Ticket prices are as follows:<br>Front Row: $30<br>2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th Rows: $25<br>General Admission: $20<br><br>For Tickets and Information:<br>Call The USA Pro Wrestling Hotlines: 1 (800) 582-5541 or (516) 214-8333<br>OR<br>Visit The Galloping Green<br>149-05 Union Turnpike 1 (71<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> 380-9084<br><br>Visit us on the web for up-to-date information and news at http://www.usaprowrestling.net/</div>
