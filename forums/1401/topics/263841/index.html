Tommy Pope, of the Fayette County SheriffÂ’s Department, in Fayetteville, Ga., the deaths of WWE Superstar Chris Benoit, wife Nancy and son Daniel were the result of a double murder-suicide, WWE.com has learned.<br><br>Benoit failed to appear both at SaturdayÂ’s live event in Beaumont, Texas, and WWEÂ’s Vengeance: Night of Champions in Houston Sunday night, after informing WWE of a family emergency. Several curious text messages sent by Benoit early Sunday morning prompted concerned friends to alert Richard Hering, VP of Government Relations for WWE, Inc. Hering, in turn, spoke with Fayette County sheriffs Monday, and requested they respond to the Benoit residence to check on him and his family.<br><br>Authorities representing the SheriffÂ’s Department initially had a difficult time entering BenoitÂ’s new Fayetteville home Monday afternoon, which had been guarded by two large German Shepherds roaming freely around the property. Once authorities entered the residence, they quickly located the bodies of Benoit, Nancy and Daniel. WWE was notified of the discovery at approximately 4 p.m.<br><br>At 10 p.m. Monday night, Lt. Pope held a press conference in conjunction with Scott Ballard, the district attorney for Fayette County. The press conference officially ruled authoritiesÂ’ findings as a double murder-suicide from within the home.<br><br>WAGA, a FOX-owned and operated television station in Atlanta, reported that investigators believe Benoit killed his wife and 7-year-old son over the weekend, then himself on Monday.<br><br>The three bodies have been received by the Georgia Bureau of InvestigationÂ’s crime lab, in Decatur, Ga., where autopsies will be performed Tuesday morning. Toxicology reports will not become available for at least two weeks.<br><br>WWE.com has further information relating to both the investigation and the cause of death, but the Fayette County SheriffÂ’s Department has requested that WWE.com not release any additional details at this time.</blockquote>RIP Crippler</div>

The message from Benoit stated he missed his flight and over slept and would be late to the WWE Live Event. The co-worker called Benoit back, Benoit confirmed everything he said in his voice message and sounded tired and groggy. Benoit then stated, Â“I love youÂ”. The co-worker stated that it was Â“out of context.Â”<br><br>3:42pm<br>The same co-worker was concerned with BenoitÂ’s tone and demeanor and called Benoit for a second time. Benoit did not answer the call and the co-worker left a message stating Â“just call me back.Â”<br><br>3:44pm<br>Benoit called the co-worker back stating he didnÂ’t answer the call because he was on the phone with Delta changing his flight.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is a sad story and we may never know the truth behind it. Why Benoit took the decision to kill his own wife and son. All i can say is I hope the wrestling business can change itself for the better in terms of welfare for the wrestlers, specifically in terms of drug abuse, family time and lesser workload. The human body is not design to get slam onto a hard canvas 144 days or more every year while travelling all over USA for close to 100 plus days, not exactly what you want for optimal recovery physically and mentally.<br><br></div>
