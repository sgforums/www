This did not please Austin and caused him to not want to participate in the event. Therefore, a substitute for Austin was made in Batista, who will now be the one to face Coachman.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Rock</span><br>In interviews conducted in 2005, Johnson revealed that his contract with World Wrestling Entertainment expired at the end of 2004. He also stated that he is able to continue using his stage name The Rock as part of a dual-ownership agreement with WWE. Pro Wrestling Insider has since reported that Johnson and WWE Chairman Vince McMahon are back on good terms, and he will continue to appear sporadically for the company, as he did after becoming a successful actor. Announcer Jim Ross' Happy Birthday announcement to The Rock on Raw's May 2 broadcast seemed to confirm this, as Ross stated that The Rock is looking forward to future appearances in WWE. It is unknown whether Johnson has signed a new contract, <strong>but it is extremely unlikely that he will ever return to wrestling full-time as long as his Hollywood career continues with success.</strong><br></div>
