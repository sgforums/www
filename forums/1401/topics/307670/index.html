Code breaker by Jericho and he pins JBL. JBL is gone. Everyone is down and JBL returns with chairs! He kills Jericho with a shot, then HBK, stares down with Umaga and backs off. Nope, he nails him too! Jericho is bleeding as well now and HBK is pouring blood. As everyone lays around, the clock runs down and Jeff is in. He attacks Umaga, reverse kick and then the corner dropkick to HBK. Gourd buster to Jericho, rights to HHH and then the poetry in motion to Umaga with an assist from Jericho. HHH is back up and he and HBK work over Jeff. Whisper in the wind by Jeff! Umaga with a stiff kick to Jeff, Catatonic to Jericho and then he places HHH into the tree of woe. HBK gets whipped into HHH and does the flip to the floor. Umaga with a diving head butt to HHH. Umaga goes for the Samoan clambake to Jericho, gets it and they go THROUGH the pod! That looked like it sucked. Umaga has Jericho, but eats a super kick, code breaker and pedigree. Jeff all the way up on the pod and gets the swanton to Umaga! Jericho covers Umaga. SUPERKICK to Jericho, and Jeff covers him and Jericho is gone! Jeff, HBK and HHH left. Twist of Fate to HBK, HHH tosses Jeff to the floor and then pedigrees HBK! 1…2…3! <br><br>We are down to HHH and Jeff now. They brawl, boot by Jeff and he charges HHH but gets tossed to the floor. They fight and Jeff tosses HHH to the cage, and then DDT's him on the floor! Jeff unloads on HHH and then slams him to he cage repeatedly. HHH is busted open and Jeff is just an animal as he beats him down. Jeff on the top rope, leaps at HHH, eats a boot and HHH goes for the pedigree, but Jeff backdrops him back into the ring. MISSES a swanton! PEDIGREE by HHH! 1…2…NO! HHH now gets a chair, lays it down and goes for another pedigree, LOW BLOW by Jeff! Goes for the TOF but HHH tosses him onto the chair! Pedigree on the chair! 1…2…3.<br><br><strong>Winner: HHH @ 24:00 via pin</strong></p>
