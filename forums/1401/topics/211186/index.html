            <div class='col-md body'>I think you'll agree with me that the WWE's main problem right now was that they did not train up enough guys to take over the company when people like The Rock, Austin and Chris Jericho left. Therefore, they end up having only about 5 people in their heavyweight division, while their midcard division is overflowing.<br><br>Let's take a look at the rosters, shall we?<br><br>*(?) means 'not probable'.<br>**(!) means 'should rightfully belong here'.<br><br>Smackdown!:<br><br>Heavyweight division:<br><br>Batista<br>King Booker<br>Chris Benoit (?)<br>Lashley (?)<br>Undertaker (?)<br>Rey Mysterio (?)<br><br>Midcard:<br><br>Chavo<br>Finlay<br>Kennedy<br>Gregory Helms<br>Matt Hardy<br>Tatanka<br>Vito<br>William Regal<br>Mark Henry<br>MVP<br>Terkay<br>Boogeyman<br>Lashley (!)<br>Rey Mysterio (!)<br><br>I don't think Lashley is ready to get catapulted into the main event scene yet. Maybe stick feuding with Finlay and Kennedy for a while. Taker doesn't wrestle as often as he did in the past, and I think his push has long ended years ago. Mysterio is only put in there because of Eddie, and he's now being pushed slowly out of the limelight. Benoit is out to heal from injuries. So, that leaves only 2 on the Smackdown side. So, who on the Smackdown midcard is fit for a title shot? Hardy? Nah. Chavo? Nah. Booygeyman? Nah. Vito? HELL NO. Maybe Lashley can climb the ladder after some time. And maybe Terkay, too, with proper storylines.<br><br>Raw:<br><br>Heavyweight division:<br><br>John Cena<br>HHH (?)<br>HBK (?)<br>Edge<br>Randy Orton (?)<br>Umaga (?)<br>Kane (?)<br><br>Midcard:<br><br>Johnny Nitro<br>Jeff Hardy<br>Carlito<br>Ric Flair<br>Shelton Benjamin<br>Chris Masters<br>Any member of the Spirit Squad<br>Randy Orton (!)<br>Kane (!)<br><br>I don't think DX is going to fall apart so early, so I'm assuming HHH and HBK won't be chasing the title for a while and continue playing pranks and feuding with McMahon. Orton is just a glorified jobber to the stars, and he's getting slowly pushed out of the limelight as well, as can be seen in the feud with Carlito, who is a midcarder. Umaga is just a Samoan, and fatter version of Brock Lesnar, but I'd think that Umaga would be the 'Rar! Me no care about trophies! Me want smash people!' type of guy, so I don't think he'd be chasing the title. That leaves only Cena and Edge. Like Taker, Kane's push ended quite some time ago, and I don't think he'll be chasing the big title again. I don't think Carlito's ready for a big push, and Hardy and Nitro seem to be more suited to the midcard. Flair? Come on now, that guy's too old.<br><br>What are your opinions on the divisions?</div>

During the (hugely botched in my opinion) Invasion angle, many WWE titles were unified with their WCW counterparts, like WWE's Light-Heavyweight with WCW's Cruiserweight.<br><br>While unification would be good for entertainment, it will not happen. Let's look at the ways:<br><br>RAW: 49 superstars<br>Smackdown!: 47 superstars<br><br>That's 96 superstars in total. Let's look at the titles:<br><br>World Heavyweight + WWE Championship = Unified<br>United States + Intercontinental (and European) = Unified<br>Cruiserweight = Already Unified (With Light-Heavyweight)<br>Women's = No unification needed<br>World Tag + WWE Tag = Unified<br><br>That gives us 5 titles in total. How are they going to spread 5 titles through 96 people? It would be fun seeing about 10 people get in the chase for the championship, but it's ridiculous. Even if they brought back other championships like the European championship, which has already been unified with the Intercontinental championship by RVD, it still wouldn't be enough. True, at least the low-midcard people like Val Venis and Charlie Haas can compete for a title, so they have SOME use other than competing on HEAT, but there's too many people to consider. We don't need 8 tag teams chasing the titles.<br><br>I think it would be best for WWE to remain in two split brands, RAW and Smackdown!, with each side practically having their own versions of the titles, with one thing that seperates them from the other (Smackdown! has the Cruiserweight division, RAW has the Women's division).<br><br>In my opinion, they're turning Smackdown! into 'WCW' and RAW into 'WWE'.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Armageddon_arrives:</div><div class="quote_body">"Unification" of the titles was what caused the huge brand split in the first place. During the (hugely botched in my opinion) Invasion angle, many WWE titles were unified with their WCW counterparts, like WWE's Light-Heavyweight with WCW's Cruiserweight.<br><br>While unification would be good for entertainment, it will not happen. Let's look at the ways:<br><br>RAW: 49 superstars<br>Smackdown!: 47 superstars<br><br>That's 96 superstars in total. Let's look at the titles:<br><br>World Heavyweight + WWE Championship = Unified<br>United States + Intercontinental (and European) = Unified<br>Cruiserweight = Already Unified (With Light-Heavyweight)<br>Women's = No unification needed<br>World Tag + WWE Tag = Unified<br><br>That gives us 5 titles in total. How are they going to spread 5 titles through 96 people? It would be fun seeing about 10 people get in the chase for the championship, but it's ridiculous. Even if they brought back other championships like the European championship, which has already been unified with the Intercontinental championship by RVD, it still wouldn't be enough. True, at least the low-midcard people like Val Venis and Charlie Haas can compete for a title, so they have SOME use other than competing on HEAT, but there's too many people to consider. We don't need 8 tag teams chasing the titles.<br><br>I think it would be best for WWE to remain in two split brands, RAW and Smackdown!, with each side practically having their own versions of the titles, with one thing that seperates them from the other (Smackdown! has the Cruiserweight division, RAW has the Women's division).<br><br>In my opinion, they're turning Smackdown! into 'WCW' and RAW into 'WWE'. Look at the titles. They've made it so that the old WCW titles go on one brand, and the new WWE titles go on the other.<br><br>Cruiserweight? WCW.<br>Big Gold Belt? WCW.<br>United States? WCW.<br><br>WWE Championship? Speaks for itself. WWE<br>Intercontinental? WWE<br>Women's? WWE<br><br></div></blockquote>i dun mind other titles such as ic, us, 2 tag-teams or women... but pls keep wwe title, world title n ecw title unified. there are 3champions and everyone are puzzled which champion is prestiged.<br><br>i suggest the champion should allow to travel on 3 shows to defend his title. as a champ, he has the responsible to defend.</div>
