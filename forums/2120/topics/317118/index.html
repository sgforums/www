              <p><strong><span class="title">Quick buck on rice: FairPrice acts</span></strong></p>
              <p><span> AS RICE prices head north, some traders and small businesses are
              apparently turning to Singapore's largest supermarket retailer to make
              a fast buck. They seem to be buying the cheaper rice sold at NTUC
              FairPrice to resell them at a higher price.
              </span></p><div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              To
              discourage such bulk buying, which would reduce stocks and potentially
              drive up prices, FairPrice, for the past month, has been advising
              customers to buy no more than five 10kg bags of rice each.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              If
              customers were to attempt to buy in excessive amounts – say, 20 bags of
              rice – FairPrice staff would intervene and tell customers they could
              not do so under the policy.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              "We
              have seen a handful of customers who have bought excessive bags of
              rice," said FairPrice managing director (Singapore) Seah Kian Peng in a
              statement on Friday. "We suspect that these are traders or small
              businesses who take advantage of our low pricing."
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              According
              to FairPrice, about "a handful" of customers have been stopped by staff
              from buying large amounts of rice since the measure took effect.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Mr Seah gave the assurance that FairPrice has "adequate supplies of rice" and that its stockpile is at a "healthy balance".
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              While
              the policy has been in place for about a month, some frontline staff at
              one FairPrice supermarket were unaware of the measure.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              "We don't know about this ... if customers want to buy  20 bags also can," one cashier told this newspaper.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              According
              to rice importer Chye Choon Foods' managing director Jimmy Soh, the
              steep prices in rice had initially resulted in some hawkers going to
              supermarkets for rice supplies rather than wholesalers.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              "Retail prices don't fluctuate as quickly as wholesale prices, so wholesale rice became more expensive," he said.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              But
              for traders and small business owners to buy from a retailer and resell
              at a higher price, Mr Soh felt that the profit margins were not
              significant enough for it to become a widespread practice.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              When
              approached by Weekend Today, hawkers and food caterers said they did
              not buy rice from FairPrice, because wholesalers would deliver the rice
              to them. "Most caterers will at least order 50kg each time, so it's
              more convenient. It's also sometimes cheaper than NTUC," said Ms
              Marilyn Fong, 36, purchase manager for KCK Food Catering.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Said
              Mr Chua Chin Teck, 50, a worker at a pig organ soup stall: "It is more
              convenient to get from suppliers because we have no time to go to NTUC."
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Other supermarket chains in Singapore said they were not planning similar measures.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Mr
              Wong Heng San, spokes-man for Sheng Siong Supermarket, said: "We don't
              see a need for such a limitation, because we are not selling our rice
              below cost. If retailers sell their rice below cost, then maybe they
              will be a bit more worried about how much people buy."
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Rice sales are stable and stocks remain adequate, he added.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              A
              spokesperson for Giant Hypermart and the Cold Storage Group said that
              there are "no quotas (on buying rice) except during rice promotions.
              There's no necessity for it currently as rice sales are stable".
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Consumers we spoke to did not feel that the move would affect them as they did not buy rice in large amounts.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Bank
              officer Fazlinda Sallim, 35, said while the NTUC policy could make it
              inconvenient for people to buy in bulk, "they can still buy them on
              different days, or just go to other outlets to buy the rice".
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              A
              quota of some kind on customers could be a good measure in the short
              term, as it would help to prevent artificial inflation of prices
              because of hoarding, said S Rajaratnam School of International Studies
              associate research fellow Ng Sue Chia.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Whether
              FairPrice's approach of encouragement rather than enforcement would be
              effective is "hard to gauge", said Ms Ng, but it was sure to create the
              awareness needed to prevent opportunistic behaviour.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Also,
              the frontline staff would have to explain clearly to consumers the
              rationale behind such recommendations. "If not, the consumers might
              interpret the move as an indication of further reduction in rice
              supplies," said Ms Ng.<p></p>

              <p>I can only say, just buy enough for your own needs... keeping rice for too long, it will start growing weevils</p>
              <p>anyway, what NTUC been saying recently are not really the true picture... Back then they said they're able to keep prices low with March's purchase, in reality it does not really effect much because of the 2/3 govt quota (You sell 1 ton of rice this month, another 2 ton has to go to the govt's reserve)</p>
              <p>so even you've sold up all your sellable rice, you are not allowed to touch the store's rice until new shipment arrives so end up this March price would only last for that batch of rice</p>

              <h1 class="clr">FairPrice discourages consumers from buying more than 5 packets of rice</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A shopper at a FairPrice supermarket told Channel NewAsia he
              was not allowed to buy more than three packets of rice. FairPrice said
              the restriction is to protect consumer interest.</p>
              <p>The supermarket chain is discouraging consumers from buying more
              than five 10—kilogramme packets of rice per shopping trip. The
              restriction is to prevent traders from taking advantage of the low
              price.</p>
              <p>FairPrice said it offers one of the most competitive prices and has re—assured consumers that the supply of rice is adequate.</p>
              <p>It
              also said most consumers should not be affected by the restriction.
              This is because most families take a while to finish a 10—kilogramme
              bag of rice.</p>
              <p>Other major supermarkets — such as Sheng Siong, Cold Storage and Giant — have no such restriction.</p>
              <p>The supermarkets have also said that the prices have stabilised and the rush to buy rice has also eased. — CNA/vm</p>
