              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: NTUC FairPrice said it is expanding its chain of 
              hypermarkets to increase accessibility for customers, with the launch of
               its fourth outlet at Nex mall in Serangoon on Tuesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>FairPrice said it expects to have six hypermarkets in Singapore by 2013 to provide greater convenience to its customers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The supermarket chain is looking to launch its fifth outlet in the eastern part of Singapore within a year.<br><br>It said it aims to provide at least one hypermarket in the North, South, East and West heartland areas of Singapore.<br><br>Ng Ser Miang, the chairman of FairPrice said the expansion will not have a negative impact on smaller proprietors.<br><br>"We
               always believe in co-existing with them. And the example of Ang Mo Kio 
              Hub, we bring in a lot of traffic so the small provision shops also 
              benefit from it. And because of the size and the different range of 
              products that we carry, so we serve different segments as well."<br><br>Addressing inflation concerns, he said that hypermarkets help to keep food items affordable.<br><br>"The
               hyperformat format has helped to contribute to the economies of scale 
              that we are able to negotiate for better prices. We have been concerned 
              with the inflation since last year, so we are able to stockpile more 
              rice for example, so we are able to hold the price of rice till August. 
              And for the 500 essential items, we have promised to hold prices and 
              even give discounts until May," said Mr Ng.<br><br>The new outlet at Nex
               is the second FairPrice hypermarket to offer 24-hour shopping 
              convenience. In total, there are 30 FairPrice outlets that operates 24 
              hours. It also features the largest live seafood selection among all 
              other outlets.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
