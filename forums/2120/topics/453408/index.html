              <p>STOMPer <strong>Leticia</strong> was annoyed to see a bus driver allowing and a passenger to bring a supermarket trolley onto the bus and even helping her to get on board. The STOMPer is worried that the trolley might pose a danger to other passengers. <br><br>The STOMPer wrote:<br><br>"I could not believe what I'd seen with my own eyes on Wednesday night at 8pm.  <br><br>"After a tiring day at work, I couldn't wait to go home to have my dinner. When I was queuing to take a Comfort Delgro shuttle bus to my condominium, I noticed this well-dressed woman 'in heels' queuing with a full<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="il">supermarket</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>trolley. I thought to myself, 'Why don't she just take a cab?!!'<br><br>" When the bus arrived, she went up and spoke to the driver. The rest of us had to wait for her before we could board. She moved aside as the driver waved to us to signal us to board the bus. When I got my seat, I thought to myself again, 'She can't be asking the driver to help her to bring up all her shopping bags.' When all the passengers had boarded the bus, the driver went to help her to bring not just the shopping bags on to the bus, but with the trolley too.<br><br>"I said 'ridiculous' loudly enough for other passengers to hear and they all looked at me. One of the passengers in front of me agreed and said that we needed to take pictures of this.  I whipped out my iPhone and took photos. She was aware of all these. Guess what?? When the bus door was closed, the trolley was blocking the bus entrance. Shouldn't both of them consider about the safety hazard?  <br><br>"During the ride, the driver and the woman started conversing.  Now I know why the driver helped her -- <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>they are both PRCs</strong></span>. Is this the right attitude of a bus driver?? The woman did not dare to look at us the whole time, but she still had the cheek to tell the driver that she would be taking his bus the next day to return the trolley!!!!!  I was speechless!!<br><br>"When it was time to alight at the first stop, she had the driver to help her brought the trolley down. Watch the video carefully!!  She knew she was being recorded but she refused to look up.<br><br>"Singapore is not a place for you to do what you want as if you were in your own country. This is what has caused all Singaporeans to be disgusted with badly-behaved immigrants. Obviously, she must have gotten in here through money and not through her education or professional skills. It really makes us Singaporeans look bad especially to foreigners who might think that these badly-behaved people are Singaporeans.  I wish the government would take a closer look at these immigrants. I believe that we can't be so desperate that we need such people in our country. It is already bad enough that Singaporeans are known to be unfriendly. <br><br>"I would like this to be shared to the other Singaporeans." </p>
