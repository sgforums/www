              <h1 class="clr">FairPrice cuts housebrand prices</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: After three months of soaring rice prices, consumers can afford to breathe a little easier for now.</p>
              <p>From today, the prices of eight types of NTUC FairPrice’s housebrand
              rice will be reduced by between 5 and 12 per cent, Singapore’s largest
              supermarket chain announced on Thursday.</p>
              <p>This marks the first time FairPrice is cutting the prices of its housebrands since rice prices shot up in March.</p>
              <p>A
              5kg bag of its Thai Fragrant White Rice will cost S$7.45, down from
              S$8.50, while its Thai White Rice — the cheapest type — will be sold at
              S$6.95 for a 5kg bag, instead of S$7.50.</p>
              <p>Although global rice
              prices peaked about three weeks ago, the price of rice had been
              expected to fall in recent months, as major producers in South—east
              Asia braced themselves for harvesting bumper crops.</p>
              <p>But CIMB—GK
              economist Song Seng Wun was circumspect on whether the price of rice
              would continue to drop across the board, pointing out that the initial
              spike was triggered by unpredictable factors such as inclement weather
              and panic—buying.</p>
              <p>“At least for now, there is more stability for
              rice, a staple food here,” he said. “But having said that, the price of
              rice is still significantly higher than that of a year ago.”</p>
              <p>On
              Wednesday, a survey by the Consumers Association of Singapore (Case)
              provided the first indications of a respite for consumers when it
              revealed that the prices for a handful of imported rice brands, such as
              Golden Peony and Royal Umbrella, had dipped.</p>
              <p>But the survey also showed that prices of housebrands had risen in the last month.</p>
              <p>FairPrice
              group chief executive Tan Kian Chew added that the company was “still
              clearing the existing stock of rice bought at a higher price”.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Tan said: “Due to our prudent buying strategy, we have managed to
              secure new shipments of rice at a lower price. Although the new
              shipments will arrive only in end July ... FairPrice is committed to
              pass on the anticipated savings to our customers.”</p>
              <p>TODAY was
              unable to reach the other supermarket chains at press time, but Case
              executive director Seah Seng Choon said that FairPrice’s competitors
              might follow suit “if they were concerned with competition”.</p>
              <p>Still,
              Mr Seah added: “In the short run, there would be price rigidity and
              prices might not go down as much as consumers want to see. But the
              prices shouldn’t be going up.” — TODAY/fa</p>
