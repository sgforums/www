              <h1 class="clr">NTUC FairPrice extends discount on housebrand items</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Some National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) social
              enterprises have adjusted selected existing initiatives to help
              Singaporeans stretch their dollar and manage the rising cost of living.</p>
              <p>In December 2007, NTUC FairPrice said consumers could enjoy a five
              percent discount on 500 essential housebrands until February this year.</p>
              <p>But
              due to overwhelming response, the offer was extended until the end of
              this month. Now, Tan Kian Chew, who is the CEO of NTUC FairPrice, said
              the offer will be extended for a second time.</p>
              <p>"We are going to extend a final extension of this five percent discount on our housebrand items up to end of July."</p>
              <p>NTUC
              Healthcare, on the other hand, says it will launch eight more Unity
              pharmacy outlets all over the island this year — bringing the number up
              to almost 50.</p>
              <p>Its CEO, Bernard Lee, said: "Our latest one is at
              Liang Court. The next few coming up are at Yew Tee, Tampines and West
              Coast Plaza. We also want to increase the number of distribution points
              for Medicare and Denticare by 20 percent, from 20 distribution points
              to 24."</p>
              <p>Medicare was formed to provide affordable medical
              services for individuals and companies while Denticare is its dental
              equivalent.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said he will also increase the number of discounted health products sold at its Unity pharmacies from 100 to 120.</p>
              <p>These are commonly purchased items such as vitamins and health supplements.</p>
              <p>As for NTUC Foodfare, it will extend its ’supervalue breakfast set’ initiative for another year.</p>
              <p>The
              scheme was first launched in 2006 and it aims to help union members as
              well as senior citizens enjoy a proper meal to start their day.</p>
              <p>For less than $2, they can visit any NTUC Foodfare outlet to purchase their meal, said its CEO Perry Ong.</p>
              <p>"This
              set comes with either a cup of coffee, or tea, two slices of toasted
              bread and kaya and two eggs. For the May Day celebrations, NTUC
              Foodfare will be offering to all union members and elderly Singaporeans
              a five percent discount across all our coffeeshops and foodcourts and
              for every Tuesday, the elderly Singaporeans will be able to get a five
              percent discount for their purchases as well. So if they are also a
              union member, they will enjoy a total of ten percent discount."</p>
              <p>NTUC
              has 12 social enterprises and all of them aim to help workers manage
              their cost of living. These include NTUC Childcare, aimed at helping
              women join the workforce, and NTUC Club which was formed to help
              Singaporeans gain access to affordable lifestyle products. —938LIVE.</p>
