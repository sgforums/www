              <h1 class="clr">’Bring Your Own Bag Day’ to be weekly affair from June 4</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Come June 4, the popular ’Bring Your Own Bag Day’ (BYOBD)
              will become a weekly affair. Every Wednesday will be designated ’Bring
              Your Own Bag Day’ at participating retailers, which include major
              supermarket chains.</p>
              <p>In consumer surveys by the National Environment Agency (NEA), 60 per
              cent of the 1,000 respondents said they support the campaign.</p>
              <p>However,
              only up to 20 per cent brought their own bags. This was because the
              majority were confused as to which Wednesday of the month was ’Bring
              Your Own Bag Day’.</p>
              <p>So the Singapore Environment Council and NEA have now decided that the BYOBD movement will be put in place on all Wednesdays.</p>
              <p>Retailers
              said they have sold 510,000 reusable bags since the campaign started
              last April and saved up to 20 per cent in plastic bags.</p>
              <p>Home—Fix
              is the latest retailer to join the BYOBD movement. Other participating
              retailers include Carrefour, Cold Storage, Giant, NTUC Fairprice, Prime
              Supermarket, Sheng Siong, Shop N Save, Autobacs, Rehab Mart and
              Stamford Tyres. — CNA/vm</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: NTUC FairPrice spends more than S$10,000 a month in rebates for shoppers who bring their own bags.</p>
              <p>Its 'Bring Your Own Bag’ campaign gives out 10 cents for every S$10 spent.</p>
              <p>Employees
              at FairPrice are also given cloth bags to reduce the use of plastic
              bags. And to cut down on the use of electricity, air—conditioning is
              turned off before 6pm.</p>
              <p>Around the office, they take the
              initiative by using less paper and printing on both sides. Bins are
              also strategically placed to make it more convenient for employees to
              recycle.</p>
              <p>Gerry Lee, General Manager, NTUC FairPrice, said: "They
              are showing an example, they are walking the talk. We have to show it

              <p>Giant staff at IMM made me pay 10cents on bring your own bag day.</p>
              <p>officially it says 'donate' 10 cents if you need a plastic bag but the staff insist i pay the 10 cents.</p>
              <p>when i question the staff about the word 'donate', it seems like that kaling dont know english.</p>
              <p>in the end, i decide not to buy anything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is there anyway i can get giant's management to comment on this stupid bring your own bag day campaign and the word 'donate'?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i really hate bring your own bag day campaign. such an inconvenience for shoppers</p>
              <p>I suggest to boycott all shops participating in the campaign</p>
              <p>so what are your views on BYOBD?</p>
              <p>it think its an half ass effort. if saving the enviroment is so important, ban plastic bags out right.</p>
              <p>to me, it is just another stupid campaign where the plastic bags sellers still work as per normal and government give another excuse to grab our money</p>
              <p>boycott all shops involve in BYOBD</p>
