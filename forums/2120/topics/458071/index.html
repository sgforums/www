            <div class='col-md body'>The recent spate of trolley theft has raised our concern. Thus, we are first year junior college students embarking on a project that aims to curb trolley theft. Please do look at this video and give us comments on how we can improve our proposal. Thanks :)</div>

              <p><strong>The New Paper</strong><br> <em>Thursday, Apr 26, 2012</em></p>
              <p>Go to the blocks at Klang Lane in Little India and you may find something odd among the normal shoe racks and clothes lines.</p>
              <p>You are likely to see trolleys from the nearby Mustafa Centre.</p>
              <p>And the fact that some of their neighbours in Blocks 671A, 671B, 
                      672A, and 672B are taking the trolleys home and parking them 
                      indiscriminately in the corridors are annoying some residents there.</p>
              <p>Mrs Ashley Lim, 37, who lives in Block 672B, said that her neighbour has been taking shopping trolleys to their home upstairs.</p>
              <p>"I'll see a trolley from Mustafa once every two or three months. When
                       they leave it on the corridor alongside their laundry and baby 
                      strollers, it creates a fire hazard," she said.</p>
              <p>When The New Paper visited the blocks on Wednesday, we found eight trolleys, all dumped along the common corridors.</p>
              <p>One, found on the 10th floor of a block, was secured to a pipe with a bicycle lock.</p>
              <p>It had a blue handle and no coin-operated trolley lock, similar to the trolleys from Mustafa.</p>
              <p>Residents of units that had trolleys outside were not in when TNP visited, or declined to comment.</p>
              <p>A maid working at Block 672B said she first observed trolleys being left at the common corridors a year ago.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old said: "I notice one family brings a trolley home and 
                      leaves it outside their flat. It usually happens once a week."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Mr Ken Cheong, 43, another Klang Lane resident, said a Mustafa Centre
                       salesman had encouraged him to use the trolley to carry his purchases 
                      home when he bought a television from the store.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Mr Cheong, who lives at Block 671A, added: "The salesman said to take the trolley to move my things back to my flat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"He said to leave it near the nearby hotel (the Hotel Grand 
                      Chancellor) after we were done, and that people would come by to collect
                       it.</span></p>
              <p>"(The trolleys) would always disappear a few days later."</p>
              <p>Mrs Cheong added: "You will see more and more trolleys appearing, but they will be gone every few days."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Mustafa Centre's general manager Alan Loo said that users do not need to put in a deposit to use one of its trolleys.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">He explained: "Tourists shopping in Mustafa usually don't have 
                      one-dollar coins with them, so we do not want to inconvenience them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">"Foreign workers also may not have coins, so it's the same for them."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">The store does not mind if shoppers take the trolley with them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Mr Loo told TNP: "The trolleys can be freely used by whichever 
                      customers that come in. They are free to bring their trolleys out to 
                      carry their things. It's part of our service to our customers."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>He said that Mustafa Centre employs a team to collect trolleys from the vicinity.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>"We have a group of eight staff members who operate daily to collect 
                      our trolleys in a 2km radius around the centre, going as far as 
                      Bendemeer Road, Balestier and along Serangoon Road.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong><br>Responsible customers </strong></p>
              <p>"However, most customers leave their trolleys at trolley bays near our entrances. Mustafa customers are quite responsible.</p>
              <p>"We have hundreds of trolleys, but lose only a few, less than 10, per
                       quarter," he said. Each trolley costs around $400, he said.</p>
              <p>What about the reports of stray trolleys from Klang Lane residents?</p>
              <p>Said Mr Loo: "This may be an isolated case. It's not possible for our staff to check every floor of every block.</p>
              <p>"The responsibility must be on customers to return the trolley, even if it is during their next visit to Mustafa."</p>
              <p>He added that customers sometimes give staff tip-offs on the whereabouts of trolleys.</p>
              <p>"Long-time customers sometimes inform our security guards about where they have spotted our trolleys.</p>
              <p>"They are also welcome to call our office."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;">Both Giant and Sheng Siong supermarkets said that customers would be 
                      reminded by staff to return trolleys, but they faced no penalties for 
                      failing to do so.</span></p>
