              <p><strong>Case checks on rice price: right or wrong?</strong></p>
              <p>A SURVEY on the price of rice by the Consumers Association of
                          Singapore (Case) is making at least one supermarket chain see red and
                          raising questions on whether its checks are done right.</p>
              <p>Case released on Wednesday the prices of 10 brands of fragrant rice at eight supermarket chains.</p>
              <p>The survey compared prices of 5kg and 10kg bags of rice - 16
                          products in all - on May 6 and 7, and showed that Sheng Shiong
                          supermarket at Ten Mile Junction on Woodlands Road had the highest
                          prices for seven.</p>
              <p>The price difference was substantial in some cases: A 10kg
                          bag of Golden Phoenix Fragrant Rice that cost $18.80 at a Prime
                          supermarket was tagged at $28 at Sheng Siong, a local outfit which grew
                          from a single neighbourhood store to a major chain in the last few
                          years on the back of a reputation for competitive pricing.</p>
              <p>But a Sheng Shiong spokesman said Case's prices are wrong.</p>
              <p>She said the $28 bag of rice actually cost $26.30 - substantially
                          different from Case's listing, but still the most expensive in the
                          list.</p>
              <p>Case was also wrong when it came to the 5kg bag of the same brand.</p>
              <p>It reported that it cost $15, when it actually cost $13.30, the spokesman claimed.</p>
              <p>She said: 'The prices are so different, it is impossible that
                          this is so ... Case must have made a mistake, we have never charged
                          such prices for our rice.'</p>
              <p>Another supermarket also said a price listing for its product was wrong.</p>
              <p>Case listed the price of a 10kg bag of Golden Phoenix Fragrant
                          Rice at Shop N Save to be $19.65, but it actually cost $20.40, said the
                          supermarket's spokesman.</p>
