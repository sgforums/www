              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice has pledged to hold 
              the price of its house brand of Thai rice till year-end amid concerns of
               increased rice prices, following the flooding situation in Thailand.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>FairPrice said it 
              will also hold the price of its Jasmine Fragrant rice from Vietnam till 
              after the Lunar New Year season next year, in end-February 2012.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>NTUC FairPrice CEO Seah Kian Peng said: "For the last few months, already, we've been stockpiling our rice. <br><br>"Right now, we do have a stockpile -- this should see us through at least for the next few months. <br><br>"What
               happens a few months from now, I think we'll certainly monitor the 
              situation, but as I've said, we're looking at other countries; we're 
              stockpiling more Vietnamese rice. In fact, we've stockpiled over four 
              months."<br><br>FairPrice said it has also stockpiled about three months of Thai rice. <br><br>FairPrice said more consumers are also switching from Thai rice to alternative sources.<br><br>Demand
               for Thai rice has dropped from 95 per cent in 2007, to 75 per cent this
               year and a 25 per cent year-on-year increase has also been seen in the 
              demand for Vietnamese rice.<br><br>Vietnam is now the world's second-largest exporter of rice.<br><br>Minister
               of State for Trade and Industry Lee Yi Shyan, who is also chairman of 
              the Retail Price Watch Group (RPWG), said Singaporeans should consider 
              the wide variety of rice available.<br><br>FairPrice has also donated S$20,000 to the Singapore Red Cross South East Asia Flood Appeal.<br><br>It urges customers to donate generously to the cause.<br><br>- CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <h1>Doubts cloud Thailand's rice pricing plan</h1>
              <p><span><span>BANGKOK: The Thai government has launched a new
                                      programme to help its rice farmers. But with Thailand being a world
                                      leading exporter of rice, critics said the move could hurt the
                                      country's position.<br> <br> For over 30 years, Thailand has been the world's biggest exporter
                                      of rice.<br> <br> This year alone, the country is expected to produce over 20 million
                                      tons of it, despite rising competition from its regional
                                      rivals.<br> <br> But that could change soon.<br> <br> One of the key policies of newly-elected Prime Minister Yingluck
                                      Shinawatra is a rice pricing scheme, under which the government
                                      buys rice from the farmers at a price of 15,000 baht (US$480) - 50
                                      per cent more than the regular market price.<br> <br> What is primarily aimed to help Thailand's eight million rice
                                      farmers could have broader implications on the domestic and
                                      international markets.<br> <br> It was one of the factors that helped the Puea Thai Party win the
                                      elections last July, thanks to its rural supporter base.<br> <br> But according to critics, not all farmers will equally profit from
                                      this scheme.<br> <br> Dr Nipon Poapongsakorn, president of the Thailand Development and
                                      Research Institute said: "Those farmers who have rice to sell to
                                      the government benefit. But farmers and consumers, particularly
                                      farmers who do not have rice to sell, do not benefit at all."<br> <br> Dr Poapongsakorn explained that farmers who do not produce rice for
                                      their own consumption will have to buy the staple at a higher
                                      price.<br> <br> Thailand's Commerce Ministry has tried to calm fears of spiralling
                                      costs for both the market and the taxpayer, saying the pricing
                                      scheme will cost much less than the estimated US$12.8
                                      billion.<br> <br> But opponents see too many fault lines and much prefer the price
                                      guarantee scheme of the previous Democrat-led government.<br> <br> Niphond Wongtra-ngan, former president of the Thai Rice Millers
                                      Association said: "Under the price guarantee programme (of the
                                      Democrat-led government), money went to the farmers faster. The
                                      guaranteed price was 10,000 baht per ton. Should farmers sell rice
                                      at 6,000 to 7,000 baht, they will get compensated."<br> <br> Furthermore, private rice exporters accuse the government of
                                      monopolising the rice trade, as collusion among a few exporters
                                      close to the administration and price fixing could occur.<br> <br> Internationally, the pricing scheme will also cause ripple effects
                                      on the market.<br> <br> Dr Poapongsakorn said: "I expect that the world price of rice will
                                      increase, because we are one of the major exporters... But who
                                      benefits? Our competitors - not Thailand!"<br> <br> After all, the consumer could be the one who ultimately pays the
                                      bill, as the price of rice is set to increase.<br> <br> As for the farmers, it has yet to be seen if they will really
                                      benefit from the new pricing scheme.</span></span></p>
