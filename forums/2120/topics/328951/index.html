              <div><br></div>
              <div>A STOMPer's 84-year-old mother was
              overcharged on several occasions and made to pay for items she didn't
              purchase at this store, and he wishes to remind members of the public
              to be careful and check their receipts before leaving.<br> <br> <strong></strong></div>
              <div><strong><strong>Taiwandonald</strong></strong> was fuming mad the last time this happened.</div>
              <div><br> He recounted, in an email to STOMP:<br> <br> "I am writing on behalf  of my aged mother, 84 years old.<br> <br> "She is a frequent customer of Shop and Save at Pasir Ris Drive 4.<br> <br> "Many a times, she told us that she was overcharged for things that she did not buy. <br> <br> "On two occasions it was just $2 and another occasion $3 over dollars. <br> <br> "those times, when she told us, it was late evening when we, family members were home from work.<br> <br> "The lapse between her claims was more than 8 hours, so we did not bother to approach Shop and Save for the difference.<br> <br> "However, on National Day,  she was again charged for 5 kg of Rice that she did not buy.<br> <br> "This time we were at home. I was very angry because 5kg and all the
              items she bought in the pictures are too heavy for an old lady to carry
              and walk more than 1 km home.<br> <br> "We went back to Shop and Save , and asked for the store manager. A lady came but did not identify herself.<br> <br> "We showed her the bag of items we bought, asked her three times why my
              mother was overcharged but she remained silent and walked away and
              murmuring, " it's only S$7.95 for rice."<br> <br> "I lost my cool and shouted and her, asking her what she meant by that.<br> <br> "Just then a man came out and identified himself as the store manager. He had witnessed his staff attitude and apologised.<br> <br> "Then he said he will investigate the matter of overcharging. <br> <br> "We were refunded the difference but I did not hear any more from the
              management, except receiving just a call from store manager that it was
              just a mistake.<br> <br> "I have a concern here-- how can the staff just say "It's only $7.95"
              when they charged an old lady who can't see or read English well for
              something she didn't buy?<br> <br> "I wonder how many similar incidents have gone unnoticed.<br> <br> "Shoppers , check your receipt when you make purchases or you will be the losers."<br> <br> STOMP is contacting the store for a response. Watch this space for updates.</div>

              Please lor... You think that their coy so stupid to let staffs bring home stuffs that they did not have a receipt for? It is purely a mistake lah... But then again... How the hell does an item that she did not buy ended up in the receipt? It would be reasonable if it is double scanned...
              
              Or maybe there might be a big conspiracy going on in that shop like what the previous people said...

              <p>Overcharging is ridiculous. I am pretty sure all items have to be scanned and if the rice wasn't there the cashier must have done something to get it into the receipt.</p>
              <p>So, I don't think the store should get away just by saying it is a mistake. How to make mistake unless the casheir scan a barcode for a bag of rice without the old lady knowing. As said, she bring it home......that's my theory</p>

              <p>Overcharging is ridiculous. I am pretty sure all items have to be scanned and if the rice wasn't there the cashier must have done something to get it into the receipt.</p>
              <p>So, I don't think the store should get away just by saying it is a mistake. How to make mistake unless the casheir scan a barcode for a bag of rice without the old lady knowing. As said, she bring it home......that's my theory</p>
              <p>Shop and Save isn't save anymore.......</p>
