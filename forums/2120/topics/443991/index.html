              FairPrice will remain the same until after the Chinese New Year 
              celebrations, at the end of February 2012.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They cover nine brands, from basic white rice to superior Thai Hom Mali fragrant rice.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>NTUC FairPrice CEO 
              Seah Kian Peng said prices of Thai rice appear to have softened in the 
              past week as the flood situation in Thailand improves.<br><br>He hopes that this trend will continue.<br><br>"We
               know many of our customers still love Thai rice, so we are making a 
              commitment to hold prices till after the Chinese New Year celebrations. 
              This is part of our social role to help ensure that essential food items
               will always be available to our customers at stable and affordable 
              prices," he said.<br><br>In November, amid concerns about rising Thai 
              rice prices due to the floods in Thailand, FairPrice froze the prices of
               its housebrand Thai rice till end December 2011 to moderate the cost of
               daily essentials.<br><br>FairPrice said prices of housebrand rice at outlets have remained largely unchanged for the past 12 months.<br><br>It has even reduced prices of some of its brands.<br><br>For
               example, a bag of FairPrice Thai white rice cost S$6.95 (5kg pack) in 
              2009, but it the price has dropped by 10 per cent to S$6.20 (5kg pack) 
              since January this year. <br><br>FairPrice Thai Fragrant white rice cost
               S$7.45 (5kg pack) in 2009 but the price has also dropped - by 8 per 
              cent to S$6.90 (5kg pack) since January this year.<br> <br>Since 
              November, FairPrice has also been asking consumers to try Vietnamese 
              Jasmine fragrant rice, by holding prices of its FairPrice Jasmine 
              Fragrant Rice from Vietnam till end February 2012. <br><br>Sales of Vietnamese rice have increased by more than 10 per cent.<br><br>"This
               shows that our customers are open to trying alternative rice, and this 
              gives us the motivation to continue to source for other alternatives to 
              further boost the reliability and price stability of rice supply for our
               customers," said Mr Seah.<br><br>Apart from Thailand and Vietnam, FairPrice also sources for rice from Cambodia, India, Pakistan, Japan, Korea and the USA. <br> <br>It stockpiles more than three months' supply to keep prices stable.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>FairPrice continues to freeze price of rice till end-June</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Retail chain NTUC FairPrice says it is extending 
              price freeze on all its housebrand rice from Thailand and Vietnam until 
              the end of June 2012.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Its CEO Seah Kian 
              Peng said: "FairPrice was founded to help moderate the cost of living 
              and we will continue to uphold this commitment. We know rice is an 
              important staple for Singaporeans and with rising transport and living 
              costs, we want to do our part to help customers stretch their dollar 
              when it comes to daily essentials." </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In November 2011, 
              amidst customers' concerns about rising rice prices due to the flood 
              situations in Thailand, FairPrice took the lead to freeze the prices of 
              its housebrand Thai and Vietnamese rice till end February 2012 to allay 
              consumers' fears. <br><br>As one of the major rice importers in 
              Singapore, FairPrice stockpiles more than three months' supply of rice 
              to ensure reliability of supply and stability of price. <br><br>Prices 
              of rice are kept stable due to the policy of stockpiling, diversified 
              sourcing, forward buying, direct importing, bulk buying and contract 
              prices with manufacturers. <br><br>FairPrice imports rice from diverse sources including Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Pakistan, Japan, Korea and USA.<br><br>Retail
               chains under the Dairy Farm Group, Cold Storage, Shop N Save and Giant 
              have also extended their price freeze on the price of their housebrand 
              rice to end-June 2012.<br><br>- CNA/ck/ms</span></span></p>
