In fact, most of the members of PPCSG.com has given good reviews.<br><br>In fact, when considering any device, you must look at the after sales service. So far, O2 has been severely lacking. I know cos I owned 2 O2 devices previously. Warranty support is very poor.<br><br>Whereas the support given by HP is nothing short of superb.<br><br>And that is the difference between outsourced servicing on a relatively smaller number of products out in the market, compared to an established brand in Singapore with the ability to provide quality service.<br><br>Have you ever seen one for one exchange given by Semitech? HP provides that. Dealing with electronic products is heng/suay, best to have good after sales service as insurance.<br><br>Besides, you do know both devices are OEM'ed by Quanta? Only diff software, which HP is releasing its 1st ROM update after just 1 month of introduction to market?</div>
