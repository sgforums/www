No one will give a son a snake went he ask for bread, or give a son poison went he ask for water. You want to poison me. Why me my friend?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Start a savings, get a job (whether u like it or not, no choice) and move out! ItÂ’s your life, there are no legal obligations on why you should do that business or listen to anyone else.<br><br>Everything else is moral bullshit, and you can basically ignore those if you are willing to commit.<br><br>Yes everything else is moral bullshit. I am willing to commit. Who will help me went I find a job.<br><br>It's so easy to say get a job &amp; start a savings. Year 2003 I apply for part time job, full time job &amp; contract job. For the two years I find for job, no give me a job. Then my brother saw me no job for two years then he force me to do business. The business I do, I get no money. I get treat. Life like prison. You know so boring, so lonely &amp; there is no hobbies to do &amp; no game to play. I ask the bloody priest for help, he doesnÂ’t want to help me. I went to CDC, SINDA, MP, no one seem to help me. I feel very helpless. Like I have a body but I can't move my hands &amp; legs. I all time think of killing myself. Can you give me tips or clue to break free. About your www.twistedhopes.com Blog, I am not sure how to go through. This year 2005 then I use internet fully. I  donÂ’t know about computer or internet. I got to use computer year 2001, once a month or not. Went I work my last job, my friend that day friend, he told me how to trick my brother to use internet. I still follow his style. Went my brother come, I swift to business job &amp; act busy until he call me.</div>
