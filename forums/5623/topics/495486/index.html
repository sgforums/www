              1. The sensor systems sometimes fail.  Before you can do anything,  it will flush a few times. Sometimes nobody in the cubicle also  flush.  (guarantee not 7 months (=hungry ghost festival {must explain because my book is going to be launched  world wide. Then again,  more words mean more money for me.  Plang,  plang,  plang I can hear the jackpot sound }) . 2nd reason  I am so  gorgeous that  thing(=ghost)   won't  want  to  scare  me. 3. My  gorgeousness will  made  that  thing  faint, wake  up  and faint  again.).  May I suggest the sensor is linked to opening a closed door.  That means after doing whatever,  open the closed door,  then sensor will trigger the flush. 
                                                      
                                                      2. I don't understand why our national airline uses so much water to bathe the newly born plane.  Order from USA should use their water not ours. Moreover,  USA does not have a water shortage issue.  Furthermore,  isn't it the normal procedure to wash the baby first like in the hospital? Who in this world has witnessed the hospital giving the unwashed baby to the parents?  Welcome our national hero, Joseph Schooling also shower the plane.  Wouldn't it be better to use a big military band instead? The same applies to all the future new born planes. Our government wants us to save water,  SIA  should lead by example. 
                                                      
                                                      3. Sometimes I see leaking taps or wc,  tell the people in charge, the problem was still not repaired for days.  Every drop counts. I ever spotted a wc gushing with water. (in this case,  every gallon counts) I  think  the amount wasted easily  can shower 100 new  born  planes . 
                                                  
                                                  May  I  suggest  all  the  buildings have  people  do  regular  maintenance. If  there  is  a  problem  fix  it  immediately. Change  the  sensor  if  it  need  be. Otherwise many foreigners will think our country is haunted then those paranormal programmes will be filmed here. 
                                            
                   P/s 1  For  manual  toilets, please  remember to  flush, there  won't  be  any  maid  to  flush for you. 
                  
                  P/s 2       I apologise to the people who read the badly constructed sentences (referring to the last 2 sentences.   If a person is too exhausted,  the brain will not be able to think properly. Therefore,  you have to take care of it all the time. Don't eat sugary food.
