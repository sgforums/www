              <p>Heal The World
                                                      
                                                      This is one of my favourite songs. It depicts and aptly describes how severely damaged our world is. Through his genius lyrics Michael Jackson wanted to heal the social ills with love and making things right for the betterment of our future generation.  He was an abused child but he did not indulge in self pity. Instead he channelled his sadness to positive energy  through his creativity. I hope people suffering from depression will emulate Michael’s positivity.
                                                      
                                                      After reading my Black or White (Michael Jackson’s song) post yesterday, the king of pop appeared in my dream last night. He told me to heal the world in all aspects. Perhaps, you were wondering if he was black or white, let me tell you he was black. He must have looked himself in the mirror and did not like the Man In The Mirror (in case you don’t know this is also his song. Since his children are fatherless due to medicine, I will help advertise his songs for free so that his children can have more income generated from the sale of the CDs ).  Hence, he must have asked a renowned surgeon in the underworld to operate as he wanted to make it right. Quick as a lightning, I asked him for an autograph. He told me due to the adverse effects of the drugs he consumed when he was in our world; he had already forgotten how to sign. (Even though the weather was fine, I actually could feel a lightning flashing and a thunder bolt crashing (imagined or real, I really had no idea). Instead of seeing stars, I could see the many numbers accompanied by countless zeros disappearing from my bank account. It was utterly devastating! It was absolutely cruel beyond words! (You see how a writer can lengthen the book using 2 sentences to say the same thing. I wanted to use 5 sentences but I can’t think of any more appropriate description. Moreover, I believe, the readers will be tired of reading too many of the same meaning. Though others may be impressed by the number of vocabularies the writer knows). 
                                                       
                                                      The side effects of all medicines can include harming the vital organs like the brain, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, blood, pancreas, thyroid, bladder, eyes, reproductive organs, stomach, intestines and any others that I may have missed mentioning.  Basically, the effect is on the entire body. Then” why do we keep strangling life” and “crucify its soul” by inflicting more harm to the poisoned body? First, we allow toxic pollutants to affect our air quality: burning of the cigarettes, fuel, carcinogenic incense, forest, gas, mosquito coil, coal, charcoal, spraying perfume, air freshener, and industrial pollutant. We also allow toxins to be present in our food: artificial colouring/flavouring, emulsifier, thickener, chemicals like E120 (any product with alphabet followed by numbers is actually using chemical), the processed oil (any brand of oil in the bottle, basically the oil from the factory. The natural oil is from the scaly fish, unsalted nuts, not injected and not fed with antibiotics and hormones chicken, duck, cow, pork). The processed salt from factory is bad and is used daily in the cooking or used indiscriminately in biscuits, instant noodles, bacon, hot dog. People who consume the processed salt tend to have high blood pressure. Instead of stopping the consumption of the very food that cause the health problem, the patients takes high blood pressure medicine that ultimately will further harm their body. The side effects of such medicine are lack of energy, nausea, cough, erection problem, fever, drowsiness, constipation, anaemia, light-headedness, weakness. Some people told me they did not experience the symptoms mentioned. They fail to understand the medicine insidiously affect a person. It is similar to a person smoking today may not get the disease immediately. However, over time due to the persistent damage, the immunity system and the rest of the body will start to fail in performing their normal functions. Once the immunity system is severely damaged then basically a person becomes vulnerable to any chronic, terminal or autoimmune disease. We also allow toxins to be in our drinks and desserts: same as the food toxin. The most unforgivable thing is many health programmes have ignorant nutritionists who demonstrated using the toxic probiotic drink to mix with a few fruits to prepare a “healthy dessert”. Firstly, the probiotic drink contains 2 toxins: processed sugar and artificial colouring. Secondly, the fruits contain natural sugar but when taken in excess it will harm the body. Combining with the processed sugar in the probiotic drink is most definitely wrong! 2 wrongs do not make 1 right. If such so call professionals tell the general public, the uninformed public will believe. The right portion of food has to be taken. When a good food is taken excessively it becomes poison! Therefore, nobody should juice the fruits or vegetables because the heat from the processor will destroy the enzymes and the nutrients which render the processed food useless. In fact, due to the overwhelming quantity used, it would overload our liver and kidneys. Too much vitamins can cause cancer. There is no such thing as “organic” food: 1. Our air quality is poisoned. The rain water containing all the toxins in the atmosphere will have the toxins. 2. One farm sprays pesticide, the other organic farms will still get the pesticides due to the wind. People keep thinking if they smoke downstairs their family would not get the toxin. Wrong, the wind will still blow the toxic particles all over. Hot air rises will still propel the toxic particles to all the units. They also fail to grasp the meaning of the lesser known 3rd hand smoking. 3rd hand smoke is when the burning has stopped but the particles still remain present. Whoever inhale such toxin including a smoker’s cigarette smell would end up with the same symptoms as the 2nd hand smoker!
                                                      
                                                      It is the ignorance of many people who cause our health problems to escalate into astronomical amount. The health care cost will not improve if people keep inhaling, consuming and drinking toxin. It is aggravated if they take the toxic medicine. 
                                                      
                                                      What you don’t know may kill you, what you know may not be the truth or facts
                                                      You may have believed in the wrong facts unknowingly generation after generation. That’s why you erroneously thought the illness originated from family history
                                                      Heal the ills of the world, socially, mentally and environmentally before you heal the toxic body
                                                      To heal you need to know real the source of the health problem
                                                      If the person does not heal or get better, it is definitely the wrong healer
                                                      True healing does not take decades and still the ailment is not heal
                                                      Don’t try to heal the poisoned body with more poison. If what you try is not healing, try its alternative without considering the qualifications. Listen to the healed and not the highly qualified who still  try to heal you . Michael Jackson tried to heal the damaged soul, I try to heal the toxic world, together we can make the world a better place for the next generation. Ignorance is definitely not bliss; it is the lack of desire to advert avoidable health problems!</p>
