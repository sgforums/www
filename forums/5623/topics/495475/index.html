              Thanks for your kind support.  It is my intention to heal the world in every sense  physically, literally, financially and mentally . I intend to write books. In fact,  I  am simultaneously writing  3 books.  That's why many of my postings are actually excerpts. 
              
               I have read about too many vulnerable victims end up committing suicide due to cyber bullies world wide.  Singapore can't afford to lose anybody especially youngsters.  We are facing an ageing population with low birth rate. 
              
              I hope the government will severely punished the cyber bullies to deter others from using words to kill the innocent lives. In my future post,  I will reveal knives and guns are not the only weapons that people can use to terminate a life. 
              
              By the way you still owe me an apology for the vulgarity used yesterday.

              Good job!  If you support cyber wellness, stop using vulgarity. An untarnished message is louder and carries more weight. Respect has to be earned, not by seniority, wealth, power, or status.  Even children need to be respected. Many people tend to forget that.  I also expect respect even from the king and queen. 
                          
                          By the way it is very unhealthy to sleep late or get up late. When your body does not have enough rest,  the cells will start to misbehave that's why people need to eat all the meals at the right time,  sleep at the right time.  This explains why some people end up feeling frustrated, angry or have mood swings.

              One of my tablets got the message: you are banned until 2038. I don't even know what I had done wrong?
                  
                  I am a "L" plate forum newbie.  If I  charge the unbanned tablet I end up like the mouth less Hello Kitty. Before freezing at least warn and give the reason first if the person repeat knowingly then ban.

                  I hope you don't keep misunderstanding my good intentions. I am sharing with you what I know regarding health problems. Many people did not know sleeping late and getting up late = skipping breakfast can also cause diabetes too. I am trying to let you know for you to avoid getting this problem. Please check the info yourself.
                  
                  I am trying to reduce your future stress. It is a thankless job to tell people the potential problem. But as a concerned citizen seeing so many people get this chronic illness, despite getting scolding/being shouted at I will do my part in telling people. Whether they listen or not it is up to them. I have lost my paternal uncle who believed in the western doctor's treatment. 
                  
                  I mean it when I said I want the whole world to heal environmentally, socially and mentally using action not just lip service. To heal people must know what triggers the problem. Many people blame the wrong culprit as a result more and more people get the chronic problem blaming family history. There are many reasons that people are not aware of.
                  
                  I do not like to join social media in the past. I now join is to inform, share how I healed because I read enough to understand what people may not know. Able to avert or not depends on their acceptance or rejection of the fact.

                  Just 8 hrs of sleep is not enough. You have to watch what you eat, drink and inhale. You must know how to detox using natural food. The correct cookware, ingredients, cooking method are equally important. There are many hidden toxins in the food. Many people are eating processed oil, processed salt and processed oil which ultimately will harm their body.
