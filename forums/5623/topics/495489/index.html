              <p>Ahem, ahem, is the mic working?
                                                      I don't know if I will be arrested because at 10.45pm at night, I did not have any chance to apply for the  permit. But even if I apply the office would have been closed already. Anyway, I will take the chance. In life,  no venture got gain, I meant, no venture no gain. (I am sweating profusely I have to keep looking behind my back in case the policeman shows up). In case,  in the middle of my important spee..eeeech (stutter {my heart pumping very fast=can get heart attack so anything that makes your poor heart beats faster like medicine, exercise, stress, fear of being arrested, anxiety, etc}, I got arrested, I will continue part 2 after my release. Alternatively,  I could  just sell my book overseas (better for me I still can earn sterling pound, US dollar, I don’t want to earn rupee ( I will tell them to convert to sterling pound or US dollar first.  Another problem is I think is 1 book I sell I have to carry a lot of rupee that is why I  propose using identity card  as  the  new  form  of  payment.  It can facilitate easy payment, and receipt of money.  If 1 book costs SGD$20 hypothetically {I have to calculate whether I want to be as rich as Bill Gates or be richer than him} then the person would just have to transfer the equivalent to my identity card.   PM Modi did not have to experience the currency turmoil because using identity card payment he could actually trace the flow of the illegal funds without crippling the payment of the rest of the population. He could suspend the payment mode of the crooks  just  by  freezing  their  identity card. In  fact, he  can  catch  the  whole  syndicate  who  are  involved in  any  crime) . I know you must be thinking why I am so long winded. Ok I am going to start now...oh dear it is my zzzzz time. I told people to sleep early so that the cells can rest . Ok I will continue part 1A tomorrow. I know you must be thinking  I talk so much irrelevant subject and do not get to the crux of the matter. Ok...
                                                  
                                                     
                                                      
                                                      1.	A good leader should lead by example , not by force
                                                      2.	(to be continued tomorrow when I apply for the permit, provided they, you know who I mean, approve)
                                                      3.	(that’s why I say I cannot say too much otherwise they will not approve because they will be so impressed by my points or maybe they will use them so that they don’t have to pay the person who writes the speech or maybe I can apply to be their script writer) oh dear, 11.11pm 1,000 cells in my body will have the body riot..(similar to Little India riot just that it happens inside the body,  that is why people feel the heat radiating=inflammation  and get easily irritated, anxious or agitated) .....that will give me inflammation which will lead to cancer and chronic diseases.....eeeeeee ( the interference sound of the mic )mic off open mic again .. hello I must say I am so glad no police came for me.... ok I will off the mic ... this time for real. MIC OFF FOR NOW
                                                      
                                   P/s I do not know why sometimes I type the correct word but the predictor changes it to a nonsensical word, I  suspect  the  person  who  wrote  the  program  has  poor  command  of English. Occasionally, I even  spotted the  wrong  past  participle was  used. Maybe that  person  can  hire  me  as  the  English tutor. 
                                  
                                  P/s 2 Therefore if  you  see  any grammatical errors , it  is 1,000% not  me. But  I have  to  keep editing  his  mistakes. I  should  charge  every  alphabet $2. I  know you  may  think  it  is  too  expensive. Let  me  tell  you, 1) time  is  very  precious 2) sometimes you  have  to  be  cruel  in  order  to  be  kind. Now  I  think  I  should  charge $10. Plang  plang x 2 (I have no  strength  to  type  the  word). I  believe in  no  time  I  can  unseat  Bill  or  whoever  in  the  top  spot. 
                                  
                                  P/s 3 Yesterday, I  saw  an  add....ad (see what I mean {delete 3 alphabets and type ad so total this person owes me $500 wait,  I  still have to include 4 dots so total he owes me becomes $900 plangx3)  appearing  in  one  of  the  posts  which  I  wanted  to  edit, may  I  know  if  I will  get  a  cut? If  yes, how  much? If  no, why  not?
                                  
                                  p/s 4 Every time I  want  to  end my  hands  still  continue  to  type ,I  believe my  brain  must  be  telling  my  fingers  every  alphabet  costs $10.
                          
                          P/s 5 I think I have to charge PM Module.. (do you see what I mean?)  Modi  for teaching him how to catch the crooks without disrupting the financial system. Wait,  plus reducing monetary crimes... let me think should I calculate the intrinsic value of my payment mode? Wait...  I think I have to charge all the governments in the world.  Imagine they can save manpower mobilise to catch the crooks... Plang x8 (for people who don't know this is the infinity logo,  at least my version) 
                                  
                                  OK  I have  to  eat  because  if  I  don't  eat  all  the 3 meals , my  cells  will  stage  a  rebel  and  I  will  get  gastric  problem. How  many  words  have  I  typed? Let  me  calculate my  income. Where  is  my  calculator? I  can't believe  it  after all  the  hard  work  I  am  not  even  close  to  what  Bill  earns  in 1 second. I  have  to  work  lessor (you see what I mean)..... lesser (this means he owes me 6 letters plus 5 dots $1,100 plus $900=$2, 000. I believe if this carries on he has to have 9 lives to pay off his debt to me.  This means I also must have 9 lives to receive.  Frankly,  I believe he must have been sleeping in class). I  should just  charge $100 per  alphabet....</p>
