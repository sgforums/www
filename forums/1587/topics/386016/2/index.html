              <p>considering the vast purchasing power of the co-op, it can purchase by bulk.. and with that in mind, and that they are not looking for a margin big enough for profits, they can sell the things to the people cheaper....</p>
              <p>yet they are being beaten in price by profit-driven companies.. and in service too..</p>
              <p>i would look at the management.. they will need to re-look their whole process and reengineer their whole operation to be more efficient..</p>

              <p>End up now housebrand items are the most expensive. Cos when items like palm oil prices went down, NTUC or supplier never adjusted the price.</p>
              <p>It's sad there aren't any small shops or private supermarkets other than SS &amp; Dairy Farm to balance them</p>
