              <h1>Shopkeepers dismayed at NTUC Fairprice’s presence in Eunos Crescent</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <p>Friday, 25 December 2009</p>
              <p><strong>NTUC FairPrice sets up a new mini-mart in Eunos to the dismay of local shopkeepers.</strong></p>
              <p>It may be the Christmas festive season, but shopkeeper Mohamed Eliyas has little to cheer about.</p>
              <p>Run for the last 12 years from a HDB shop unit at Block 6 along Eunos Crescent, the 66-year-old’s convenience store business has never been all that prosperous. It provides a decent livelihood for him and his three workers, nothing more.</p>
              <p>The recession threatened to end all that. Nonetheless, Eliyas managed to keep the business afloat, albeit only just – despite a rent reduction last year, his monthly takings can barely cover the running costs.</p>
              <p>Some good tidings would have been welcome this holiday season, yet none are forthcoming.</p>
              <p>Three weeks ago, NTUC FairPrice – a retail chain with over 90 supermarkets across Singapore – announced its inauspicious arrival to local shopkeepers by commencing renovation work for a new mini-mart.</p>
              <p>The store, located just 50 metres away from Eliyas’s shop, will greet its first customers next Monday.</p>
              <p>Faced with price competition from a major supermarket chain, Eliyas fears the worst. He expects to lose 30 to 35 per cent of his customers – a daunting prospect for his 34-year-old business. He lamented: “How are we going to survive?”</p>
              <p>Eliyas is not alone in his anguish. About seven other shops in the area could face tougher times ahead.</p>
              <p>An Indian shopkeeper, who preferred to remain anonymous, told The Online Citizen that he could lose up to 50 per cent of his earnings. “In the worst-case scenario, I may have to return the shop [to the HDB],” he said.</p>
              <p>Others expressed bewilderment. A 48-year-old male shop assistant, who declined to be named, said in Mandarin: “This place is a small pond. Why would a big fish like [FairPrice] want to come here? There isn’t much room for it to swim.”</p>
              <p>FairPrice, however, does not consider its presence to be damaging to local business. A spokesperson told TOC: “The [new store] will be replacing [an iEcon mini-mart]. As such, we do not foresee this as adding new competition to the area.”</p>
              <p>Setting up small stores in HDB estates is not a new gambit for FairPrice. The supermarket chain currently runs more than 10 mini-marts, having opened its first one in the late 1970s.</p>
              <p>“Our objective for the Eunos store is to serve the lower income families in the area,” the spokesperson added.</p>
              <p>And if FairPrice does honour its claim to make essential items “affordable and accessible”, then local residents would not mind their presence, regardless of the impact on small businesses.</p>
              <p>“Competition is good for the consumer,” said Mdm Tan Siew Geok in Mandarin. The 55-year-old housewife added: “It may not be great for the shopkeepers, but consumers would welcome lower prices.”</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" style="margin: 13px; float: right; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Cost%20of%20living/ntuc250320.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="320">Mdm Tang Siew Tiang agreed. The self-employed 54-year-old said in Mandarin: “Most people will compare prices and buy from the shop with the cheapest offerings.”</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, she believes that local shopkeepers need not be overly worried. “[FairPrice] doesn’t always offer the cheapest prices. There will be items that will be less expensive to buy from the other convenience stores,” she said.</p>
              <p>Even so, shopkeepers are not optimistic about fending off competition from a large commercial rival, given its brand name and superior distribution links.</p>
              <p>For Eliyas, an Indian Muslim, he can only hope that his range of Indian goods and foodstuff might retain some patrons.</p>
              <p>“I have some Indian customers, but I’m not sure they can cover for [the loss of business] or not,” he explained. “If HDB reduces the rent by 50 per cent, I hope I can make it. If not, there’s a question mark [over my future].”</p>
              <p>The future is similarly bleak for shopkeeper Chua Kia Joo. Now in her eighties, she too faces the prospect of closing her three-decade-old business.</p>
              <p>Her daughter, who helps run the shop, summed up their mood. She declined to be named, but said in Mandarin: “It’s not right for a big company to come here and compete with us small businesses. How do they expect us to do business?”</p>
              <p><strong>But beneath the indignation, she seemed resigned to the inevitable.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>“Eventually all the small businesses like ours will be gone,” she sighed. “It is only a matter of time.”</strong></p>

              <h1>Sheng Siong shirks its corporate social responsibility &amp; engages in anti-competitive behaviour</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">December 23, 2009</span></p>
              <p>This is a letter from a group of customers of wet-markets to Temasek Review. please post it on your forum or letter section.</p>
              <p>We are a group of wet market regular customers and we are terribly upset with Sheng Siong for shirking its corporate social responsibility and for engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. The news article above in CNA informed about Sheng Siong’s practise of signing 1 year leases with stall owners of the three wet markets it bought recently. It also gave assurance that rents will not be increased till end March 2010.</p>
              <p><strong>Sheng Siong’s Anti-Competitive Behaviour</strong></p>
              <p>Firstly when Sheng Siong came forward to buy those three wet markets Competition Commission of Singapore should have stepped in as that is clearly anti-competitive behaviour. In a free market, when a player with substantial market power due to its size moves in to gobble up the smaller players, that is undeniably anti-competitive behaviour.</p>
              <p>In a perfect free competition market, there should be no seller with a bigger market share than another seller. That basically means that in the real imperfect world, there should be extremely few sellers with large market share and they should not have significantly large market shares. In other words there must be a reasonable number of other players who can compete with the larger players even if their firm sizes differ. Most importantly the former group must not use its market share advantage to push out the smaller ones.</p>
              <p>When Sheng Siong bought those three markets, it only edged five leaps closers to pushing out the smaller retailers of vegetables, meat and groceries in wet markets. Today Sheng Siong has offered to give only a pathetic 1 year lease to stall owners. That will cripple stall owners from making any long term sustainable plans to their businesses. Essentially this measure by Sheng Siong will reduce market share of wet market stall owners. This is again an anti-competitive behaviour. Competitive Commission of Singapore must step in and take Sheng Siong to task.. CCS so far has failed in its independence and competency in preserving and promoting competitive behaviour in circumstances such as this.</p>
              <p><strong>Sheng Siong shirking its corporate social responsibility</strong></p>
              <p>Sheng Siong has a corporate social responsibility towards the stall owners and society at large. These stall owners are mostly from the bottom 50% of the income bracket in Singapore. Yet they have not built their businesses on subsidies and protection in all these decades. Rather they are an integral part of Singapore society who have served the needs of Singaporeans in many ways.</p>
              <p>Their sustainability is a social requirement. If they were to die out due to Singaporeans giving up on them, then that is a different issue. Some segments of Singaporeans still patronise wet markets. Those who dont still want them to be around. Therefore Sheng Siong must stop its practices that reduce participation of the stall owners. Already several stall owners have given up their stalls due to insecurity posed by Sheng Siong with its unfair leases. These practices must stop.</p>
              <p>Sheng Shiong’s corporate social responsibility to the society at large is to ensure the society enjoys continued benefit and satisfaction from the wet markets. We do not wish to see the wet markets being turned into Sheng Siong supermarkets. We do not get that much benefit from Sheng Siong supermarkets as we get from wet markets. As iterated earlier, the mere existence of wet markets even if some Singaporeans do not patronise them gives them a sense of satisfaction seeing them around. Those Singaporeans do not reap such satisfaction from seeing Sheng Siong supermarkets around as they are indifferent to Sheng Siong.</p>
              <p><strong>Alternative Strategies for Sheng Siong</strong></p>
              <p>Sheng Siong should explore alternative strategies. For instance it can create a cooperative for the stall owners and let them run it. Sheng Siong can then set up its supermarkets around the wet markets and capitalise on the synergies. For instance the wet markets do not open long hours and Sheng Siong can get the sales during those hours. Likewise Sheng Siong can do wholesale to these stalls.</p>
              <p>There are indeed many ways Sheng Siong and the stall owners have a win win situation without affecting the sustainability of wet markets or commercial returns of Sheng Siong. The time is now for Sheng Siong to act. It is particularly disturbing when one realises  that Sheng Siong founder, Lim Hock Chee was an ordinary pork seller before starting his supermarket. He should all the more understand the agony of customers and stall owners than civil servants and politicians. If we do not see a difference in Sheng Siong’s policies, then the supermarket can be rest assured that we will boycott the chain.</p>

              <p>Now NTUC like fighting to keep its prescene due to CS, SNS &amp; SS compeititon, now taking available small shop space.</p>
              <p>Take never mind. Make small shop out of business with their lagi smaller product range. I'm not joking, NTUC's product range some outlets even lose to provision shops not to say price.</p>
