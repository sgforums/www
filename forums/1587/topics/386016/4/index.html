              <p>lots of supermarket and chap huey tiam are also airconditioned.
              So why ppl's goods same brand can still be selling cheaper? it's
              all to do w/ margins.</p>
              <p>As for pricing, in the first place let competition balance
              everyone's margin. In e first place, CASE's report scope is very
              limited.</p>
              <p>As for NTUC Fairprice, you'll be surprised of their esp
              housebrand item's margin. Other ppl can forget abt thinking of 20%
              profit margin. wa liao eh, afaik branded cooking oil other than
              palm oil margin is like 5 - 9% only</p>

              <p>i know what you saying, but to put up a case against NTUC, there will need to be specific charges. for example, if somehow everybody agree that a can coke is $1.10, and NTUC charges $1.20 than CASE can come in and put this overpricing of items against them.</p>
              <p>Or if some onedollar shop charges $1.00 for the coke, CASE can come in and fine  them for underpricing. The charges needs to be specific, not ambiguious.</p>

              <p><br>Perhap it is time for me to make clarification here.</p>
              <p>First, we have ask ourselves, What is the purposes and objectives of NTUC?</p>
              <p>Well, to answer that, we have to go back to the history of mid 60s to 70s, during that period, there is no NTUC co-operatives. Provision shop towkays are king of town and village, they can call whatever price they wanted on all essential goods, illegal taxi driver are kings of road by demanding any fare prices they like. There was no insurance coverage for layman and workers. And certainly, there was no dental care, no childcare and no proper workman protection.</p>
              <p>Just taking the example of provision shop. Because of the greed of towkays who can sell their rice at any prices of those days, peoples suffered, PIEU and SILO was then formed by worker Unions to cater them to buy essential items such rice, coffee, salt, sugar etc etc at a reasonable market prices and being members, you get further discount, these attracted many peoples join the Unions. And when the group get larger, both PIEU and SILO joined to form NTUC fairprice. One of the objective was to provide a simple worker and his family a chance to shop at supermarket which during that time only the rich can afford. More so, the objective also give a reasonable price on essential goods, so that all people are fairly treated. By and by, more consignment products came knocking into NTUC fairprice door, because of the crowd, business people wanted to sell their product at NTUC shelves, so be it, the more the merrier. At end of the day, NTUC is a price taker, price controller and benchmarker whether they are expensive or cheap, it actually benefit consumer. Think wisely, without NTUC, you think Sheng Siong is willing to lower their prices, you think provision shop are willing to lower their prices. Stiff competition among supermarkets is alway a gain for consumer. You alway notice in today, when people talk about food prices, they alway compare with NTUC, anything that is cheaper is consider cheap, anything that is higher is consider expensive. But whatever happen, NTUC fairprice stand still on their prices, the rest will follow. Therefore this alone allow Govt to control unreasonable inflation, fairprice is a price setter. Imagine if you dun have NTUC fairprice, all papa and mama shops will be rising their prices, and when prices goes up, hawker foods also goes up and so on..therefore we have to be thankful to NTUC for controlling the prices, they dun mind you buy from Sheng Siong or other cheaper shops, because NTUC is not a profit generated organisation, it got no shareholders to answer to, but only members, all profit by NTUC co-operatives are ploughed back to help the society, be it education at e2i, learning hub or spur, scholarship and bursary for the needed member, rebate of 5 dividends for members, transport voucher for those earning less, back to school voucher, NTUC vouchers, discount at flywheel, zoo, clubs, subsidize childcare, dental care etc etc are what NTUC had ploughed back to the society.</p>
              <p>Finally, a layman on the street can buy insurance for him and his family, can shop at supermarket, can sent his kids to childcare, can care for his dental, can get upgraded and trained at a fraction of a price or even free, and more important, can get someone to talk to and represent him for any unfair employment practices.</p>
              <p>Oh, there is one more purpose about NTUC fairprice, the objectives of openning more and more at various places is not just mend for selling goods, NTUC fairprice is also the ration/food points for Singaporeans when there is war or social unrest. Those food in NTUC is really to give out in case of emergency. Clear!</p>

              <p>Firstly Fairprice is being attacked by you guys for coming to snatch small owners businesses. And they are able to do primarily because they charge lower prices than these owners. Then after that people attacked Fairprice for overcharging them. How does that compare up?</p>
              <p>I deal with Fairprice, the Dairy Farm group, Sheng Siong and other many other retail chains in Singapore. Fairprice is a not-for-profit co-op, it is not a NON-PROFIT co-op. There is a difference there. Every chain has a strategy and you would realise.</p>
              <p>What I want to say and I cannot say too much is that assuming that every chain gets the same cost price for every item, it does not always mean that the chain selling the item at a higher price earns a better profit. There are many considerations like sales cycle, AR and AP etc. Fairprice has a better payment term for alot of suppliers and that generally means more cash flow  concerns.</p>
              <p>I am not going to defend Fairprice saying that is the best retailer chain in Singapore. Every one of them is just unique and but for Fairprice's case, I also work with them on alot of off-business initiatives which benefit the poorer people. Whether that is for PR or whatever, they do have alot of those. But just remember, the retailer chains are here to give us a choice, in fact, for a country of this size, the number of retailer chains we have is overwhelming. SO make your choice, and buy from the person whom you think gives you the best value.</p>

              <p>Fairprice have embarked on a 30 day credit terms for some of its suppliers. While Singapore remains a free market and anti-competition laws are in place, it remains a grey area. For example, if Fairprice or Sheng Siong or Giant makes a margin of 40% on a certain product, what is there to stop anyone of them to drop the price to earn a 35% margin? Nothing. They are free to do so. However, in the whole sales cycle and setting of prices, there are many parties involved. The principal, the brand owner, the distributor, the retailer and the consumers. As you may know, there is such a thing as RCP - recommended - but you cannot force anyone to follow it strictly due to our anti competition laws. One retailer like SS  may price a product at $1 and making a profit margin of 40%. Another retailer might say, oh, I would like to price this product more expensive at $1.10 making a bigger margin. Another would say, lets price it at 95cents, earning a lesser margin. Now do you think Fairprice can just come in and say, hey because I am only a co-op, i only need to earn a 10% margin and price it at 70 cents. They can do it but like as I say, principals and brand owners have their brand interests to protect and that means retailers are also careful not to price their products according to their whims and fancies. The best practice would be to price a product at prices that are fair and competitive.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, when a retailer advertised "lowest price guaranteed" does it always mean that? No it doesnt. Every retailer including Fairprice needs to MAKE a profit because they have overheads. Their overheads are not cheaper because it is an Co-Op. They have the same costs as any other retailers in the same space.</p>

              <p>Maybe you are also in the retail trade and you would know also. I am from a principal and everyone runs a business. Margins are subjective. Some companies can make a high margin but still make a loss because it is running on high costs and overheads. Some companies can make a lower margin but controlling their costs well will do well for them. Every business including a principal, retailer or dealer will have a minimum margin they want to look at, NOT to break even but for the business to grow and to make not just profits but sustainable profits. We can argue that if principals can dun make so much margins, it will lower costs for retailers and retailers can give a lower price to consumers.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, consumers have a choice. And market forces will always dictate prices. LCD TVs prices are dropping like crazy because consumers demand new models within short periods of time and brands are rushing to push out new models every 4-6 months and such market forces ensured the violatility of the prices.</p>
              <p>Consumers may always be at the mercy of the pricing strategies of principals and retailers but they do have a choice. For every expensive option, there is always a cheaper one. It all depends what consumers perceived as value.</p>

              <p>then its a business issue they need to resolve. no customers are sure to stay with you forever. Thats why there is competition. Whoever can provide the perceived value that customers need wins the customer's business. Fairprice and any other retailer chains have a business strategy. If you do see the kind of stores that Fairprice are opening up or converting, maybe that gives an idea of the strategy they are heading towards. Similarly with SS, the locations of their stores are part of their strategies too. And in all business sense, any consumers, suppliers or products that do not fit into that strategy does not matter to them.</p>
