              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br>Perhap it is time for me to make clarification here.</p>
              <p>First, we have ask ourselves, What is the purposes and objectives of NTUC?</p>
              <p>Well, to answer that, we have to go back to the history of mid 60s to 70s, during that period, there is no NTUC co-operatives. Provision shop towkays are king of town and village, they can call whatever price they wanted on all essential goods, illegal taxi driver are kings of road by demanding any fare prices they like. There was no insurance coverage for layman and workers. And certainly, there was no dental care, no childcare and no proper workman protection.</p>
              <p>Just taking the example of provision shop. Because of the greed of towkays who can sell their rice at any prices of those days, peoples suffered, PIEU and SILO was then formed by worker Unions to cater them to buy essential items such rice, coffee, salt, sugar etc etc at a reasonable market prices and being members, you get further discount, these attracted many peoples join the Unions. And when the group get larger, both PIEU and SILO joined to form NTUC fairprice. One of the objective was to provide a simple worker and his family a chance to shop at supermarket which during that time only the rich can afford. More so, the objective also give a reasonable price on essential goods, so that all people are fairly treated. By and by, more consignment products came knocking into NTUC fairprice door, because of the crowd, business people wanted to sell their product at NTUC shelves, so be it, the more the merrier. At end of the day, NTUC is a price taker, price controller and benchmarker whether they are expensive or cheap, it actually benefit consumer. Think wisely, without NTUC, you think Sheng Siong is willing to lower their prices, you think provision shop are willing to lower their prices. Stiff competition among supermarkets is alway a gain for consumer. You alway notice in today, when people talk about food prices, they alway compare with NTUC, anything that is cheaper is consider cheap, anything that is higher is consider expensive. But whatever happen, NTUC fairprice stand still on their prices, the rest will follow. Therefore this alone allow Govt to control unreasonable inflation, fairprice is a price setter. Imagine if you dun have NTUC fairprice, all papa and mama shops will be rising their prices, and when prices goes up, hawker foods also goes up and so on..therefore we have to be thankful to NTUC for controlling the prices, they dun mind you buy from Sheng Siong or other cheaper shops, because NTUC is not a profit generated organisation, it got no shareholders to answer to, but only members, all profit by NTUC co-operatives are ploughed back to help the society, be it education at e2i, learning hub or spur, scholarship and bursary for the needed member, rebate of 5 dividends for members, transport voucher for those earning less, back to school voucher, NTUC vouchers, discount at flywheel, zoo, clubs, subsidize childcare, dental care etc etc are what NTUC had ploughed back to the society.</p>
              <p>Finally, a layman on the street can buy insurance for him and his family, can shop at supermarket, can sent his kids to childcare, can care for his dental, can get upgraded and trained at a fraction of a price or even free, and more important, can get someone to talk to and represent him for any unfair employment practices.</p>
              <p>Oh, there is one more purpose about NTUC fairprice, the objectives of openning more and more at various places is not just mend for selling goods, NTUC fairprice is also the ration/food points for Singaporeans when there is war or social unrest. Those food in NTUC is really to give out in case of emergency. Clear!</p>

              <p>then its a business issue they need to resolve. no customers are sure to stay with you forever. Thats why there is competition. Whoever can provide the perceived value that customers need wins the customer's business. Fairprice and any other retailer chains have a business strategy. If you do see the kind of stores that Fairprice are opening up or converting, maybe that gives an idea of the strategy they are heading towards. Similarly with SS, the locations of their stores are part of their strategies too. And in all business sense, any consumers, suppliers or products that do not fit into that strategy does not matter to them.</p>

              <p><br>Huh??? me old auntie..wow! i want to be, but cannot, you know there is a kind of funny thing about human, when they are young, they want to be grown up adults, and when the had grown up, they wanted to go back to be young. So i wanted to be, as much as i dress to adulthood, people still call me Xiao mei mei...haiz!</p>
              <p>a few years back, when i waiting for my O level results, a friend of mine asked me to join her for partime job at NTUC, my Dad also think that i should get more exposed in working life rather than seating at home, going out spending and be naughty. So, we decided to take on the job as a cashier, $5 per hour. We need to train at a Fairprice center in Fu luo Shu complex for about 3 days, at that moment, the facilitors taught us about the purpose and objectives of Fairprice and also its history, that is why i get to know, a social enterprise.</p>
              <p>however, after 3 days, we went to Marine parade NTUC to work, which is also near our houses, but instead of being cashier, the Manager said i should be a promoter because of my sweet and pleasant looks, so i become selling from yorhurt to instant noodle, you name it, funnyhow, whatever i sell, lots of Uncles and guys bought it, aunties dun really bought it, so, for a few months there, i was quite famous, both as a sweet 16 gal for sg Uncles and a idol for sg Aunties to grumble about wherever their husband or bf talks to me. But i make good money, on top of that $5 per hour, i get commission for anything i managed to sell, and those products companies even wanted to engage me privately. Well, i have to continue my studies, too bad.</p>

              <p>in every dispute, there's 2 sides to the story...</p>
              <p>in this case, one complains of more competition, the other welcomes the competition as hopefully it leads to lower prices and better services...</p>
              <p>as it is, being a consumer, i look forward to lower costs and fresher products, not forgetting the more variety to choose from around the world...</p>
              <p>as it is, i think NTUC is improving its services, starting to open up 24 hrs......</p>
              <p>try to get the residents' response and feedback to this new opening to report a balance view to it.....or are you going to harp on their complaints when they say that everything in their estate is so inconvenient and the prices are so high as they dont have a supermarket there to offer them freshness of meat, vegetables in economies of scale?</p>
              <p>so next time, get a grip.....report both sides to the story...yeah?</p>

              <p>Well, then why ppl in Hong Kong &amp; ROC are ok w/ Wellcome and so on? Simply because at the end of the day, ppl still come in and invest in your city. They rent space, employ staff, somewhat continues source a proportion of goods w/ local suppliers, pay local taxes.</p>
              <p>The money all goes to e govt, who is going to be willing to invest further? As I've mentioned in e long run, Singapore would lose it's attractiveness and tax collections will fall. Not to say abt problems feeding high wages for scholars or e minister unless they go print money.</p>

              <p>It failed, because it is a social enterprise, and of course there many other insitution that help to finance the charity work in Singapore. eg are Sinda, merdaki and Chinese Chamber....etc etc.</p>
              <p>People also come and invest in our city, so it is up to people of Singapore to see for themselves, spending and buying is one obligation, you want to buy what from where is your problem. I am just stating the facts. And whatever or whoever set up supermarket here will take NTUC price as a lead to sell and give a price tag to their products on the shelves.</p>
              <p>Every countries got it own entrepreneurs or social enterprise for it citizens, but if they wanted to shop at a foreign owned supermarket, so be it, but they will compare the pricing with their local supermarket.</p>
              <p>NTUC fairprice was never mend of the middle class and rich, but they still welcome them to shop, and funny part is that those poorer peoples are gathering and shopping at Cold storage and takashimaya for class and action, our rich are shopping at NTUC. Because to be rich, you need to be thrifty ya. </p>
