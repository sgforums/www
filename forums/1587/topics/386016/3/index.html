              <p>lots of supermarket and chap huey tiam are also airconditioned. So why ppl's goods same brand can still be selling cheaper? it's all to do w/ margins.</p>
              <p>As for pricing, in the first place let competition balance everyone's margin. In e first place, CASE's report scope is very limited.</p>
              <p>As for NTUC Fairprice, you'll be surprised of their esp housebrand item's margin. Other ppl can forget abt thinking of 20% profit margin. wa liao eh, afaik branded cooking oil other than palm oil margin is like 5 - 9% only</p>
