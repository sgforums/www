But I dun sense much.<br>When I look back, I am very thankful tt I din turn out rebelious. Maybe is my consciuous tt control mi. If not, maybe right now, i will be in the "changi chalet".<br><br>My grandmother is a very fortunate 80 ++ lady who can cease doing housework by the age of 50(my parents married), n yet complain tat her life is very bitter. She is still  a very strong lady- afterall, she drank Chicken essence almost every day n wash her eyes wif eye mo daily. She normally walk slowly at home complaining her leg hurts but when she is out of our sight, she can walk at a speed like us. So crafty<br><br>My father. Hardly see him except Sunday morning before he left e house for horse-betting or etc. Dun like him as he is a VERY stubborn person+ has old-fashioned mind. From days when i m young, whenever he get provoked, he will start throwing fist. Err... my mother is one of his victims.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  A lot of times, i wanna run away from home. But I m too young. I have no $$ nor any1 else to depend on.<br><br>My mother. Always tt nagging woman who cannot be provoked too. Nope she wun throw fists, but she will start her theory tt it is better for her to die. - Husband treat her in tt way, n children beginning too. *sign* though the first part is a truth, but she has been using the same sentence for 15 Yrs...Kinda irrated. Like many other parents, they dun like to admit their mistake. Yeah... one thing I really dislike abt her is tt she like to search our drawers. Caught her too many times looking among my sisters' n warn mi against telling them. But as a matter of fact, we all noe liao.<br><br>Eldest sister. Very temperant like mi father. If she need ur help, she will treat u well. But when U need hers assistance, sometimes she will come up wif alot excuses. She hates this hse, n glad tt she will marry next yr.<br><br>Elder sister. our r's is better now after she leave her ex-bf who show no respect for my mother. ex-bf broke off after my sister discover he is seeing another woman<br><br>Mi<br><br>Many ppl find mi "odd"(tt what I feel myself too) Who will walk in the rain though holdng an umbrella. Who will like to walk behind ppl, n not uttering a single word. As a matter, when ppl noe i cheong, they were SURPRISED <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Love....<br><br>I have more female friends than guys. But seemingly, most of them were attached. In my life, there r 3 gals tt holds a significant place in my heart.<br><br>SJ - I really dun noe why I can still remember tis kindergarten classmate. Still can remember tt song when we were performing together on our graduation ceremony. (think the name is "So-lola Pumba") Maybe is the riddle book she gave mi. Hmmm wionder how she look now? Last known Street living in: AMK Ave 10(we on the same school bus)<br><br>PJ - Cannot tell whether is primary school or sec. but I think u ppl IQ not so low. hahaa.. She sit beside mi in class. Dun noe why n when i start to miss her when i graduated.. Is she pretty? ok hoh... still have her photo wif mi <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Last known address : Somewhere in Bishan St 13(hope i wun receive calls from my ex-classmate who happen to noe some1 here)<br><br>SX - look at my post on the orgin of xian89 n u noe e story liao<br><br>Life and death...<br><br>Sometimes I wonder why i am still in this world. My life seems a failure. Been wasting all this years doing acomplish nothing. While every1 at my age is having their career on the run, i haven't start mine yet.
