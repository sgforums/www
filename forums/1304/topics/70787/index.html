I have had 6 cats before in different stages.<br><br>But, yes I do agree 10kg is quite the tad overweight? Maybe you feed him too many times and too much?<br><br>It depends what type of cat food you buy for your cat. There are some special kinds of cat food which does'nt have man-made chemicals. In fact, its actually proven that cat food is better for your cat in the long run. The crap does'nt smell so bad as eating normal food. The crap is also harder and not soft. The fact that cat food is harder to chew, helps the cat's teeth grow stronger and can make it cleaner. There's tons of added benefits such as these.<br><br>Basically, human food is'nt good for animals.<br><br>If you fed chocolate to a mouse/rabbit, it would die of cancer and have a shorter life span.

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm from praising women to highlighting men's apparent penchant for infdelity...<br><br>oh well.. yeah thank goodness someone said that women are also capable of that but that's totally out of point in this thread anyway.<br><br>i like singaporean women becos i am singaporean too. one of the biggest hurdles is culture, and even within the same culture there can be many differences like upbringing, financial status and education. imagine having to deal with a different culture altogether AND the other stuff.<br><br>singaporean women in general are getting pretty stubborn and independant and have minds of their own. that of course isn't a bad thing. i do know, and feel that no matter how head strong a woman is, once they fall in love, a miracle happens. it seems the stubborness is geared towards the encouragement of her man. the biggest proof of this is the "nan ren bu huai, nu ren bu ai" syndrome, where she is stubborn to all else, but just wants to stick to her man. now if she were to stick to a man that's good, then there'll be blissful times ahead.<br><br>however, maybe this nan ren bu huai thing isn't isolated to just singaporean women. i'm sure many women over the world have this "problem" too.<br><br>sometimes when u see a woman's behavior and u think she's too independant or headstrong and esp if u are one of those geared towards the MCP type of man (like me? hahaha) u might not take a liking to the girl. i still think that many things change when a woman falls in love, and i dare say it's not becos the guy forces it upon her. women are more emotional than men in general and love is generally classified as having a very strong emotional basis. i see it totally logical that when a woman is in love, miracles happen.</div>
