            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I have a boyfriend who grew up with me.<br>His name is Jin.<br>I always thought of him as a friend until last year, when we<br>went to a trip from a club. I found that I fell in love with<br>him.<br>Before that trip was over, I took a step and confessed my<br>love for him.<br>And soon, we became a pair of lovers, but we loved each<br>other in different ways.<br>I always concentrated on him only, but by his side, there<br>were so many other girls.<br>To me, he was the only one, but to him, maybe I was just<br>another girlÂ…<br><br>Â“Jin, do you want to go watch a movie?Â” I asked.<br>Â“I canÂ’tÂ”<br>Â“Why? You need to study at home?Â” I felt disappointment<br>grabbing me.<br>Â“NoÂ… I am going to meet a friendÂ…Â”<br>He was always like that.<br>He met girls in front of me, like it was nothing.<br>To him, I was just a girlfriend.<br>The word Â‘loveÂ’ only came out from my mouth.<br><br>Since I knew him, I had never heard him say Â‘I love youÂ’<br>before.<br>To us, there werenÂ’t any anniversaries at all.<br>He didnÂ’t say anything from the first day and it continued<br>till 100 daysÂ…200daysÂ…<br><br>Everyday, before we say goodbye, he would just hand me a<br>doll, everyday, without fail. I donÂ’t know whyÂ…<br><br>Then one dayÂ…<br><br>Me: Um, Jin, I Â…<br>Jin: WhatÂ…donÂ’t drag, just say..<br>Me: I love you.<br>Jin: Â…Â…youÂ….um, just take this doll and go home.<br>That was how he ignored my Â‘three wordsÂ’ and handed me<br>the doll.<br>Then he disappeared, like he was running away.<br><br>The dolls I received from him everyday, filled my room,<br>one by one. There were manyÂ…<br>Then one day came, my 15th year old birthday.<br><br>When I got up in the morning, I pictured a party with him,<br>and stranded myself in my room, waiting for his call.<br>ButÂ… lunch passed, dinner passedÂ… and soon the sky was<br>darkÂ… he still didnÂ’t call.<br>It was already tiring to look at the phone anymore.<br>Then around 2am in the morning, he suddenly called me<br>and woke me from my sleep. He told me to come out of the<br>house.<br>Still, I felt joy and I ran out happily.<br><br>Me: JinÂ…<br>Jin: HereÂ…take thisÂ…<br>Again, he handed me a little doll.<br>Me: WhatÂ’s this?<br>Jin: I didnÂ’t give it to you yesterday, so I am giving it<br>to you now. IÂ’m going home now, bye.<br>Me: Wait, wait! Do you know what today is?<br>Jin: Today? Huh?<br>I felt so sad, I thought he would remember my birthday.<br>He turned around and walked away like nothing had<br>happen.<br><br>Then I shoutedÂ…<br><br>Â“WaitÂ…Â”<br>Jin: You have something to say?<br>Me: Tell me, tell me you love meÂ…<br>Jin: What?!<br>Me: Tell me<br><br>I put my pathetic self behind and clung on to him.<br>But he just said simple cold words and left.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t want to sayÂ…that I love someone so easily, if you<br>are desperate to hear it, then find someone else.Â”<br><br>That was what he said. Then he ran off.<br><br>My legs felt numbÂ…and I collapsed to the ground. He<br>didnÂ’t want to say it easilyÂ…<br>How could heÂ….<br>I felt thatÂ…<br>Maybe he is not the right guy for meÂ…<br>After that day, I stranded myself at home crying, just<br>crying.<br><br>He didnÂ’t call me, although I was waiting.<br>He just continued handing me a little doll every morning<br>outside my house.<br><br>ThatÂ’s how those dolls piled up in my roomÂ… everyday<br>After a month, I got myself together and went to school.<br><br>But what made the pain resurface was thatÂ… I saw him on<br>a streetÂ…with another girlÂ…<br><br>He had a smile on his face, one that he never showed<br>meÂ…as he touched the dollÂ…<br>I ran straight back home and looked at the dolls in my<br>room, and tears fellÂ…<br>Why did he gave these to meÂ…<br>Those dolls are probably picked out by some other girlsÂ…<br>In a fit of anger, I threw the dolls around.<br>Then suddenly, the phone rang. It was him.<br><br>He told me to come out to the bus stop outside my house.<br>I tried to calm myself down and walked to the bus stop.<br>I kept reminding myself that I am going to forget him,<br>thatÂ… itÂ’s going to end.<br>Then he came into my sight, holding a big doll.<br><br>Jin: Jo, I thought you were pissed, you really came?<br>I couldnÂ’t help hating him, acting like nothing had happen<br>and joking around.<br>Soon, he held out the doll as usualÂ…<br>Me: I donÂ’t need it.<br>Jin: WhatÂ….whyÂ…<br>I grabbed the doll from his hands and threw it on the road.<br>Me: I donÂ’t need this doll, I donÂ’t need it anymore!! I donÂ’t<br>want to see a person like you again!<br>I spitted out all the words that were inside me. But unlike<br>other days, his eyes very shaking.<br>Â“IÂ’m sorryÂ” He apologized in a tiny voice.<br>He then walked over to the road to pick up the dollÂ…<br>Me: You stupid! Why are you picking up the doll?! Just<br>throw it away!!!<br>But he ignored me and just went to pick the doll.<br>ThenÂ…<br><br>Honk~ Honk~<br><br>With a loud honk, a big truck was heading towards him.<br><br>Â“Jin! Move! Move away!Â” I shoutedÂ…<br><br>But he didnÂ’t hear me, he squatted down and picked up the<br>doll.<br><br>Â“Jin, move!Â”<br><br>HONK~!!<br><br>Â“Boom!Â” That sound, so terrifying.<br><br>ThatÂ’s how he went away from me.<br>ThatÂ’s how he went away without even opening his eyes to<br>say one word to me.<br>After that day, I had to go through everyday with guiltiness<br>and the sadness of losing himÂ…<br>And after spending two months like a crazy personÂ…<br>I took out the dolls.<br><br>Those were the only gifts he left me since the day we<br>started going out.<br>I remembered the days I spent with him and started to<br>count the daysÂ… when we were in loveÂ…<br><br>Â“OneÂ…twoÂ… threeÂ…Â”<br><br>That was howÂ… I started to count the dollsÂ…<br><br>Â“Four hundred and eighty fourÂ… four hundred and eighty<br>fiveÂ…Â”<br>It all ended with 485 dolls.<br><br>I then started to cry again, with a doll in my arms.<br><br>I hugged it tightly, then suddenlyÂ…<br><br>Â“I love you~, I love you~Â”<br>I dropped the dolls,shocked.<br>Â“IÂ….lo..veÂ…you??Â”<br>I picked up the dolls and pressed its stomach.<br>Â“I love you~ I love you~Â”<br>It canÂ’t be!<br>I pressed all the dollsÂ’ stomach as it piled on the side.<br>Â“I love you~Â”<br>Â“I love you~Â”<br>Â“I love you~Â”<br>Those words came out non-stop.<br>IÂ…love youÂ…<br><br>Why didnÂ’t I realize thatÂ….<br>That his heart was always by my side, protecting me.<br><br>Why didnÂ’t I realize that he love me this muchÂ…<br>I took out the doll under the bed and pressed itÂ’s stomach,<br>that was the last doll, the one that fell on the road.<br>It had his blood stain on it.<br>The voice came out, the on that I was missing so muchÂ…<br><br>Â“JoÂ…Do you know what today is? WeÂ’ve been loving each<br>other for 486 days. Do you know what 486 is? I couldnÂ’t<br>say I love youÂ…. UmÂ… since I was too shyÂ… If you<br>forgive me and take this doll, I will say that I love youÂ…<br>everydayÂ… till I dieÂ… JoÂ… I love youÂ…Â”<br>The tears came flowing out of me. Why? Why? I asked<br>god, why do I only know about all this now?<br>He canÂ’t be by my side, but he loved me until his last<br>minuteÂ…<br><br>For thatÂ… and for that reasonÂ… to meÂ… it became<br>courageÂ… to live a beautiful lifeÂ….<br></div>
