Meddling situations are solved in no matter of time. No wonder you're the exemplary problem solver. There are times you need to raise your voice to let your opinion be heard.<br><br>Love Tendency: You lack the allure that men find appealing. But anyone who searches for an honest woman will be lucky to find you. Dating will come to you later than others. Don't be bothered by it because it will be worth the wait.<br><br>Life: Things may not work the way you want them to be. Hard times will be in store for you in your younger ears but happiness will fall into place two-fold in your later years. Learn to rely on yourself instead of depending on others for help.<br><br>Match<br><br>Good Match: O-type and A-type Taurus and Scorpios. AB-type Capricorns and Pisces also are great for you. They and you share the same destiny line that you are able to share the tribulations and happiness of life together. Since you dislike people who are superficial, the down-to-earth AB-type Taurus and O-type Virgos will suit you right.<br><br>Bad Match: A fickle person, just like B-type Aries would not be helpful in any way. B-type Libras are too nonchalant and insensitive for you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Leo &amp; B-Type<br><br>July 23 - August 22<br><br>for Men<br>Personality: You have the tendency to enjoy the life of luxury because you love the limelight. People have to follow your way or they'll be in a disagreement with you. Your curiosity and variety of interest earns you many friends. You should be more careful about making split-second decisions.<br><br>Love Tendency: You are Mr. Popular among girls because you make them feel comfortable around you and your personality doesn't bore them. People will mistake you for a playboy even though you don't experience many relationships, thanks to your masculinity.<br><br>Life: Compliments from others are treats for you and you crave for them. Success will come to you from early on but you have to struggle to hold onto to it. Be your own entrepreneur. This will give you a better chance to succeed.<br><br>Match<br><br>Good Match: You will have great times with O-type and AB type Aries and Leos. They appreciate your free spirited nature. Frugal people are your pet peeves. You consider that to be a sin. O-type Gemini, B-type Libras and Aquarius are generous people and they will pamper you.<br><br>Bad Match: B-type Capricorns and A-type Scorpios disdain flamboyant scenes and have trouble conveying positive compliments to you. They can't provide the lifestyle that you seek. Another problem you might encounter with them is that they, unlike you, keep some opinions to themselves, which then resurfaces at the wrong time.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> .......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.  It's pretty accurate for Leo + A.<br><br>Personality: Here's another one who conveys this charming shyness to people. But to your friends, you are a great confidante who they can count on for help. Your pride will get in your way if you hold onto it too much. Be careful not to do that or else it will be hurt to the point you might not be able to endure.<br><br>Love Tendency: Boyfriends will be plentiful for you and that's why you will enjoy many relationships. The only problem is that they will not be meaningful to you. You are not great at expressing your thoughts into words and therefore make an easy escape with gifts. In a serious sense, love will come to you only once and you will carry that in your heart forever. You will be choosy when it comes to picking a potential husband. However, there will be no regrets because you know you made the right decision.<br><br>Life: There will be some low points in your life when you think you are alone. That's because you are sensitive and worry too much. You worries should be cast aside because you have loving friends around you. Money management is something people should learn from you because you are very organized. There shouldn't be a problem with money due careful spending habits.<br><br>Match<br><br>Good Match: O-type of Aries, Sagittarius, and Aquarius will truly love you with all their emotions. They are trustworthy and you can always put your head on their shoulders when in need. You can also rely on AB-type Leos and Sagittarius.<br><br>Bad Match: The person you least favor is one who is stingy with his money. A-type Leos and B-type Taurus and Cancers will not be able to give you the financial freedom you need. This is not the only aspect in where you clash with them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Libra Type A<br><br>September 23 - October 22<br><br>for Men<br>Personality: You are a pacified person who doesn't like to cause arguments with anyone. That's why you are sometimes mistaken for a cold person.<br><br>Love Tendency: The combination of your smartness and gallant manners makes you an attractive package to women. You're definitely the <strong>leading man out of all the Libra blood types.</strong><br><br>Life: Peace and tranquility that you cherish very much. Therefore, you lack the fiery, aggressive business approach. Make sure you work at your own pace rather than to try to catch up your ambitions hastily.<br><br>for Women<br>Personality: Your enchanting magnetism people to you. Another asset you possess is the generosity for others. The weakness about you is that you are careless and clumsy at times. You've got to be careful if you would like others to trust you with important matters.<br><br>Love Tendency: You are the dominant one in the relationship who has the upper hand most of the times. But that doesn't stop the men to be attracted to you. You will have many boyfriends, where one of them will be a very special person. Marriage is in your destiny and it will be a happy one.<br><br>Life: You endured many family hardships in your lifetime but you still grew up to be a mature and responsible adult. You are respected in your workplace because you put your entire effort into any project. Since you were young, there were only a few friends you kept in touch because you were more mature than your peers. This will occur as an adult, too. Try to stay away from matters that don't concern you because this is one reason why people will not be too fond of you.<br><br>Match<br><br>Good Match: Mental stability is very important and A-type Gemini and AB-type Libras and Aquarius are able to provide that for you. A-type and AB-type Leos and O-type Sagittarius also match very well with you because they have the strength to guide you through life.<br><br>Bad Match: You don't understand people who are rude and don't have any manners. That's why B-type Aries will be of much inconvenience for you because they start arguments anywhere with you. B-type Capricorns are also people who don't appreciate the finer things in life, such as the beautiful world of art.<br><br>muahahahhaa. i am invinsible!<br>[/b]</div>
