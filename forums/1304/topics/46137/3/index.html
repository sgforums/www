I held you tight...<br>Praying you would always love me every day, and every night<br>But time went on, as it tends to do...<br>And with times passing, I fell even deeper for you...<br><br>Your love grew tiresome... it tore me apart...<br>And you broke every promise, when you broke my heart...<br>I couldnÂ’t stop crying, it hurt me so much...<br>For I longed every moment to feel your gentle touch...<br><br>I gaze into your eyes, to see only gray...<br>there was no need for words... I knew what you had to say...<br>I held on to you, in the depths of my heart...<br>Regardless of how it tore me apart...<br><br>My love still remains, through the betrayal youÂ’ve done...<br>Messing with my best friend, and having your fun...<br>I stood by your side, though you didnÂ’t want me...<br>and I loved you so endlessly...<br><br>I still love you, but timeÂ’s mended my heart...<br>But never shall your memory part...<br>And you will always have a special place within my heart...<br><br>You will always be the first, who touched me so deep...<br>And in my heart, will I always keep...<br>memories of you and me...<br>together for eternity...<br><br>You taught me how to love and, darling...<br>You will always be my first love.<br><br></div>
