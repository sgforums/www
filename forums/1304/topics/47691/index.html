Because of your nature of remembering hatred and high ego of not forgiving others, your relationship always suffer.<br><br>Starfruit;<br><br>You are like a magnet; attracting many people. A popular fruit to the opposite sex.  A starfruit is the most egoistic fruit. A male starfruit likes to woo girls to show off to friends, never is serious to girls.

A good worker.<br><br>Strawberry;<br><br>A strawberry is someone very nice, hardworking and considerate. Plan your future very well. A female strawberry is a girl next door, a male strawberry however is a multiple lover.

When these two fruits are together, they are the most loving pair, and will gain many admirations from others. They may experience many tough obsticles along the road but since they are made for each other right from the start, no obsticle in this world can stop them from getting together. Because a male grape will to learn from mistakes and change, once together, they are the most stable pairing.<br><br>Male Apple and Female Apple;<br><br>This two fruits are very suitable for one another.
