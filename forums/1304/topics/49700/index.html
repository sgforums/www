            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">if i had the chance, i really want to tell you all these.. but seems like.. you never gave me the chance...</span><br><br>"You are the girl i love most." This was wad you told me. I will never forget it, it means so much to me. If only i have the chance to, i really want to call you my laogong once more. I have never loved somone so much before. Although i may be still young, but i really missed you, the moments we had together were too beautiful. I really enjoyed the times we had together, i am sure you did, didn't you?<br><br>I still remember, we knew each other in IRC. We were only in secondary one then. When i told you who i am, you said you knew me. I was surprised. I didn't know you, I wanted to know, but i did not really bothered to ask, since you told me not to. At that time, i still like another guy, and was rather heartbroken. It took me about 5 or 6 months to get over him. I guess all along, you were chatting with me. However, i still did not know who you were.<br><br>Until one day, i was at the blk, 424 behind the school. You was with your friends at the playground there. Your friends came and asked me if i was lijuan. I told them i was not, they went back n scolded you. Well, till then, then i know who you were. We started talking on phone. I started to have a liking in you. I told my closest friends, and asked them not to tell you. I didn't know you liked me too.<br><br>I remembered our trip to Malacca, our class shared the same bus. At that time, i liked you alot, i didn't know it was love. We talked till late night at the hotel. I really enjoyed talking to you.<br><br>Soon our final year exams are here. During our exams, or rather just before it, you asked me, " ni ke yi zuo wo de stead mah"  i was very happy, i wanted to say yes immediately, but i wanted you to feel nervous, i accepted you only after some days, on the 11th of Oct. I was very happy, i was so in love =) .<br><br>We were both shy, i don't even know how to go stead, so we were not close, even though, we live quite near. There was a distance between us. At that time, i don't even know how to go stead, i don't even dare to hold our hand. Thinking back, i think we were very funny, 1 young couple, both shy. Then, i don't dare to hug you too. I told you, and you pulled my hand over, till then, i finally dared to. It was a long time before we finally we like a couple. After being together for 7 months, you wanted a break up, i was very sad, i cried.<br><br>I remember then next day, got cultural camp, i did not want to go, but still went. I act that i was happy, but deep in me, my heart is crying. Well, that night you asked for a patch. I immediately agreed, i couldn't help it, i love you too much.<br><br>Things were not the same anymore, after we patched. But i still tried to maintain our relationship, think we dragged on, and finally on the 2nd of july, you wanted to break. We were both in sec 2. Well, i cried alot. I even cut myself, i know its stupid, i couldn't help it. After a few months, i really though i got over you, i even went stead with ur friend, it was merely a crush.<br><br>One day, you smsed me, we talked. All my feelings for you came back, i wanted to be with you. I did not like him anymore, all becoz my feelings for you never go away. I hoped to be with you, but you just told me, "maybe its better for us to remain friends."<br><br>Well, then i lived on liking you, but you changed, you had mixed with wrong company, and learnt bad things like smoking, etc. My heart aches alot, you know anot. We were in sec 3 already, In june, i had a barbercue with my friends. I asked you to go, as all my friends asked people we like to go, and it was on 10th of June. At that time,yourbrother liked me, but i liked you. You ask me to like him as he is a good guy, but i won't coz i like you. can you imagine the one u like ask u to like someone else, i was heartbroken.<br>After the barbercue, you all came to my house to stay, well, i was actually looking at you most of the time, you did not noticed. Well, i really love you alot.<br><br>Soon on the 13th of june, you asked for patch, or rather jianqi used ur hp to sms me, i tought it was you, but well, i was too happy, i accepted you. From then, you did not treat me as a stead, you don't even want to go out with me. I thought you don't like me, i did not want to drag. Soon, you started treating me well, i really had the happiest days of my live, at least till now, those were the happiest days.<br><br>In a relationship, there must be quarrels, we had joys n angers well, but you really treated me well. I am really very happy to be able to be with you, likewise, i think you are happy too right. Soon, after being together for 11 months this time round, we began to quarrel almost everyday, y .. i also dunno..<br><br>I really tried hard, i don't wanna quarrel with you, but the things i do , you just dun like. I always say its my fault, coz i never wanted to quarrel with u, but.. i have never felt i did anything wrong. towards you, everything i did, was all becoz i really love you that much, you get jealous easily, i also do. I kept distance from guys , but wadever i do, they dun seems to please you in any way. I feel so useless. i really tried hard, i tolerated the almost daily quarrels, just to dun wanna lose you. then, you did not even want to go out with me, i understand, it was examinations period.<br><br>I remember after my exam, we wanted to go out. you had no money, even though we already decided on going to watch movie. In the end, you say we weill watch next time wen you have the money. I believe you, the day did not come, that was one of the many things i wish had happened but did not.<br><br>Finally, after those quarrels, we mamaged to survive, we did not break up but,  my o level chinese is 3 days away, on the 6th of june, i told you i wanted a separation. which only meant to be letting me cool down n study, i wanted to study, my plans were to patch with you, after my exams, but after i want to separate, you want to break. you said alot of harsh things to me, which hurts alot.<br><br>just one more week, you also dun wanna gif me, you dun even wanna spend our one year together, i really missed the times we were happy together. i always thought that if we could just give ourselves one more chance, things would improve. however, you did not want to give me that chance, or till now , i haven't had that chance. I tried calling you, i tried everything. I even wated to patch. You juz seems to ignore me, i feel so hopeless. you said if i did not want to separate, u will not want to break.but seems like.. i am not even ur ex.. i dun seem to know you anymore.. you are as cold as ice, with so many thorns that pokes right into my heart..<br><br>after knowing that you and her met each other to smoke, etc. i was very jealous, but there was nothing i could do. something in me told me you liked cindy,but you told me you don't.. haix.. i realli dunno wad i should do.. but.. never wanted it to end this way.. wo zhen de ai de hao ku.. but thanks, without u, i would not be what i am today... i guess.. we were too young.....<br><br></div>
