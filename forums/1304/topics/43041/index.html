            <div class='col-md body'>this was something I always told you.... whenever we argue~<br><br>we met 4 years ago.... in our workplace~~I was waiting for my O level results.~ I did not bear any good impression at all, cos you were too playful, and irritating... and my impression of you was as a lame joker~~ and how much I hate you to get out of my sight~<br><br>Nov 2000, we started off as colleagues... We often had lunch with Vin and Ling~~ and how often you would disturb Ling with ur lame joke~ To Vin and me~, you and Ling would become a couple~ but seems we were wrong~<br><br>I remember the first day I started a 'serious' chat wif you. I broke off with my bf and you came consoling me then~ I remember that was the first time I saw the 'decent' side of you~ the way you talked to me~ how convincing indeed~~<br><br>Soon~~ we started to be the best pal at work~ lunch together, and times when you would gave me a treat during break time for my hard work etc....<br><br>Jan 2001, you dated me out on my birthday~~ and it was the first time ever I saw the smart side of you~ the way you dress and presented yourself impressed me a lot~~ and was so unlike the one I knew during work~ We had a fun time with Vin and your buddies~ and since then we would chat on phone~~ for number of hours~ We would talk about our past~ in school or in relationship~ and I remember you told me that you had not been with any girlfriends before~~<br><br>Feb 2001, Valentine's day~ the second time you dated me out~ We were with Yao and his gf, Sin,  they were always the problematic couple in your circle of friends~~ but they were great people, not only friendly but mature too~~ they always had arguments even with our presence~~ I remember we took a walk in center point~ and Yao and Sin went somewhere else~ we entered a toy shop~ and I had told you how cute the soft toys were~~ and you looking at me~~ asking me if we could be just more than the best pals~~ I was shocked~ but nervous too~~ I knew the ans straight in my heart~ "Yes" was what I wanted to tell you~~ but I was playful~~ i wanted to disturb you~~ so I replied~~<br><br>"try giving me half an hour more, I will give you my answer then"<br><br>And you didn't get my hint at all and not even attentive enough to catch my goofy grin~~</div>
