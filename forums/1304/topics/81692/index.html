            <div class='col-md body'>How often do we throw our temper on someone who<br>was always there for us, who cares for us and<br>really loves us with all his or her heart? And<br>all we do is break their hearts? HereÂ’s a story<br>that I read about and found it meaningful so<br>decided to forward to you people hope u enjoy<br>reading it as much as me.<br><br>The wish of a child<br>A man came home from work late, tired and<br>irritated, to find his 5-year old son waiting<br>for him at the door. "Daddy, may I ask you a<br>question?"<br>"Yeah sure, what is it?" replied the man.<br>"Daddy, how much do you make an hour?"<br>"That's none of your business. Why do you ask<br>such a thing?" the man said angrily.<br>"I just want to know. Please tell me, how much<br>do you make an hour?" Pleaded the little boy.<br>"If you must know, I make $20 an hour."<br>"Oh," the little boy replied, with his head<br>down.<br>Looking up, he said, "Daddy, may I please borrow<br>$10?"<br>The father was furious, "If the only reason you<br>asked that is so you can borrow some money to<br>buy a silly toy or some other nonsense, then you<br>march yourself straight to your room and go to<br>bed. Think about why you are being so selfish. I<br>work long hard hours everyday and don't have<br>time for such this childish behavior."<br>The little boy quietly went to his room and shut<br>the door.<br>The man sat down and started to get even angrier<br>about the little boy's questions. How dare he<br>ask such questions only to get some money?<br>After about an hour or so, the man had calmed<br>down, and started to think: He may have been a<br>little hard on his son. Maybe there was<br>something he really needed to buy with that $10<br>and he really didn't ask for money very often.<br>The man went to the door of the little boy's<br>room and opened the door. "Are you asleep, son?"<br>He asked.<br>"No daddy, I'm awake," replied the boy.<br>"I've been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you<br>earlier," said the man. "It s been a long day<br>and I took out my aggravation on you. Here's the<br>$10 you asked for."<br>The little boy sat straight up, smiling. "Oh,<br>thank you daddy!" He yelled.<br>Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled out<br>some crumpled up bills. The man, seeing that the<br>boy already had money, started to get angry<br>again.<br>The little boy slowly counted out his money, and<br>then looked up at his father.<br>Â“Why do you want more money if you already have<br>some?" the father grumbled.<br>"Because I didn't have enough, but now I do,"<br>the little boy replied. "Daddy I have $20 now.<br>Can I buy an hour of your time? Please come home<br>early tomorrow. I would like to have dinner with<br>you."<br><br>I believe after reading this, remember: there<br>is someone who cares for you and loves you,<br>donÂ’t lose him or her to your temper and regret<br>the next moment. People have reasons to do what<br>they did, maybe you should take time to find out<br>why they did it and soon you will learn to<br>appreciate more people who are precious and<br>important in your life. Everyone needs a friend.<br>So treasure them! Take care.<br><br>- Nvr put what u can do today till tomorrow.<br>Cause someone needs u today -<br></div>
