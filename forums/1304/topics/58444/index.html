            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; It was first day of the mid-year exams, therefore i finished school a<br>little<br>&gt; earlier, i called him,<br>&gt; :Hey, i finished school earlier today, would you come by and pick me up?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Alright, give me 5 minutes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :5 minutes? But my school is just beside your house.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :I need to get ready.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Alright, make it fast then.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2pm in the afternoon, the sun is extremely hot, I stood under a shaded<br>tree<br>&gt; and fan myself.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Although it doesn't make much of a difference, it was better that I<br>fanned.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 5 minutes have passed, he's still not shown up, I was a lil' unhappy while<br>&gt; looking at my watch.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 10 minutes and he's still not here....couldn't be that he was met with an<br>&gt; accident?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 15 minutes passed, he finally shown up.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Why are you so late?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He wasn't even a lil' bothered: Nahz, was watching TV.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :What?! TV?! Why don't you sleep, bathe and eat before you come down then?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I haven't got anything else to say for that, didn't take the helmet he<br>&gt; handed me but stood there and stared at him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Sorry.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This was the first time he said sorry to me...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He is an egoistical person all along and has never once apologised to a<br>&gt; girl.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I looked at him, Alright, took the helmet and let him sent me home.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He is always acting like this, no explanations, no friction, no quarrels.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The only thing he does is to apologise. To me, somethings can't be settled<br>&gt; with a sorry.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I would never go on asking after everytime he apologises.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He told me, that was the first time he said sorry to a girl.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Although it take courage to admit mistakes, he never once correct his<br>&gt; mistakes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Saying sorry became a word to shut me up instead.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Tears flowed down my cheek on the 59th time he apologised.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I dropped my head: you don't ever need to say sorry to me again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If you can never change, then don't let me keep giving you chances again<br>and<br>&gt; again hoping and believing that you would change each time.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He held me lightly, and said the 60th sorry.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Even then, he did not change, and there was no explanation whatsoever.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I began to worry if there was something he was keeping from me.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :What's wrong with you these few days?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Nothing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Then why are you acting so strange?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :I am not.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :What can you say other than this answer?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">o you know I'm very woried, very insecure,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; do you treat me as your girlfriend?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :I'm sorry...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :I don't want to hear you say sorry again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I put down the phone and he did not call back.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He doesn't even care about me. Maybe we should....break up.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ....this was the 99th time he said sorry...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; From that day onwards, I never once called me or went to look for him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Sometimes I get an anonymous phonecall<br>&gt;<br>&gt; but everytime I said hello, it was dead, i think it's a call from him, but<br>&gt; why don't he speak up?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; After one month have passed, I couldn't contain the feelings I still have<br>&gt; for him anymore and went to his school to find him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I went outside his classroom and looked around, but there was no sign of<br>&gt; him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :excuse me, is XOXO here today?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :I'm afraid he already stopped schooling.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Huh? Why? When was that?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :He hasn't been in school for a month already.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Oh erms...thanks.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One month....not in school for one month...why is that so? I stumbled<br>home.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Called his hp: Sorry the caller is currently unavailable, please leave<br>your<br>&gt; message after the tone....<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I put down the phone, and called his house next, but there was no answer.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; How can it be? The whole family migrated?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It seems as though he has already disappeared from the face on the earth<br>&gt; leaving not even a single trace.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I couldn't find him....just as I was feeling distraughted, the phone<br>&gt; suddenly sounded, it was my friend.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He was one of his brothers and also my good friend.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Hey, what have you been doing? XOXO is in hospital.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :REALLY? WHAT HAPPENED?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Oh he is in ZZ hospital, the one you stayed in last time.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :I'll be right there.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I used the fastest speed my legs could carry and when I reached the<br>hospital<br>&gt; I saw that his parents were already there.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I asked them for the room number and flew across the hall.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He was lying on bed, looking at me, not saying a word, not moving a<br>muscle,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Hey, what happened to you? Why didn't you contact me?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He did not answer, and used the same stare on me again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Come on answer me...why don't you speak?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A tear flowed down the side of his eye, and it looked as though he used<br>the<br>&gt; greatest amount of strength that he could master to say...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :I'm...sorry...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; After that, his eyes went shut.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Hey, don't fool around alright...why say sorry to me?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">on't say sorry to me....please wake up....answer me please.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I wept and fell down on the side of his bed, pulling his shirt I cried<br>out..<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :Why do you have to apologise? Why don't you give me an explanation<br>instead?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :I won't forgive you, wake up, saying sorry is no use...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :If you don't wake up I'll never ever forgive you in this lifetime, please<br>I<br>&gt; beg of you..open your eyes.....<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That was the 100th sorry<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A group of medical staff, doctors, nurses pulled me away and tried to<br>revive<br>&gt; him. I had no strength to stand up...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; My mind was a blank.... my eyes could only see a sea of black.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He did not leave this world...I merely lost the chance to touch him<br>anymore.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But he would appear in my dreams sometimes, telling me how he was doing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He's still accompaning me, still alive, in my heart.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; would still laugh at my silliness, and call me his darling....just<br>that...he<br>&gt; never apologise to me anymore.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; After a month, his mom came to look for me, and gave me a box...inside was<br>&gt;<br>&gt; a 100 photographs, everyone had a story behind them..the reasons why he<br>made<br>&gt; me angry.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The first time, my dear, I did not purposely arrive late to pick you up.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I know this excuse is really lame, but I didn't have the heart to tell you<br>&gt; the truth then,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; before I stepped out of the house, I felt a pain in my chest, but I still<br>&gt; made it a point to meet you, please forgive me?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The second time, my dear, I...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The third time, my dear, I...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The 100th time, my dear, I didn't mean to leave you alone in this world,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It had to be so because God did not give me the chance to say I Love You<br>for<br>&gt; this lifetime of mine, and to put the ring on your finger....<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You are the first girl I apologised to.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And also the first girl I want to be with for the rest of my life...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Forgive me for not able to bring you happiness but I have thus become your<br>&gt; angel, always looking out for you...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Looking at you while you find your happiness...promise me...don't shed a<br>&gt; tear...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don't want to see you weep like this for me, I Love You ~XOXO<br>&gt;<br>&gt; How can I not cry? What you said was just too impossible.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The last photograph was of him in the hospital,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Although he was skinny, the smile on his face was bright as ever.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; His face was white and yet he tried his best to give his last smile on the<br>&gt; last photo, the 100th.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; At the time when he needed me the most, I wasn't with him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; :I'm sorry.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I held the photo tightly and cried for us.....<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So Guys out there... Explain to your girlfriend... Always......<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And girls... understand your boyfriend... Always...<br>&gt;<br></div>
