Rats are teamplayers for different reasons. They are able to take inputs from others to create superb and highly effective solutions that benefit others and, unselfishly, for their own credit and glory. Not easy to guess what they are thinking of, if they choose not to say, for they are too fast and unpredictable. They are highly family-oriented and will do anything (even at others` expense) for the goodness of his or her family.

To strengthen your business and career, place a `Dollar Sign Fountain of Wealth`s Lucky WaterÂ’ and a `Citrine Gem TreeÂ’ in the north sectors of your office and home respectively. It is important that you keep your kitchen stove clear of dust all the times to keep your<br>career luck high. At the South sector of the house, place a `Chong KuiÂ’ statue to flight off all poison arrows. A `CicadaÂ’ in the West can also promote peace for the mind and ward off the `5 Ghost StarÂ’.<br><br>To receive the good stars into your household, make sure you have a `Laughing Buddha on the HorseÂ’ in the sitting hall facing your front door. In the South East Sector, you may want to put a `Lucky Bat with Golden CoinÂ’.<br><br>For romance and good marriage luck, one can hang a `Mystic KnotÂ’ in the South West sector.

And they do so in good stride and nature. Never quick to put blame on others, they are reliable friends and partners amidst their stubbornness. Even in good times and prosperity, oxen maintain their mellowed countenance. Oxen`s partners, unless they are oxen too, can often get impatient on their slow-natured partner and that's where murmuring can go on for years but with little harm done, on our good natured Ox, of course.<br><br>Oxen`s 2004 Luck:<br>As the rain stops, clear sky is ahead of you in 2004. Your perseverance will yield fruits this year. For those in business this means greater profits. For those working, you may get a promotion and salary increment.

You will eventually find that someone whom you deserve better. For those who are married your relationship will be strengthened after what you guys went through last year. You may want to plan to have a baby to arrive in 2005.<br><br>For students, your result will improve over last year, giving you more confidence in school. Carry on the good works and you can even do better. Elderly oxen need to be extra careful in whatever they do. Do not climb high and let the younger ones do the heavier loads for you. Sure you may have the muscles, oilment aren't cheap also.<br><br>Useful Feng-Shui Tools for Oxen:<br>Oxen should use more attack mode feng-shui this year to herald in the good stars. `Laughing Buddha on the HorseÂ’ in the living hall facing the front door is a good start. Place a `Dollar Sign Fountain of Wealth`s Lucky WaterÂ’ and a `Citrine Gem TreeÂ’ in the north sectors of your office and home respectively. Do this after you have cleansed all the dust off the top hinges of all your doors<br>and windows. Near your front door , it is good to place a `Treasure PotÂ’.<br><br>To attract important friendsÂ’ aid, use a `Fountain of Wealth ReplicaÂ’ in the North West sector. Your `Partner CharmÂ’ to carry wherever you go is `Rat, Snake and RoosterÂ’. Use a statue of `Chong KuiÂ’ in the South to defend against the Death Star lurking around this year.<br><br>To secure your new love relationship, make sure you have your `Rose Gem Love DucksÂ’ in the South West of your room. If you think you have not found the right one, use `Singing Love BirdsÂ’ instead. If too many to choose from, use `Mystic KnotÂ’. To harness your marriage relationship, `Rose Gem TreeÂ’ will do.<br><br>Get a `Wisdom PagodaÂ’ and place in the North East sector of the study room to help your children improve on their results.<br><br>Elderly oxen have more things to get. If staying alone, defend yourself by planting `Jade Kuan Yin bambooÂ’ outside the house. Within a 3 meter radius from the front door, place a `Jade Gem TreeÂ’ to deflect bad energies. Clear all clutters in the centre zone of the house where the bad `Yellow-5 StarÂ’ will hit this year. Rear 9 Goldfish (8 Gold colors 1 Black color ) in the North.

They are adventurous and enjoy threading on dangerous grounds. Curious by nature, they like to embark on new things, learning new skills and settling on new environment. Unlike the oxen who are stubborn inwardly, tigers are outwardly defiant, making them at times, seemed hard to get along with. Those who submit to them, on the other hand, have much to gain, for the Tiger will do most of the work for them.<br><br>Tigers` 2004 Luck:<br>Although you have crossed the Grand Duke Star this year, you are fortunate that there are many other good stars that will help alleviate the degree of wrath. You should experience better results than last year.<br><br>For those in business and working alike, although you will continue to face problems but you will realise how easily the problems solve for themselves this year. Some big serious crisis may arise (that may seem unbearable), but have a level-head and maintain your cool. The problem will be solved and you will walk out of it safely and a better man.<br><br>While career luck is good, love will unfortunately be like a roller coaster ride for the tigers this year. Sometimes, the problems do not lie with the other party. Use a mirror and look into it seriously. Only after you did that and concluded the problem was with the other party then you may throw the mirror at him/her. For those married, if only you treat your spouse like your children and not the maid, things will be happier for everyone. Absence will make the heart fonder, short separation is good but permanent separation is expensive.<br><br>Like any years, Tiger studentsÂ’ education will be like a walk in the park. Problems may come from sportsÂ’ injury. You still playing too rough? Use the overhead bridge. Lazy bones may equate to broken bones.<br><br>For the elderly, there is a blood star around, so don`t climb up and down or do anything stupid. It may be a good idea to go on holidays to improve your luck further.<br><br>Useful Feng-Shui Tools for Tigers:<br>Continue to use those auspicious wealth-gathering feng-shui tools from last year like the `Dollar Sign Fountain of Wealth Lucky WaterÂ’ in the North sector, `Three Legged Frog` on each side of your<br>doorway; inward facing, `Chinese Ancient Coins` on the inside door-knobs of every rooms, `Citrine Gem TreeÂ’ and our `Fountain of Wealth 24k Replica`etc. You may however want to change<br>your`Laughing Buddha on Money BagÂ’ to ` Laughing Buddha on the HorseÂ’ since you can receive wealth luck better this year. A `Treasure PotÂ’ will also be good to add this year in the South East sector. Place a statue of `Guan KongÂ’ in the South to help clear all hurdles and a `Mystic KnotÂ’ in the South to strengthen your prestige and status. To appease the Grand Duke Star, place a pair of `Pi XiuÂ’ in the centre of your hall. Your `Partner CharmÂ’ to carry consists of `Horse, Dog &amp; PigÂ’. Remove all triangular shape flower vases in the home to avoid extra-marital problems. Use round or oval shape ones instead. If you already have `Rose Gem Love DucksÂ’ on the South- West sector but it does not help much, add a `Singing Love Birds`. Putting `Rose Gem StonesÂ’ below the pillow may help also.<br><br>To reduce your temper, get an `Amethyst Gem TreeÂ’. You can put this at the North East sector. No need to add anything if your Tiger children are doing well in their studies. Otherwise, use the basic `<br>Wisdom PagodaÂ’ and `Clear Crystal Gem TreeÂ’ like the rest. More importantly, put a `8-Precious Stone CharmÂ’ in their school bag to ward off any potential injury.<br><br>Elderly Tigers should do the same things like the Elderly Oxen: planting `Jade Kuan Yin bambooÂ’ outside the house, a`Jade Gem TreeÂ’ inside the front door, clear all clutters in the centre zone of the house, rear 9 Goldfish in the North, `Fu-Lu ShouÂ’ in the East, `Hu-LuÂ’ in the bed room and carry a `8 Precious Stone CharmÂ’ wherever they go.</div>
