            <div class='col-md body'>Hello!  I would like to make a complain about an incident that happened to me recently. On July 03, 2003, I went to a store named J.S.L Digital located at 1 Rocher canal Road #01-63 Sim Lim Square 188504 Singapore.  I bought a JVC Digital movie camera model GR-D70 from Jimmy Chew. I did not know that he sold me a movie camera which can only be used in countries that used PAL.  He very well knows that I live in Manila, Philippines and the system we use is NTSC.  Clearly in this aspect, he deceived me.  I realized that the camera cannot be used when I got back to manila.  I called him long distance to complain about this.  He told me that I just need a converter and I can use my computer to burn vcds of my movie using the CD provided. I told him that should it happen that i cannot use the cd, i would like to return the whole unit.  He said no problem.  When I tried to use it on my windows XP, the computer doesn't want to download because the CD was not windows XP compliant.  I asked my friend to bring the unit back to Jimmy for a replacement of a cheaper digital camera.  Jimmy refused and told me that I should bring him my computer and he will bring me to JVC to download the program.  He also told me that I don't know how to use my computer.  The only thing he can help me is to give me a converter for my TV to convert the JVC movie camera output so that I can watch it in my tv.  How can I make copies of the movie and play it in the vcd now?  Is this how Singapore does business?  I hope you can look into this incident and give me some feedback.  I am very disappointed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are certainly many of such businessmen (actually they're just sales staff, usually) in singapore and admittedly, they will do anything to "cheat" tourists.<br><br>However, one thing I must mention to you, while you're seeking justice, is that, for future reference, perhaps you would like to do some research on your intended purchase, especially expensive equipment like cameras and audio/visual stuff.<br><br>It's no good walking into a shop just wanting a "camera". That's when they will kick your ass silly (esp at sim lim) and u will end up with what u are now. i'm not saying it's ur fault and that the singaporean vendor is just doing his "job", i'm saying this experience could have been avoided if u had certain product knowledge of what u intend to spend hundreds of dollars on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey lee, relax, i dun think he (or she?) despises singaporeans, and yeah he was sway enuff to really go to where they purposely try to rip tourists off.<br><br>serendipity: if it makes u feel better, they also try to rip locals off! some shops anyway. it used to be worse, few years ago, prices in the same building could be 50% different! and then of course there's all that "white lies" that u encountered.<br><br>i wouldn't know how you'd seek redress for this except to take it formally and go to the authorities. wat's the consumer complaints authority in singapore anyway? ahhah i also dunno..

            <div class='col-md body'>excuse me LEE, I am not complaining about stolen wallets  I was a customer and bought an item thinking that I will not be cheated. Maybe I was too trusting or the salesman Jimmy Chew was really convincing.  I guess he will forever be a salesman.  Sorry to find out that there are people in your country that are like him and like you too.  By the way, a singaporean national brought me to that Sim Lim place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there are people like that everywhere, not just in singapore. As the rest says, 'black sheeps' do exist. To be on the safe side, it's actually better to buy the product in your home country or at least, get a local who understands your requirements to get for you. Bringing you to Sim Lim doesn't mean you have to buy from them. In the first place, you must have wanted to buy the product and so your friend brought you to Sim Lim. The wallet story by Lee is just an analogy.</div>
