            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by veLvEtgEr:</div><div class="quote_body">ok.. here's the scenerio:  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>a girl got to know 2 guy frens (A and B) 5 years ago. A and B used to be quite close frens since a long time ago, till A went overseas 4 yrs ago. at that time, the girl was not very close to both A and B. during the period when A was overseas, the girl got to know B better, and they became very good frens. the girl realised that she was falling for B, but somehow thought they couldnt be together. (B couldnt forget abt his ex). the girl went steady with other guys, but a place in her heart was kept for B, duno whether the liking for B was just purely friendship, or BGR.<br><br>recently, A came back from overseas. B had no gf yet, and the girl broke up with her bf already. the girl started to get to know A better, but still remained as good frens with B. she tried bringing A and B together again, cos they had not contacted each other for a long time. A started to go after the girl, but the girl only had feelings for B. however, the girl didnt know if B had feelings for her. the girl didnt know what to do...<br><br>questions:<br>1) is the girl a b.i.t.c.h or flirt?<br>2) would the friendship between A and B deteriorate 'cos of the girl?<br>3) what should the girl do??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Pretty much the same elements in the case of Curad. Let daddy analysis this situation for you bah.<br><br>Firstly, the impression B has in A when the both of them are getting closer is more of a friendship than anything else. This is shown by the fact that she isn't anywhere better than his ex, therefore he rejected her with the context of excuse saying he couldn't forget his ex. Ok... so be it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This girl definitely has a gnawing inferiority in her, which creates a void of emptiness in heart. (Sh|t I am using the same sentence again). She couldn't have him, therefore he goes try relationship with other guys - hoping that someone could take over the place eventually. In the end, none made it. Therefore she always say, there is a place for him in his heart.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Actually this girl unconsciously is using reverse psychology to lure him to jio her. But as you can see, she has failed. What I mean by reverse psychology? It simply means that she go with other guys to try to make B do something about it if he likes her, because if he do something, she will immediately accept. Sad to say, as her quest went - I doubt B's impression of her will continue to remain good.<br><br>If you ask daddy if B like her, I would say most probably no. Because if he did, he would already do something and furthermore, what she did - moving along with guys one after another - only serve to futher destroy this impression B will have.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Question 1<br>Whether she is a b|tch or flirt - it all lies in the eyes of a beholder.<br><br>Question 2<br>Whether A and B will fall out because of her - I doubt so, unless A is very subjected to woman's scheme. I doubt B will because of her fall out with A, but if it did happened - most probably will be because of A.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Question 3<br>What should the girl do? The girl have been making mistakes for SO LONG. All her love decision are totally screwed up. Unless miracle take place, I doubt B will accept her. Its time to give herself some *quality* time to think and reflect upon herself. She made decision for the sake of making them - its damn screwed up. She need to think about things, etc and see what she really wants. Once she know for certain, etc - without giving up halfway - she has to go for it. Or to give it up totally. Moving about to nowhere will only serve to reflect upon her character that B will pout.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Cheers</div>
