People hates making decision or sacrifices at their own expense - and will often land themselves in situations like A.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If A truly loves this relation with B, he wouldn't even accept the break as break - he will work things out. Furthermore, the fact remains that he went for C - which is exactly the source of problem that B sees in and it has confirm to B that C is the source of problem despite A possible attempt to ward it off as a friendship, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>During the relationship with B, A fell in love/crushes/etc with C - this shows that his love for B isn't that strong afterall. A fully satified man will never go for another woman. Well, A did.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>My advice A need a period of time to reflect and ponder on his doings/feelings/thoughts/etc. He never give himself time to think and tries for the best of both world situation - this hardly work.<br><br>P.S: Are you so sure he loves B and not because he feel gulity that C came into the picture and he responded to her?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
