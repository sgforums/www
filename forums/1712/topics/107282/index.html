            <div class='col-md body'>Full Marks for the ACS OBA!<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>10 out of 10!  That was the verdict many gave the ACS OBA for taking the initiative to organise the TeachersÂ’ Day barbecue in honour of retired ACS teachers. About 70 old boys and girls turned up at the ACS (Barker Road) Shaw Pool on 01 September 2004 for an evening of fellowship and to pay tribute to 63 retired teachers and principals who once shaped their lives in school.<br><br>Several of the invited retired teachers were surprised by the large turn out as they thought the event was only for past and present teachers. According to Mr Wee Moh Nam: Â“Frankly, I did not expect to see so many old boys at the barbecue.  It was a great opportunity for me to catch up with them as well as the old teachers, some of whom I have not seen for years!Â”<br><br>Mr Ying Yoke Kong, was also thrilled to re-establish friendships with old colleagues. Â“ItÂ’s a great party, and I thank the OBA for remembering us. I hope this token of appreciation will remind the younger teachers of the important role they play in nurturing the future leaders of tomorrow, and the satisfaction of being appreciatedÂ”, he added.<br><br>As old boys and retired teachers mingle together as one family exchanging fond memories and anecdotes, one old boy, Mr Chan Hian Young (ACJC Class of 7<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> delighted some of the teachers when he read a personal warm tribute to them, extracts of which are quoted below.<br><br>Observing the beaming faces and spirited conver-sations that went on throughout the evening, former principal Mr Lee Hah Ing aptly remarked that the occasion truly demonstrates the unique ACS Spirit and the solidarity of ACSians.<br><br>It was indeed a joyous evening for everyone at the barbecue.  Many of the retired teachers present gave the OBA the thumbs up and look forward to more such occasions in the future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Extracts from Mr Chan Hian YoungÂ’s<br>Tribute to Teachers.</strong><br><br>Today is TeacherÂ’s Day and I would like to say a few words<br><br>Teachers are special. Next to parents, they have the greatest influence during a childÂ’s formative years.<br><br>I am very blessed to have had great teachers. I can remember almost every detail of a conversation with a teacher. It is not because I have a particularly good memory. It is because a child (and anyone below 18 is a child) holds on to every word that comes from the mouth of the teacher. Sometimes, the teacherÂ’s authority is greater than that of the parent. Many a child is more anxious to please the teacher than to please the parent. It may be difficult for teachers to believe this, but children behave better in school than at home or anywhere.<br><br>I will always remember what my teachers have taught me. I will carry to my grave the knowledge that my teachers have imparted.<br><br>I would like to thank every one who has taught me. Time does not permit me to thank every one of you. I would like to thank even those who have not taught me personally. At one level, I am standing here as Chan Hian Young, ACPS Class of 1972, ACSS Class of 1976 and ACJC Class of 1978, paying tribute to the specific individuals present and absent today who have taught me. But at another level, I am standing here as the Timeless, Nameless and Faceless Pupil thanking the Timeless, Nameless and Faceless Teacher. Your pupils may or may not be here today. It does not matter. I am thanking you on behalf of all the pupils you have taught.<br><br>Thank you for having dedicated your lives to the teaching profession so that we, whether or not we knew it then or know it now, may be beneficiaries of your choice of profession. As you look back in your retirement years, stand proud that your lives have made a difference in the lives of your pupils. God bless all of you.<br>Chan Hian Young<br><br>ACJC Class of 1978<br><br></div>
