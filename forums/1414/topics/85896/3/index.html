I think this is ridiculous!.. I mean the girl could have put it in a nicer way and not so directly. Seems very threatening to me. Anyway if the couple is very stable in the r/s, I presume they would have been planning about marriage, so the question is abit pointless.<br><br>If the guy is willing and planning to settle down, the proposal will come as time passes. No point asking for it. A bit too pressuring for the guy to handle.<br><br>What if the guy proposes next year, but there isn't adequate planning for marriage, also have to wait right?? Is the girl feeling insecure in the first place?<br><br>They can ROM first then have the customary wedding later but then, if I'm the girl, is pretty wierd for me, if I need to ask him to propose.<br><br>If she's getting tired of the r/s, what makes her think that by getting married, she will think otherwise?<br><br></div>
