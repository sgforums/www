            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong><span style="color: blue;"><span class="large">Feng Shui Tips! Believe it or Not...<br><br>1) There should be no shoes or slippers lying around outside the main<br>door<br>of every house. Remove it if you can. Allow that space at the main door<br>to<br>be free and clear. Now, allow me to tell you why. The chi (energy)<br>rides<br>with the wind and will collect all the smell of those shoes and<br>slippers<br>into your house causing sickness. These chi then travels about in your<br>house<br>looking for water to stay but if there are no water fountains or fish<br>tanks,<br>then the chi will be disperse by wind.<br><br>2) There should be no television sets in your bedrooms: If you cannot<br>get<br>rid of that habit then after watching the television programs, cover it<br>with<br>a plastic table cloth. Remember it has to be plastic and not simply<br>cloth.<br><br>3) There should be no mirrors opposite your bed or at the side of your<br>bed.<br>Mirrors opposite the bed can attract a third party to the relationship.<br>Therefore, do not place mirrors anywhere you like and especially in<br>your<br>bedroom.<br><br>4) There should not be a dinning table opposite your altar table. Some<br>people are still not aware of this concept and still have that in their<br>dinning room. Shift the dinning table.<br><br>5) If you have a fish tank in your house, be careful. A fish tank<br>placed<br>correctly can bring about greater fortune as you will tap on the Divine<br>Water Dragon's Den". But if you tap wrongly, it can cause you to have<br>lawsuits, bankruptcy, work pressure, troubles and problems. If you<br>noticed<br>any of these after placing the fish tank for approximately four months,<br>shift your fish tank to another location.<br><br>6) In your kitchen, ensure that opposite your stove there is no<br>refrigerator, washing machine, wash basin and toilet. The fire and<br>water<br>crash causing family members to have disagreements. The fengshui<br>solution?<br>Remove one of them.<br><br>7) Try not to allow children to sleep on mattresses on the floor. Yes,<br>this<br>allows young children not to fall off beds but it also causes young<br>children<br>to fall sick frequently. The reason is: chi is not able to flow<br>underneath<br>the bed. Ideally, chi should circulate around the mattress where our<br>children sleeps to allow them to be healthy.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> For young children, try to have their back to the wall when, they<br>write.<br>It is important there should be a solid wall behind a children's<br>writing<br>table. This allows the child to have support so that he can sit there<br>and<br>study longer rather than for only half an hour and then they tend to<br>move<br>about because there is no solid wall behind their back. Adjust your<br>writing<br>table.<br><br>9) Do not allow children to sleep on double decker beds even if it<br>means<br>saving space. The child sleeping underneath the double decker bed will<br>not<br>have "fresh chi" and so his health might be weak. But if due to space<br>constraints, then monitor your child's health if not add in a metal 6<br>rods<br>wind chime to break up the "stale chi" around his bed.<br><br>10) Your bed should always have a solid wall behind you. This is<br>important<br>if you wish to have a good rest. A solid wall simply means that you can<br>go<br>into deeper sleep and therefore enabling you to have good rest so that<br>when<br>you wake up in the morning, you will feel fresh and well rested. This<br>also<br>allows you to be able to concentrate on your work better.<br><br>11) There should be no beam on top of your bed, your stove, your sofa<br>sets<br>or the altar table. The beam above causes chi to be pressured thus<br>enabling<br>you to have pressures in life. Therefore, don't place furniture's<br>underneath<br>it or alternatively level the beam. But make sure if you choose the<br>latter,<br>it is important that you have enough height for that space.<br><br>12) If you have a lot of work pressure, maybe it's the marble table<br>that you<br>have in your dinning room that uses you to have those problems. Remove<br>that<br>marble table and change to a wooden one or alternatively live with that<br>work<br>pressure!<br><br>13) If your child usually falls sick in that bedroom: Then either<br>change<br>them to another bedroom or simply hang a six rod metal wind chime as<br>the<br>metal element will break all the earth energies in that room. After<br>hanging,<br>if the wind could not do the job for you then you will have to "chime"<br>it<br>yourself and then watch for the good results.<br><br>14) Do not use a red sofa set: The colour red represent the element of<br>fire.<br>And for fengshui, some places simply cannot have the colour red in that<br>sector. For example : the wealth area or some other sectors which<br>without a<br>fengshui check would be unable to tell you where it is. A red sofa sets<br>gives rise to heavy work pressure, troubles and obstacles. Most people<br>simply accept that life is like that without realising that THAT is<br>caused<br>by the bad fengshui of that red sofa ! Fengshui Solution ? Change the<br>colour<br>of your sofa.<br><br>15) Always open your bedroom windows at least once 20 minutes a day to<br>allow<br>fresh chi to come in - Why should we do it? We do this so that it<br>allows<br>fresh new chi from outside to come into your  bedroom, if not you will<br>be<br>sleeping with stale chi every night. And if that happens, then how can<br>you<br>expect your life to bring in more good fortune to come to you? So open<br>that<br>window and never mind if dusts comes in! The great good fortune that<br>you can<br>have will far exceeds the time you take to clean off the dust!<br></span></span></strong></div>
