            <div class='col-md body'>Am sure you read before, just read it again and ponder...<br><br><span style="color: blue;">&gt; HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;  Five lessons to make you think about the way we treat people.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;  1. First Important Lesson - Cleaning Lady.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;      During my second month of college, our professor gave us a pop<br>&gt; quiz.<br>I was a conscientious student and had breezed<br>&gt; through the questions, until I read the last one: "What is the first<br>&gt; name<br>of the woman who cleans the school?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;      Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman<br>several times. She was tall, dark-haired and in<br>&gt; her 50s, but how would I know her name? I handed in my paper, leaving<br>&gt; the<br>last question blank. Just before class ended,<br>&gt; one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz<br>&gt; grade.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;      "Absolutely," said the professor. "In your careers, you will meet<br>many people. All are significant. They deserve<br>&gt; your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say "hello".<br>&gt;<br>&gt;      I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was<br>Dorothy.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2. Second Important Lesson - Pick-up in the Rain<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     One night, at 11:30 p.m., an older African American woman was<br>&gt; standing<br>on the side of an Alabama highway trying to<br>&gt; endure a lashing rainstorm. Her car had broken down and she<br>&gt; desperately<br>needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag<br>&gt; down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her, generally<br>unheard of  in those conflict-filled 1960s. The man<br>&gt; took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a<br>&gt; taxicab.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down his address and<br>thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on<br>&gt; the man's door. To his surprise, a giant console colour TV was<br>&gt; delivered<br>to his home. A special note was attached. It<br>&gt; read: "Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other<br>&gt; night.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The rain drenched not only my clothes, but also my spirits. Then you<br>&gt; came<br>along. Because of you, I was able to make it<br>&gt; to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away. God bless<br>&gt; you<br>for helping me and unselfishly serving others,"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;      Sincerely, Mrs. Nat King Cole.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   3. Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;        In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10<br>&gt; year-old<br>boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a<br>&gt; table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him. "How much is<br>&gt; an<br>ice cream sundae?" he asked. "Fifty cents,"<br>&gt; replied the waitress. The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket<br>&gt; and<br>studied the coins in it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;       "Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?" he inquired. By<br>&gt; now<br>more people were waiting for a table and the<br>&gt; waitress was growing impatient.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;      "Thirty-five cents," she brusquely replied. The little boy again<br>counted his coins.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;      "I'll have the plain ice cream," he said. The waitress brought<br>&gt; the<br>ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked<br>&gt; away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When<br>&gt; the<br>waitress came back, she began to cry as she<br>&gt; wiped down the table.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;       There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and<br>five pennies. You see, he couldn't have the<br>&gt; sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 4. Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacles in Our Path.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;       In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then<br>&gt; he<br>hid himself and watched to see if anyone would<br>&gt; remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and<br>courtiers came by and simply walked around it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;       Many loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but<br>none did anything about getting the stone out of<br>&gt; the way.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;       Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon<br>approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his<br>&gt; burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much<br>pushing and straining, he finally succeeded.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;       After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed<br>&gt; purse<br>lying in the road where the boulder had been.<br>&gt; The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King<br>&gt; indicating<br>that the gold was for the person who removed the<br>&gt; boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never<br>understand!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;       Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;  5. Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;       Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I<br>&gt; got to<br>know a little girl named Liz who was<br>&gt; suffering from a rare &amp; serious disease. Her only chance of recovery<br>appeared to be a blood transfusion from her<br>&gt; 5-year-old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and<br>&gt; had<br>developed the antibodies needed to combat the<br>&gt; illness. The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and<br>asked the little boy if he would be willing to<br>&gt; give his blood to his sister.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;       I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath<br>&gt; and<br>saying, "Yes I'll do it if it will save her."<br>&gt; As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and<br>smiled, as we all did, seeing the colour returning<br>&gt; to her cheeks. Then his face grew pale and his smile faded.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;       He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice,<br>&gt; "Will I<br>start to die right away?".<br>&gt;<br>&gt;       Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he<br>&gt; thought<br>he was going to have to give his sister all<br>&gt; of his blood in order to save her.</span></div>
