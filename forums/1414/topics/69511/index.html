Sad isn't it?<br><br>And the sadder thing is that I feedback to them numerous times but people just don't change and don't bother to do anything abt it. In fact, the HDB update thing was still very manual... it's not an option avail online and they sent me the same form so many times I called up the dept head and gave him a piece of my mind.</div>
