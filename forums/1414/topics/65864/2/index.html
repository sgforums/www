However, I have to admit that it feels good to have someone you truly love.<br><br>Right now she's stuck in Melbourne while we're trying to find a way for her to join me here for the rest of the year.  In the meantime, I've got even more time to reflect on how I feel about her.<br><br>The lesson was rammed home to me this very night.  I went to a function that my friend invited me to, and when I got there, I ran into a girl who I had a huge crush on while I was in JC.  I was so busy thinking about my girlfriend that the only things I said to this girl were, "Hi, how are you?  Have you seen so-and-so (my friend)?  Ah, thanks" and, as I was leaving, "Hey, good to see you again - bye!".  I didn't even realise what had taken place until I was halfway home.<br><br>Upon reflection, it's a matter of course that this should have happened, but even while my girlfriend's not with me, it's wonderful to discover, on a daily basis and through the smallest of things, how much I love her.</div></blockquote>tat's really sweet.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
