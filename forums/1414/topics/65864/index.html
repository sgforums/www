            <div class='col-md body'>Love is like the answer to a riddle. Other answers may seem good or clever, but only this one answer is perfect.<br><br>Love is like the right job. The job inspires you and feels like play. You crave the work, you are passionate about it. It lifts you up and drives you to new levels.<br><br>Love is the color which connects with the deepest level of your being. It is the music which speaks to you.<br><br>When you love someone, you are totally yourself with them. Nothing can drive a wedge between you. Whatever life throws at you, you deal with together.<br><br>When you reach the boundary between like and love, you know you are entering another country. You are beyond newness and infatuation.

            <div class='col-md body'>1. She and I were chatting on MSN Messenger (while we were at work), as we had for months, and it occurred to me.<br><br>2. No signal, really - the thought occurred to me and it just made perfect sense.<br><br>3. Nothing in particular, but I do keep an eye out for anything that needs to be done.  For example, when she was sick for a week, I would get her to get some rest and wake her up once I had dinner ready.  I'm not a big believer in sweep-her-off-her-feet expressions of love, but I do make it a point to include my love for her in everything I do.<br><br>4. That's one that's really for her, rather than me, to answer.<br><br>5. No specific place - we tend to go out and explore new places.  However, we met at salsa classes, so a place that has salsa is always good.<br><br>6. Girlfriend.  I've never been one to beat about the bush and my relatives already know that I'm not accustomed to having my judgement questioned.<br><br>7. We started out as strictly friends and when she was talking about a past relationship, I realised that she the sort to give absolutely 100 percent.  By that time, I was tired of futzing around and, watching my parents' example, had already decided that being 100 percent was going to be the clincher.<br><br>8.<br>1) Her integrity<br>2) Her giving spirit<br>3) Her gentleness and willingness to give<br>4) Her intelligence, in particular her willingness to se things from different perspectives<br>5) Her sensibility<br>6) Her beauty, especially when she's asleep<br><br>9. When I'm good and ready.  Right now things are a bit topsy-turvy because I've decided to stay in Singapore to sort out some family matters.  After that I'll return to Australia and get properly set up.  In the meantime, there is no question that I will - like I said, I'm done futzing around.<br><br>10. Step back from her?  I never even considered considering that.<br><br>The difference between love and like?  Like is a lot more superficial, and as such you don't think as much of the deeper implications.  In my case, I've spent a lot of time going after the superficial crap - my last girlfriend was a model and a doctorate student, and she came from an influential family.  At the end of the day, none of it mattered because she could not give the 100 percent I required and I could not see her being a lifelong partner.  I walked away and I have never regretted it because I have moved on to better things, although we do remain good friends.<br><br>What is love, then?  It's hard to define, but the best I can do is allude to its corollaries.  This is the speech I delivered at my best friend's wedding two months ago, with names edited out:<br><br>"Please excuse this speech.  I wrote in on the plane on the way back from Singapore.<br><br>My first thought when G told me that would marry V was, "It's about time".  Yet I refrained from actually voicing this thought because it did not feel entirely correct.<br><br>A while ago I mentioned that I had just returned from Singapore.  Those here who know me know that the purpose of my trip was to attend my mother's funeral.  During this trip, I reflected that come December, my parents would have been married for 37 years.<br><br>Given that the longest commitment of my life, my university years, spanned barely a quarter of that period, the magnitude of my parents' commitment to each other was mind boggling.  What would make such an undertaking successsful through all of life's challenges, of which raising me was aruguably the most daunting?<br><br>It would be simple enough to say "Love, of course", but the cynic in me has always rebelled against such a vague answer. I attempted to define the qualities required for such a commitment, and here is are some of the key ingredients I think make up this vague concept of love.<br><br>First, it's about integrity, the tempering of ideals with reality to ensure that the core values of the marriage are not only maintained, but indeed nourished, through life's challenges.<br><br>It's about faith, the strength of belief that spouses have in each other, which forms the backbone of the marriage.<br><br>It's about insight, the ability to see well beyond the events that occur daily, and to perceive how these events form the quilt of experience which is marriage.<br><br>It's about courage, facing the vast expanse of the unknown future with conviction.<br><br>It's about respect, not only that of spouses for each other, but of the institution of marriage, of family and of God, by whose blessing this marriage has taken place.<br><br>It's about a sense of humour - if you can laugh, no challenge is insurmountable, and it makes the adventure a lot more fun.<br><br>I see these elements not only in the example of my own parents, but in other couples as well, in particular G's parents, Uncle R and Auntie T.  In both cases, these qualities have held them in good stead for well over thirty years.  At the same time, I see it in younger couples, such as my sister and brother-in-law, and these same qualities have already seen them through a multitude of events and challenges over nine years.<br><br>I stopped myself from saying "It's about time" to G because I felt that it was an inaccurate statement to make.  It's about integrity, faith, insight, courage, respect and a sense of humour.  These have seen married couples through decades, and these are qualities that will see G and V, the latest addition to that list, through the coming decades.<br><br>It's not about time at all - it is timeless."<br><br>Hopefully that answers your question.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks, Maya - not bad for 20 minutes' work in an airplane's economy seat, huh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Seriously, I'm not a particularly emotional sort of person - hell, I didn't even cry at my mother's funeral, but my parting words as they covered up the coffin were "Bye Mom, it's been grand".  However, I have to admit that it feels good to have someone you truly love.<br><br>Right now she's stuck in Melbourne while we're trying to find a way for her to join me here for the rest of the year.  In the meantime, I've got even more time to reflect on how I feel about her.<br><br>The lesson was rammed home to me this very night.  I went to a function that my friend invited me to, and when I got there, I ran into a girl who I had a huge crush on while I was in JC.  I was so busy thinking about my girlfriend that the only things I said to this girl were, "Hi, how are you?  Have you seen so-and-so (my friend)?  Ah, thanks" and, as I was leaving, "Hey, good to see you again - bye!".  I didn't even realise what had taken place until I was halfway home.<br><br>Upon reflection, it's a matter of course that this should have happened, but even while my girlfriend's not with me, it's wonderful to discover, on a daily basis and through the smallest of things, how much I love her.</div>
