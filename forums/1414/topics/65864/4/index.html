I know people say passion drives one to commitment, when you really love a person, at the least you would woo (or the passion to woo) and then establish and tries to maintain harmonious relationship.<br><br>I am pretty lazy. When both parties engage in a relationship, there must be al least some form of show of love and commitment, whether its everynight SMS for some people here, or smiles at each other everyday, or even going down to Jalan Kayu have supper , then go home, and hardly speak a word during the meal. I may like or love a girl, but what drives me back is because I am lazy to keep a commitment.<br><br>Unlike friends and families, I find BGRs rather foggy. I am the type of person who is like Yes/No, 1 to 10, A to Z type of person. Nothing foggy, murky or shady. I am not good in stuff relating to emotions, except my own. Engaging in a relationship is also like playing around with sensitivity, emotions and feelings. For me, I would say Bah! and plunged into my books. I find books on politics, business, military stuff more appealing than relationships, psychology, emotions..doesnt mean I am not emotional or not sensitive to others. Just find that I am scared of relationships. Reading the Bear's posts and countless thread in Aunt Agony actually put me more and more off from BGRs. Unlike what I dwelved in, like those MLM issues in Kopitiam, feelings of the heart was never for people like me.<br><br>Even dealing with people in sgforums a chore. We find people flaming, disgusting nitwits, misunderstanding (well, internet interaction is quite limited) , even supporting and maintaining harmonious relationships with others is a bit of a chore too. Yikes, hope Neontetra is not reading this.<br><br>To end it off, I cannot blame the Bear for maybe what appears to be a contadictory personality, or this 'appear to be noble, and playing victim' gooble gook. This is posting over internet, we donch know how he feel or thinks really, by not interacting with him personally. Another point, dont base someone personality over what he post.<br><br>Ending off<br><br>PS: You guys can put it down on your diary, after three months since joining sgforums, laurence82 actually start to post on this type of topic. And a long post too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
