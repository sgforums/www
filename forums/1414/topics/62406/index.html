Well, can you see if it is?"<br>"No."<br>"Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?"<br>"Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle - it's because it's dark."<br>"Dark?"<br>"Yes - the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window."<br>"Well, turn on the office light then."<br>"I can't."<br>"No? Why not?"<br>"Because there's a power failure."<br>"A power.......a power failure?! ....

Now here are the<br>&gt;rules from the male side. These are our rules! Please note... they<br>&gt;are all numbered "1" ON PURPOSE!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up,<br>&gt;put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us<br>&gt;complaining about you leaving it down.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if<br>&gt;we can find the perfect present yet again!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Sometimes we are not thinking about you. Live with it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the<br>&gt;tides. Let it be.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive<br>&gt;than short hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married<br>&gt;is that married women always cut their hair, and by then you're<br>&gt;stuck with her.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of<br>&gt;it that way.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Crying is blackmail.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints<br>&gt;do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work!<br>&gt;Just say it!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. We don't remember dates. Mark birthdays and anniversaries on<br>&gt;the calendar. Remind us frequently beforehand.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Most guys own three pairs of shoes - tops. What makes you think<br>&gt;we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look<br>&gt;good with your dress?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every<br>&gt;question.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it.<br>&gt;That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. A headache that last for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Check your oil! Please.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument.<br>&gt; &gt;In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't<br>&gt;expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We<br>&gt;refuse to answer.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of<br>&gt;the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want<br>&gt;it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do<br>&gt;it yourself.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say<br>&gt;during commercials.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two<br>&gt;months we were going out. Get over it. And quit whining to your<br>&gt;girlfriends.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings.<br>&gt;Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a<br>&gt;fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. We are not mind readers and we never will be. Our lack of<br>&gt;mind-reading ability is not proof of how little we care about you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will<br>&gt;act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is<br>&gt;just not worth the hassle.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an<br>&gt;answer you don't want to hear.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear<br>&gt;is fine. Really.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are<br>&gt;prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, the shotgun<br>&gt;formation, or monster trucks.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. You have enough clothes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. You have too many shoes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. It is neither in your best interest or ours to take the quiz<br>&gt;together. No, it doesn't matter which quiz.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. BEER is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Thank you for reading this; yes, I know, I have to sleep othe<br>&gt;couch tonight, but did you know we really don't mind that -- it's<br>&gt;like camping.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. I am in shape. ROUND is a shape. </span></span></div>

Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument.<br>&gt; &gt;In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't<br>&gt;expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We<br>&gt;refuse to answer.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of<br>&gt;the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want<br>&gt;it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do<br>&gt;it yourself.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say<br>&gt;during commercials.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two<br>&gt;months we were going out. Get over it. And quit whining to your<br>&gt;girlfriends.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings.<br>&gt;Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a<br>&gt;fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. We are not mind readers and we never will be. Our lack of<br>&gt;mind-reading ability is not proof of how little we care about you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will<br>&gt;act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is<br>&gt;just not worth the hassle.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an<br>&gt;answer you don't want to hear.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear<br>&gt;is fine. Really.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are<br>&gt;prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, the shotgun<br>&gt;formation, or monster trucks.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. You have enough clothes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. You have too many shoes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. It is neither in your best interest or ours to take the quiz<br>&gt;together. No, it doesn't matter which quiz.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. BEER is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Thank you for reading this; yes, I know, I have to sleep othe<br>&gt;couch tonight, but did you know we really don't mind that -- it's<br>&gt;like camping.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. I am in shape. ROUND is a shape. </span></span></div></blockquote></div>
