Both myself and my partner are financially stable. No mortgage, no nice cars to pay off. Not even HECS debt.<br><br>I feel that we are able to do it. He's sick of his job, i'm not even here for about 9mths and i've been sidelined to a shitkicker. Urgh... i keep telling myself to be a teamplayer at the same time I didn't go to Uni to be a receptionist.<br>I admit i don't have much to do in my normal job. It's just that the owner of this joint was overseas and was not around to handball some crackpot ideas for me to pursue.</div>

Oh i did Nikki's website under the name of Vers. So that when the despotic owner's pawn (ie.. crappy sales managers) pounced on her. She said it was my partner's father who did it. To avoid me getting the cane as well... ya know she is so innovative but he was threatened by her. He told me not to talk to her as much, that everything we do is confidential (what did i do? Gave her all the reports i did. haha). And that it might hamper my career advances (as if there were any in the first place!) if i'm hanging around NIkki too much!<br><br>Anyway.. vers is like top secret.. I think as the software that John developed has not really gone anyway due to the standards have not been implemented yet.<br>Well.. i'll pm you our website address.</div>
