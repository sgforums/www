For weeks in advance, he coached his patients to respond to his commands. When the day of the game arrived, everything seemed to be going well.

            <div class='col-md body'>Once upon a time there was a non-conforming sparrow who decided not to fly south for the winter. However, soon the weather turned so cold that he reluctantly decided to fly south. In a short time ice began to form on his wings and he fell to Earth in a barnyard, nearly frozen solid. A cow passed by where he had fallen, and crapped on the little sparrow.The sparrow thought it was the end, but the manure warmed him and defrosted his wings!<br><br>Warm and happy, able to breath, he started to sing.<br><br>Just then a large cat came by, and hearing the chirping he investigated the sounds. The cat cleared away the manure, found the chirping bird, and promptly ate him.<br><br>The Moral of the Story:<br><br>Everyone who craps on you is not necessarily your enemy<br><br>Everyone who gets you out of crap is not necessarily your friend.<br><br>And if you're warm and happy in a pile of crap, you might just want to keep your mouth shut.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This man got his prescription for Viagra, and goes home to get ready for when his wife gets home.

He takes the Viagra and waits.<br><br>An hour goes by, the man is ready to go, but no wife!<br><br>She calls him on the phone and she says, "Traffic is terrible.
