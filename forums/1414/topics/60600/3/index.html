            <div class='col-md body'>Once upon a time, while I was s h i t t i n g happily on my favourite tam pui, suddenly the tam pui peng sung, i shouted "oh S H I T !!!", and decide to call jOhO for help. jOhO arrived and saw qq covered in sh1t, n was so disgusted, so he decided to go look for kitten instead and kitten gave jOhO a good time. However, jOhO showed no interested at all in toking about qq when i asked him about it. Then abterror walk<strong>ed</strong> pass and <strong>wanted to</strong> join in the fun. joho chased him away. den joho <strong>looked</strong> into keisha's <strong>eyes</strong>.....shining brightly. suspecting something special. keisha shyly put her head down...joho <strong>reached</strong> for his right pocket...<br><br>abterror <strong>walked</strong> away sadly and saw poor seacucumber standing under the tree with teary eyes <strong>and</strong> with a piece of %@*$ on her head. QQ sulked quietly <strong>in</strong> one corner. joho <strong>did not care</strong> what <strong>was</strong> ard him..<strong>he only had eyes for keisha</strong>...<strong> he took out from his pocket</strong> QQ's photo. only then <strong>did</strong> he realise he <strong>found</strong> it er xin, n promptly threw it away. he said tat pic was supposed to pi xie..<br><br>Joho <strong>proceeded</strong> towards Keisha. Inch by inch joho <strong>closed </strong>in on keisha. Keisha <strong>looked down </strong>at the ground, shyly avoiding eye contact. Joho <strong>nudged</strong> keisha's face upwards and <strong>stared</strong> deeply into her brown eyes. Keisha's breathing <strong>started to get</strong> heavier and heavier. At this moment......keisha let out a fart<br><br>Joho's face turned red and started to back off, looking all pissed by such a major turn off. Meanwhile, abterror helped seacucumber <strong>clean</strong> up. All of a sudden, seacucumber laid abterror on the ground. Abterror looked on nervously and <strong>his</strong> breathing got heavier. Bit by bit, seacucumber unbuttoned Abterror's shirt. Seacucumber then placed her hand into abterror's pants. He moaned in satisfaction. Her hand felt warm and gentle. Seacucumber then proceeded to <span style="color: blue;"> squeeze his balls.... HARD. Abterror yelled out in terror(pun intended), as he spied in the corner of his eye.... GASP! XLN!!! with a carving knife in her hands!!!</span></div>
