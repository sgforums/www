            <div class='col-md body'>Once upon a time, while I was s h i t t i n g happily on my favourite tam pui, suddenly the tam pui peng sung, i shouted "oh S H I T !!!", and decide to call jOhO for help. jOhO arrived and saw qq covered in sh1t, n was so disgusted, so he decided to go look for kitten instead and kitten gave jOhO a good time. However, jOhO showed no interested at all in toking about qq when i asked him about it. Then abterror walked pass and wanted to join in the fun. joho chased him away. den joho looked into keisha's eyes.....shining brightly. suspecting something special. keisha shyly put her head down...joho reached for his right pocket...<br><br>abterror walked away sadly and saw poor seacucumber standing under the tree with teary eyes and with a piece of %@*$ on her head. QQ sulked quietly in one corner. joho did not care what was ard him..he only had eyes for keisha... he took out from his pocket QQ's photo. only then did he realise he found it er xin, n promptly threw it away. he said tat pic was supposed to pi xie..<br><br>Joho proceeded towards Keisha. Inch by inch joho closed in on keisha. Keisha looked down at the ground, shyly avoiding eye contact. Joho nudged keisha's face upwards and stared deeply into her brown eyes. Keisha's breathing started to get heavier and heavier. At this moment......keisha let out a fart<br><br>Joho's face turned red and started to back off, looking all pissed by such a major turn off. Meanwhile, abterror helped seacucumber clean up. All of a sudden, seacucumber laid abterror on the ground. Abterror looked on nervously and his breathing got heavier. Bit by bit, seacucumber unbuttoned Abterror's shirt. Seacucumber then placed her hand into abterror's pants. He moaned in satisfaction. Her hand felt warm and gentle. Seacucumber then proceeded to squeeze his balls.... HARD. Abterror yelled out in terror(pun intended), as he spied in the corner of his eye.... GASP! XLN!!! with a carving knife in her hands!!! suddenly XLN stooped down and picked up something BIG and ORANGE with her hands.. and she started to carve a jack-o-lantern. As XLN finished carving the jack-o-lantern, she flung it towards Seacucumber *sparks sparks sparks!* gasp! Magic Jack-o-Lantern! Seacucumber started to change color.. *poof!* it's not Seacucumber! it's Insightist impersonating her! keisha walk over with a bottle and the real seacucumber is inside it. it seems like kaisha have bewitched joho as she pull him in front of him with a dog collar.<br><br>Sea Urchin suddenly appears and projects one of his spikes to slightly prick keisha's hand so she would let go of his beloved sea cucumber. He felt so relieved that she was finally safe in his many many many arms. By then as sea urchin look inside the bottle, and find out tat kaisha has forgot to put in sea water in the bottle which resulted in a dry seacucumber.... SeaUrchin started to drool, and lubricated her thoroughly,and then she came back to life, jumped out, and grabbed SeaUrchin's dick with one hand, holds up a giant carving knife with the other, and............... cut it and throw the dick into abterror's pot of boiling soup!<br><br>Seacucumber turned and look at abterror with an evil look, grab bear's balisong and chop chop chop off abterror's dick as well.....But abterror's was too hard and cannot be chop off. which broke the knife into pieces....Seacucumber wonders why is the dick so hard, she decide to burn it first, before she borrow another knife from bear......... but then, on second thoughts, Seacucumber decided she had no choice but to start up her chainsaw, and brutually butchered off Abterror's dick, leaving him screaming in terror(pun intended AGAIN!) she then tossed the mutilated, severed member into a meat processor and turned it into minced meat which she then fed to Abterror ..seeing him eating with delight, seacucumber decided to eat some as well..<br><br>While eating happily, keisha looked at seacucumber with hunger......<br><br>keisha decided to kill seacucumber for food....tat's the end of seacucumber's participation...[after that, she looks over to Inzaghi, n proceeds to chop his dick off for food as well.joho ran hungrily and chew inzaghi's dick into pieces. Keisha was very angry on seeing this because she was hungry and wanted the dick for herself, so she chopped off jOhO's dick and chewed on it, then *glup* swallowed it.Then along came xiaowei with a glass of coke in her hand standing at the doorway looking at what all the scene is all abt. Suddenly someone shouted "mata"!!! coming so everybody panic especially all those dick eater. Keisha, seacucumber , inzaghi their face turn white when they heard the police are coming. All with their dick being chopped off took out a facet each to cover their lower part and start running. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
