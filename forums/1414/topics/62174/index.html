            <div class='col-md body'>Words By Cheri Rodriguez<br>Take a graduate level college course and you may end up doing your homework with Asian porn star Annabel Chong. As philosophical as she is photogenic, Annabel dispenses a double dose of erotic knowledge for the mind and body.<br>X-I understand you were born in Singapore. How long did you live there?<br>A-Until I was about 18.<br><br>X-What were you like in high school?<br>A-I was a nerd.<br><br>X-When did you lose your virginity?<br>A-It was in primary school to a bunch of girls. Like 11 or 12.<br><br>X-How about the first time you had sex with a guy?<br>A-15... 16 maybe. I was really into girls for a while.<br><br>X-What year did you do your first porn film?<br>A-1994.<br><br>X-Do you remember the name and your co-stars?<br>A-Dirty Debutantes with Ed Powers.<br><br>X-How much were you paid?<br>A-$1,000.<br><br>X-I assume you're making more than that now.<br>A-Definitely more. My rates start at $1,000 for a girl-girl scene.<br><br>X-Do you think being Asian has been an asset?<br>A-Oh, definitely, because there's always a shortage of Asian girls.<br><br>X-How many videos have you done?<br>A-About 30.<br><br>X-Which one's your favorite?<br>A-I Can't Believe I did the Whole Team. It's got a football theme, and I was in college at the time, so it's completely up my alley of fantasies.<br><br>X-You once held the gang-bang world record at 251. How did you feel when you heard you'd been dethroned?<br>A-Well, you know when you set a record someone's going to break it. Everybody's doing the whole gang-bang thing, like now it's the reverse gang-bang. I can't remember the guy, but he did 75 girls.<br>X-Any chance you'll go for the record again?<br>A-Probably not. It's so played out. Right now I'm scouting for people to be in an all Asian video. We're gonna shoot one for cable entirely in Chinese.<br><br>X-Have you done any mainstream TV or movie appearances?<br>A-I've got a documentary out on my life called Sex: The Annabel Chong Story. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and is going to be in the theaters in October.<br><br>X-If you could do a sex scene with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?<br>A-Messalina, the original gang-bang queen.<br>X-Say you're a White House intern in the mid-1990s. How would you play your cards with the president?<br>A-I wouldn't. I'd play it with his wife. Because as we know, she holds the power.<br>X-How about the First Daughter?<br>A-No, I don't like her teeth.<br><br>X-Are you very political?<br>A-I try to take an interest in American politics. But unfortunately, CNN is like the worst news channel in the world. It's like trash news. So I try to catch PBS.<br><br>X-Would you rather attend a Washington sex orgy with Republicans, Democrats or a third party?<br>A-(Pause and laughter.) Well, cocks are cocks. But basically I tend to lean toward Libertarians.<br>X-What makes for a better orgy-more men, more women, or an equal number of cocks and pussys?<br>A-Equal number.<br><br>X-In Italy a few years back, a porn star was elected to parliament. Any chance you'd ever run for office?<br>A-Maybe. If there was an issue out there I really cared about.<br><br>X-What's one law you'd like to see made or abolished?<br>A-I think the zoning laws for strip clubs are absolutely ridiculous. By zoning it in really bad areas, not only are they keeping it sleazy, it's also endangering the clients and the girls. I mean the girls and the clubs are paying taxes just like everyone else.<br>X-So your career ambitions outside the sex industry are what?<br><br>A-Currently I'm working on a documentary and I'm also working on a book. I've got a publisher in London who's interested in my writings.<br>X-I read some where that you're working on a graduate degree. True?<br>A-Right now I'm raising money to go to graduate school.<br><br>X-Do you think men are more intimidated by smart women or beautiful women?<br>A-I want to believe that men are men and they're not easily intimidated by women. A lot of them are. But really, we don't bite.<br><br>X-Have you ever slept with a professor for an A?<br>A-No.<br><br>X-If you were failing a course, would you?<br>A-I would never fail a course. If I come home with a B+, I end up crying for an hour. One time I worked really hard for this course and got an A- and I spent like two hours screeching around my apartment and throwing stuff saying "How dare he give me an A-."<br><br>X-In public, do people recognize you?<br>A-They're recognizing me more and more. But I do wear my glasses so it makes it harder.<br><br>X-You live in L.A. now, right?<br>A-Yes.<br><br>X-Do you hang with the Hollywood jet set?<br>A-I'm not really big on the Hollywood scene. I find it very plastic.<br><br>X-How's your social life?<br>A-I don't have a social life. It's kind of all work and no play. There's not even enough time to go clubbing.<br><br>X-Say you are out clubbing. Do you make the first move or let guys approach you?<br>A-I usually go to gay clubs and dance. They've got better music.<br><br>X-What's your best pick-up line?<br>A-Do you want to go back to your place or would you rather fuck in the toilet?<br><br>X-Let's say we're married and I encourage you to fuck other men. Are you okay with that?<br>A-I wouldn't marry anyone unless they were a swinger. So I would think that's very very cool.<br><br>X-Do you have any particular music you like fucking to?<br>A-If the sex is good, the music will sound good.<br><br>X-Even James Taylor?<br>A-Well, it could be worse. It could be Polka music.<br><br>X-Where's the weirdest place you've done it?<br>A-In a military compound in Singapore.<br><br>X-What do you like best in your pussy-cocks, tongues or fingers?<br>A-Cocks. I don't like fingers, period. A lot of people don't know how to use them, including girls.<br><br>X-Okay, let's say the nuclear missiles are coming. Would you rather be sucking dick or having your pussy eaten as the world explodes?<br>A-I'd chose 69.<br><br>X-What trait in a guy turns you on?<br>A-Self-confidence. That's so hard to find these days.<br><br>X-Any major turn offs?<br>A-I get turned off by neurotic guys. I need a guy who has a certain degree of calmness.<br><br>X-Do you like your men hairy or smooth?<br>A-I like smooth everything. I've given a lot of guys pubic trims in my lifetime.<br><br>X-Do you have any advice for men on hooking up with women?<br>A-Men should play harder to get. Give a girl the thrill of the chase by holding off. Play the maybe game. Maybe he's interested; maybe he's not. That gets a girl going.<br><br>X-Any advice for those aspiring porn stars?<br>A-You have to really like sex. Secondly, you have to have your shit together. You shouldn't be an alcoholic or on drugs or be flaky. You have to be savy and have your head together because this really is a business.<br>X-Do you have a website?<br>A-Yeah, it should be up pretty soon. The address is Anabel-Chong.com.<br>X-When you die, how's the epigraph on your tombstone going to read?<br>A-Bear in I'm not just involved in the porn industry. I'm also involved in other things-directing, writing, the art scene. So I want my tombstone to read-She was a jack of all trades who started off in the jack-off trade.<br><br>X-Anything you'd like to say in closing to the readers of Xtreme?<br>A-Continue to support your strip clubs. If the government tries to shut down a strip club, I would love to see the customers support the club by going out there to protest. If you really like an establishment and you like the girls, come out of the woodwork to support the club.<br></div>
