Once they are independent, the guy will watch his step with the woman rather than take them for granted!<br><br>And you know what?? Why women are concentrating so much on career and other things these days?? The society's expectations of women have changed. Women are now expected to be able to multi-task... have a career, help out in supporting the family AND take care of the children and family. Whereas Men are still stuck in the age old and outdated thinking that so long as they supply the dough, that's enough. When women prove that they can do it better than the guys, the guys end up looking for women who are more dependent and helpless so they can bully them and walk all over them like classic MCPs do. And at the end of the day men are the ones who say women are getting too tough for them to handle, concentrate too much on career, have no time for men etc. IT'S A LOAD OF BS!!!<br><br>ok... obviously not in a very good mood today... but let me see one more of those stoopid sexist remarks and all flames will break loose....</div>
