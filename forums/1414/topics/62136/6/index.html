            <div class='col-md body'>seeing jOhO's posts, i'm reminded of what i've read somewhere in a book, a sociology book on mate selection. it is theorized that people do not actually choose their partner but rather settle for one.<br><br>difference is people who actually choose their partner have certain prerequisites for mate selection like wealth, looks, social class, ethnicity etc. they pay little attention to those who are not within the criteria, and bias towards those who do. people who settle for partners refers to people who have no such criteria for mate selection but rather on elements/factors like chemistry, emotions, sexual instincts, etc.<br><br>not that this post is worth much relevance to this thread, but simply sharing this rather interesting read. actually there's much more but i'll stop here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Head, or heart, there isn't an answer actually. just like when i posted on the read on mate selection from a sociology text, either methods do not outdo each other in mate selection.<br><br>Those who actually have criteria for mate selection are obviously limiting their own selection. They usually look for person to person, always finding their partner-to-be falling short of their expectations, so they continue "hopping" around. Some people in end might just give up and enter the latter category, and rates people based on chemistry and instincts.<br><br>People who rely on chemistry/instincts fares no better. Such people may date people one after another goes in and out of relationship but are not quite able to secure that kind of desired feelings they are looking for, then dropout of the relationship. What that can be most bugging to this, that these people may even be subconsciously not wanting to settle down! So this means that they actually don't want to be in a relationship but may be upset and confused by their desire to be attached. This is getting more common in modern societies.<br><br>These are actually 2 major generalizations of mate selection and people oftentimes do not just fall into one category, but somewhere in the middle. That is people are usually either more criteria-based, or instinct-based.<br><br>Speaking of the search of a needle in haystack...my question is...at the end of the day, is it really worth it? I don't have the answer, and i know i'm not searching.</div>
