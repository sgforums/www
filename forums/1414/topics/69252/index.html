            <div class='col-md body'>to stay faithful in a relationship? Most people say that guys always stray away in a relationship but then i think it applies to both genders. Its always the same... when they meet someone good... they don't cherish but once its gone then they try to do all the things to patch, pamper etc to get the person back. What do you all think?<br><br>P.S: Keisha, i hope you don't mind i put this thread on your forum... besides the topics in your channel are nice to read.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I was just asking this question because i wanted to see how many people can be faithful in a relationship but then as you said humans are cheap. What to do... this is life!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
