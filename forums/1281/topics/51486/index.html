            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>A youth in my church once asked me "I used to be so faithful to God in the past. But recently, I am not as faithful...how?"<br><br>I guess many people had this question on their minds at some time or another.  I had many youths asking me that many times.  But my question to them is <span style="color: red;">"How do you define faithful?", "How do you quantify faithfulness? Does it have a meter or ranking?"</span><br><br>My answers to the last 2 questions are <span style="color: red;">"NO"</span>.  FAITHFULNESS is something not physical.  You should never think of someone as faithful just because he/she is doing many things for God.  We should never translate what a person says, does and appears to be into FAITHFULNESS.<br><br>So what then is FAITHFULNESS? Remember DAVID? In the bible, he was described as a <span style="color: red;">"MAN AFTER GOD's HEART"</span>. That despite him committing ADULTERY.  You see, a person who had sin or sins against God is NORMAL, like DAVID.  What is important is that after sinning, DAVID felt remorse, he wanted to repent. But instead of trying to do things like reading the srciptures more to show he has repented, he instead turned to God and cried and prayed (see some of the PSALMS David wrote, they are full of repentance.).<br><br>David was a man after God's heart because he seek after God. He did not focus on what he had done in the past for God, but his focus is on GOD!<br><br>So my sister and all who are discouraged because you think you are not as faithful as in the past, DO NOT keep thinking thoughts like <span style="color: red;">"I used to do 1 hour quiet time, now only 30 minutes...i must strive to do 1 hour again." or "I use to be so active in the youth service...now i never go...i must go back and serve again."</span>.  Nothing wrong with these statements except if you put your focus on these "OBJECTIVES", you will never be like DAVID, a person after God's heart.<br><br>Focus on God. I do not know whether you understand my words, i do not write as well as i talk but I hope it encourages some of you all. I shall summarize my points.<br><br>1.  Focus on God.<br><br>2.  Aim to know God.<br><br>3.  Read your bible not to gauge you are faithful but to know God's heart.<br><br>4. Pray that God will help you to seek Him first.<br><br>5. Dun be discouraged if your quiet time or service or passion seems to be dying out. Be like David, even in sin, he looks to God and see what God has done to him. God restored him.<br><br>6. It takes time. God is always there. He never moved. Its you who moved so, take your time, inch back to Him, you will find Him.<br><br>7. Remember, God loves the server more than the service. Dun worry about not reading the bible as long as last time. Dun worry about not serving in church. Dun worry about not having the passion for the church. Just CONCENTRATE on knowing GOD. How do we KNOW GOD? Read the bible (not quantity but quality), Look at the NATURE! Pray, GOD SPEAKS! Interact with US!!!! The issue is in quality not quantity. When you pray, just tell God your raw feelings. Sometimes when I pray and I am angry with God, I TELL HIM so and God came and healed me....He just wants you to talk heart to heart to Him.<br><br>Alright....I guess i talked alot, I really hope God can bring those who are down to Him again.  Draw near to Him and He will draw near to you. Forget all about the DOING DOING DOING. Its all about LOVING AND KNOWING. When you truly know and love God, the doing will come naturally.<br><br>God bless.</div>

If she is, maybe you can try telling her that it hurts you or irritates u everytime u does that and u dun feel good. If she is not a christian, I think you also need to let her know....maybe it is just her normal reaction to you, no hidden meanings. However, if after toking to her, she insists that she is right or she did it on purpose, then just steer clear or such people, continue to be nice to her but then we got to be wise like a serpent sometimes.</div>
