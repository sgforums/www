My friend encouraged me to read Proverbs one chapter a day. I was like skipping my quiet time for almost half a year. And meanwhile i am playing and leading as a worshipper on stage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ... that's really bad.<br><br>But the thing is i managed to pick up and read the bible. THings are improving, slowly..<br><br>There's alot of reason why pple don't want to read it. Because they either dun believe that what is written inside is true or they don't even want to give God a chance to speak to them because they feel that God might have disappointed them in some way or another, which is of course not true. I hope you can start reading bit by bit too. I'm sure with prayers covering you and all, God will  speak to you and you will find God more real in your life once again.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[found the whole story]<br><br>[bold]Butterfly[/bold]<br><br>Once upon a time in a land far far away, there was a wonderful old man who loved everything, animals, spiders, insects...<br><br>One day while walking through the woods the nice old man found a cocoon. Feeling lonely, he decided to take the cocoon home to watch its beautiful transformation from a funny little cocoon to a beautiful butterfly. He gently placed the cocoon on this kitchen table and watched over it for days.<br><br>Suddenly on the seventh day, the cocoon started to move. It moved frantically! The old man felt sorry for the little butterfly inside the cocoon. He watched it struggle and struggle and struggle.<br><br>Finally the old man feeling so sorry for the cocooned butterfly rushed to its aide with a surgical scalpel and gently slit the cocoon so the butterfly could emerge. Just once slice was all it took and the butterfly broke free from it's cocoon only to wilt over in a completely motionless state. The old man did not know what to think. Had he accidentally killed the little butterfly? No, it's still moving a little bit. May it's sick?<br><br>He was dumbfounded and quite perplexed. 'What should I do', he said. Well he felt so sorry for the little creature that he decided the best thing he could do for the butterfly was to place it gently back into its cocoon. He did so, and placed a drop of honey on it to seal the cocoon, leaving the butterfly to nestle in its natural state.<br><br>Well the next day, he noticed that the cocoon was moving again. 'Wow', he said. It moved and moved and struggled and struggled. Finally the butterfly broke free from its cocoon and stretched its wings out far and wide. It's beautiful wings were filled with such wonderful colours! It looked around and took off. It was flying. It was so beautiful. The old man was jumping with joy.<br><br>And the wonderful butterfly flew and flew until it was almost out of the old man's sight. But then he started to think. What did he do wrong by trying to help that beautiful little butterfly out at first?<br><br>The old man went into town. Found the library and read every book he could on butterflies and cocoons. Finally the answer appeared. The butterfly has to struggle and struggle while inside the cocoon. That's how it gets its strength. That's just how they were designed to overcome in order to be strong and beautiful.<br><br>Now he knows the reason why they do what they do. It was only his perception that made it appear that the butterfly was having a hard time. Well from then on, the old man knew that loving something sometimes means to pray for it and cheer it on!<br><br>He realise that God is wonderful and that sometimes appearances aren't what they seem to be. That we are all beautiful butterflies, even though we have our apparent struggles in life...<br><br>8 "My thoughts are not your thoughts, and my ways are not your ways," declares the Lord." 9 "Just as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than your ways, and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts."<br><br>Isa 55:8-9<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
