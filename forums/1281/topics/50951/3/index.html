Hope Saintboy you are much better now.<br><br>Just thought of sharing a personal testimony with you guys:<br><br>I first got to know this guy A when i was serving in the ministry. He was new to us and looked troubled. So on our way back after cell, asked him to call to chat. And we did. From that night we called perhaps once a week and talked for hours. Then it intensified in a week when we talked every night till 2am or 3am n the morning. when it got to that point, i realised that i had falled for this person. I asked myself why and I knew he was someone i could talk to. He cared much for his family and i know he will care for his own. He's also very understanding, told him some 'dirty linen' about my family but he did not judge me. so one faithful night when we were talking, i decided to ask him how he felt (want to know if this is going anywhere). He asked where i think this is going and i expressed that i had some positive feelings about him. He said that it was just as friends that we've been talking. I was devastated!!<br><br>Even after that night, i could not get over it. Days, weeks and months, i'll lament to my friends how i feel for him and how he did not reciprocrate. Actually, he did not clearly say that he did not like me, more like it's not working that way. So i cling on (heart dun die la).<br><br>But through the months, God was speaking to me about letting go. He used the story of Abraham and Isaac. How the former was going to sacrifice his only son because of his love for God. Thankfully our God is not a tyrant, it was merely a test for Abraham, if he could trust God wholeheartedly and he did! I tried to let go but a few days later, i took it back again.<br><br>God continued to speak to me until one fine day, during worship, i saw a picture of myself hanging on to a twig at the side of a steep cliff. I knew what it was about. I have the impression that God was telling me to let go, of this whole feelings and relationship and submit to Him. But i argued that if i did, what would i be left with? He said to me, just let go and you'll see. Look at what you are holding on to, it's a twig. It will break in time (how can it hold me up). So i did let go and fell into the palm of God's hands.<br><br>(part 1)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by saintboy:</div><div class="quote_body">Your part 1 only? Got part 2? </div></blockquote>Have... waiting for you to ask only...<br><br>[part 2]<br><br>as i was saying, God told me to let go of the r/s. It was a really difficult decision to make. Cos feel he's someone i can spend the rest of my life with, of course if he wants to also. I bargained with God for some more days. God was also speaking to me about r/s in general, if i could accept other people, who may not be physically attractive, shorter than me etc. I walked through that and realise that i could.<br><br>So finally, i made the decision after one last group outing, a chalet. he was there too. On sat night, i cried my heart out to God for i knew that was it. It was really no use holding on to it. My girlfriends were with me saw me cry my heart out. I knew when i went to church the next day i'll leave it at the altar and not turn back.<br><br>I left for church on Sun morning. He drove us there. when the pastor came to the pulpit, he said that God's love is so strong there. God wants us to know that He loves us. I cried. Felt that's what i needed to know. I held back tears throughout service. When it was over, i walked up to my mentor and told her to pray for me. I said it's about A. I did not say much. She prayed and amongst other things, said that 'A and you will always remain as special friends.'<br><br>Having surrendered, I didn't want to think more about it. I told a close mutual friend that i'll be honest with him that day and close the chap of my life. I told myself even if i did not get married in future, it'll be all right. God's love was so strong in my life.<br><br>without my knowledge, one of my girlfriends checked out the chalet with him. She spent the whole afternoon talking to him. She asked him point blank what she thought of me and to just let me know if he does not have feelings. so after the service, she msg me and said that she's so happy that she wanted to cry. I read it that she was so happy to know the truth, that he does not have feelings for me and hence wanted to cry.<br><br>I met up with in the evening of the same day. We took a long walk and we talked for hours. Finally (plucking up all the courage i had that day), i asked him how his last year was. He said ok. I told him mine was terrible. Since i had this feelings for him and after the declaration, couldn't just be friends. so everytime we are in a group, it got really awkward. I said to his face that i still had feelings for him after the faithful night we talked. but now i'm going to let them go. he surprised me by saying that he was actually quite confused. But he decided to give it a go, give us a go. Actually my friend who boo-booed with the message met up with me before i saw him and told me the truth. But since i left the r/s (or any possibility of it at the altar), i did not want to tell him i knew. I was just going to close the chapter and move on with my life.<br><br>Hope you are not confused by now. let me sum up what i'm trying to say:<br>1) when i had feelings for him, he was my world.<br>2) God told me to let Him be my world and trust Him<br>3) i realised how much God loves me and really knows what's best for me<br>4) God will never take away something from me, just to see me cringe<br>5) i amen to jer 29:11, that he knows his plans for my life, plans to prosper me and not to harm me, plans to give me hope and a future.<br><br>Do you know the ending? i'm now married to A!! it's something i never thought could happen but did. I'm not implying that the same will happen to you. But i'm saying that when God is put in proper perspective in your life, that is first, all things will fall into place. God loves you too much to withhold any good thing from you. Remember that!!<br><br>That's why i can sing 'Jesus loves me, this i know' and really understand how much Jesus loves me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
