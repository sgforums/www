            <div class='col-md body'>I like that song... but sometimes feel that i sing it too much, i forget what it actually means. He did pay a high price for my life, even when i wasn't lovable and didn't know Him.<br><br>He cares so much about me and cares about what i care about... I'm saying that when i talk to Him and tell Him what I'm going through and my struggles, He touches my heart by bringing an encouragement through someone (who may not know what I'm going through), in that way, I know He is real and that He loves me.<br><br>A simple example. Was rushing off to some place for meeting. Told God that I needed the bus to come quickly and to wait so that I will not miss it. When i got up the bus, it was almost empty. So i laughed and said to God that He didn't have to stop the whole bus for me but He did. So cute...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

"<br><br>God works in mysterious ways and thus, I believe everything happens for a specific reason... God has it all planned out 4 me, it may seem bad at 1st but it wld always turn out to be a blessing in disguise...<br><br>I've prayed to God many times .. and almost everytime he answered my prayer...Im really grateful for that..<br><br>Like the time in sec sch, an ah lian wanted to fight 1 to 1 with me... im thinner than her and much more "fragile", I wasnt exactly afraid of fighting with her but I just din wanna fight, I mean, a girl fighting??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> So unladylike... and I prayed and in the end,*surprise* *surprise*... that girl backed out....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Praise the LORD!<br><br>N I believe tt when U give willingly during offertory... U would be blessed even more... After all, God loves a cheerful giver..<br>Cus usually when I go to church, I dun bring along my wallet or any money at all... so I dun give .. but 1 Sunday, I had enuff to give and I just gave $2.. seems small.. but God worked in miraculous ways to bless me with even more than the $2 I gave Him...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

I also faced some relationship problems and it did affects me but i am slowly making my way out of this heap and no matter how...whether she can be mine or not i will still serve the Lord. Take a break....maybe u r just tired from ur involvements and take this time to settle things u need to settle, things u need to get rid from ur life inorder God can use u fully....things that r hindering ur faith u need to get them off u.  Pray....never stop seeking Him</div>
