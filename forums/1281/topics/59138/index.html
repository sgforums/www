            <div class='col-md body'>spiritual attacks are oppositions from satan when a believer comes into a serious commitment to obey God.<br><br>Eg. like when a person wants to studythe Bible or share the gospel to someone, there will be some things that happen which makes it difficult to do so. However, thats not the end of story, victory comes through Jesus Christ.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Satan don use one tactic to 'kill' all...he change to suit each individual and hit where it hurt most. For ppl who have lesser self control...maybe he will send some pretty girls to seduce him? or what...i cant say for sure.<br><br>All i can advise u is to keep pressing on, read His Word daily and pray.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Satan attacks only when needed.  If you are already doing real badly with your relationship in God, he will leave you alone and all he needs to do is to jsut whisper lies into your ears all the time.<br><br>Spiritual attacks to take in a more serious context is Satan taking the strong initiative to pull you away from God, just like what he requested to scheme against Job in the bible.  If you are under spiritual attack, and i mean real spiritual attack, not things like 'shucks my favorite football team lost!"...it has to do with things that will really disturb you physically, emotionally or mentally like maybe computer breaking down when your assignment is due tomorrow.  A spiritual attack is a sign that Satan feels that you are too close to God thats why he needs to do something...thats a good sign!<br><br>So be strong, a spiritual attack is common but God says that the One who is in us is bigger than those who surround us. Satan is defeated, can do nothing but lie, why be scare of him?<br><br>God bless.</div>
