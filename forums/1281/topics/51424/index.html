            <div class='col-md body'>Jesus tells us to be as harmless as doves and shrewd as snakes. We must be careful to discern this kind of situations.<br><br>A satanist is so much easier to identify compared to a person who claims to bear the light of Christ and their lives speak nothing about God at all.  Jesus says <span style="color: red;">"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.  (Mat 7:21 NIV) </span>He will say to them<span style="color: red;"> "Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'  (Mat 7:23 NIV)".</span><br><br>God also says <span style="color: red;">"In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. " (Mat 5:16 NIV)</span>and <span style="color: red;">"If you love me, you will obey what I command.  (John 14:15 NIV).</span> So he doesn't really love God genuinely by doing that. He needs God's love to change him. So anyone who claims that he loves God but yet refuses to obey him doesn't really love Him at all. Our love for Him must be propelled by a genuine encounter with God a transformation of our life when we are a new creation in Him. I pray that God will somehow touch him personally.</div>
