            <div class='col-md body'>a great story to start the day with..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>There once was a little boy who wanted to meet God. He knew it was a long trip to where God lived, so he packed<br>his suitcase with Twinkies and a six-pack of root beer and he started his journey.<br><br>When he had gone about three blocks, he met an old woman.  She was sitting in the park just staring at some<br>pigeons.  The boy sat down next to her and opened his suitcase.  He was about to take a drink from his root beer when he noticed that the old lady looked hungry, so he offered her a Twinkie.  She gratefully accepted it and smiled at him.  Her smile was so pretty that the boy wanted to see it again, so he offered her a root beer.  Once again she smiled at him.  The boy was delighted!<br><br>They sat there all afternoon eating and smiling, but they never said a word.<br><br>As it grew dark, the boy realized how tired he was and he got up to leave, but before he had gone more than a few<br>steps, he turned around, ran back to the old woman and gave her a hug.  She gave him her biggest smile ever.<br><br>When the boy opened the door to his own house a short time later, his mother was surprised by the look of joy on<br>his face.<br><br>She asked him, "What did you do today that made you so happy?"<br><br>He replied, "I had lunch with God."  But before his mother could respond, he added, "You know what?  She's got the most beautiful smile I've ever seen!"<br><br>Meanwhile, the old woman, also radiant with joy, returned to her home.<br><br>Her son was stunned by the look of peace on her face and he asked, "Mother, what did you do today that made you<br>so happy?"<br><br>She replied, "I ate Twinkies in the park with God."  But before her son responded, she added, "You know, he's much younger than I expected."<br></div>
