            <div class='col-md body'>This coming Saturday, my frens will get married.  Both bride and groom my good frens and churchmates.<br><br>THe problem now is that the  groom is asking his mentor and wife who watched him grow from young to be the emcees. IT would make his day becos he is his mentor  and he has been away from Singapore and been in CHina for  a year or 2. Yes C hina.<br><br>So the issue of SARs come in. HE refuses to see that his GUESTS who will come to church wedding may  be paranoid the fact that the emcees are from CHINA regardless they got fever or not. And   because they  are singaporeans, they would not be forced quarantine if they do not have fever upon reaching Spore.<br><br>So we tok to the groom, either u change the EMCEES or u need to inform your guests  (400+)  that the emcees are from coming back from China, so if they choose not to   attend its ok. But he refuses to because t o him, its his wedding and he has a emotional attachment to his mentor.  I understand how he feels but i feel that he has to be socially reponsible to his guests. I told him i will be there (cos my  band is to  play for him) but the guests may not understand. Furthermore, there will be kids there. You can check temperature but t he moment you tell pple you just came back from China, there are bound to be people who will feel paranoid...but he just fail to see the reality...haiz...sian ah dun noe how to tok to him...his wedding coordinators headache  also. ..</div>
