It is not easy to balance the two truths: "I must not be prideful, but I must understand just how much God values me." Satan can use our self- denigration, the worthless worm syndrome, to discourage us and keep us from using our gifts for Kingdom work. On the other hand, pride takes God out of the picture and attributes our contribution to God's Kingdom to us and not to God.<br>Prayer:<br><br>Holy Father, as your child, redeemed at the cost of Jesus' life, I know I am loved and valuable to you. I know you have given me abilities and gifts to use for your glory and to bless your church. But Father, I do not want to ever think that my abilities are somehow mine alone. I know you have given me the gifts, abilities, and experiences that have shaped me, so please empower me to your glory. But Father, I never want the glory that is achieved from your gifts to puff me up or turn from me the realization that I am what I am, I have what I have, and I do what I do, because of your grace and your generous gifts. May I ever be your humble but valuable child at work in your Kingdom. Through Jesus I pray. Amen.</div>

The courtroom of complaint. Some of you are rehashing the same hurt every chance you get with anyone who will listen.<br><br>For you, I have this question: Who made you God? I donÂ’t mean to be cocky, but why are you doing his work for him?<br><br>Â“Vengeance is Mine,Â” God declared. Â“I will repayÂ” (Heb. 10:30 NKJV).<br><br>Judgment is GodÂ’s job. To assume otherwise is to assume God canÂ’t do it.<br><br>Revenge is irreverent. . . . To forgive someone is to display reverence. Forgiveness is not saying the one who hurt you was right. Forgiveness is stating that God is faithful and he will do what is right.<br></div>

"I the Lord search the heart and examine the mind, to reward a man according to his conduct, according to what his deeds deserve."<br><br>Thoughts on today's verse<br>Jesus told us that what is in our heart ultimately works its way out into our activities. The great wise man told us to guard our heart because it is the spring well of our life. Jeremiah wants us to know that God knows our heart. We want to stress the importance of what goes into our hearts because it really makes a difference in what goes on inside our heart. Invite the Lord in to what you do, think, read, watch, and hear and ask him to remove those things that are not worthy of your time and interest.<br><br>Prayer:<br>Righteous Father, please help me guard my heart and be wise enough not to place things into it that would rob it of its devotion to you. I want to be pure through and through. Please search me and help me remove everything that would steal my devotion from you and ruin my influence with others. Through Jesus I pray. Amen.</div>

When we vote according to our pocketbook more than character and when we excuse the indiscretions, infidelities, and illegalities in the leaders of both political parties, we have reached a very sad state indeed! But before we rant and rave about the sad state of morality in our public officials, let's make sure we're honest in our own daily lives, that we don't say cruel things about others, that we remain faithful to our marriage and our purity vows to God, and let's make sure that we expect of ourselves higher standards than we do of others.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>God, you are not only the Almighty, you are holy! Holy, Holy, Holy are you, the LORD God Almighty. May the whole earth be filled with your glory and may that glory be shown in what I do and say. Forgive me for my own sin and hypocrisy. Bless me with purity and holiness as I pledge my life to your glory. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Diligence does pay off<br><br>For reading &amp; meditation - Proverbs 24:23-34<br>"Thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds '" (v.31)<br><br>We spend one more day on the subject of diligence. What are diligence and perseverance all about? They are sticking to a task you know God wants you to do until it is completed, irrespective of the difficulties and frustrations. Diligence does pay off. Two frogs who fell into a bucket of cream tried very hard to get out, but each time they slipped back again. One said, "We'll never get out of here," gave up and drowned. The other frog persevered with kicking. Suddenly, he felt something hard beneath his feet and discovered that his kicking had turned the cream into butter. He hopped on top of it and was able to leap out to safety. Someone has described diligence as "an archaic word." It may not play a big part in today's world, but it plays a big part in the Bible. Those who have done great exploits for God have been men and women of persistence and perseverance. One of the greatest examples of diligence in the Bible is the apostle Paul. The verse that best brings this out is this: "We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed" (2 Cor. 4:8-9). He kept going when others would have given up. I love the story of Sir Winston Churchill who, during his last years, and though failing and feeble, stood up to address a group of university students and said: "I have just one thing to say to you: Never give up. Never, never give up. Never, never, never give up." He sat down to a standing ovation.<br><br>Prayer:<br>Father, I see that life can be made or broken at the place of continuance. Give me this aspect of wisdom so that, like a postage stamp, I will stick to one thing until I get there. In Jesus' Name I ask it. Amen.<br>For Further Study<br><br>John 17:20-26; 19:30<br>1. What will Jesus not give up doing?<br>2. What did Jesus declare on the Cross?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Words that scar<br><br>For reading &amp; meditation - Proverbs 12:11-28<br>"Reckless words pierce like a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing." (v.1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me." It's not true. Names do hurt and produce emotional scars that stay within the soul for life. A woman could not escape the bondage of a name her father gave her when she was a child: "The devil's daughter." She was freed from it eventually, but not without hours of counseling and struggle. Unkind words are like deadly missiles that penetrate all the soul's defenses and blast a hole in the personality that may take years to repair. On the other hand, words that are encouraging can lift and cheer the soul in a way that is quite amazing. C. E. Macartney tells how he saw sitting on a bench a minister whom he had known. The man was well advanced in years and broken in health. As a result of his condition, he had given up his church and was unable to participate in any kind of pulpit ministry. Macartney says, "I turned to speak to him, expecting to hear from him some word of melancholy, reminiscence or present gloom, but I received a pleasant surprise. He told me that a woman going by had just spoken to him and told him that a message he had given many years ago had been the means of bringing her to Christ. The glow on his face was something I shall never forget." How wonderful it will be if today you and I can say a cheerful and encouraging word to someone that will lift their burden, lighten their darkness and minister the life of God into their soul. At least let's try!<br><br>Prayer:<br>O Father, help me not to be like the person who looked into a mirror and then went away forgetting what he looked like. I have looked into the mirror of Your Word and see what I should be. Now help me be. In Jesus' Name. Amen.<br>For Further Study<br><br>James 3:1-18; Eccl. 9:17; Isa. 50:4<br>1. What does James say about the tongue?<br>2. What had the Lord given Isaiah?</div>
