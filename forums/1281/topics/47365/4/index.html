(v.5)<br><br>We need to fix it as an axiom in our thinking that nobody ever gets away with anything, anywhere, at any time, if that "anything" is dishonest or untrue. The whole history of humanity is a commentary on this. The first lie, uttered by Satan in the Garden of Eden, was this: "You will not surely die" (Gen. 3:4). And he keeps repeating that well-worn but discredited lie to every man and woman who comes into this world. Something dies the moment you are dishonest or fail to be a person of integrity. Self-respect dies within you. Death begins to eat away at your heart the moment dishonesty comes in. You are not so much punished for your sin. You are punished by sin for sin. In one sense, sin is its own punishment. "Dishonesty puts sand in the machinery of life," says one writer. I would add: "And honesty and integrity put in oil." We can choose to live with sand, or oil, in our inner mechanism. I cannot say whether or not I would ever lie. I would like to think not - but I am fallible and human. I know this, however: my moral joints will creak if I am dishonest. I am made for integrity and I will not function well without it.<br><br>Prayer:<br>O Father, help me grasp this simple but important fact - I am designed in my inner being for truth and honesty. When I work with truth, I go leaping into life. When I work without it, I limp. Drive this truth deep into my being. In Jesus' Name. Amen.</div></blockquote>where u get all these?? very helpful <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong>Jesus said, "If you love me, you will obey what I command" (John 14:15, NIV).</strong></span><br><br>A Daily Encounter reader writes: "I know lovely people who go to church and say they want and embrace an intimate relationship with JesusÂ—and are living with their lovers outside of marriage. A girl who works where I work says she loves Jesus and wants a close relationship with him. She goes to church every Sunday and is living with her boyfriend. We can't judge."<br><br>How sad or rather, delusional, when we say we love the Lord but don't obey him. As Jesus said, "If you love me, you will obey what I command." The reality is it's what we do, not what we say, that counts.<br><br>True, as Christians we have freedom and don't want to slip back into legalismÂ—that is, doing the "right" thing outwardly but not from the heart. At the same time, our freedom or liberty in Christ is not a license to do as we please. As the Bible also says, "What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid" (Romans 6:15, KJV). If we do keep sinning, we actually lose our freedom because we become a slave to, rather than a master of, sin.<br><br>Our reader also says that we can't judge. Actually, while we are not to judge others, we are to judge actions. Again, God's Word says, "But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one" (1 Corinthians 2:14, NKJV).<br><br>Pastors and teachers are also instructed to rebuke and correct people who are sinning. Admittedly, there is a fine line between judging people and their actions, but if Christians would read the Bible, know what it teaches, and were sincere about obeying the Lord, their actions would judge themselves.<br><br>Sadly, too, what so many people fail to realize is that God's instructions are for our good, not to take away the joy of living. Living in harmony with God's will gives us true liberty but it doesn't give us a license to do as we please. Also, when we sin, we not only hurt ourselves but very often others as well.<br><br>Suggested prayer: "Dear God, please help me to love you sincerely from the heart. Help me to overcome my bent for sinning so that I will always want to live in harmony with your will and live to please you and not myself. Thank you for hearing and answering my prayer. Gratefully, in Jesus' name, amen."<br><br>[/b]</div>

But evil people bring evil things out of the evil they stored in their hearts. People speak the things that are in their hearts."<br><br>The Voice:<br>Thump... Thump... Thump...<br>By: Max Lucado<br>From: On the Anvil<br><br>When a potter bakes a pot, he checks it solidity by pulling it out of the oven and thumping it. If it "sings" it's ready. If it "thuds," it's placed back in the oven. The character of a person is also checked by thumping. Been thumped lately?<br><br>Late-night phone calls. Grouchy teacher. Grumpy mom. Burnt meals. Flat tires. "You've got to be kidding" deadlines. Those are thumps. Thumps are those irritating inconveniences that trigger the worst in us. The catch us off guard. Flat footed. They aren't big enough to be crises, but if you get enough of them, watch out! Traffic jams. Long lines. Empty mailboxes. Dirty clothes on the floor... Thump. Thump. Thump. How do I respond? Do I sing? Or do I thud? Jesus said that out of the nature of the heart a man speaks. (Luke 6:45) There's nothing like a good thump to reveal the nature of a heart. The true character of a person is seen not in momentary heroics, but in the thump-packed humdrum of day-to-day living.<br><br>Prayer:<br>Praise God for being our Potter and our "Thumper."<br>Confess to Him the thumps you've thudded to instead of sung to lately in your life.<br>Thank Him for the thumps in life that make us persevere and for not giving up on us when we do thud.<br>Ask Him to help you be a joyful noise in all situations when you are thumped.<br><br></div>

I like to think of a slight smile coming over his lips as he heard what his Master said. For now he understood.

John had been listening for an answer to his earthly problems, while Jesus was busy resolving his heavenly ones.<br><br>That's worth remembering the next time you hear the silence of God.<br></div>

Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to his edification."<br><br>The Voice:<br>"No one is useless in this world who lightens the burden of anyone else."<br><br>Best-selling author Leo Buscaglia was the youngest son of a very large Italian immigrant family. He grew up speaking Italian at home, learning English as a second language. As a boy he preferred opera to popular music, and he knew Italian fairy tales rather than the traditional English ones read by his neighbors. His family's home was marked by joyous moments, passionate beliefs, and deep family ties.<br><br>However, his school psychologist saw him differently. He considered Buscaglia's English language skills to be very low, and his view of the world radically unrealistic. The psychologist classified him as mentally deficient, "retarded," and recommended that he be in a special class.<br><br>In the special class, Buscaglia met Miss Hunt, a caring, warm teacher who paid little attention to the label placed upon him. She saw him, and the other students in her class, as rich in potential. She conveyed a love of learning to all her students.<br><br>Buscaglia soon blossomed, and after several months, Miss Hunt insisted that he be re-tested. The result was his placement in a regular classroom. Miss Hunt's door remained open to Buscaglia, and she continued to encourage him and convince him that he had a wonderful life ahead.<br><br>What might you do today to help someone who has been "written off" by others?<br><br>Comments:<br>We judge people today by the standards that we learn from society. Society is of the world and we are not of the world. To quote a famous song by the group called Avalon, "We are not like the world... but we can love it.....so let us be... in it not of it." God put us here to be lights for him and to show the people what the world is supposed to be like if we are in God's will. We are to have the mind of Christ. What do you think about all day?<br><br>Prayer:<br>Pray for others today and for yourself that we might all come to know Christ better in this day He's given us to serve Him.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Another Name</strong><br>...how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me?   Matthew 18:21<br><br>My sister was named for our aunt. She never really liked her name. When she began writing , she changed the spelling of her name from the male version to the female, but ended up going back to the original.  Performers usually take a stage name. Many authors have a pseudonym.  Some people add a name, like at confirmation.<br><br>God has many names  which describe facets of His character.  Jehovah Rapha (The Lord who heals) and Jehovah Jireh, (The Lord our provider) are a couple.  He has another name I have given Him.  Jehovah the God of Another Chance.<br><br>The other day on the phone I got my feelings hurt by a candid comment.  He apologized,  wanted another chance to rephrase what heÂ’d said.  I was quickly weighing the pros and cons, while that little voice inside was saying, Â“YES, give him another chance.Â”<br><br>How many times in just one day do I want somebody else to allow me another chance?  For something I have done - or not done.    Mahatma Ghandi is quoted as saying, Â“If we practice an eye for an eye and a tooth  for a tooth, soon the whole world will be blind and toothless.Â”<br><br>In the Bible there is an account of Peter asking Jesus just how many times he should forgive someone. Peter thought he was being so magnanimous by offering to do that not once, not twice, but seven times.  Seven is a number symbolic of perfect, complete, or whole, so Peter felt sure he was being more than generous.  Jesus gently corrected his thinking when He said not seven times, but seventy times seven.  In other words, no number large enough to express how many times.<br><br>The Lord is always willing to forgive us when we mess up and make mistakes.  There is no set time when He says, Â“ThatÂ’s it!  No more chances for you!Â” Yes, He has many names, including The God of ALWAYS Another Chance.<br></div>

He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.<br><br>Thoughts on today's verse<br>Maranatha -- O Lord come! This cry of the early church, especially during times of trial, persecution, and difficulty, must be tempered with the reminder that there is a lost world around us -- many of whom are dear friends and family.

Jesus taught us to pray for the day that the LORD would be the recognized king over all the earth. We look forward to that, because our faith will be shown true and the LORD himself will be glorified as he should be. In a world of profanity, a world where God's name is blasphemed, every knee will bow and every tongue confess that he is LORD, Yahweh, incomparable without rival.<br>Prayer:<br><br>Great Almighty LORD, work to bring yourself glory, in these days.

When we're facing problems in all areas of our life. The only person we usually turn to is our friends, families etc. What we did not realize at most of our time is we should turn to our heavenly Father in heaven for answers for HIs will to be revealed in us. Many times, we would cry and keep blaming ourselves or others for what is happening. Blaming is not supposed to be. We can't blame anyone for things that happen. Because our Father in Heaven allowed it to happen for a purpose, a reason, a time for us to learn, to love, to experience joy, pain and misery.<br><br>What we can do is to accept and hold on to the truth, to the joy that God has for us.<br><br>No doubt our frens and loved ones are there to support us and advise us. But, not everyone is blessed with such good company. I do have many friends but good friends who would always be there for u, good friends who truly understand u, where can u find? I've always though I had one very close friend. But our daily lifes have kept us apart.<br><br>May everyone continue to hope and trust in e Lord.<br></div>

The greatest thing we can do is to find that purpose and live it out. We can trust his purpose in us because it is based on his wisdom and love. As long as we seek his will, we're not going to do anything that can ultimately spoil his purpose in us. Yes, we may at times stray from the perfect channel he wants us to travel, but we never get totally out of the main channel. As long he does not abandon us, (and he promised he never would forsake us he will use us) for his purposes.<br>Prayer:<br><br>O Sovereign God, help me discern today what my life is intended to fulfill. Thank you for loving me and promising to walk beside me every step of my life. I live trusting that you will never forsake me. Through Jesus I pray. Amen.</div>
