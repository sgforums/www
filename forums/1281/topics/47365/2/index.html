The ups and downs, the joys and tribulations. My days in the army, my days overseas, my graduation, my first breakup, my dad passing away.. God has always been there.

The New Testament is clear, a Savior who is not Lord is no Savior and no friend. If the Old Testament showed us anything, it is that God's seemingly bizarre laws were written not for his fascination but for his people's preservation. Let's not only call Jesus Lord this week, let's live in a way that shows that he controls our lives and his Spirit produces our character.<br>Let us keep focused on God every minute of our lives so that our word, actions honour Him.<br><br>Prayer:<br>Most Holy Lord, please take control of my life and my will so I may be wholly yours, not just in word, but in thought and in deed as well.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">The Verse:</span><br>Remember this, fix it in mind, take it to heart, you rebels. Remember the former things, those of long ago; I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me.I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times,what is still to come. I say: My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please. Isaiah 46:8-10<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The Voice:</span>[/color]<br>Our Thoughts - Charles Stanley<br><br>The mind is the control tower of life. Your thoughts greatly influence your successes, your failures, and the direction of your life, as well as your relationships with God and others. Godliness derives from thinking the way God does.<br><br>Yet there are several problems that can beleaguer your thought life. One of the most persistent is the influence of your past. When you were saved, God gave you a new spirit, a new life, and a new beginning. However, He did not blot the past from your mindÂ—He wants you to be able to draw from your good and bad experiences when ministering to others. He also wants you to appreciate His grace all the more by remembering that from which He rescued you.<br><br>Another problem is unsuitable input. Though we may think we are immune, what we allow into our minds does greatly affect our thinking. Ungodly input creates an acceptance or appetite for worldly things. It can also lead to hostility: our godly thoughts are at odds with our ungodly appetites, which creates feelings of tension and guilt. As we begin to edit God from various parts of our lives, we allow Satan to get a toehold.<br><br>ThatÂ’s why God instructs us,Â“Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.Â”(Phillippians 4:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. He knows that properly programming our mind can protect us from the DevilÂ’s traps.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Comments:</span>[/color]<br>Many of us are plagued with the problem of what goes on in our head, and it's suitability to our Daily walk. For some of us, it is easier to filter out, but for others, it is a very real and daily struggle to be dealt with. I urge you to not let past failures discourage you, or past successes inflat your spirit, rather draw from these experiences and learn. No one experience defines who you are and what you will be. You are defined by what you do over the duration. One mistake will not topple your faith, nor will one, outside of salvation, seal your eternity. I urge you to keep your eyes on the prize at the end of the race, and to pray for your brothers and sisters.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Prayer:</span>[/color]<br>Father, be with us not only in our daily lives and walk, but also in our thoughts. Help us to dwell on You and the good things You inspire.<br></div>

Did he think think the whole whole was out to get him? You might get that impression as you read through some of his psalms. Look at a few of the statements he made:<br><br>* "Strangers have risen up against me, and opperssors have sought after my life" (Psalm 54:3)<br>* "There are many who fight again me/" (Psalm 56:2)<br>* "They lie in wait for my life; the mighty gather against me" (Psalm 59:3)<br><br>Of course, during this time David was being hotly pursued bu Saul and his men, so it's easy to see why he felt as he did. Nonetheless, his observations about people may echo the way we feel on occasions when others criticize and oppose us. Perhaps it's those with whom we worl. They seem to disagree with us no matter what we do or say. Maybe it's family members who apparently enjoy irritating us. Or people at church who seem to be critical or faultfinding. We just feel as if everyone is against us.<br><br>If this describes your situation, it's time to do what David did. He declared, " In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?"

He sacrificed himself to give us a second chance. He would have gone to any lengths to do so. And he did. He went to the cross, where manÂ’s utter despair collided with GodÂ’s unbending grace.
