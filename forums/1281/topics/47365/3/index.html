            <div class='col-md body'>You were taught to be made new in your hearts, to become a new person. . . . Made to be like God, made to be truly good and holy.<br>EPHESIANS 4:23-24<br><br><strong>Walking with God</strong>Healthy marriages have a sense of "remaining." The husband remains in the wife, and she remains in him. There is a tenderness, an honesty, an ongoing communication. The same is true in our relationship with God. Sometimes we go to him with our joys, and sometimes we go with our hurts, but we always go. And as we go, the more we go, the more we become like him. Paul says we are being changed from "glory to glory" (2 Cor. 3:18 KJV).<br><br>People who live long lives together eventually begin to sound alike, to talk alike, even to think alike. As we walk with God, we take on his thoughts, his principles, his attitudes. We take on his heart.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Where our individual desire dies and sanctified surrender lives.</strong><br><br>One of the greatest hindrances in coming to Jesus is the excuse of our own individual temperament. We make our temperament and our natural desires barriers to coming to Jesus. Yet the first thing we realize when we do come to Jesus is that He pays no attention whatsoever to our natural desires. We have the idea that we can dedicate our gifts to God. However, you cannot dedicate what is not yours. There is actually only one thing you can dedicate to God, and that is your right to yourself (see Romans 12:1 ). If you will give God your right to yourself, He will make a holy experiment out of youÂ—and His experiments always succeed. The one true mark of a saint of God is the inner creativity that flows from being totally surrendered to Jesus Christ. In the life of a saint there is this amazing Well, which is a continual Source of original life. The Spirit of God is a Well of water springing up perpetually fresh. A saint realizes that it is God who engineers his circumstances; consequently there are no complaints, only unrestrained surrender to Jesus. Never try to make your experience a principle for others, but allow God to be as creative and original with others as He is with you.<br><br>If you abandon everything to Jesus, and come when He says, "Come," then He will continue to say, "Come," through you. You will go out into the world reproducing the echo of ChristÂ’s "Come." That is the result in every soul who has abandoned all and come to Jesus.<br><br>Have I come to Him? Will I come <span style="font-style: italic;">now</span>?</div>

And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.</blockquote>Thoughts on today's verse<br>No matter what your passport says, if you are a Christian, there is no earthly country that can hold you, no borders that can claim you and no flag that flies above you but Jesus and the Kingdom of Heaven. You have more in common with the believing aboriginal tribesman of Indonesia, the Christian refugee in Africa, or the Bedouin brother in Egypt, or the high-rise business person in Hong Kong who bows to pray in Jesus name, or the Spirit-filled Brazilian housewife, than you do your next door neighbor if they don't know Christ as Lord and Savior.<br><br>Prayer:<br>Glorious God and Almighty Father, I look forward to the day when people from every language, tribe, nation, and language join the angels and elders around your throne and worship you in joy forever.

            <div class='col-md body'>All you who put your hope in the LORD be strong and brave.<br>PSALM 31:24<br><br><strong>Character Creates Courage</strong><br><br>A legend from India tells about a mouse who was terrified of cats until a magician agreed to transform him into a cat. That resolved his fear... until he met a dog, so the magician changed him into a dog. The mouse-turned-cat-turned-dog was content until he met a tigerÂ—so, once again, the magician changed him into what he feared. But when the tiger came complaining that he had met a hunter, the magician refused to help. Â“I will make you into a mouse again, for though you have the body of a tiger, you still have the heart of a mouse.Â”<br><br>Sound familiar? How many people do you know who have built a formidable exterior, only to tremble inside with fear? . . . We face our fears with force... or. . . we stockpile wealth. We seek security in things. We cultivate fame and seek status.<br><br>But do these approaches work?<br><br>Courage is an outgrowth of who we are.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Joshua 6 :1-21</strong><br>The LORD said to Joshua, "....March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. Have seven priests carry trumpets of ram's horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have all the people give a loud shout;the wall of the city will collapse and the people will go up, every man straight in."<br><br>JOSHUAÂ’S COMMANDER<br>The God of Israel has always worked wonders among His chosen people. Feeding multitudes with manna, providing out of rocks, constructing a makeshift 'expressway' through the parted waters of the Red sea and once again in River Jordan. Of enabling young David to kill giant Goliath with simply a few smooth stones, of speaking to Balaam using a donkey and so on.<br>From the above experiences with God, we see a trend running through them. A heart of obedience. To collect just enough manna for the day, to get water from rocks, to walk on dry lands at His command are some examples that require obedience.<br>Joshua 6 tells yet another 'out-of-this-world' example of conquering a city. The men were armed but never use them to demolish walls, the priests were carrying shofars for the first six days but were not told to blow them. As if the marching is not tiring enough, why bother to carry these bulky instruments when they do not even have the chance to use them? March round Jericho once a day for six days and seven rounds on the seventh day and expect walls to tumble to many of us is foolishness. The Israelites obeyed GodÂ’s command and God delivered their enemies into their hands. The carrying of weapons but not using it to conquer perhaps is God's message to us that we cannot expect things to happen just because we force our way through, to carry arms and not employing them is a sure sign of obedience to the Chief Commander-God Himself.<br>It is not the weight of the marching crowd that loosen the foundations of the wall of Jericho but the victory that accompanies their obedience to God. If you think human abilitites can do wonders, take a look at the God of wonders in the Scriptures.  Obedience to GodÂ’s command have proved victorious results throughout history, dare to try that again?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Verse:<br>James 4:6 "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."<br><br>The Voice:<br>Painting The Grass<br><br>As my husband, Gary and I were riding down the coastline recently, we passed one of the posh area casinos. The landscaping is absolutely breathtaking, and there is usually a covey of groundskeepers busily keeping it that way. However, what we observed that day really made us chuckle! As we passed the manicured foliage, Gary said, "Take a look at THAT!" There were two men painting the grass!<br><br>One member of the team was using a sprayer connected to a huge tank, which emitted a fine spray of what seemed to be a diluted form of green paint. As he guided the wand back and forth across the grass, his co-worker held a piece of plywood to keep the spray from getting on the curb and other plants. What had previously been a large area of light green grass interspersed with several spots of yellow and brown suddenly was transformed into a lush, deep green expanse. Of course, the goal was to make it more appealing and attractive to the eye.<br><br>Comments:<br>While we may smile at this scenario, are we not sometimes guilty of seeking to "paint the grass" in areas of our lives? I have faults and weaknesses, and I really prefer that others not know them. I want them to think I "have it all together"; otherwise, they might not like me much! But if we all go through life wearing these masks, how can we really get to know each other? "Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much." This verse (James 5:16) shows a better way. Much emotional healing could be accomplished if we would, through heeding this admonition, put pride to death. Then with transparent lives, we could nurture each other and provide needed prayer support!<br><br>Prayer:<br>"Dear Lord, give me the courage to share my deepest needs with special friends, and give them the freedom to share theirs with me."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tips On Jogging</strong><br><br>Feel like jogging yesterday evening . Get all changed into my tee-shirt and shorts, put on my socks and slip into my running shoes and set for the park.<br><br>Spent about 10 minutes doing some warm-up exercises and started off on a 2.4Km journey. The beginning of the run was fine, the pace were regular and my breathing okay...I kept taking a look at the distance marking at the side of the track and each time I saw it, I felt discouraged about the distance I need to run in order to reach the finishing line. Each time I took a glance, my pace became irregular, I felt shortage of breath and the running gets tougher and tougher. I told myself to be focused and kept on running, whenever someone overtook me I will use him or her as a pace marker and run after the person. After much struggle, distractions, perserverances I reached the finishing line 2.4Km away from where I started. I have completed the race.<br><br>I couldn't help but to relate my physical experience with the spiritual journey...<br><br><strong>WEAR PROPER ATTIRE WITHOUT EXCESS LOADS(POCKET LESS SHORTS IF POSSIBLE) </strong><br><br>Similarly, as a Christian I have a race marked out before me by God and the run is constantly surrounded not by the trees and shrubs of the park but by a great cloud of witnesses. The run can be as tiring as that of a physical run and the difficulty comes from the load of things that so often hinders, sin so easily entangles(Hebrews 12:1). Just like entangled shoe laces that causes needless injuries and slows me down; hidden and unconfessed sins will retard out speed and makes me trip over the rocks.<br><br><strong>WHAT YOU SEE AFFECTS WHERE YOU WILL END UP RUNNING IN </strong><br><br>The things I fixed my eyes upon also have significant impact in the course of my race, by focusing on the markers stating my distant ran so far would not increase my speed, instead the opposite. Focusing my eyes on things of this world will in many ways affect my relationship with God because when I place all my attention on this earth that I lost touch of heaven. The Scripture teaches us to fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith(Hebrews 12:2). By directing our eyes towards the Saviour do we have our lives readjusted and tuned in to the Voice from above.<br><br><strong>EAT WELL, DRINK PLENTY OF WATER AND AVOID JUNK FOOD </strong><br><br>I have also learnt that good nourishment and plenty of water before the actual race is important. However, downing bottles of water can never be done right before you start to run, it has to be taken in several hours before the exercise and at intervals of reasonable volume. So is it with our intake of spiritual nourishments- the Word of God(Hebrews 4:12). Do we consume the sumptous food from His Word at regular intervals or do we enjoy Bible binge? Do we drink from His eternal spring of living water that wells up within us to everlasting life(John 4:13,14) or do we prefer counterfeit stale water? What we eat affects how well we can run, does our stamina reveals our spiritual diet? Can we start well the journey and end as well as we start?<br><br><strong>ALWAYS LISTEN TO THE CHIEF INSTRUCTOR AND FOLLOW THE EXAMPLES OF THOSE WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE RACE </strong><br><br>Instructor Jesus(Psalm 32:8  ) is there for us always, till the end of the age (Matthew 28:20b) and has provided us the best spiritual supplement ever!(Deteronomy 8:3, 2 Timothy 4:16) and also a great cloud of witnesses throughout the journey to cheer us on...<br><br>At the end of my life on earth, will I be able to say with certainty that <strong>"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith." (2 Timothy 4:7) </strong><br><br>[article written by NeonTetra, Scriptures from Holy Bible(NIV)]  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Psalm 68:4-5<br>Sing to God, sing praise to his name, extol him who rides on the clouds -- his name is the Lord -- and rejoice before him. A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling.<br><br>Thoughts on today's verse<br>I can't help but think of what James, Jesus' brothers said: "Pure religion, undefiled before God the Father is this: keep oneself undefiled and care for orphans and widows in their distress." Jesus showed clearly this was the Father's heart in his ministry. Now it is up to us to continue it!<br><br>Prayer:<br>Father, may my life, my compassion, and my ministry reflect your heart for those who need care and protection and love. Give me eyes to see this need more clearly and a heart to responded more certainly so that your love may be demonstrated through me. Through Jesus I pray. Amen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For reading &amp; meditation:<br>Proverbs 14:1-13<br><br>"A truthful witness does not deceive, but a false witness pours out lies." (v.5)<br><br>We need to fix it as an axiom in our thinking that nobody ever gets away with anything, anywhere, at any time, if that "anything" is dishonest or untrue. The whole history of humanity is a commentary on this. The first lie, uttered by Satan in the Garden of Eden, was this: "You will not surely die" (Gen. 3:4). And he keeps repeating that well-worn but discredited lie to every man and woman who comes into this world. Something dies the moment you are dishonest or fail to be a person of integrity. Self-respect dies within you. Death begins to eat away at your heart the moment dishonesty comes in. You are not so much punished for your sin. You are punished by sin for sin. In one sense, sin is its own punishment. "Dishonesty puts sand in the machinery of life," says one writer. I would add: "And honesty and integrity put in oil." We can choose to live with sand, or oil, in our inner mechanism. I cannot say whether or not I would ever lie. I would like to think not - but I am fallible and human. I know this, however: my moral joints will creak if I am dishonest. I am made for integrity and I will not function well without it.<br><br>Prayer:<br>O Father, help me grasp this simple but important fact - I am designed in my inner being for truth and honesty. When I work with truth, I go leaping into life. When I work without it, I limp. Drive this truth deep into my being. In Jesus' Name. Amen.</div>
