            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Verse</strong><br>John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whosoever would believe in Him should not die, but live eternally with Him."<br><br><strong>The Bread</strong><br>"He Chose The Nails" (By Wes King; from: CD - "Max Lucado-He Chose the Nails")<br><br>A tool of torture becomes of sign of hope.<br>The measure for the love of God.<br>The intersection of eternity and time.<br>Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,<br>Or thorns compose so rich a crown?<br><br>The hand that held the hammer was the hand of God.<br>The hand that took the nail was His only son.<br>The doors that heaven opened as He opened up His hand,<br>And it rained down mercy.<br>It rained down mercy.<br><br>He built an altar to offer up his son.<br>How could this be the will of God?<br>The intervention from Heaven was a voice,<br>Saying "Though this someday must be done,<br>Abraham, it will not be your son."<br><br>The hand that held the hammer was the hand of God.<br>The hand that took the nail was His only son.<br>The doors of heaven opened as He opened up His hand,<br>And it rained down mercy.<br>It rained down mercy.<br><br>He drank the cup and ripped the veil,<br>When He chose the nails.<br><br>The hand that held the hammer was the hand of God.<br>The hand that took the nail was His only son.<br>The doors of heaven opened as He opened up His hand,<br>And it rained down mercy.<br>It rained down mercy.<br><br><strong>Comments</strong><br>This song has such a beautiful message. And that's because its message is the gospel, the message of Christ and of our Heavenly Father's tremendous love for us. Max Lucado, in a narration before this song on the CD, talks about the fact that Jesus didn't resist on the cross not only because He loves us, but because at the moment He was on the cross, along with most likely every moment He was alive, He saw the list of our sins. "He knew the price of those sins was death and He knew the source of those sins was you." The source of the sins that Christ died for was us. Not only did Christ see those sins, our Father saw those sins. This song makes the analogy that the hand that held the hammer to nail Christ to the cross was the hand of God and the hand that took the nail was His only Son. It wasn't a choice that would have been easy to make, but a choice that He knew had to be made. And for Him, because He loves us so much, there was no option other to crucify Christ so that we could be made free through his death and most assuredly through His resurrection. "Since He couldn't bear the thought of eternity without you, He chose the nails...And as the hands of Jesus opened for the nail, the doors of Heaven opened for you."<br><br><strong>Prayer</strong><br>Today, if you have not taken the opportunities that He's given you to become His child and to be freed from the persecution of your sins, take this time. Take this time to confess to Him your sins and to ask Him to be your Lord and your Savior. Tell Him exactly what you feel. There are no special words but what is truly in your heart. He will listen and He will rejoicing take you in. If you have taken those opportunities, then take this one to thank Him for being so merciful to you and for allowing you to be His child. Rejoice, for He has risen!<br></div>
