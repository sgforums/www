Reading the Bible and praying to Him are importants aspect of ur life as a beginner and also for any Christians who wanna a closer walk with Him. Try to be more open towards fellowship and if possible join a cell group..so that u can confide ur struggles and problems with people ur age and be encouraged by them.<br><br>u can also post ur doubts here and there are many Jesus freaks here to help you by <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can i also add something else?? (i think i still will even if you say no  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )<br><br>there were times when i felt like i'm just doing stuff and joy doesn't come. I'm just serving but have no love. All i do gets very dry and i'm just living a day as it is. so i ask myself, if this is a christian walk, it isn't anything different, then why do i want to believe. Then i hear of testimonies of what God has done for others and how there is this glow in their eyes, like they know something that i don't. so i ask God, i want to have what they are having and more. I'm saying that I want to know you and feel Your love like they do. So I look. The bible says in Jer 29:13 'You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart'.<br><br>Our faith is not in religion. What makes us different is when we can know our God, who He is and be loved by Him. I've been reminded by this line, we cannot give what we did not receive. If we do not take time each day to love God and be loved by Him, we can't love those around us. I'm learning that each day....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.... guys, let me tell you a story. A long long time ago... lol...no no no...wrong story...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Okay here goes. A glass of water weighs about 300 grams. 300 grams? That's not much right? You can easily use your baby pinky and hold it. But<br><br>If you hold the glass of water continuously using your hand for 10 minutes, you will fill uncomfortable.<br><br>If you hold it for half an hour, your hand will start to ache.<br><br>If you hold it for 2 hours,  you wil probably need to see the doctor after that.<br><br>If you hold it for a day, you will need to call the ambulance.<br><br>The thing that i want to say is simple.At certain times, when we get tired from carrying the burden on us, we feel like giving up and throwing it away. What we need to do is to occasionally put down the burden, and renew our strength and by His grace, pick it up and move along the christian journey again. So when is the last time when you had a refreshing touch from God?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Isaiah 40:28<br>"They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles.

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay here goes another story. I don't know why i am sharing this too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Once there was a student who was doing a school group project. The teacher had given them a topic to research on. The topic was the refining of silver. They are supposed to find out the process of how the silver is being refined and to present them to the class.<br><br>So this boy went to the silversmith to do the research on his project. When he saw the silversmith, he ask "Can you tell me how do you refine a piece of silver?"<br><br>The silversmith told him, "Well boy! I'll show you how. First, you got to put the silver into the furnace and burn it. The furnace must be really hot or else the impurities will be left behind in the silver."<br><br>"Won't the fire destroy the silver?" The student ask in amazement.<br><br>"No son, that is why i have to sit by the furnace and watch it closely. Because if i held it in the fire any longer than it should be, it will be destroyed." replied the silversmith.<br><br>Sounds of Ooos and ahhhs can be heard when the students heard the silversmith explain it to them. Finally one boy popped out the last question "How do you know if the silver is refined and the process is complete?"<br><br>"Oh that's easy!" the silversmith replied with a smile. "When i can see my face in it" he said.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>How true it is when we are going through the toughest times our our lives, God is refining us and moulding us in the heat of the fire. He never takes His eyes off us for a second while we are in the fire for His eyes are on the sparrows. And how much more do we worth than a sparrow! And once the process of refining is complete, that's when God can see His face in you, the image of Christ fully formed in you in all His glory. So don't give up. Keep on persevering and believing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hope you guys are blessed by this short msg that i type as far as i can remember.</div>
