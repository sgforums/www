What do I mean?<br><br>I mean to say that it is NOT a rule that you must give 10%. You can give 1%, you can give 90%, that will not make God any happier nor sadder. The fact you must recognised is that God ACTUALLY owns 100% of what you have and you are just giving part of it back to Him.  Thus, you have to get the 10% our of your head...because once we treat giving to God like as if we are submitting for our annual INCOME TAX, of cos we will heart pain and full of complaints. Give according to your heart as in 2 Corinthians 9:7. BUT this is not an excuse to shortchange God. God knows your heart. If you are a 'CHEERFUL GIVER' because you can give lesser now, God forbids it.<br><br>Then we come to the issue of CHEERFUL GIVING. Does cheerful giving means a person who only has a monthly income of $1000 gives away $100 or $200 is not worried about not enough money?<br>No. Even in giving, sometimes we are worried. We may ask questions like 'God, I dun think I would have enough if I were to give you this much..' or 'God, i need this to pay for my bills...'. We ask questions like this...but 'cheerful giving' occurs in these questions when you realise 'Yes God...though i may think i will lack cash...but i know when i give to you...you promise in Philippians 4:19 that you will meet my needs according to your riches, you are a PROVIDER! Thus i trust in you and will give this amount that my heart prompts me to!.' That in short is CHEERFUL GIVING. Knowing that God will bless us EVEN MORE when we give....we have the assurance to give cheerfully.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anglicans say this offertory sentence after we have given our tithes and free-will offerings :<br><br><strong>Yours, Lord, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the splendour, and the majesty; for everything in heaven and on earth is yours. All things come from you, and of your own do we give you.</strong><br><br>Giving to God is not so much on 10% of our paychecks etc. It is the attitude of surrendedness and sacrifice behind it all. In the Old Testament times, they don earn salary but the setting aside the firstfruits of the harvests and other agricultural products for God is an act of dedication to Him and acknowledgement that He is their Provider.  Very often we as Christians claimed to call Jesus as our Lord but we need to take this time to <strong>examine</strong> ourselves and our attitude. Do we simply call Him Lord because the rest of the church calls Him that???  Is Jesus really your Lord? Lord means to control and rule over everything in your life. Ranging from your health, your sexuality, your intellectual, your relationships etc...yes, even your finances. He must be the Lord over all of these.<br><br>If God cannot touch us in our finances, which many people are going after today and we see it as the most important part of our livelihood, then we still acknowledge Him as our Lord and God? I dont think so...dont deceive urself either. In our giving, dont be so calculative as in to use a calculator and see 10% is how much...i mean a few dollars extra wont leave u bankrupt right? It is the attitude....not the amount.<br><br>I would like us to take a peep into the Gospel of Luke, in chapter 21 verse 1 - 4. Read and see what our Lord is saying to us in this example of giving.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> neontetra</div>

After days, he decided to obey God and painfully (as he said) gave the $500.  Soon after he graduated, he also decided to be a fulltime mission worker...this time round, it is his turn to raise funds....he also wrote newsletters...and he also wrote to the christian worker he gave the $500 to....and the surprise he got was that weeks later he rcv a cheque from this guy for an amount of $500!!<br><br>I think he knew that if he had kept that $500 in the beginning, all he had was $500. But having gave, he now had $500 and the understanding of the riches in Christ he had....<br><br>This is not a story to ask you all to give everything in ur bank account but to give as God prompts you to. He will not shortchange you!!!<br><br>So Evanasence, glad you knw what to do now!</div>
