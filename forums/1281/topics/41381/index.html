            <div class='col-md body'>My very good fren got lekeumia 1.5 years ago. I was with him when the doctor revealed the news to him and told him that he has only six months if the treatment does not go well. At that point of time, he was a non christian and certainly fits into the description who constantly laffs at my faith in God. But the moment he knew that his life is gonna prematurely cut short, he wanted to know more about God and the eternal hope that God offers.<br><br>ANother good fren's dad just recently diagnosed with last stage of lung cancer. He is worse, he has a real low chance of recovering and could go within months. throughout this time, he has been resistant to listen about God but because of this, he wanted to find out more about what God is saying.<br><br>A poly fren's dad passed away few years ago of heart attack. Her family has never thought that something like this could happen to the dad. But the sudden death caused the mother to think how short and unpredictable life can be. The mother became a christian short after.<br><br>You know the blessing that through these events is that they began to want to know more about life. My good fren who  has lekeumia became a christian a few mths after he got to know he has the cancer. He is scare he said because simply he does not know after he dies, where would he go. He needs a hope. His mother became  a christian recently too. From a person who use to mock my faith to a person who become so strong in his faith, this is truly a miracle for me. He said that he never use to think about questions like "where would I go when i die?" because he was so young and death never comes to his mind and at the most die is die lor, you wun know. But at the moment when he knew his life is almost ending, all these questions just came to him mind.<br><br>I am not writing this to advocate christianity but although I must state that Jesus gave me a hope when I thought that I had no hope. I am writing this to encourage to think more about death and the brevity of life. thinking of death is not being pessimistic but it facing a fact that may happen any time. And when that happens, are you sure you have left behind fond memories of yourself, have you asked where would I be  if i die, have you asked, if there an eternal hope? Dun tell urself its not impt and you still have time cos you may not know when you will be in the shoes of my frens and Yes, life is really short.</div>
