Denominations are not different in their major doctrines but minor differences like on how to conduct services. The comparison should not be liken to christianity vs roman catholicism.</div>

As said in James, faith without action is dead. However, the context as what was said in James is that, When someone is truly justified, he is truly saved and regenerate.  Therefore, we see the results of true saving faith as they are manifested in the changed life of the one justified by faith alone.  Real faith produces good works but it isn't these works that save you.  Good works are the effect of salvation, not the cause of it in any way and they certainly do not help anyone keep their salvation. It does not mean that You NEED FAITH AND WORKS to be saved, however if a person claims to have faith but yet does not show works, it is a dead faith because TRUE FAITH IN GOD will PRODUCE good works.<br><br>Secondly, talking about the TRADTION that was used by Roman Catholics as supposed 'REVELATIONS', let us refute this step by step.<br><br>* In Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 97, it states that "Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God . . ."  thus we can say that Roman Catholics view the bible as equal to Tradition.<br><br>* If the Holy Bible had mention that the Sacred Tradition is trustworthy, naturally it would be for us to believe. Roman Catholics claim that the Sacred TRadition is equal to the bible, therefore, it is equally inerrant.if the Bible said do not trust tradition, then Sacred Tradition would be instantly and obviously invalid. . In either case, the Scriptures hold the place of final authority and by that position, are shown to be superior to Sacred Tradition. If Sacred Tradition were really inerrant as it is said to be, then it would be equal with the Bible. But, GodÂ’s word does not say that Sacred Tradition is inerrant or inspired as it does say about itself (2 Tim. 3:16).  To merely claim that Sacred Tradition is equal and in agreement with the Bible does not make it so.  Furthermore, to assert that Sacred Tradition is equal to Scripture is to effectively leave the canon wide open to doctrinal addition.  Since the traditions of men change, to use tradition as a determiner of spiritual truth would mean that over time new doctrines that are not in the Bible would be added and that is exactly what has happened in Catholicism with doctrines such as purgatory, praying to Mary, indulgences, etc.  Furthermore, if they can use Sacred Tradition as a source for doctrines not explicit in the Bible, then why would the Mormons then be wrong for having additional revelation as well?<br><br>Thirdly, for the purgatory issue, the only verse in the BIBLE that Roman Catholics seek out to support this doctrine is "If any manÂ’s work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire." found in 1 Cor 3:15.<br><br>The context speaks of Paul having planted the Corinthian church and that another person was building upon that work: A few verses earlier Paul says, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth."  Paul goes on to say that unless a person builds upon the foundation of Jesus, his work will be burned up the in the day of judgment.  Paul is simply using the terms that are familiar with the people of the time. Fire was the tool used to purify metals and to get rid of that which was unwanted, the dross. So too, on the day when our works are examined, the fire of judgment will both purify and remove. This will not affect our salvation, but it will affect our rewards. This is not talking about becoming saved or staying saved.<br><br>1 Cor. 3:15 does not teach purgatory as a place we go to in order to have some of our sins cleansed from us. It teaches that even though the person is justified by faith and cannot face damnation, his works will, however, be judged on "that day." Those works which are good will survive the fires of judgment the way gold, silver, and precious stones can survive fire.  But false works will be consumed the way fire consumes wood, hay, and straw.  What is left has no bearing on whether or not we are saved.  It has to do with rewards in heaven.<br><br></div>

Its your choice, if you think it is worthy of your faith, welcome. If not, its your choice again. I think thats fair isnt it? The bible is not legally binding u to anything, it is giving u a choice to decide whether you think what it is saying is true.</div>

Supposed contradictions brought up were all refuted because it was taken out of context.<br><br>External evidence - are there any other documents supporting it?<br>Apparently, events described in the bible were not exclusively found in the bible but even in writings of Socrates and Josephus and others.<br><br>Archaelogical evidence - things like dead sea scrolls were found and other archaelogical evidence points to authenticity of events described in the bible.<br><br>I have all these studies on paper but too long to write here hehehehe. If you wan, i can pass u a copy somehow.<br><br>HOWEVER, i must say that despite such evidences that the bible is real, I am of the great belief that FAITH is more important that all these what our eyes can see. It is what I experience after I became a christian rather than all these evidences that make me trust in God more.</div>
