Basically, Christian Deviations seem like the real thing because some of the central doctrines they taught are similar to the christian faith but yet  there are some very important doctrines which they resist or altered.

I will talk about some of them.<br><br>1) Christians believe that we are justified by faith in God alone as said in Romans 3:28. But Roman Catholics believe that faith alone is not sufficent as said in Council of Trent, Canons on Justification, Canon 9.<br><br>2) We believe the bible to be the sole authoratative word of God and if anyone were to add or take away words from the bible, they will be judged by God as in Revelations. But RC believe that that the BIBLE needs to be treated equally as the TRADITION, which claimed it contains revelation to the church over the years.<br><br>3) We believe that all sins are forgiven as said in John 19:30 that the work of justification and cleansing is done completely by Jesus. But RC believes otherwise that we have to suffer in Purgatory (a doctrine unheard of in the bible) to wash away sins that were not by the death of Christ. This is a direct insult to Christ death on the cross.<br><br>Thus we can see major differences in doctrines in the authority of  Christ. There are many more. I am not condemning Roman Catholics but just bringing out biblical references to what I believe.<br><br></div>

I will briefly summarise then you ask questions if u have any.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mormons</span><br><br>Mormonism is founded by a guy called Joseph Smith. Outrightly, i can tell you he is wrong cause he claimed he did more than Jesus in keeping the church together.<br><br>MOrmonism teaches that the holy gospel was lost but mormonism is its restoration. Without this restoration and Joseph Smith, there would be no salvation.  It also teaches the the Mormonic Bible, a book written by Smith who claims God inspire him to write it, is better and more accurate than the bible. And  better still, they teach that if you become a very good mormon, you have a potential to become a god.<br><br>They have a church in Singapore called the Church Of the Latter Day Saints. They normally walk around Singapore in white shirts and a name tag and preaching. They are mostly ang mohs in Singapore.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seventh Day Adventist</span><br><br>It is very close to christianity except because it has some major doctrinal difference that many pple choose to classify it as a deviation.<br><br>Weird teachings include that our sins will ultimately be placed on Satan and that Jesus is Michael the Archangel. Worship must be done on Saturday (the Sabbath) and On October 22, 1844 Jesus entered the second and last phase of his atoning work.<br>Worse still they claimed that Ellen G. White, the "founder" of Seventh Day Adventism, was a messenger from God gifted with the spirit of prophecy and that there is a sanctuary in heaven where Jesus carries out his mediatorial work.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jehovah Witnesses</span><br><br>Founded by Charles Russel, I am sure u heard of their refusal to sing national anthems and hold arms and not going to doctors when sick.<br><br>Again doctrinal differences and discrepancies classified them as a deviation. Some very wrong doctrines include that Jesus was only a perfect man not God in flesh. They said that only their church members will be saved (a trademark of cults). Only 144, 000 JW will go to heaven (the believe for what?). Good works is necessary for salvation. LASTLY, blood transfusion is a sin.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scientology</span><br><br>STarted by Mary Eddy. Basically the name suggests that the science is a key to God. Again doctrinal differences.<br><br>They teach that God is the Father-Mother, and that Jesus was not the Christ and that Jesus did not die. THe holy spirit to them is SCIENCE, just more divine. In direct contradictions, they say that there is no devil and there is no sin. Sicknesses are not real, but only illusions and most importantly they say the sacrifice of Jesus was not sufficient to cleanse from sin.</div>
