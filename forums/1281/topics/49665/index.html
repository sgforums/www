Both the bread and the wine is administered usually only to a newly-married couple in a wedding Mass.<br><br>So while a priest may apparently have both the bread and wine, the congregation can also have it.</div>

What we have is unleavened bread. As a Protestant congregation, we simply subscribe to the doctrine of the Communion as a memorial, instead of the Catholic doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">transubstantation</span>, which devotes to the Real Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ.<br><br>Besides, my local church do not take the position of the Eucharist as a <span style="font-style: italic;">sacrament</span>, but more of an <span style="font-style: italic;">ordinance</span>, a mere symbol which do not infuse grace into the believer who participates in it.<br><br>Personally, I believe the transubstantation doctrine of the Eucharist as closer to the Communion in which the early historical church practised.<br><br>Sometimes I am irked by the many anti-Catholic views of my Protestant brethren, who have accused falsely of the claims of the Holy Mother Church, even without doing the necessary homework to justify such a polemic.<br><br>Smacking of poor scholarship and anti-intellectualism, we have build caricatures of straw, convenient though they are, and tear them down. But what we tear down, isn't the genuine article, but a misrepresentation. That has been the weakness, a moral flaw, of many a Protestant believer - not only towards Roman Catholicism, but of other religious traditions as well, such as Islam (Christians having gross ideas of what Islam is, which in reality is not).<br><br>May God in His mercy forgive us of our hypocrisy and pharisaical attitude.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh. It is so sad to know that even in dialogues which are rational, logical and reason-based, there are still people who, because of reasons only known to them (perhaps being unable to come to terms with the biblical cadence of Catholicism), choose to ignore or be unwilling to search the Scriptures and Church history in order to desire for the truth, whether or not the truth may be pleasing to their prejudices or not. sigh.<br><br>There wasn't even personal attacks, character assassinations, and cheap debate tricks on my part to garner some "points" for my position. It was simply a sincere theological discussion on my part to at least "educate" or "inform" the Protestant brethren of the Catholic faith, lest they misunderstand or have exaggerated and misrepresented notions of what the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church is about.<br><br>Anyway, my brief explanation of the Marian doctrines in another thread was simply a response to what gasband requested, to perhaps elaborate and clarify on certain issues he brought up when he quoted the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC).<br><br>That was all. Have he understood my post...or did he find it too intellectually convincing such that he has to resort to closing the thread so as not to stumble his conscience even further?
