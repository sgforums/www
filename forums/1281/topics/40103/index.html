But well, lets just all show some grace and love towards them, all of us are humans, we make mistakes but the greatest part is when Jesus says He will always love you. Hmm so my sista (my assumption) here are a few verses for you that God still wants you and loves you while you are trying to learn how to become the person God wants you to be:<br><br>Hebrews 13:5<br>Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, <span style="color: red;">because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you</span><br><br>1 John 1:9<br>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.<br><br>Just remember sista that you are NEVER too sinful for God to want you back. He has never moved away from you, no He is just waiting for the day u will move back to Him. Cheers! God bless.</div>
