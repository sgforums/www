When people see you happy and at peace, they will want to know.. and that is when they will come to you... and to God.<br><br></div></blockquote>Firstly, i have to emphasize to you that going out to talk to people about Christ is absolutely nothing wrong. God commands us to do that because "How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?" in Romans 10:14.<br><br>But I do understand when someone tries to force it down. I do not do that. I share but I do not force it if someone do not want to listen.<br><br>Secondly, there is no such thing as best form of evangelism. In the bible, Jesus did all forms of evangelism. He did street evangelism (when He tok to the samaritan woman he met). He did mass evangelism (the beautitudes). He also did lifestyle evangelism as you have said. The crux is not to choose the best form of evangelism but to do evangelism, all forms of it. Like what Paul said in 1 Cor 9:22 "To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some."<br><br>Thus, to reject evangelism in other forms and insisting on just using ur lifestyle as a form of evangelism is a direct contradiction of the life and teachings of Jesus.<br><br>And lastly, I do not think that all christians who share Christ on the street are obnoxious. Leave the judging to God. You do what God wants you to do.</div>

And while I am not shirking responsibility, I cant possibly talk to everyone who behaves like this. Even if I do, I cant possibly say I can change their mentality. But even there is such people, it should not stop us to go out and tell people about Christ.<br><br>That is why whenever I counsel or just advise someone, I will leave the person with "Pray about it, if you think you need to change, only you with the strength from God can you do that."<br><br>Do not feel anger or hatred or even disgust towards them. Those feelings will cause us to judge and sin. Not saying that I do not judge, but it is true that we as humans, everyone of us will sin, but certainly we can make an effort to let the Holy Spirit take control of our lives and we will feel lesser of unwanted emotions.<br><br>Let God deal with them accordingly. Paul in the bible was allowed to do many bad stuff isnt he? Until God decides it was time to deal with him. God has His timings and plan for each individual. God desires none to perish but all to come to repentance. Bad christian behaviours may give non-christians a bad impression but if we have the mentality that by behaving badly, we can prevent a person from coming to Christ or church, do you know thats pride? Because we  actually think that just because of what a human did, a person will not come to God. Our GOD is BIGGER than that man! Amen! He loves everyone of us more than anyone else. He desires everyone of us to come back to HIM more than anyone of us. If your friends had been driven off from church for the time being, why not pray for them and focus on the fact that God loves them more and will deal with them in His timing.<br><br>I am sorry if i sound offensive to you but I am not defending those people. As I said, i used to hate christians too but when I experience the goodness and grace of God, I came to realisation that all we need to do is to do our part  and God will deal with the rest thats beyond us.</div>

You think I am not hurt and I am not sadded? I do, my brudder, i do. But if I were to react to them in the same way, i would not be doing God charged me to do, to show love and grace. I am not perfect, sometimes i do hit back but the point is that, let us who know the truth show the truth, talk the truth and then walk the truth.<br><br>If you are concerned enough, pray for him. As for God, He is watching, even though we are behing computer screens, God knows who are typing everything.

Meaning only if  you put your faith in Jesus Christ and acknowledge Him as saviour and Lord, will you be saved. You can be called a christian, a catholic or whatever, it doesnt matter, as long you acknowledge Jesus Christ as your saviour and lord and believe in Him, you will be saved. The "HIM" however is not a SYMBOLIC word meaning it cannot mean an ything else except Jesus Christ.<br><br>So, we christians did not teach that, it was the BIBLE and God Himself who taught that and if I were to believe in God, I would believe in whatever He says.<br><br>Now, that doesnt mean I go around telling people that they are sure to go hell. I only tell them that Jesus offers a chance to go to heaven.<br><br>I am sure within this topic, its gonna diversify into many other different issues like "Why would a loving God send people to hell?" or "Why is God so unfair to those who did good deeds but never believe in Him?"  and many others.<br><br>I am glad to answer them but all I can tell you is that God is always in his doings. I am sure that If i had a 100 children who had disown me and I say "hey you can come back to this house again if only you just acknowledge me your father again." Thats not too much to ask isnt it? becos if a son or daughter refuse  to call his/her father or acknowledge him, that is his/her own freewill, should the father then allowed them back into the house?</div>
