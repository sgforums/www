            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why the "unequally yoked" is there precisely as a warning.  God did not include that statement to make christians elitists, but to warn christians the situation you be getting into if you go into a relationship with a non-believer.<br><br>Firstly, I would address the issue of relationship. Why have a gf or bf? issit for fun? Issit for love? Issit for testing testing? Issit for experience? Going into a relationship needs to have a long term committment. I firmly encourage all couples before going into a boy/girl relationship to have marriage as an end in mind. That DOES NOT mean all these couples will or must get married in the end. It just means that both parties will put in more effort and commiittment into the relationship.<br><br>And since it is a long term committment going towards marriage, then one should consider all aspects of the other party.  Religious beliefs is a sensitive issue.<br><br>Imagine if I, a very staunch christian, decides to have a non-believer girlfriend right now.  Every sunday I go to church. 2 days of the week, I need to be in church to practice with the band. For a while, maybe its ok, but after sometime, there will be complaints that I dun spend enough time with her and she can not understand why I want to do all these things. At the girlfren stage, maybe things still can be worked out, but if our end is to get married, then it is going to get sticky. What to put in our house? Should I bring my children to be baptised or let my wife bring to temple to be blessed? What if one day, i decide to serve God in a third world country? Will she understand? Furthermore, in the bible, a couple is ONE, both should come as ONE and serve God. Would she do it?<br><br>Maybe people will say, love prevails. But how many times, you see loving couples breaking up because of differences. The fact is that we cant deny human LOVE has limits most of the time.  LOVE don't prevail all the time. Since if we know the possible sticky situation we could be getting into if christians were to get into a relationship with a non-believer, why do it then?<br><br>Secondly, "unequally yoked" is not meant to discriminate. Dun focus on the word "unequal" but on the word "yoke". Yoke is a long wooden cross beam and two bars down from it fitting snugly over two oxen. The modern day example would be the harness of the shire horses to plough or pull a cart.  Thus, to be unequally yoked is to say we are carrying different weights and things on our shoulders. It simply implies that non-believers have on them, a different belief, different directions and values. Thus, since God desires a total committment from christians, it is wise not to enter into a relationship with a person who have a totally different view of God from you.<br><br>I would gladly answer any questions on this but would not entertain mocking of any faith or beliefs of the people here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

That you may not have done the right thing in God's eyes.<br><br>However, my advice to christians who have already non-christian bf/gf to not take extreme actions and break off using God as a reason. We do have to consider the feelings of the other party if we were to do that.<br><br>If you are really serious being faithful to God, i think both you and boyfren should really sit down and talk about it. Talk about that if there is a possibility of him being open to christianity and explore goiong to church and finding out more about the faith and if he wants to, he can put his trust in God like you did. Note that I say discuss, do not put pressure that if he doesnt, you will break up or that you be unhappy....christianity is afterall a free choice.<br><br>If he is open to it, invite him to church and pray that God can touch him and he will come to God willingly one day.<br><br>If he is not open to it and say he will not go to church, then leave it as it is first but continue to pray that he will one day.<br><br>I have to say something not very nice here but it is definitely not a generalisation. If you are TRULY SERIOUS about God, God will lead you to places and things that you will need to do for Him and soon you will discover your priorities in life shifting. Your boyfren may or may not understand why you are changing, but one thing for sure is that when you are serious about God, your perspectives and values will change....and I have seen couples break up becos of this...not becos of God but becos the change that comes in each other.<br><br>Dun be discouraged. Be open to it, talk to your boyfren about ur concerns, dun put any pressure on him and have an open discussion.</div>

Take heart! God loves you!<br><br><span style="color: red;">1 Corinthians 7:12-15<br><br>To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. 14For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.   But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.</span><br><br>HOWEVER, remember that this passage is spoken to<span style="color: red;">christians who are ALREADY MARRIED in the context</span>.  This is <span style="color: red;">NOT</span> a passage to encourage everyone that it is ok to get into a relationship with a non-christian. But if you are already into one, just committ yourself to God, He will help you.</div>

By acknowledging oneself as a Christian, that person also acknowledges that he/she is a sinner. No human* on earth can be without sin. It is not very appropriate for Christians to make non-Christians feel small or undermine their spirituality simply because they are not of the same religion.<br><br>It is a shame to know that Christians while being Christians in their faith, are not practicing, yet making the mistakes the Pharisees were guilty of, esp. complacency [which i believe is the deadliest precursor to sin].</div>
