            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Brief Summary of Points</span></strong><br><br>1. Character<br>- How a person treats himself; which reflects on how he/she treats others, then on how he/she treats his/her partner and then later his children.<br><br>Personality traits are different from character. Examples are being caring, patient, kind..etc... cream of the cake. Character's the substance, which consists of 4 main qualities/points.<br><br>i) Commitment to personal growth<br>- Commitment to God's Word &amp; lifestyle<br>- Placing God first in his/her life<br>- Seeking and trusing God &amp; His Word<br>- Leading an exciting, adventurous &amp; purposeful lifestyle in God<br><br>ii) Able to receive Help &amp; Guidance<br>- Teachability<br>- Openess to help &amp; counselling when crisis arises<br>Therefore, find out ifpartner is as open in this area as u so that it'll not be too late when crisis in the relationship occurs.<br><br>iii) Consciousness of his/her weakness/problem areas<br>- So that your partner will also become aware of them as time passes.<br>- Pride &amp; stubborness in a relationship will turn the whole relationship into a bloody battlefield. <br><br>iv) Setting Personal growth for Real Change<br>- He/she must be determined to change for the better if there're certain areas necessary for it. And it must be a REAL change.<br><br>2a. Emotional Openess<br>- A partner should be able to feel unless he/she's a tin can. And also, say how he/she feels. Being able to express and communicate their feelings.<br>- Ability to say how much u love that person.<br>- Ability to share feelings.<br><br>2b. Emotional Generosity (This trait provides key access to a person's soul)<br>- Of course, not missing out on generous &amp; unconditional love in the relationship.<br>- Ability to show his/her love.<br>- Not Stingy.<br><br>3. Integrity (Walking in truth / represents consistancy of character)<br>- Say what u mean, mean what u say<br>- Do what u mean, mean what u do<br>- Honesty &amp; trustworthiness &amp; reliability<br>- Without this trait, one can never gain respect; let alone a partner<br>- Also honesty in the way one feels<br><br>4. Maturity &amp; Responsibility<br>- Outward life is the reflection of the inward life<br>(Responsibility determines Maturity)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Taking action for any present situations by understanding certain boundaries. It's not a concept, it's an action.<br><br>5. Healthy Self-esteem<br>- Love yourself.<br>(Note: U choose to love a person, not because u have to, but because u want to)<br>- Don't self-abuse. If u r suffering &amp; wanna get out of it, get out of it!<br>- Never let others abuse u. Be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">meek</span>, but not weak.<br>(Being meek is not retaliating quickly when persecuted, rather having grace towards the persecutor. It doesn't means keeping this way for long either, one must fight 4 one's right, when the time comes.) (A wimp doesn't like to take risk or "cause trouble", and always procrastinates, because a wimp feels low about him/herself.)<br><br>6. Positive Attitude Towards Life<br>- Yup. Being optimistic could help. Who likes a hard-core pessimist as a mate?<br><br>7. Personal Chemistry (This isn't a trait)<br>[Songs of Solomon 4:9] <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> refer<br>- Are you attracted to the other party?<br>- Is there a bond?<br><br>This is NOT a trait. Either you have it, or don't even have it.<br>It's very hard to have a successful lasting relationship without personal chemistry (physical attraction).<br><br>HOWEVER, personal chemistry need not have to be instantaneous.<br>It could also take time to build. So... that's a good news. Remain as friends; go out in a group and then decide and from there, choose your potential mate!<br><br>Good Luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
