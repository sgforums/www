Don't confuse christian and roman catholism. Its two different thing. Catholics worship mother mary, christians only believe that mary is a human, hand picked by God to carry baby Jesus. But there is only one God. We don't worship mary.<br><br>IN this case, your quesiton can be directed to the catholics. Maybe they can answer you as to why is that so. J.C. died for us. No such thing as unlimited grace i think, just "sufficient" (more than enough) grace. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When one takes the Bible literally, anyone would be able to understand that Christians are not to bow down to any man-made idols and images. Fair enough. When we try to take a step futher, God had made this commandment when the Israelites were very unfaithful, evident in the earlier part of the Old Testaments. Almost in every few pages, people started to whine and complain about God, especially the part where the people said they preferred to die under the hands of the Egyptians than to die out in the desert due to starvation etc... Thus the people turned to idolatry, and thus, sinned against God.<br><br>Idolatry meant idol worship, worshipping of the fake gods etc. In present times, this extends into other vices including idolatry of pornagraphy, fornication, materalism or basically the "worshipping" of material goods or gratification. In another words, this translates into treating material or others things above God: this is what is really meant be "idolatry".<br><br>If you are not convinced, do read through the old testaments, and what the fake gods represented. Bottomline is that, idolatry is simply treating other things higher than God himself, which means the lack of faith and allowing oneself to believe in gods, superstition instead of the true Higher Power/God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by saintboy:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey man. Don't confuse christian and roman catholism. Its two different thing. Catholics worship mother mary, christians only believe that mary is a human, hand picked by God to carry baby Jesus. But there is only one God. We don't worship mary.<br>IN this case, your quesiton can be directed to the catholics. Maybe they can answer you as to why is that so. J.C. died for us. No such thing as unlimited grace i think, just "sufficient" (more than enough) grace. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div></blockquote>Hmm...sometimes little knowledge is a bit dangerous, and in this case, ignorance of certain issues are indeed damaging to the overall intellectual endeavor.<br><br>In the first place, Christianity, for about 1500 years since the advent of Christ into the world, via the Incarnation; has been Catholic. To label Catholicism as antithetical to Christianity is a false dichotomy. Christianity has been Catholic all along, for about 1500 years C.E (the Common Era), until the Protest-ant reformation of Martin Luther, whose central tenet of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sola Scriptura</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sola Fide</span> ripped through the ranks of Christendom, introducing the private interpretation of Scripture to the world.<br><br>Secondly, Catholics do not <span style="font-style: italic;">worship </span>Mary. This is a misconception of many, not only Protestants but lay catholics (ill-informed ones, who are many) as well.<br><br>I challenge you to seek all the creeds you can find, all the catechisms of the Catholic Church you can peruse, and show me a blatant assertion by the Church that as Catholic Christians, they "worship" (revere) Mary, as God.<br><br>There is a difference between worship and respect, which is fundamental to the understanding between what is Protestant and what is Catholic. In Catholic dogma, the veneration of the saints, which include Mary, is of respect and honor, NOT worship. Catholics adore only God, and they know and realize that only through Christ, His blood shed on the Cross, which redeems man from his sins. That is worship.<br><br>Catholic dogma do not attribute salvation to Mary.<br><br>I got to go now..any queries will have to be dealt with some other time.<br><br>In His Majesty's Service,<br>Soli Deo Gloria<br>To God Alone be the Glory.</div>
