            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by dumbdumb!:<br><strong>"thats the thing.. if she can deliver ppl from death, that doesn't validate the death of Jesus, she isn't a diety. it contradicts everything in the bible right from the torah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> "</strong> Catholics are supposed to know that the subject of worship is God, or the Holy Trinity, not Mother Mary<br><br><strong>"plus, she shouldn't be the subject of preaching and teaching in the first place. again, she isn't diety. tats why."</strong> Correct<br><br><strong>"whether she remained a virgin isn't really clear, cuz there was one part in the bible in matthiew, where Jesus turned wine to blood? the bible said that mary and his brothers were looking for him. but since brothers could mean anything, lets leave that out since its unclear."</strong> Jesus had many names, Son of Man, Jesus of Nazareth...Son of David. Assuming Jesus as human, Jesus still is not a direct decendant of David, yet he had this name. His cousins are therefore also sons of David. Thus, the sons of David with Jesus included are considered brothers and sisters. You'll have to research into the Jewish history to convince yourself.<br><br><strong>"my bible doesn't tell me she is queen over all things"</strong> neither does the catholic version of the bible, from your context. This i assume is found the Catechism. In the Catholic context, she is regarded as queen because she is one without the orginal sin, but more convincingly that she had followed and obeyed God all her life [something that almost no other human can do, with humility and obedience]. The book of Luke, the book of Revelations had mentioned about her. She was also present during the Pentecost.<br><br><strong>"so why Catechism keeps making her out to be diety"</strong> please read again, Mother Mary is regarded as a saint, not a god/goddess. The trouble with people is that people don't listen and bite into each word that is being said. That is why misunderstandings arise everything we speak in haste. Quick to listen slow to speak.<br><br><strong>"...when she [Mary] is the subject of preaching and worship she prompts the faithful to come to her Son..." (Vatican Council II, p. 420). </strong> Read this sentence again. This literally means that when Mother Mary becomes the subject of preaching and worship, she points to the faithful to her son, Jesus Christ. Meaning that Mary is not god, but points to the faithful that Christ is the one, the Messiah.<br><br>Please note that there are many Catholics who are not very "educated with Catechism of the Catholic Church", and often tells others the wrong things, practices the wrong stuff etc... Before fingers starts to shoot around, there are just as many Christians who are not very biblically educated and many things can happen, big or small, minor or not. For example, there are Catholics who still think that Mother Mary is a god. And the truth is, she isn't. These people may be either misinformed, stubborn to change their belief, no one correcting their way of thinking...<br><br>Nobody can guarantee who goes where, not Mother Mary, not the priests, not your pastors, not us, not anyone but Christ. Some ppl hav the habit of wearing the brown scapula which i think is the one you're talking about. This is for ppl who are devoted to Mother Mary who mediates ppl to Christ. Neither Mary nor the saints hav any power to answer prayers but intercedes for the ppl who pray to them. Devotion to Mary means to devote to God, while Mary herself is not god, due to her intercession for the people and pointing them to Christ. The key word here is that Mary is not god.<br><br><strong>"so let me ask u, Jesus die for wat? for fun issit? "</strong> Do note that statements like that easily provoke ppl into a fight with you. Catholic celebrate the holy Mass, during the Liturgy of the Eucharist, to show to the ppl the love of Christ for us all when he gave himself up for us. The spiritual bread is meant to nourish the spirituality of the people who partakes of it, and grow in love for Christ and in remembrance of his holy sacrifice. It is not for fun.<br><br>One meaning of the crucifix is to remind Catholics how much Jesus had suffered in his own free will for our salvation. It also serve to remind that the way of Christ [being Christian] is the way to the crucifix [meaning that being Christian is to die with the sufferings but rise again in glory]. The way to the crucifix is the way of suffering, and to do it the way Christ did, to suffer [to carry our own crosses], to face our own deaths. This, is being Christian.<br><br>To end, it is good that people question when in doubt and ask around for the right answers, to search for the truth. Please, do ask ppl nicely, varying attitudes can vary the answers being given [when one is provoked, the mind becomes unclear]. God bless.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see your point dumbdumb now that you had mentioned your past experiences with the catholics. I'm sure we all can a healthy discussion here with adrenaline levels lowered. When i had posted the above, i didn't not mean it to be at all offensive, neither was it all defensive. What i had stated is what the church is trying to teach. Note that the people don't necessary practices what that were preached, that explains the "bad" practices and i'm not going to defend for these people. As you said, the catholic went on to preach to you and your family how "superior" catholicism was, if i were you i wouldn't be at all impressed [i would probably have the very same reaction as you did].<br><br>Do understand that humans are not perfect and can make very stupid mistakes from time to time. What the caths had done to you, were wrong. First of all, we are also "driving out demons in the name of Christ", so are all of us. Like the disciples in the Gospels, they are comparing with each other from time to time, like what the churches and denominations are doing now. It is wrong to put one another down. The ideal approach is to first understand that people's actions had due to many factors, the church is not the only one. Just like now, i'm trying to let you see what the catholic church is trying to teach as nicely possible. I neither want to provoke/antagonize you nor want you to misunderstand the catholic church. The catholic church not not any superior to other churches, we are all one and the same.<br><br>While i can't explain in detail what Mary is about, esp the part about her being without the original sin which you had well pointed out, i'm sure about a few things...<br><br>We are all Christians and are thus followers of Christ, that makes us brothers and sisters. And as the name suggests, catholics worship God, not Mary, thus it is wrong to worship The Lady.<br>I can't understand what really happened to you in the past but i do know it is bad from the sentiments i feel in your posts. Difficult as it is, don't let hate take over, it is a burden and clouds your vision, when seeing is not always believing. I had my share of bad experiences with other churches, but i know these people approached in a very insensitive way and many other reasons. Godspeed.<br></div>
