            <div class='col-md body'>In the commandments we are not to forget we all have to honor the fathers and mothers as they are the ones who bring us up. Jesus has great respect for his mother, and Mother Mary is not like any other humans. We all fail sometime or another and refuse wilfully to the word of God. Instead, Mother Mary said yes when angel Gabriel asked her if she were to conceive Jesus, and all her life she had dedicated to God.<br><br>In the same context, we all also have great respect for great people like Ghandi, the Dalai Lama, and Mother Mary like them, ordinary people but has great faith in themselves or God most importantly. Even if she isn't the mother of Jesus, if we respect other people like your friends, Dalai Lama, Confucious, so much more should we respect Mother Mary who stayed by Jesus and God all her life. Even if she's not God, we shouldn't be insulting her, calling her names. What has Our Lady done to deserve this?<br><br>Even when people disapprove of the worship of Mary, it is the people who are doing the worship, not Mary. She did not allow herself to act on the behalf of God, but rather, always pointing to the people that the Messiah is Jesus. In John 2:5, Mother Mary said to the servents, "Do what he tells you". Like John the Baptist, Mother Mary points to Jesus who is the subject, not herself. Mary does not answer prayers, but like the Wedding at Cana, she speaks to Jesus of the needs of the people. But it is ultimately Jesus to do what is best.<br><br>Heng@ here is very right <strong>"your atttitude is the one which makes me doubt if u understand the true meaning of christianity.... understanding, tolerance... love thy fellow man..... because u sure sound pretty insolent... no matter what, remember u are being rude to his mother, by degratorily calling her "mum mary" so it fails to convince me how much u respect him....... if u are a christian, start behaving like one for "Christ"'s sake.</strong><br><br>dumbdumb, allow me to remind you that it the Catholic theology that you are not convinced. To find the truth is to search into the Catholic theology, the Catechism, and look into these with a neutral point of view. Tackle the ball, not the man. <strong>"catholics cannot validate this with the word of the bible? as usual.. nothign they do can really validate anything. blah"</strong> Adapting a "religio-centric" point of view is going to mar your vision and not going to help things. If one starts saying things without ernestly finding out what that is closest to the truth, isn't this to "being a false witness against thy neighbor?"<br><br>If you really wish to know the truth, asking for the truth is the way, not to attack the faithful like that. Ask and answer yourself honestly if you have been fair making derogatory statements like that. I can see that you're obviously in a foul mood and probably angry over something. These are the times that as Christians [whether one is Protestant/Catholic], when we have to practice restrain and avoid hurting other people out of spite. Not that it help others, more importantly, by practicing restrain out of love in the name of God, we ourselves learn to free ourselves of hatred and many negative feelings, we change for the better as a person.<br><br>The commandments are commandments of love, and free us from our own bondages. Addiction to alcohol, sex, unnecessary anger, following the commandments as closely possible helps ourselves. When we are slowly being freed of these bondages, we also become joyful [though not necessarily happier], and God will see our efforts and reward us accordingly.<br><br>Neither am i a strong Christian, esp when i'm conscious of my sinfulness yet have little power and will to overcome and truly repent. But stay in faith, hang on to God, things will definitely turn for the better in ways we don't often notice. Everyone is suffering, that is only through God can our burdens be lightened. Godspeed.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>too bad most catholics think mary did.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>nothing against mary. really.. she was one who obeyed God, more than i did. but she ain't a diety. and i sure ain't gonna go find "saint joseph" in the church backyard made of limestone and ask him things.<br><br>and confession of sins have nothing to do with mary, so i dun see why i should recite her name 1000 times everytime i post in sgforums<br><br>and neither am i praying to her, cuz she is some "interccesor" between me and jesus, on the basis that jesus would be more willing to listen to her than me, becuz she is his mum..<br><br>he's the interccessor and i already seldom pray to him liaoz.<br><br>and i'm not going to turn into some braggart who can only tell others how many churches my denomination has all over the world, and how many books i can type out in 1 minute  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>oh. and i also refuse to believe that mary was the one who crushed satan, as many catholics told me, that cuz mary gv birth to j.c. and if she didn't, he wouldn't have been borned. so she deserved the title.<br><br>so i guess, if i make a big impact in the kingdom, 100 years down the road, i should expect ppl worshipping me, then tell others, actually they dun worship me, but cuz i deserve the title and saying "hail dumbdumb" for sins?<br><br></div>

It does not mean Catholic theology do not subscribe to the Resurrection of our Lord and Savior. Besides, it was Catholic theologians - the Early Church Fathers, in one of their councils, which affirm the doctrine as essential to the Faith.<br><br>This is what many Protestants assume, and think, contrary to all reason. To bring the argument the other way, does that mean Protestants do not believe in the atonement and death of Christ? Nay.<br><br>Some also accuse the Catholic Church of idolatry, via the figure of Christ on the cross.<br><br>Let's see. Sometimes, an ignorance of history can be dangerous.<br><br>During the medieval ages, literacy was sparse and few, amongst the peoples of the world. Prior to the Gutenberg press, there wasn't the mass distribution of literature which we know and have today. One of the many practical reasons in which the figure of Christ was carved onto the cross was to provide a <span style="font-style: italic;">pictorial </span> understanding of the atonement of Christ to the masses, who cannot read. Thus the many paintings and icons we see in a Catholic church. They not only add aesthetic value to experiencing spirituality, they served as a picture "bible" to the illiterate masses of those times.<br><br>The "3-D" carving of the figure of Christ aids the blind as well, in feeling the actual figure of Jesus, helping them to visualize the idea of the atonement better.<br><br>One other thing. Many assume that the Mass is a reiteration of the Sacrifice of Christ. This the Church disagrees too. In the catechism of the Church, one can easily read the denouncement of a repeated sacrifrice, which the Epistle to the Hebrews forbade, for Christ has finished the sacrifice, once and for all. Thus perhaps the use of a crucifix, or so the protestants believe.<br><br>That is not true. The mass is a memorial to perpetuate the Sacrifice of Christ, more of a larger scale <span style="font-style: italic;">Eucharist </span>(Communion). It does not express the notion of an unfinished work of Calvary which has to be repeated.<br><br></div>

The veneration of Mary and the saints (<span style="font-style: italic;">hyperdulia</span>) are interpreted in terms of honor and respect.<br><br>Anyway, in dealing with the above quotes, let me try my best to clarify certain issues.<br><br>What you have read, of the above, do not teach or imply the divinity of Mary. They are part of what the Church teaches as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Marian dogmas. </span> I know that many of the concepts are difficult to digest and understand, especially when as a Protestant, we have already uphold certain bias and perspectives already. Do keep an open mind in attempting to comprehend them.<br><br>The marian dogmas are briefly:<br><br>1) The <span style="font-style: italic;">perpetual virginity </span>of Mary<br>2) The <span style="font-style: italic;">Immaculate Conception </span><br>3) The <span style="font-style: italic;">Assumption </span><br>4) The veneration of Mary as <span style="font-style: italic;">Queen of heaven</span><br>5) Mary as Mother of God (<span style="font-style: italic;">theotokos</span>)<br><br>The Catholic church hold that Mary, even after giving birth to Jesus, remained a virgin till her demise from the earth.<br><br>As a Protestant, our tendency to reject this doctrine holds from a few issues. One is our propensity to uphold the primacy of Christ in our worship, by putting all others to a secondary status. We want to show that Mary, however, blessed and highly favored she is, was simply a human vessel which God used. That's all.<br><br>However, there are a few objections to the Protestant view. Besides, Martin Luther himself, the father of the Reformation, subcribed to the Catholic view.<br><br>1) When the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary, and announced to her that she will bore a son, who will be Savior to her people, note that at that time, she was already bethrothed to Joseph. Note also that Gabriel's first announcement did not include the supernatural mode in which she will conceive. That comes later. Now, it is very natural, when someone comes to you, and tell you that you will have a child (esp. when you are already engaged), that you will assume that the child would arrive via natural means, that you will get married to your fiance, and then have marital relations, in which you will conceive that child.<br><br>But notice what Mary responded? She told the angel Gabriel that how is it possible that she can conceive..since she is a virgin? Of course she was then still a virgin. But she is going to be married to Joseph. Why the discrepancy? Only then did Gabriel told her the supernatural manner in which she will conceive the child.<br><br>Thus the implication from Scripture that there was a vow she had made to God, a vow of virginity before God.<br><br>2) Is it natural to remain a virgin after marriage? Hmm..it is not normal and typical, but nothing disproves the notion that it cannot be done. It is still a normal functioning family, with Joseph leading and taking care of the family. Marriage do not presume conjugal relations. Besides, according to Catholic teaching, Mary is a type of the Ark of the Covenant. Just as the Ark is set apart for God's use (noone can touch it and live), to contain the word of God and the glory of God, Mary is the Ark, used by God to contain the living Word of God made flesh. Thus it is a natural consequence of that sanctification to even set apart her body for holy use.<br><br>3) Another common objection by Protestants would be the use of the word "firstborn". The bible uses the word "firstborn" in describing the child Jesus - <span style="font-style: italic;">Mary's firstborn</span>. Protestants would always assume that the word "firstborn" would presume many more children. But that is an assumption which has no warrant at all. To the Jewish people, one's first child is the firstborn, regardless of whether or not there would be anymore children. The child who <span style="font-style: italic;">opened up the womb </span>would be the Firstborn. Thus the word does not disprove anything.<br><br>4) The bible also used the word "brethren" and "brothers" to describe many of Jesus' acquaintances. Now, the word brother, or brethren, has many meanings in the Bible. Not just the conjugal, per se. Brethren can speak of cousins, relatives, fellow Jew, fellow Christian, etc etc. This still does not disprove conclusively the Catholic view. Note that everytime these alleged brothers of the Lord were named, they were so called in relation to Jesus - "brethren of the Lord". "the brothers of Jesus", etc etc. Nowhere can we find <span style="font-style: italic;">Mary's sons</span>, or <span style="font-style: italic;">Mary's children</span>. In relation to Mary, there is always only one son - Jesus Himself.<br><br>5) Now, let's assume that Jesus had brothers. They would all be younger than He was, right? When the family went to Jerusalem for the Passover feast, as depicted in the Gospel of Luke, only Jesus the boy, was present. He was already 12. Now, in Jewish custom, they do not leave any of their children behind when participating in the Feast. But in Luke's account, it is apparent that only the boy Jesus was present with them. This could mean that if he indeed has a brother, there would be at least a 12 year age gap. It is obvious during that time, Mary has not other children.<br>Now, most of Jesus' acquaintances, as well as cousins, such as James and John, Judas (not Iscariot), etc, who were labelled "brethren" in the bible, were of similar age with Jesus. Besides, Jesus died at around 32. He started His ministry at age 30, estimately. This would mean his next younger brother would be 18 (12 years difference). Obviously, many of Jesus' "brethren" were not of such tender age then.<br>One other point. Jewish culture forbids the younger from giving advice to the elder. That is disrespect. But we can read in Scripture incidents whereby Jesus was receiving advice from his "brethren", which implied they were of older age. This cannot be, if they were biological brothers - as Jesus was the oldest, the firstborn. (I cannot recall the account firsthand. But trust me on this. Check it up. Use a concordance even.)<br><br>I will continue with the other Marian dogmas in another post.</div>

He is a seminary friend of Matatics, who first examined the claims of Catholicism, and sought his friend (Matatics) for help.
