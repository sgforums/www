            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Romans 11<br><strong>The Remnant of Israel</strong><br>1I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 2God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about ElijahÂ—how he appealed to God against Israel: 3"Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me"? 4And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal." 5So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 6And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.<br><br>7What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened, 8as it is written:<br>"God gave them a spirit of stupor,<br>eyes so that they could not see<br>and ears so that they could not hear,<br>to this very day." 9And David says:<br>"May their table become a snare and a trap,<br>a stumbling block and a retribution for them.<br>10May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,<br>and their backs be bent forever."<br><br><strong>Ingrafted Branches</strong><br>11Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. 12But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!<br><br>13I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry 14in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. 15For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 16If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.<br><br>17If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, 18do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. 19You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in." 20Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. 21For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.<br><br>22Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. 23And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 24After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!<br><br><strong>All Israel Will Be Saved</strong><br>25I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. 26And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written:<br>"The deliverer will come from Zion;<br>he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.<br>27And this is my covenant with them<br>when I take away their sins."<br><br>28As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, 29for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable. 30Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, 31so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. 32For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.<br><br><strong>Doxology</strong><br>33Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<br>How unsearchable his judgments,<br>and his paths beyond tracing out!<br>34"Who has known the mind of the Lord?<br>Or who has been his counselor?"<br>35"Who has ever given to God,<br>that God should repay him?"<br>36For from him and through him and to him are all things.<br>To him be the glory forever! Amen.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The verses in Romans 11 show very clearly that Replacement theology does not and will not hold as Yahweh has a plan of salvation for His FIRSTBORN.<br><br>In Roman's 11 Shaul also admonishes the then gentile converts not to become too arrogant and prideful and this is something that the modern church needs to check itself on. Especially in their misunderstanding of the Jewish people and their role in Yahweh's great plan. They are most certainly not done away with and have most definitely not passed their use by date.<br><br>In John 4:22 Yeshua says that SALVATION IS FROM THE JEWS. Note the use of present tense here. It is not past. So as it was then, it is today, salvation is from the Jews.<br><br>In Rom 9:4, Shaul talks about the privileges of the Israelites. The first namely being their adoption as sons. In Exodus 4:22 Yahweh Himself says that Israel is HIS FIRSTBORN. The interesting thing to note here as well is that the tense that Shaul uses to describe the unbelieving Israelites is in the present tense.<br><br>The people of Israel are special to Yahweh. ISRAEL IS AND REMAINS THE CHOSEN OF YAHWEH. Their rejection is not complete and is not forever.<br><br>The way Yahweh treats Israel and continues to treat Israel shows us the relationship between the Father and the firstborn son. It shows us how Yahweh will treat us likewise.<br><br>When we see how Yahweh deals with Israel, we see how Yahweh deals with a son. We also will see how Yahweh will deal with us. Sometimes the love will be soft sometimes it will be tough love. The faithfulness of Yahweh to the Israel  shows us how wonderful it is to be a son of Yahweh.<br><br>Yeshua came and shows us what true sonship is. But because He never sinned, He cannot show us what it is like to be a son of Yahweh who is out of fellowship with Yahweh. Whilst most of Israel is in unbelief, but it will not always stay that way. The parable of the prodigal son applies to Israel. Luke 15. The parable of the prodigal son shows us YahwehÂ’s relationship with Israel. It shows the fathers love and compassion.<br><br>The Father of Israel is patiently waiting for His firstborn to return from the world. Jer 31:9, Yahweh is a father to Israel and Epharim is my firstbornÂ…<br><br>What a party that Yahweh has prepared for the nation of Israel. Yahweh is waiting for His firstborn son to come home.<br><br>The law given to Israel was like a tutor given to Israel so that the son may learn the fathers lessons well. Israel will learn from the law through the tutor of the law, and the purpose of the law is Yeshua. When all Israel is saved, the Jewish people will be our brothers in Yeshua.<br><br>When Israel comes into their fullness, there will be a sweeping revival that will sweep through the world. Israel will have a significant role in the salvation of the world. Salvation was,is and will be of the Jews.<br><br>If Yahweh is not finished with Israel, then we can be sure that if Yahweh has chosen you, He will not unadopt you and you will forever be His son. Only you can walk away from Yahweh, He will not walk away from you.<br><br>Shalom!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>All people can be saved via Israel's Yahweh  </strong><br><br>The following portions from Isaiah show how intensely the God of Israel is involved with living creatures on earth and the well-being and salvation of all of mankind (verse 22), not just Israel.<br><br>Isaiah 45:18 For this is what the LORD says--he who created the heavens, he is God; he who fashioned and made the earth, he founded it; he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited--he says: "I am the LORD, and there is no other. 19 I have not spoken in secret, from somewhere in a land of darkness; I have not said to Jacob's descendants, 'Seek me in vain.' I, the LORD, speak the truth; I declare what is right. 20 "Gather together and come; assemble, you fugitives from the nations. Ignorant are those who carry about idols of wood, who pray to gods that cannot save. 21 Declare what is to be, present it--let them take counsel together. Who foretold this long ago, who declared it from the distant past? Was it not I, the LORD? And there is no God apart from me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none but me. 22 "Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth ("Let all in the world look to me for salvation" - Living Bible); for I am God, and there is no other. 23 By myself I have sworn, my mouth has uttered in all integrity a word that will not be revoked: Before me every knee will bow; by me every tongue will swear. 24 They will say of me, 'In the LORD alone are righteousness and strength.'" All who have raged against him will come to him and be put to shame. 25 But in the LORD all the descendants of Israel will be found righteous and will exult.<br><br>In Isaiah 45:25, however we find a qualification for the salvation of non-Jews: "But in the LORD all the descendants of Israel will be found righteous and will exult." It is clear that non-Jews can only be saved when they become part of Israel. It is in line with Ephesians 2:12, Remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. ...... Ephesians 3:6 This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.<br><br>Israel's physical restoration will lead to gentiles (the rest of mankind in general) seeking God, as well as Christians (those called by my name) who had already found God (verse 17).<br><br>Acts 15:12 Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring how many miracles and wonders God had worked through them among the Gentiles. 13 And after they had become silent, James answered, saying, "Men and brethren, listen to me: 14 Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name. 15 And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:<br>16'After this I will return And will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down; I will rebuild its ruins, And I will set it up; 17 So that the rest of mankind may seek the LORD, Even all the Gentiles who are called by My name, Says the LORD who does all these things.' NKJV<br><br>Christians also seeking God could be due to general apostasy that will occur in the end-times, but also in our opinion, to confusion among gentile believers due to God seeming to favor and be pre-occupied with the Jews and Israel although they hadn't yet acknowledge Messiah. If we are correct in our assessment, there will therefore be Christians among the ten "from the nations" who want to join the Jews in the following prophecy:<br>"In those days ten men from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, `Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you.'" Zechariah 9:23.<br></div>

Lamentably, his position was completely disregarded by historic Christendom in the furtherance of political and economic interests vested in the temporal and ecclesiastical hierarchies of every generation, including our own. (Our commentaries to these passages are italicized within block parentheses.)<br>"For I speak to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my office . . . For if the first dough be holy, the whole loaf is also holy; and if the root be holy [IsraelÂ’s sacred history and destiny,] so are the branches [individual Jews]. And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree [Gentile] wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness [blessings] of the olive tree, boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. Thou wilt say then, Â‘The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.Â’ Thou sayest well! Because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear; for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest He also spare not thee."1<br><br>The Vatican Council II BishopsÂ’ Conference recognized that the historic infrastructure of European anti-Semitism is retraceable in no small measure to one specific doctrine of early ecclesiastical, residually Marcionite, dogma, supersessionism, a dogma unchanged by the Protestant Reformation. Popularly called Replacement Theology, the doctrine holds that Christendom has become the chosen of God and that the Jewish people are accursed, condemned and cut off from a meaningful relationship with believing mankind, with all that is divine and, indeed, with its own literary and spiritual past. Replacement Theology is demonstrable as a false doctrine against which even from the beginning the early Church is warned: "Be not carried away with divers and strange doctrines."2<br><br>JesusÂ’ own teaching must be reconsidered and applied against such historic "strange doctrines." To reapply JesusÂ’ timeless message self-critically we may cite:<br>"Thus have ye made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, Â‘This people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth, and honoreth Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me, But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."3<br><br>Moreover, Replacement Theology has perennially been the banner of all the crusades, inquisitions, pogroms and ultimately the Holocaust itself against the Jewish people. JesusÂ’ message was too often forgotten: "Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."4<br><br>PaulÂ’s position unmistakably affirms the scriptural relationship of believers to Jews, the people of Jesus. It is that of a wild olive branch grafted into GodÂ’s own olive tree, Israel. In this way only can believers truly understand themselves as Spiritual Israel, maintaining a distinct role in the divine plan for human history, yet fully sharing in the hardships and rejoicing in the successes of the Jewish people as an integral part themselves of IsraelÂ’s sacred destiny. Indeed, it is this scriptural realignment that is the very heart of Olive Branch Theology, overdue since the "parting of the ways" almost 2,000 years ago.<br><br>Continued...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All Israel Shall be Saved Part2<br><br>Contemporary academic theologians are ever more acknowledging that PaulÂ�fs writings have been grossly misunderstood, and worse, perhaps willfully misread, throughout the ages. With the keen eye of doctrinal deconstructionism we shall now consider one of the many examples, PaulÂ�fs specific guidelines on Jewish-Christian relations.<br><br>"For I brethren would not have you to be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits: that a kind of obstinacy has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. And then<br>all Israel shall be saved [it will happen] as it is written: Â�eThere shall come out of Zion the deliverer, and shall turn away impiety from Jacob. For this is My covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins.Â�f " 5<br><br>Look at this closely. Romans 11: 26b cites the Septuagint Greek text of Isaiah 59:20: "And the deliverer shall come for ZionÂ�fs sake, and shall turn away impiety from Jacob." However, Romans 11:27 only partly paraphrases the Septuagint text of Isaiah 59:21: "And this shall be My covenant with them, said the Lord: Â�eMy spirit which is upon you, and the words which I have put in your mouth, shall never fail from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your seed, for the Lord has spoken it, henceforth and for ever.Â�f " 6<br><br>The Masoretic Hebrew text of Isaiah 59:21 makes plain that the Greek words, ho Kyrios, "The Lord," in this verse translates the Shem haMephorash, the "Tetragrammaton," (Y/H/W/H). PaulÂ�fs Greek inerrantly conveys his understanding of the divine intent when he alters Isaiah 59:21 to drive home his point, ". . . when I [God] take away their sins." Paul could have rephrased Isaiah to read, "When I cause their sins to be taken away by others," but he carefully and specifically used here the Greek first person singular future of the middle voice, aphÃ©Â¬mai. The nuance is expressible in Latin and German with the "dative of reference" and means: "When I take away for My own purpose their sins." Paul states here bluntly that God and God alone will take away IsraelÂ�fs sins; and it will be for His own purposes that God and God alone does it, specifically, that He may be "sanctified in them in the sight of many nations"7<br><br>On this point all other Biblical proof texts concur: it is God alone, and no extrinsic, man-made ecclesiastical body, authority, or representative member who will "redeem and save" Israel.8 "Let Israel hope in the Eternal [Y/H/W/H], for with the Eternal [Y/H/W/H] there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption. And He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities." 9<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All Israel Shall be Saved Part3<br><br>At a sublime moment in our not too distant future, through the dynamics of restoring ChristianityÂ¡Â¯s Hebraic roots, we will all yet come to understand PaulÂ¡Â¯s existentially authentic meaning. It will no longer be the false doctrine of supersessionism, Replacement Theology, that will be taught throughout the Christian world, but PaulÂ¡Â¯s original, scripturally sound, insight into the Godly relationship between Gentiles, the believers in Jesus, and Jews, the family of Jesus. Abraham himself taught and practiced a ministry of hospitality; he never shut the door on any guest. Neither should we. However, Paul teaches us that not until "the fullness of the gentiles be come in" should anyone think to actively interfere with GodÂ¡Â¯s special care and concern, His own timetable, for His people, Israel. These words of Paul reverberate with confidence in GodÂ¡Â¯s ultimate fulfillment of His own plans beyond every human calculation and endeavor. Cannot Spiritual Israel share this faith and vision of "the Apostle to the Gentiles" in a loving relationship with JesusÂ¡Â¯ own Jewish people? It is very much as Roger Cardinal Etchegaray of Marseilles taught at the Plenary Session of the Synod of Roman Catholic Bishops of Reconciliation, Rome, October 4, 1983:<br><br>"Is not this connection, which can only be lived in a peaceful tension, one of the elements of the dynamism of the history of salvation? As in the parable, it recalls that neither of the two sons can gain possession of the entire inheritance; each one is for the other, without jealousy, a witness to the gratuitousness of the FatherÂ¡Â¯s mercy. It is also a demanding emulation between the one who awaits a messiah to come and the one who awaits his return. Franz Rosenzweig, after quoting the midrash which says: Â¡Â®At the death of a Jew, he will only be asked one question: did you hope for redemption?Â¡Â¯ used to add: Â¡Â®All other questions are for you ChristiansÂ¨CFrom now until then let us prepare ourselves together in faithfulness to appear before the heavenly Judge!Â¡Â¯ "<br><br>At that moment in our future when the Restoration will have become a paramount, world-wide reality, we will then understand the esoteric meaning for both Christians and JewsÂ¨C"to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile"Â¨Cresident in the verses penned so long ago by John exiled on the island of Patmos: "And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: Â¡Â®Great and marvelous are Thy works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of Saints! Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? For Thou only art holy. For all nations shall come and worship before Thee for Thy judgments are made manifest.Â¡Â¯ "10<br>To make certain his meaning is not misunderstood, Paul concludes his explanation of this issue with these words: "Concerning the Gospel they are enemies for your sake [because of you, not because of the Jewish people.] But concerning the election [as specifically chosen by God for their unceasing role in human history], they are beloved for the fathersÂ¡Â¯ sakes [GodÂ¡Â¯s Promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob]. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance [God will never go back on His word]. And were it otherwise, to what confidence, to what hope, could any hold fast?11<br><br><strong>"And all Israel will be saved"Â¨Call in GodÂ¡Â¯s good time and by God alone. Until then those consecrated to Restoring the "Ways of the Lord" to the Body of the Christ have a world of work to be done "until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in."12</strong><br><br>Dr. Charles Bryant-Abraham is a widely-published scholar of Biblical Hebrew, Imperial and middle Aramaic, Syriac, KoinÃ�Â‹reek, and Ecclesiastical Latin.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>STOP IN ORDER TO ADVANCE<br><br>Shabbat shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>Â“If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, From doing your pleasure on My holy day, And call the Sabbath a delight, The holy day of Yahveh honorable, And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, Nor finding your own pleasure, Nor speaking your own words,  Then you shall delight yourself in Yahveh; And I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth, And feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father. The mouth of Yahveh has spoken.Â” Isaiah 58:13,14<br><br>Yom Hakippurim, The Day of Atonement is the holiest day in The Hebrew calendar. It is called a Â“Shabbat of ShabbatsÂ”. Shabbat is the day of rest when we stop from all normal activities and fellowship with YAH (God) and with each other. Every Shabbat we are required to Â“Stop (or cease) from our own works and to enter into rest. We are also commanded to have a Â“Holy ConvocationÂ” that means a special gathering of believers to worship Yahveh. In Hebrew the word Shabbat means Â“to sit, to dwell or to go on strikeÂ” in other words to STOP Â“business as usualÂ”.<br><br>And Yahveh spoke to Moses, saying: Â“Also the tenth day of this seventh month shall be the Day of Atonement. It shall be a holy convocation for you; you shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to Yahveh. And you shall do no work on that same day, for it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before Yahveh your God. For any person who is not afflicted in soul on that same day shall be cut off from his people. And any person who does any work on that same day, that person I will destroy from among his people. You shall do no manner of work; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. It shall be to you a sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict your souls; on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall celebrate your sabbath.Â” Leviticus 23:26-32<br><br>As we read the above scriptures about Yom Hakippurim, The Day of Atonement we notice that this is a STATUTE FOREVER so no man has the rights to cancel it. This day will continue being a Shabbat of Shabbats throughout our generations. We can clearly see that the emphasis is on halting, ceasing, stopping and afflicting. When we read in Hebrew about afflicting it always means FASTING. In this case the whole nation is called to prayer and fasting for an entire day beginning from the sunset of the 9th of Tishrei (the seventh month in the Biblical calendar) to sunset on the 10th of Tishrei. Just like we are required to STOP all activities besides prayer and worship, we are required to STOP eating and drinking. In other words all of our being is summoned into The Presence of Yahveh! It is so serious not to stop everything that the Word tells us that such person that does not heed to this commandment will be Â“cut offÂ” or excommunicated from the People of Israel and with it from the Covenant Promises. So, Yom Hakippurim is a day to do a 24 hour prayer/worship watch unto The King of Kings. In Israel the whole country stops and there are no cars on the roads. The children go out on the streets with their skates and bicycles because there is no danger of being run over. All shops are closed and most of the people fast and spend most of the day in the synagogues in prayer and worship.<br><br>continued...</div>
