            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>The Sabbath in the Age to Come</strong></span><br><br>God created the Sabbath for mankind (Mark 2:27), and there will yet come a time when all mankind will keep God's Sabbath.<br><br>The Bible speaks of God's Kingdom as being established on earth when Jesus Christ returns to rule as "King of kings and Lord of lords" (Revelation 11:15; 19:11-16). In addition to ruling over sons of God who will be changed to spirit beings and rule with Christ in the Kingdom of God at the time of His second coming, Jesus will rule as Head of a literal government over physical nations on earth (Psalm 22:27, 28; 72:1-11; Daniel 2:34, 35; Zechariah 14:8, 9).<br><br>At that time, all nations will be ruled by God's laws (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Micah 4:2; Isaiah 2:2, 3; Hebrews 8:7-13).<br><br>All of humanity will learn and keep God's Sabbath: "'From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,' says the LORD" (Isaiah 66:23, NIV).<br><br>The Sabbath will be kept by gentiles and those who were never a part of the physical nation of Israel. "Thus says the LORD: 'Keep justice, and do righteousness, for My salvation is about to come, and My righteousness to be revealed. Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who lays hold on it; who keeps from defiling the Sabbath, and keeps his hand from doing any evil . . . To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, and choose what pleases Me, and hold fast My covenant, even to them I will give in My house and within My walls a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.<br><br>"'Also the sons of the foreigner who join themselves to the LORD, to serve Him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be His servantsÂ—everyone who keeps from defiling the Sabbath, and holds fast My covenantÂ—even them I will bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer'" (Isaiah 56:1, 2, 4-7). Sabbath observance is specifically mentioned as a part of the covenant God will make with all peoples then.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>Romans 3 : 21 - 31<br><strong> Righteousness Through Faith</strong><br>21But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. 22This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, 23for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 25God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunishedÂ— 26he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.<br><br>27Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith. 28For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law. 29Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, 30since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith. 31Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.</blockquote>More to think about (same line of thoughts from the previous quotes)<br>our righteousness is from God through faith in Jesus Christ, since our righteousness is not from the observing of the law, can we then ignored the law? Since we are justified by faith apart from observing the law, can we then nullify the law by this faith?<br><br>here is Paul's answer :<br>Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.<br></div>
