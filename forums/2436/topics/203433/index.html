            <div class='col-md body'>As per Psalm 1<br><br>it just got me to thinking again, how many believers out there delight in the law of Yahweh and how many actually do meditate on it day and night?<br><br>How many of us miss out on being planted like trees by streams of living water?

Suffering and sacrifice are always Yahweh's ways of atonement for sin.<br>2. This eternal plan of our salvation was revealed in the OT already, so this is not a new story. Yahweh made known His eternal plan from a long time ago.<br>3. Yahweh used an innocent sufferer to bring atonement. As wtih times in the past, an innocent and unblemished animal was the atonement for sin.<br>4. Yahweh knew we would stray so He provided the answer.<br>5. Yeshua willingly accepted and did not doubt the father, so neither should we doubt Yahweh about situations in our lives as this may be a path that leads to other peoples salvation.<br>6. It is only through the acceptance of Yeshua that we will begin to understand the peace that is ours that surpasses all understanding.<br>7. It is hard to imagine the amount of Yahweh's wrath that was unleashed on Yeshua so that we have our atonement for sin.<br><br>Shalom!</div>

The heavens show His glory and the earth His handiwork. Even the day and night reveal Yahweh.<br><br>Night unto night reveals knowledge. How is this so? By the study of the stars, the wise men knew about the times and place. So also if we understand how to read the stars as Daniel did, we will have knowledge about the times and days.<br><br>The stars also guide and lead us and give us direction by using them as navigation points.<br><br>Yahweh reveals Himself everday and everywhere.<br><br>THE LAW IS PERFECT! So therefore IMHO it is incomprehensible that Yahweh would have done away with the law as many believers now claim. If something is perfect, it would not need replacing.<br><br>Knowing and obeying the ways and laws of Yahweh should be the greatest desire of our lives. The word of Yahweh is our source of live, widsom, joy, enlightenment and relationship to Yahweh.<br><br>Yahweh's laws, statutes, commandments and judgements are a warning markers for us not to stray and that which orders our steps. Keeping Yahweh's laws bring much rewards.<br><br>A few questions to ponder...<br><br>1. What is the fear of Yahweh?<br>2. How will our response be to PS19?<br>3. What is the bible doing for us? Is it more than just a book? Does it give you life?<br></div>
