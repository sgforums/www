            <div class='col-md body'>One of the main highlight of this Holy Feast is that contrary to all other Holy Feasts and Shabbats, there are no offerings to be brought to the Temple on this day. On normal Shabbat the priests are commanded to offer seven times more lambs but not on Yom Hakippurim. The only one that makes a sacrifice is the High Priest and He sacrifices first for Himself in order to be fit then to make the sacrifice for all the People of Israel. He, then enters into The Holy of Holiest for the first and only time in the year.<br><br>Â“And Aaron shall bring the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house, and shall kill the bull as the sin offering which is for himself. Then he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from the altar before Yahveh, with his hands full of sweet incense beaten fine, and bring it inside the veil. And he shall put the incense on the fire before Yahveh, that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the Testimony, lest he die. He shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east side; and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times. Â“Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering, which is for the people, bring its blood inside the veil, do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and before the mercy seat. So he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, for all their sins; and so he shall do for the tabernacle of meeting which remains among them in the midst of their uncleanness. There shall be no man in the tabernacle of meeting when he goes in to make atonement in the Holy Place, until he comes out, that he may make atonement for himself, for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel. And he shall go out to the altar that is before Yahveh, and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar all around. Then he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, cleanse it, and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.  Leviticus 16:11-19<br><br>Of course 2000 years ago YÂ’shua who became IsraelÂ’s High Priest from the Order of Melchizedek offered His own blood as atonement on the altar and thus forever has cleansed the sins of those that put their trust in Him.<br><br>Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens; who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the peopleÂ’s, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. Hebrews 7:25-27<br><br>YÂ’shua with one sacrifice cleansed us from sin and gave us a new life of holiness and righteousness. However many people do not understand the Gospel. For us to enter into Eternal Life through forgiveness of sins; WE MUST ENTER INTO YOM HAKIPPURIM. We must STOP everything! True salvation occurs when we stop our life as usual and humble ourselves before The Almighty, acknowledging that we have broken His commandments and we are in need of salvation. No salvation can occur unless we are cleansed and forgiven of our sins. The only way to be cleansed as instituted by the Creator Himself is by the offering of a perfect, unblemished sacrifice of a clean animal. (pigs would not be acceptable!) as mentioned in the Book of Leviticus. So, in order to obtain mercy we must,<br><br>STOP business as usual<br><br>ACKNOWLEDGE our own sins and transgressions<br><br>ASK for forgiveness<br><br>RECEIVE the Blood Sacrifice of YÂ’shua as the High Priest and the Â“sacrificial goatÂ”<br><br>TURN from our rebellious and sinful ways<br><br>ARISE to new life in Him in a forgiven state<br><br>OBEY His Commandments<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day. There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His. Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience. For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.  Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, YÂ’shua the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Hebrews 4:8-16<br>YÂ’shua fulfilled the role of the TWO GOATS<br><br>Then Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats: one lot for Yahveh and the other lot for the scapegoat. Leviticus 16:8<br><br>YÂ’shua gave His blood and He became Â“THE ATONING GOATÂ” but He also took our sins upon Him and all the curse and the judgment that we deserved and He became Â“THE SCAPEGOATÂ”.<br><br>Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, concerning all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat, and shall send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a suitable man. The goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities to an uninhabited land; and he shall release the goat in the wilderness.  Leviticus 16:21, 22<br><br>Just as the Prophet Isaiah also says,<br><br>But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed. Isaiah 53:5<br><br>In Hebrew the words Â“Chastisement for our peaceÂ” means Â“the discipline and punishment so that we can be made whole was put on HimÂ”. Just like the Yom Hakippurim scapegoat<br><br>And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God, from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool. For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified. But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before, Â“This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says Yahveh: I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,Â” then He adds, Â“Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.Â” Hebrews 10:11-17<br><br>The outcome of taking our sins away and fulfilling the role of Â“The ScapegoatÂ” was so that His Commandments will be written in our hearts and we would walk as obedient sons and daughters to Our Father in Heaven. The outcome and results of the true Gospel Â“made in ZionÂ” and of true new birth and salvation is a RADICAL LIFESTYLE OF OBEDIENCE as a response to YÂ’shua becoming our High Priest as well as our Blood Sacrifice. A Â“supposed salvationÂ” that does not lead to a radical lifestyle of obedience is not rooted in the true Gospel. YÂ’shua has SAVED US TO THE UTTERMOST. He has paid the highest price-His own Body and Blood in order to eradicate sin and death from our lives and RESTORE US to His image and likeness!<br><br>STOP EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW! HAVE YOU BEEN SAVED TO THE UTTERMOST FROM SIN OR HAVE YOU RECEIVED A Â“PARTIAL SALVATIONÂ” AND YOU WALK ONLY A PARTIAL WALK? THAT IS NOT THE TRUE GOSPEL!<br><br>STOP EVERYTHING TIME IS LATE AND RECEIVE THE TRUE GOSPEL AND THE TRUE JEWISH MESSIAH THAT PAID THE PRICE TO SAVE YOU FROM SIN TO THE UTTERMOST.<br><br>THERE IS NO ADVANCING WITHOUT STOPPING<br><br>May this Day of Atonement be one in which you ENTER INTO HIS REST COMPLETELY by stopping your own agendas and plans and by surrendering all the way to the ONE that has paid all the price for your radical transform ation. We strongly suggest that you separate Sunday sunset to Monday sunset for a day of TOTAL fasting, prayer and seeking that you may be able to ADVANCE into all His blessing and all His glory.<br><br>We love and care for you<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Bishop Dominiquae and Rabbi Baruch Bierman<br><br></div>

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.<br><br>8Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 12Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.<br><br>13And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</blockquote></div>

How do we fear the LORD? What is meant by fearing the LORD. These are just a few questions I would like to throw out for all to ponder and let Hashem guide you to the answer! Shavua Tov!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>shabbat shalom<br>its Friday again... today, quite free, after having been rushing to neigotiate and coordinate the helpdesks support for the two new deployments...<br><br>here is this week's installments (something that had been bugging me for the last 2 weeks)<br><br><strong>The Parable of the Lost Son  (Luke 15: 11-32) </strong><br>11Jesus continued: "There was a man who had two sons. 12The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them.<br>13"Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. 14After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. 15So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. 16He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.<br>17"When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! 18I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. 19I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.' 20So he got up and went to his father.<br>"But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.<br>21"The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.[b]'<br>22"But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. 23Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. 24For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate.<br>25"Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. 26So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. 27'Your brother has come,' he replied, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'<br>28"The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. 29But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. 30But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!'<br>31" 'My son,' the father said, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. 32But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'
