Note they were not created immortal, but immortality was within their grasp. Had they done so in their fallen state, they would have been consigned to an immortal existence in rebellion against Hashem. Like hasatan, they would remain forever unredeemable. An eternal life of endless death.<br><br>We like Adam and Chava are in exile from paradise.<br><br>Because Adam lived his life in exile, he having tasted of the fruit of the garden and knowing what he was missing, there is a longing in his heart, as such we also have a desire we cannot wuite put our finger on, we thirst for water we have never tasted. We long for fruit we have never eaten.... we hunger and thirst for the persence of Yahweh. We are forever looking for the way back to eden...<br><br></div>

The way of the tree of life entails passing between these chrubim, yet who can go there?<br><br>If we are to enter back into the garden and taste of immortality, we must have someone make the way for us. This is one of the meanings of the rending of the curtain in the temple. Yeshua made a way between the cherubim. He is " the Way, the truth and the life."<br><br>Thus we can claim as in hebrews 10:19-20... we have ocnfidence to endter the holy place by the blood of Yeshua, by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil...<br><br></div>

A journey of reconciliation and becoming part of the commonwealth of Israel.<br><br></div></blockquote>If we read carefully, the new covenant promise was made to the houses of Israel and Judah, not to the gentiles. Unless gentiles choose to follow the God of Israel, they have no part in the covenant, new or old.<br><br>Thus, when we have faith in Yeshua as our Saviour, it marks the beginning of our journey back towards God and His ways ordained from ancient times.<br><br>Through Yeshua, we are now physically and spiritually part of Israel and have the same rights to His promises as His firstborn Israel. The condition is that we follow Him and His ways as He set them out in the Torah, not following the religion of man and man's own interpretations of the Torah and New Testament, which was what Paul (Shaul) was trying to explain in his writings.<br><br>Unless Christians come to grips with the realization that Yeshua was a Jew and walked the earth as a Jew and followed every single commandment in the Torah (not just the 10 commandments) and we are commanded by Him to follow in His footsteps (be His disciples), they cannot fully grasp the meaning of repentance and reconciliation to God. We also cannot know who Yeshua is and the full extent of what He has done for us and why.<br><br>The God of Yeshua is the God of Israel, the Jewish people, and He is the God Christians claim to be worshipping. Take the Jew out of Yeshua and you would not have a Saviour or Messiah. He has reconciled us to the God of Israel, so how can we cut Israel out of the equation?<br><br>It is essential for believers to go back to the roots of our faith to fully understand Who we are worshipping, what is considered sin in God's eyes and therefore what we need to repent from.<br><br>Yeshua has brought us redemption from the penalty of sin which is eternal death and given us the right to eternal life. The Torah (God's instructions for man) teaches us how to be live pleasing in God sight. Take one away from the other and we would at best have only half the picture.</div>
