The New Englishman's Greek concordance goes on to say that it is "a change of heart and mind away from self and sin, and towards God and holiness." This is getting much closer, but too many students and teachers stop right there and try to apply that definition to our present day lifestyle.<br><br>To modern Christians, this means acknowledging that Jesus is Lord, the devil is bad, the Jehovah's Witnesses are a cult.<br><br>But repentance is more than this, what is then the scriptural definition of repentance, according to Yahweh?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To continue on this topic of repentance, in the hebraic way of thinking, the term repentance is described by this word, teshuvah.<br><br>Teshuvah means to retrun to something...<br><br>In B'reshith (Genesis) 3:17-19, ". . . cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou RETURN unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou RETURN."<br><br>So here Adam is returned to the dust from which he is created... thus adam will teshuvah to dust.<br><br>The root of repentance is to turn back to something. It is what one turns back to that is critical.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in order to understand repentance in the New Testament, we have to go back to the OLD Testament (THE HOLY SCRIPTURES) to get a fuller understanding of the word.<br><br>In the Holy Scriptures, the word repent was the constant cry of Hashem to His people, it was to Teshuvah back to His ways, to shoov (turn) away from being adulterated by and with the world back to to ways of Hashem, to come back to the commandments...<br><br>Thus we see in Matthew 4:17 the words of John the baptist was to REPENT. To Teshuvah. Understand that John was speaking to the jewish religious leaders of that day, the pharisees and the saducees. People who know Torah, who know the commandments and the laws... John is telling them to Teshuvah back to the ways of Hashem as these people play at keeping the commandments and the ways of Hashem but are really only keeping man made tradition as denounced by Yeshua.<br><br>The common myth that Judaism was a law-keeping religion that Hashem came to denounce and change is a lie.<br><br></div>

This is the translation of the King James English, "workers of iniquity". It is also a description of their leader, whether they know it or not, in 2 Thessalonians 2:7-8. He is the mystery of iniquity that already works and is called the wicked one or the lawless one.<br><br>We are cautioned again in the book of Revelation 3:3<br><br>3 Remember therefore how you have received and heard; hold fast and <strong>repent</strong>.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is understood that salvation came first for the Jews, this was the cry of Hashem to His people, Teshuvah. Repent.<br><br>The word for the gentiles was <strong>BELIEVE</strong>. Believe in Yeshua and be saved. Believe in Yeshua and become part of Israel and be saved. It is essential to understand this concept of becoming part of Israel, for outside of being Avrahams seed, we have no part in the covenant of Hashem. It is written very clearly in Ephesians 2:11-13<br><br>11 Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the fleshÂ—who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by handsÂ— 12 that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.<br><br>Those outside of the commonwealth of Israel are strangers of the covenants of promise and of the new covenant that is given.<br><br>But because of Yeshua, we (the gentiles) have become part of Israel. Both in a physical sense and a spiritual sense.<br><br>It is only in the letters of Sha'ul, we see as he visited the local gentile communities, he pleaded with many <strong>believing gentiles</strong>, who had already walked away, to repent. Many gentile believers had already turned back to their old ways. Sha'ul reminds many of them in 2 Corinthians 7:1, that they are to cleanse themselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of YHVH. In verse 10 he reminds them of the difference between worldly repentance and godly repentance. One works death and the other leads to the paths of righteousness.<br></div>
