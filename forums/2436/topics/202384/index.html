            <div class='col-md body'>In Matthew 5:17 we are told that Yeshua came to fulfill the law and not abolish it. And in it continues in verse 18 to say that "18 For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled."<br><br>So how then can we say that Yeshua abolished the law on the cross? These are the Messiah's very own words.<br><br>In the light of this, why do so many believers and so called professing christians say that Yeshua has abolished the law on the cross? This is heresy because by saying this you say that Yeshua as the word of Elohim made a mistake when He wrote the law. Yahweh is not this inconsistent.<br><br>What Yeshua did was to abolish the enimity which was caused by the law between Jew and Gentile, but the law still remains because we are told over and over to keep the commandments. Yeshua becomes the sole reason why we as gentiles can be saved because without Yeshua, the gentiles could not have gained access into the commonwealth of Israel or to the covenants of Yahweh or any of Yahweh's promises.<br><br>Note that the bible never mentions ever a commonwealth of gentiles or any other nation for that matter, but a commonwealth of Israel. This is consistent with the fact that we are the wildbranches which are grafted in and not the other way around. We are grafted into become like the Jews because salvation is of the Jews not the gentiles. We are to become like Yahweh's chosen. We are to become like Yeshua.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And if the law is indeed abolilshed as many christians claim, then why do we find the following verses from the book of acts:<br><br>Acts 21:24<br><br>24 Take them and be purified with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads, and that all may know that those things of which they were informed concerning you are nothing, but that you yourself also walk orderly and keep the law.<br><br>Here we see Shaul (Paul) keeping the law as required when confronted by the elders at Jerusalem, but the more interesting point is the four men that he took into the temple to be purified, they were greeks and not jews, yet they were keeping the law.<br><br>Also in Acts 24:14 Shaul says this<br><br>14 But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets.<br><br>Amazing, Shaul does not advocate the abolishing of the law either for if he did why would he say he believed all things which are written in the law?<br><br>And in Acts 28:23<br><br>23 So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he explained and solemnly testified of the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening.<br><br>Shaul used the law to persuade people about the truth of Yeshua.<br><br>Thus if you say that the law has been abolished then those who are christians do not have any hope anymore because if Yeshua cannot be proven that He is Messiah, then the gentiles have not hope. But because the law proves the Messiah, we as gentiles have this hope.</div>

That was Paul's topic in this verse?<br><br>You are a Judaizer boy :  stop putting us under the Old agreement. we are in the new agreement.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Hi Jamison and Shalom.<br><br>Let us discuss these verses that you bring up.<br><br>Lets start by looking at Ephesians 2:6-16 (amplified bible)<br><br>6And He raised us up together with Him and made us sit down together [giving us [b]joint seating with Him] in the heavenly sphere [by virtue of our being] in Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed One).<br><br>7He did this that He might clearly demonstrate through the ages to come the immeasurable (limitless, surpassing) riches of His free grace (His unmerited favor) in [His] kindness and goodness of heart toward us in Christ Jesus.<br><br>8For it is by free grace (God's unmerited favor) that you are saved ([c]delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ's salvation) through [your] faith. And this [salvation] is not of yourselves [of your own doing, it came not through your own striving], but it is the gift of God;<br><br>9Not because of works [not the fulfillment of the Law's demands], lest any man should boast. [It is not the result of what anyone can possibly do, so no one can pride himself in it or take glory to himself.]<br><br>10For we are God's [own] handiwork (His workmanship), [d]recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].<br><br>11Therefore, remember that at one time you were Gentiles (heathens) in the flesh, called Uncircumcision by those who called themselves Circumcision, [itself a [e]mere mark] in the flesh made by human hands.<br><br>12[Remember] that you were at that time separated (living apart) from Christ [excluded from all part in Him], utterly estranged and outlawed from the rights of Israel as a nation, and strangers with no share in the sacred compacts of the [Messianic] promise [with no knowledge of or right in God's agreements, His covenants]. And you had no hope (no promise); you were in the world without God.<br><br>13But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were [so] far away, through (by, in) the blood of Christ have been brought near.<br><br>14For He is [Himself] our peace (our bond of unity and harmony). He has made us both [Jew and Gentile] one [body], and has broken down (destroyed, abolished) the hostile dividing wall between us,<br><br>15By abolishing in His [own crucified] flesh the enmity [caused by] the Law with its decrees and ordinances [which He annulled]; that He from the two might create in Himself one new man [one new quality of humanity out of the two], so making peace.<br><br>16And [He designed] to reconcile to God both [Jew and Gentile, united] in a single body by means of His cross, thereby killing the mutual enmity and bringing the feud to an end.<br><br>Here Shaul makes clear that yes, we are saved by grace v8. But does verse 15 actually say that Yeshua abolished the law? No in the amplified we get a clearer picture of what Shual meant when he said it. By hanging on the cross for us, Yeshua abolished the curse of the law which is death, but Yeshua did not abolish the law because He says very clearly in Matthew 5:17-19<br><br>17Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br><br>18For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.<br><br>19Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>According to Yeshua's own words and anyone who teaches so is directly contradicting Yeshua.<br><br>But coming now to the verse in question<br><br>15By abolishing in His [own crucified] flesh the enmity [caused by] the Law with its decrees and ordinances [which He annulled]; that He from the two might create in Himself one new man [one new quality of humanity out of the two], so making peace.<br><br>It is clear from the amplified bible that the thing that is abolished is the enmity that is caused by the law.  The next portion is what decrees and ordinances did He annull? These decrees and ordinances refer the the rabbinical laws and observances that the pharisees keep which make converts twice the son of hell that they are (Matt 23:15)... these do not refer the Yahweh's original laws which He set down.<br><br>It is clear from Ephesians that the work of Yeshua was to destroy the dividing wall between the Jews and the gentiles thus making one nation, the commonwealth of Israel. Eph 2:12<br><br>As I have written in my earlier post, the problem is not with the law, but with the covenant. Ie, it was the people who could not keep the law. Heb 8.<br><br>Yeshua in Matt 19:16-17 clearly states that if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments. Which commandments do you  think Yeshua was talking about? Yeshua expects more from us than just mere lip service, in Matt 7:21 He says " No everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he ho does the will of My Father in heaven."<br><br>The question now becomes how do we know what the will of OUR Father in heaven is? By knowing and obeying the commandments.<br><br>If there was a problem with the commandments, then why would Yahweh say that He was going to write them on our hearts and put them in our minds? In fact He says this twice in the book of Hebrews in chapter 8 and again in chapter 10.</div>

I think not. For if this was the case, then why would Shaul say in <strong>1 Corinthians 7:19 "Circumsion is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what matters"</strong><br><br>In his letter to the church in Rome, Shaul said in Rom 1:5 that he and the other apostles "received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations" What did paul strive to obey? If we read further on in Rom 7:21-25, we gain some insight into this, Shaul says<br><br>21 I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. 22 For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. 23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 24 O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 I thank GodÂ—through Jesus Christ our Lord!<br>So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.<br><br>If Shaul taught that the law was abolished, they why would he say with the mind I serve the law of Yahweh? Unless that he is serving the law which is written on our hearts and put in our minds according to Hebrews?<br><br>In his discourse on the law in Romans 2, Shaul mentions that it is the doers of the law who will be justified and not just hearers only (v13). In v14-15, he says that when gentiles who have no divine law do the law, then they show the essential requirements of the law which is written on their hearts...<br><br>In Rom2:18, Shaul speaking to the jews say that they should know and understand the will of Yahweh and are able to discern the better things and what is vital because they were instructed in the law. So if you want to put aside the law, how can you then say that you are able to discern and understand what is vital to Yahweh?<br><br>In Acts 24:14, Shaul clearly says this that he worships the God of his fathers and believes all things which are written in the law and the prophets. Even in his preaching to the gentiles, Shaul says that "I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the gentiles to obey God.." Rom 15:18.<br><br>Following from all of this, does the new covenant mediated by Yeshua abolish the Ten commandments?<br><br>In Heb 8, Yahweh tells us that he altered the original covenant and made a better covenant, established on better promises. Heb 8:6, but it was not established on different laws. The laws stayed the same. What Yahweh did was to remedy the fault in the original covenant, that is the inabillity of the people to keep the law.<br><br>In the old covenant, Yahweh wrote His Ten commandments on tablets of stone, it was external, not part of the thinking and motives of the people. It was in their literature, but not in their hearts. In the New covenant, Yahweh writes the law in the hearts and minds of His people, Heb 8:10, Jer 31:33-34. To enable people to internalise His law, to love it and obey it eagerly and willing. That is why Yahweh says in Ezekiel 36:26-27, A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to wallk in my statutes, and you shall keep my judgements, and do them. It is the Holy Spirit of Yahweh that enables us to obey His laws.<br><br>People lacking the Holy Spirit are incapable of wholehearted obedience. Why? Â“Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please GodÂ” Romans 8:7-8. This is why the Old Covenant and the New Covenant differ. Paul explains that Â“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin [lawlessness] in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the SpiritÂ” Romans 8:3-4. See also 1 John 3:4.<br><br>In reference to Romans 8:4, Â“The International Critical CommentaryÂ” says: Â“GodÂ’s purpose in Â‘condemningÂ’ sin was that His lawÂ’s requirement might be fulfilled in us, that is, that his law might be established in the sense of at last being truly and sincerely obeyed, the fulfilment of the promises of Jeremiah 31:33 and Ezekiel 36:26Â” In a footnote to Jeremiah 31:33-34 the commentary explains that this passage Â“is often misunderstood as a promise of a new law to take the place of the old or else as a promise of a religion without law at all. But the new thing promised in v. 33 is, in fact, neither a new law nor freedom from law, but a sincere inward desire and determination on the part of GodÂ’s people to obey the law already given to them...Â”<br></div>

If a man sinned, he broke LAW No. 1, the moral law of the Ten Commandments. Then he brought his offering, according to LAW No. 2, the law of sacrifices, and he received forgiveness. Here the two laws were brought into right relation. LAW No. 1 defines sin, for sin is the transgression of the moral law, the Ten Commandments. 1 John 3:4 LAW No. 2 defined sacrifices, the ceremonial law which was the remedy for sin. When the Israelite sinned, he broke the first law. To secure forgiveness he had to obey the second law. So here are two very distinct laws of which this fact cannot be overlooked.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jamison:</div><div class="quote_body">can i quote Paul:<br><br>.... He is not under the torah. he is under Christ's law.<br><br></div></blockquote>It is interesting that you mention that Shual is under the law of Yeshua. But what law is that exactly?<br><br>Let me preface this will a verse Malachi 3:6 For I am the Lord I change not...<br><br>Yeshua said, Â“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one anotherÂ” John 13:34. Did Yeshua replace the clear definitions of the Ten Commandments with a new religious principle that love alone can guide our lives? Does this new commandment supersede the Ten Commandments and replace all other biblical laws? Yeshua clearly answered this fundamental question when He said, Â“Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the ProphetsÂ” Matthew 5:17.<br><br>Yet many people who believe in Yeshua as their Saviour also believe this new commandment frees them from any obligation to obey Yahweh's 10 Commandments. They misunderstand what Yeshua said and meant. The Holy Scriptures, in the Old and New Testaments, teach that we should love each other (Leviticus 19:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and love God with all our heart, soul and mind (Deuteronomy 6:5). Yeshua did not introduce love as some new principle. That was already in the Bible from the beginning and a fundamental part of YahwehÂ’s instruction to the children of Israel.<br><br>What then was new in YeshuaÂ’s Â“new commandmentÂ”? Notice His wording. He said we are to Â“love one another; as I have loved you...Â” What was new was His own example of love! The whole world has, in Jesus, a perfect model of the love of God in YeshuaÂ’s perfect example of loving obedience. Yeshua loved us so much that He sacrificed His own life for us. He Himself explained, Â“Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down oneÂ’s life for his friendsÂ” John 15:13.<br><br>Yeshua came as the light of the world to illuminate the application and practice of the royal law of love. We no longer have an excuse for saying we donÂ’t understand what to do or how to do it. Yeshua demonstrated what loving obedience is all about, <strong>Â“If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my FatherÂ’s commandments, and abide in his love.Â” John 15:10. </strong><br><br>We comply with JesusÂ’ new commandment when we obey all Yahweh's 10 Commandments in a genuinely loving manner and are willing to risk our lives for the sake of others.<br><br>So therefore we see that Yeshua's law is exactly that the ten commandments given to us from Yahweh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Jamison and Shalom.<br><br>Let us discuss these verses that you bring up.<br><br>Lets start by looking at Ephesians 2:6-16 (amplified bible)<br><br>6And He raised us up together with Him and made us sit down together [giving us [b]joint seating with Him] in the heavenly sphere [by virtue of our being] in Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed One).<br><br>7He did this that He might clearly demonstrate through the ages to come the immeasurable (limitless, surpassing) riches of His free grace (His unmerited favor) in [His] kindness and goodness of heart toward us in Christ Jesus.<br><br>8For it is by free grace (God's unmerited favor) that you are saved ([c]delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ's salvation) through [your] faith. And this [salvation] is not of yourselves [of your own doing, it came not through your own striving], but it is the gift of God;<br><br>9Not because of works [not the fulfillment of the Law's demands], lest any man should boast. [It is not the result of what anyone can possibly do, so no one can pride himself in it or take glory to himself.]<br><br>10For we are God's [own] handiwork (His workmanship), [d]recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].<br><br>11Therefore, remember that at one time you were Gentiles (heathens) in the flesh, called Uncircumcision by those who called themselves Circumcision, [itself a [e]mere mark] in the flesh made by human hands.<br><br>12[Remember] that you were at that time separated (living apart) from Christ [excluded from all part in Him], utterly estranged and outlawed from the rights of Israel as a nation, and strangers with no share in the sacred compacts of the [Messianic] promise [with no knowledge of or right in God's agreements, His covenants]. And you had no hope (no promise); you were in the world without God.<br><br>13But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were [so] far away, through (by, in) the blood of Christ have been brought near.<br><br>14For He is [Himself] our peace (our bond of unity and harmony). He has made us both [Jew and Gentile] one [body], and has broken down (destroyed, abolished) the hostile dividing wall between us,<br><br>15By abolishing in His [own crucified] flesh the enmity [caused by] the Law with its decrees and ordinances [which He annulled]; that He from the two might create in Himself one new man [one new quality of humanity out of the two], so making peace.<br><br>16And [He designed] to reconcile to God both [Jew and Gentile, united] in a single body by means of His cross, thereby killing the mutual enmity and bringing the feud to an end.<br><br>Here Shaul makes clear that yes, we are saved by grace v8. But does verse 15 actually say that Yeshua abolished the law? No in the amplified we get a clearer picture of what Shual meant when he said it. By hanging on the cross for us, Yeshua abolished the curse of the law which is death, but Yeshua did not abolish the law because He says very clearly in Matthew 5:17-19<br><br><span style="color: red;">But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law, {Gal.4:4}<br>that's why. </span><br><br>17Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br><br>18For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.<br><br>19Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br><br><span style="color: red;"> before the cross period.</span><br><br>According to Yeshua's own words and anyone who teaches so is directly contradicting Yeshua.<br><br>But coming now to the verse in question<br><br>15By abolishing in His [own crucified] flesh the enmity [caused by] the Law with its decrees and ordinances [which He annulled]; that He from the two might create in Himself one new man [one new quality of humanity out of the two], so making peace.<br><br>It is clear from the amplified bible that the thing that is abolished is the enmity that is caused by the law.  The next portion is what decrees and ordinances did He annull? These decrees and ordinances refer the the rabbinical laws and observances that the pharisees keep which make converts twice the son of hell that they are (Matt 23:15)... these do not refer the Yahweh's original laws which He set down.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Having cancelled and blottted out and wiped away the handwriting of the note (bond) with its legal decrees and demands which was in force and stood against us (hostile to us). This [note] with its regulations, decrees, and demands] He set aside and cleared completely out of our way by nailing it to [His] cross.  {Amplified Bible} Col. 2:14</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace (Ephesians 2:15) NIV</span><br><br>It is clear from Ephesians that the work of Yeshua was to destroy the dividing wall between the Jews and the gentiles thus making one nation, the commonwealth of Israel. Eph 2:12<br><br><span style="color: red;">What divided the Jews from the Gentiles? The Law</span><br><br>As I have written in my earlier post, the problem is not with the law, but with the covenant. Ie, it was the people who could not keep the law. Heb 8.<br><br>Yeshua in Matt 19:16-17 clearly states that if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments. Which commandments do you  think Yeshua was talking about? Yeshua expects more from us than just mere lip service, in Matt 7:21 He says " No everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he ho does the will of My Father in heaven."<br><br>The question now becomes how do we know what the will of OUR Father in heaven is? By knowing and obeying the commandments.<br><br>If there was a problem with the commandments, then why would Yahweh say that He was going to write them on our hearts and put them in our minds? In fact He says this twice in the book of Hebrews in chapter 8 and again in chapter 10. </div></blockquote></div>

I think not. For if this was the case, then why would Shaul say in [b]1 Corinthians 7:19 "Circumsion is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what matters"</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;"><br><br>commands of grace</span><br><br>In his letter to the church in Rome, Shaul said in Rom 1:5 that he and the other apostles "received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations" What did paul strive to obey? If we read further on in Rom 7:21-25, we gain some insight into this, Shaul says<br><br>21 I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. 22 For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. 23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 24 O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 I thank GodÂ—through Jesus Christ our Lord!<br>So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.<br><br>If Shaul taught that the law was abolished, they why would he say with the mind I serve the law of Yahweh? Unless that he is serving the law which is written on our hearts and put in our minds according to Hebrews?<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">1Co 9:20 To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;<br><br>21 to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law.</span><br><br>In his discourse on the law in Romans 2, Shaul mentions that it is the doers of the law who will be justified and not just hearers only (v13). In v14-15, he says that when gentiles who have no divine law do the law, then they show the essential requirements of the law which is written on their hearts...<br><br><span style="color: red;">the moral aspect of the law</span><br><br>In Rom2:18, Shaul speaking to the jews say that they should know and understand the will of Yahweh and are able to discern the better things and what is vital because they were instructed in the law. So if you want to put aside the law, how can you then say that you are able to discern and understand what is vital to Yahweh?<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">we have the mind of Christ</span><br><br>In Acts 24:14, Shaul clearly says this that he worships the God of his fathers and believes all things which are written in the law and the prophets.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">like Paul we believe the things written in the law. we learn from it. we are to study it. but we are not under it.  </span><br><br>Even in his preaching to the gentiles, Shaul says that "I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the gentiles to obey God.." Rom 15:18.<br><br><span style="color: red;">he did not mention the law. we obey the commands of the grace of God</span><br><br>Following from all of this, does the new covenant mediated by Yeshua abolish the Ten commandments?<br><br>In Heb 8, Yahweh tells us that he altered the original covenant and made a better covenant, established on better promises. Heb 8:6, but it was not established on different laws. The laws stayed the same. What Yahweh did was to remedy the fault in the original covenant, that is the inabillity of the people to keep the law.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">tricky.  But: In that he says, "A new covenant," he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away. [Heb 8:13]</span><br><br>In the old covenant, Yahweh wrote His Ten commandments on tablets of stone, it was external, not part of the thinking and motives of the people. It was in their literature, but not in their hearts. In the New covenant, Yahweh writes the law in the hearts and minds of His people, Heb 8:10, Jer 31:33-34.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Not the law but lawS. "I will put my laws into their mind, I will also write them on their heart.

That is why Yahweh says in Ezekiel 36:26-27, A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to wallk in my statutes, and you shall keep my judgements, and do them. It is the Holy Spirit of Yahweh that enables us to obey His laws.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Christians benefit the spiritual blessings of the new covenant law. no probs.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>People lacking the Holy Spirit are incapable of wholehearted obedience. Why? Â“Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please GodÂ” Romans 8:7-8. This is why the Old Covenant and the New Covenant differ. Paul explains that Â“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin [lawlessness] in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the SpiritÂ” Romans 8:3-4. See also 1 John 3:4.<br><br><span style="color: red;">in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. in us. not by us. </span><span style="color: darkred;">"in us" not "by us" The Christian's rule of life is the Spirit in him. When he walks by the Spirit the result is:  "But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law." The Spirit in the Christian does not need the law. With or without the law he produces love. And love is the fulfillment of the law. </span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>In reference to Romans 8:4, Â“The International Critical CommentaryÂ” says: Â“GodÂ’s purpose in Â‘condemningÂ’ sin was that His lawÂ’s requirement might be fulfilled in us, that is, that his law might be established in the sense of at last being truly and sincerely obeyed, the fulfilment of the promises of Jeremiah 31:33 and Ezekiel 36:26Â” In a footnote to Jeremiah 31:33-34 the commentary explains that this passage Â“is often misunderstood as a promise of a new law to take the place of the old or else as a promise of a religion without law at all.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Our law is Jesus.  To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law; to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law.</span><span style="color: red;">Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God. (Ro 7:4) to me to live is Christ (not the law) </span> <span style="color: darkred;">For I, through the law, died to the law, that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me. (Gal. 2:19-20)<br><br>As Marquee Mathup said: just as Christians died to sin, Christians died to the law. Christians have nothing to do with sin. They died to it. The same with the Law. Christians died to it. they have nothing to do with it. We live not by the Law but by faith in the Son of God inside us to whom we died with.</span><br><br>But the new thing promised in v. 33 is, in fact, neither a new law nor freedom from law, but a sincere inward desire and determination on the part of GodÂ’s people to obey the law already given to them...Â”<br>[/b]</blockquote><span style="color: red;">Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don't be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. (Galatians 5:1)<br>But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses."(Acts 15:5) Now therefore why do you tempt God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? (Acts 15:10)I just want to learn this from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Grace, Faith and the Law</strong><br><br>Paul taught that salvation is a gift from God by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. The Greek word for Â“graceÂ” is charis, meaning a gift or favour. In the New Testament it can refer either to GodÂ’s gift of mercy or to His gracious favour. Paul makes it clear throughout his writings that GodÂ’s grace leading to salvation is Â“not of works, lest anyone should boastÂ” (verse 9). But PaulÂ’s overall perspective toward Christian works is generally ignored by opponents of obedience to GodÂ’s law. Look at PaulÂ’s perspective in the next verse. Â“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in themÂ” (verse 10). Those who ignore the reasons for our being GodÂ’s Â“workmanshipÂ”, who ignore why we are Â“created in Christ Jesus for good worksÂ” and why we are to Â“walkÂ” in them, miss a most important part of PaulÂ’s message. Notice how PaulÂ’s relationship of obedience and works related to salvation to GodÂ’s work within us, which enables us to accomplish His purpose in us. Â“Wherefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasureÂ” Philippians 2:12-13.<br><br>Certainly forgiveness and salvation are gifts from God and they cannot be earned. As humans we possess nothing of sufficient value to pay for the forgiveness of our sins and our salvation and never will. Yet Jesus bluntly tells us that Â“unless you repent you will all likewise perishÂ” Luke 13:3, 5. Through repentance we do not earn salvation, but repentance is a prerequisite for salvation. Repentance is simply turning away from sin, forsaking lawless behaviour (1 John 3:4). We canÂ’t receive the Holy Spirit and be converted unless we are willing to repent and live as law abiding Christians (Acts 2:3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br>Faith is another prerequisite for salvation. We read that Â“without faith it is impossible to please HimÂ” Hebrews 11:6. We must be Â“justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood...Â” Romans 3:24-25 But simply because faith is required by God doesnÂ’t mean we earn salvation by having faith. Neither do we earn salvation through works. But, as the many scriptures quoted in this document show, God clearly expects faith and obedience in those to whom He will extend the gift of salvation and eternal life.<br><br>Those who oppose obedience to GodÂ’s laws choose to emphasize certain statements Paul makes and totally ignore others that clarify his intent. PaulÂ’s discussion of faith and works in Romans 3 is one such passage. In verse 28 we read, Â“Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law.Â” Paul is talking about justification: ChristÂ’s death covering our previous transgressions. Paul is showing that we could never earn forgiveness. But that has nothing to do with the way we are supposed to live. It has no bearing whatsoever on the importance of GodÂ’s law as the guide to our behaviour. Paul is talking only about how Â“sins that were previously committedÂ” can be Â“passed overÂ” (verse 25) so we can get on with our lives as obedient servants of God. To make sure we understand this, Paul says in verse 31, Â“Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.Â”<br><br>Paul wants us to understand that he is not even hinting that Gods 10 Commandments were voided or abolished. On the contrary, without the law we would have no way of understanding what sin is or is not because Â“by the law is the knowledge of sinÂ” (verse 20). Remember, for sin to exist there has to be law because Â“sin is lawlessnessÂ” 1 John 3:4. Therefore, Paul is saying that the concept of GodÂ’s Â“graceÂ” or forgiveness establishes that His law is still in effect and that sin is breaking that law. GodÂ’s grace through faith requires a law that defines the sins that are to be forgiven. So repeating Paul, Â“Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.Â”<br><br></div>

Here's a parallel verse: "But by the grace of God I am what I am.

"For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all men,<br>training us to renounce irreligion and worldly passions, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this world," (Tit. 2:11-12) What the Law cannot do. Grace will do the work. Some who do not understand Grace get jittery and nervous when he hears the believer is not under law but under grace. He would ask: "What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!" (Romans 6:15) Paul then explains grace. That grace made us dead to sin Rom 6. Grace made us dead to the law Rom. 7 (which is the strength of sin). Grace (Holy Spirit in us) enables us to fulfill the righteousness of the law. Rom. 8<br><br>The Law never made us dead to sin. It never made us alive. It killed us like it killed Paul. Law only aroused the sin nature in us. Law is for the unsaved man (1 Tim 1:8-10). Again as my friend here in this forum said: We cannot live the Christ life. Only Christ can live His life. But God demands from us righteousness (Christlikenss which is what the law demands). But how to do it we are encapable. But what if Christ will live inside you. What if you let Him live His life in you?  What if you walk in the Spirit? Can you bear fruit love and holiness and righteousness? Yes. If Christ is living and manifesting His life in you, do you need the law? Does Christ need it? No. With or without the Law Christ will always be Himself---righteous. Ga 5:18 "But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law." The Law is for wicked people. What if you let Christ live His life in you. does Christ need to be told :thou shalt not murder...Thou shalt not steal........and etc? No. Therefore :....if you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law."   </span><br><br>PaulÂ’s discussion of faith and works in Romans 3 is one such passage. In verse 28 we read, Â“Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law.Â” Paul is talking about justification: ChristÂ’s death covering our previous transgressions.

To make sure we understand this, Paul says in verse 31, Â“Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.Â”<br><br><span style="color: red;">Yes, by faith in Christ we establish the Laws purpose. We do not nulify it. The Law was to make us aware of our sinfulness and need of salvation. A person who places his faith in Jesus as Savior  has established the law's purpose. He has 'allowed' the Law to tutor him to Christ.<br><br>"But before faith came, we were kept in prison under the law, waiting for the revelation of the faith which was to come.So the law has been a servant to take us to Christ, so that we might have righteousness by faith. But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a servant. Because you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus." Gal. 3:23-25<br><br>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who has faith. Ro 10:4</span><br><br>Paul wants us to understand that he is not even hinting that Gods 10 Commandments were voided or abolished. On the contrary, without the law we would have no way of understanding what sin is or is not because Â“by the law is the knowledge of sinÂ” (verse 20).<br><br><span style="color: red;">Yes, the Law as a covenant to Israel was abolished. But its convicting ministry goes on. </span><br><br>Remember, for sin to exist there has to be law because Â“sin is lawlessnessÂ” 1 John 3:4.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Yes, Sin existed even before the Law was given:<br><br>" For this reason, as through one man sin came into the world, and death because of sin, and so death came to all men, because all have done evil:<br>Because, TILL THE LAW CAME, sin was in existence, but sin is not put to the account of anyone when there is no law to be broken." Ro 5:12-13<br>THE Law came at Sinai. It never existed before Sinai. What was the rule of life before Sinai?<br><br>Here i quote someone:<br><br><span class="large">The Bible clearly teaches in many places that a Christian is not under the law of Moses. Those who insist that we are under the law of Moses mistakenly claim that without the law of Moses you give a licenses to sin. What they donÂ’t realize is that just because Christians are not under the law of Moses doesnÂ’t mean they are without divine law. Think about it for a moment, people from Adam to Moses were without the law of Moses, yet God gave them commands to follow as previously shown above. Some of the laws given to those from Adam to Moses were similar to those given in the Mosaic law, such as murder. Yet others were complete opposites such as the eating of clean and unclean animals. There were two different laws to govern two different groups of people. The same is true today, Christians are not under the law of Moses, they are under the law of Christ which is love. Therefore the divine law for Christians is the law of love. If we love God as we should then we would never sin against Him. If we love our neighbors and enemies as we should then we would never sin against them. The law of love is far superior to the law of Moses. The law of Moses was an external list of 613 doÂ’s and donÂ’t which one could be forced to follow to a certain degree even if their heart was not in it. On the other hand the law of love covers every conceivable sin one can commit and those who obey do so from the heart because true love comes from the heart. This is why love is the greatest law and fulfills the law and the prophets. Christians do not commit murder, adultery, lies etc. because it is against the law of love, not because it is a violation of the Mosaic law. We obey righteousness because we are under the law of Christ, not as incorrectly claimed by some that we are under the law of Moses</span>.</span><br><br>Therefore, Paul is saying that the concept of GodÂ’s Â“graceÂ” or forgiveness establishes that His law is still in effect and that sin is breaking that law. GodÂ’s grace through faith requires a law that defines the sins that are to be forgiven. So repeating Paul, Â“Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.Â”<br><br><span style="color: blue;">see above for the answer.</span><br></div>

If a man sinned, he broke LAW No. 1, the moral law of the Ten Commandments. Then he brought his offering, according to LAW No. 2, the law of sacrifices, and he received forgiveness. Here the two laws were brought into right relation. LAW No. 1 defines sin, for sin is the transgression of the moral law, the Ten Commandments. 1 John 3:4 LAW No. 2 defined sacrifices, the ceremonial law which was the remedy for sin. When the Israelite sinned, he broke the first law. To secure forgiveness he had to obey the second law. So here are two very distinct laws of which this fact cannot be overlooked. Christ became that One and perfect final sacrifice for us when He cried out Â“It is finishedÂ” and bowed His head and died.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Is this not clear enough? Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. Galatians 3:24-25 What Law is he referring to? Was it only the Ceremonial Law that you call that Paul is referring here? The "Ceremonial Law" leads us to the Savior. Or was it only the 10 Commandments that Paul was referring here? Paul elsewhere clearly writes that all of these leads to Christ. The 10 commandments made the Jews aware that they are sinners and that lack righteousness. The "Ceremonial Law" (that you call) made them aware of that they need forgiveness of sins. Are these not the things that Jesus gave sinners? Righteousness and Forgiveness of sins? The Law (all of them) leads to Christ. But after Christ has come in the life of the sinner is he still under it? No. "But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor." Ro 10:4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. How then will we serve God? Ro 7:4 Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another--to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God.Ga 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,<br>23 gentleness, self-control.
