Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name and done many wonders in Your name?' And then I will declare to them, ' I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!"<br><br>To whom could the Lord be talking to and why this warning? </div></blockquote>I think this is truly a serious warning to all of us who claim to be believers in the Lord. We have to make sure we are truly worshipping our God in the way He requires of us, not in our man made religious ways. Quite obviously, simply calling Yeshua Lord, going to church and even doing miracles are not going to ensure our salvation. In fact, in the above verse, Yeshua asks these people to depart from Him and even calls them workers of lawlessness.<br><br>It is thus evidently of utmost importance to Him for us to practice lawfulness on top of confessing and believing that Yeshua is Lord. If we truly believe in Him and repent, we will go on to learn about His ways and walk in them, not by man's interpretation of religion but what is written in His Word.</div>

It is only the very very beginning, this is what Shaul is talking about when he talks about drinking milk... the Torah is solid food.<br><br>What is finished? To me that is the divide which separates us from Yahweh, that is what is finished. Not that the Torah is finished. That has always been the guide to the way we believers should live life. It is Hashem's way of what He wants us to live life. (and yes I do agree with you that good works and obedience are the results of this grace... )<br><br>I heard someone talk about the work of Yeshua and what this person was trying to say was that the thing that Yeshua changed was that where once there was sin and judgement, now there is forgiveness. But this still does not preclude us from following in the ways of Yahweh.<br><br>Shalom and shavua tov!<br><br></div>
