But the principle covers both cases.</div></blockquote>Shalom! Interesting topic...<br><br>Throughout the Bible, God gives dreams and visions which are not necessarily to be taken literally and people have to ask for interpretations of their dreams or visions.<br><br>For example in Joseph's days, 7 lean cows did not literally eat 7 fat cows and 7 thin ears of corn certainly didn't eat the 7 fat ears of corn. There was a meaning and interpretation that had to be sought.<br><br>Yeshua, when He was on earth, was not a food waster. Each time he fed the multitudes, he asked His disciples to gather up the remainder. Yet he allowed the demons to go into 2000 pigs resulting in the death of those pigs. If pigs could now be used for food, wouldn't those pigs make a whole lot of food?<br><br>Also, in Isaiah 66 where it talks of the new heavens and new earth, verse 17 says, amongst other things, that those who consume swine's flesh and the mouse, both unclean for food, shall be consumed together. Rev 18:2 also mentions that there still exists that some birds are unclean.<br><br>Acts 10:28 quite clearly says "...but God has shewed me that I should not call any <strong>MAN</strong> common or unclean" and nowhere makes mention of the vision being relevant to food. This vision was given in relation to MAN and not food.<br><br>Nowhere in the Bible mentions that foods of any kind may now be eaten and Yeshua Himself did not eat anything unclean, so if we are to be His disciples, are we not expected to do the same?</div>
