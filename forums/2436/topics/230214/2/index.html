Conversion is even till today not encouraged, meaning Jews are not required to go out and make converts at all. However, if one proved so sincere in wanting to follow the God of Israel, then he or she is welcomed with open arms and accepted as one of them after proving his or her sincerity (this may take up to several years of studying, etc...). Hence Ruth's complete acceptance into the community to such an extent that Yeshua's lineage is traced back to Ruth.<br><br>However, Yeshua's command to His disciples were to make disciples of Him, not go out and make people confess His Name and believe they are thus saved. This is deceptive to say the least and results in countless so-called "backsliders"...<br><br>If we believe in Yeshua, then we have to become His disciples, meaning imitating Him in everyway, and through Him, we do indeed have full inheritance in Israel and the Torah and rights to the blessings mentioned in it, the same way as anyone who makes it known they are wholeheartedly following and worshipping the God of Israel.</div>

Grace is given so that we have a chance to repent (turn back to following God's ways), not grace to continue sinning.<br><br>Sanctification is obtained through works or efforts on our part which follow salvation. Sanctification can only come through the cleansing by the water of the Word, revealing the roots of sin and is an essentially part of salvation. It is how we grow and mature as a believer.<br><br>I agree that we need the Holy Spirit to open up God's Word to us and to lead and guide us, but we also need to know what we are rebelling against, otherwise there can be no obedience as we won't know what to be obedient to.<br><br>God's Word tells us what pleases Him and what is acceptable to Him.
