            <div class='col-md body'>What would you say is the most important thing about you? Your gifts? Your accomplishments? Your looks? Your education? Your job? Your family? Your mutual fund portfolio? I believe that what comes into our minds when we think about Yahweh is the most important thing about us. The most important thing about any human being is not what he may say or do at a given time, but what deep in his heart he thinks about Yahweh. Why is that? Because what we think about Yahweh determines everything else that we think or do or become. There is a supernatural law of the soul that says that we tend to move toward our mental image of Yahweh; we tend to become what our conception of Yahweh is like. If our Yahweh has no standards, we will have no standards. If our Yahweh has no absolutes, we will have no absolutes. If our Yahweh is cruel and uncaring, we will become cruel and uncaring. If we have no Yahweh, we will become Yahwehless. If our conception of Yahweh is pure and holy we will become pure and holy. If our Yahweh is loving and kind, we will become loving and kind. If our Yahweh is true and eternal, we will live forever. If our Yahweh is false and temporary, we will be temporary and die eternally.<br><br>The person who comes to a right belief about Yahweh will relieve himself of a million other problems in life. The person who has a wrong concept of Yahweh will add a million other problems to his life.<br><br>The truth is that almost everything that is wrong with our society is due to the fact that we have been losing the knowledge of Yahweh.<br><br>Both the Church and the Synagogue have been losing the concept of the holiness and majesty of Yahweh. In many of our nation's churches and synagogues Yahweh is portrayed as a non-judgmental friend, or your "good buddy," or as a doting old grandfather, or as a therapist. But this is not who Yahweh really is. One of the most common sins in our society today is the sin of idolatry. Idolatry does not consist only in bowing before statues, or kneeling before visible objects of adoration. The essence of idolatry is the entertainment of thoughts about Yahweh that are unworthy of Him. The idolatrous heart assumes that Yahweh is other than what He really is. It substitutes a Yahweh after its own image for the true Yahweh. A Yahweh created in the imagination of our hearts will be worthy or pure, cruel or kind, according to the moral state of the mind from which it emerges. This is what Yahweh says to the wicked in Psalm 50:21: You thought that I was just like you. A Yahweh created in the darkness of the fallen human heart cannot possibly be in the likeness of the true Yahweh.<br><br>This decline of the knowledge of Yahweh has brought on almost all of our troubles. A rediscovery of the majesty of Yahweh will go a long way toward curing them. The most important obligation for the Church and for the Synagogue today is to purify our concept of Yahweh until it is once more worthy of Him. If we would bring back true spiritual power to our lives, we must think about Yahweh as He is, not as we think He is. THINKING CORRECTLY ABOUT YAHWEH BY KNOWING HIS ATTRIBUTES One way to think correctly about Yahweh is to learn about His attributes (midot in Hebrew). An attribute expresses Yahweh's true nature and being. Yahweh's attributes are whatever Yahweh has revealed as being true about Himself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The question that is put forth for discussion is this "What is Yahweh like?," but at the very beginning we must acknowledge that ultimately we cannot answer this question. The closest that we can come is to say that Yahweh is not exactly like anything or anybody that we know. Yahweh is incomprehensible.<br><br>Upon the preface of the topic, lets hope to get some healthy discussion about what Yahweh is like.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The desire to know What can't be known, to comprehend the Incomprehensible, to touch the Unapproachable, arises from the image of Yahweh deep in the nature of man. The soul senses its origins and longs to return to its Source, and deep calls unto deep. If what we conceive Yahweh to be He is not really He, then how should we think of Him? King David and Rabbi Paul tells us that we can start to know Him a little bit by means of creation. The heavens are telling of the glory of Yahweh, and their expanse is declaring the work of His hands. Since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made. We can know something of Yahweh through His creation, just as we can know something of the artist through a masterpiece of art. We can know there is a Yahweh who has vast wisdom, intelligence and power. But the knowledge we can come to about Yahweh through His creation is limited. We also see suffering, cruelty and death throughout nature. Nature cannot answer the questions: Is this Yahweh good? Is He kind? Is He worth praying too? Is He worthy of my worship? Yahweh has revealed Himself even more clearly throughout the Holy Scriptures.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The greatest revelation of Adonai comes through Messiah Yeshua our Lord. In Messiah and by Messiah, Adonai effects complete self-disclosure to mankind. Yahweh came to us in the incarnation of Messiah. No man has seen Yahweh at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has revealed Him. Yahweh, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, in these last days has spoken to us through His Son. He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature. Do you want to really know what Yahweh is like? Fix your eyes on Messiah Yeshua No one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him (Mt. 11:27)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Goodness of Hashem</strong><br><br>When we say that Hashem is good, it means that which is in the nature and character of Hashem that causes Him to be kind and benevolent. Hashem's goodness means that He is basically tenderhearted and sympathetic towards His creation; His underlying attitude towards His creatures is one of friendliness. By His very nature He is inclined to bestow blessing and happiness. By His inherent nature He takes pleasure in the happiness of His people. He is good and He does good (Psalm 119:68 ).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>The goodness of Hashem is foundational for all sound thought about the Most High and is necessary for our moral sanity:</strong> If Hashem was not good, there could be no distinction between kindness and cruelty; good could be bad, and bad could be good; heaven could be hell, and hell could be heaven. But since the Lord is good, there is a real moral difference between good and evil, and they are not to be confused. Woe to those who call evil good and good evil because there is a difference (Is. 5:20). Depart from evil and do good (Ps. 34:14) is as good advice now as it was when it was written by King David 3000 years ago.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>The goodness of Hashem is revealed in Creation: </strong>Every good thing that any creature enjoys in the present, or hopes to enjoy in the future, flows from the inexhaustible river of the goodness of Hashem. Every good thing bestowed and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights (James 1:17).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>The goodness of Hashem is revealed in His Word:</strong> Why did the Infinite One give us His special communication, the Bible? Why did Hashem send us righteous prophets to instruct us? Why did the Almighty send us good kings like David and Hezekiah? Why did Hashem send us priests and saints, holy men and apostles, pastors and teachers? It is because of His goodness.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>The goodness of Hashem is revealed in Redemption:</strong> Why didn't Hashem destroy the world after Adam and Eve sinned? Why has Hashem saved a people in every generation? Why did Hashem take Israel out of Egypt? Why did Hashem give the Jewish people the land of Israel? Why does the Lord accept our repentance and forgive our sins? Because He is good - not because our repentance is so special in and of itself, and not because Hashem is obligated to forgive us. For You Lord are good, and ready to forgive, and abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon You (Psalm 86:5). Why does the King of Heaven answer our prayers? Not because He is indebted to us in any way, or because our prayers are so meritorious in and of themselves, but simply because His nature is good.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>The goodness of Hashem is revealed most clearly in Messiah Yeshua:</strong> Hashem sent His Son into the world to show us ultimate goodness. Yeshua is the Good Shepherd (John 10:11). He proclaimed the Good News. He did many good works from the Father. He gave good gifts, He sowed the good seed, and He served the best wine. He made many good promises. Then in an unparalleled act of pure goodness, Messiah sacrificed His endless life and died on a cross. In fact His life and ministry can be summarized by saying that He went about doing good (Acts 10:38 ). What caused Hashem to become a man? What sent Messiah to die on a cross? What will cause Him to return to earth, and bring unending blessing, prosperity, happiness and bliss to the world? The goodness of Hashem. How can we know for sure that the unseen infinite Hashem is good? The answer is that Hashem is exactly like Messiah Yeshua. He who has seen Me has seen the Father Messiah Yeshua dared to proclaim. Messiah walked on earth so that He might show us what the Father is like. He came to make Hashem known to a lost race that had all kinds of wrong ideas about Him. From Yeshua we can learn how Hashem acts toward people. The humble and the repentant will find Hashem good and merciful, as they found Yeshua. They will find the Father to be like the father of the prodigal son - gracious, welcoming, delirious with joy - if they come to Him like the prodigal son came to his father. The frightened will find Hashem friendly. To the poor in spirit He will be forgiving. To the ignorant He will be considerate. To the weak He will be gentle. To the stranger He will be hospitable. To those who mourn over their sins, He will be comforting, as was Yeshua. But those who think themselves wise will find out that the All Knowing One is even shrewder. The hypocrites and the insincere, those who honor Him with their lips but whose hearts are far from Him, will find Hashem cold and aloof - as they found Yeshua. Yeshua will always be the friend of sinners, but He will forever oppose the proud and independent. He will not force His friendship upon those who refuse to be friendly with Him.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>We must recognize that God is good and that we are not:</strong><br><br>Most people think that they are pretty good, especially when compared to the next guy. But compared to the infinite goodness that is God, the best of men are not very good at all. There is an infinite distance between the goodness of God and fallen humanity. The Lord has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God. They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one (Psalm 14:2-3). Yeshua reaffirmed this when He said: no one is good except God alone (Luke 18:19). God is absolutely good. Man is only relatively good to the degree that we conform to the goodness of God. We are evil to the extent that we deviate from the God's goodness. If we will not admit that He alone is truly good, and we are not, we will never come to Him the way that we should. If we insist on claiming that we are good, we will never experience the totality of His saving goodness.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Why do bad things happen to relatively good people? </strong><br><br>Sometimes people question the goodness of Hashem when bad things happen, or if they experience a disappointment. They wonder if the Lord is good if He allows evil to exist in the world. But consider this: sin and evil are bad in themselves. The amputation of an arm or leg is bad in itself; but if it is necessary to save a life, it is good. Pain is something bad in itself. But if it warns us not to put our hand in the fire, it serves a good purpose. In a similar way, Hashem is so powerful and so good that He has the ability to use sin and evil to bring about a greater good! Whatever others do to us, even if they mean it for evil, Hashem can turn it around for good (Gen. 50:20). He causes all things to work together for good to those who love Hashem, to those who are called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28 ). If evil can be used to bring about a greater good, then it is consistent with the goodness of Hashem to permit sin and evil to exist for a time. Eventually the evil will bow down before the good (Proverbs 14:19), and then all sin and evil will be completely eliminated from the new heavens and the new earth. A universe of pure goodness is the final goal of Hashem's plans. Until we reach our final destiny, Hashem will discipline us so that we will not miss that eternity of joy. It was after he was afflicted that King David was able to say: it was good for me that I was afflicted (Psalm 119:71). Whether we are experiencing pleasant or difficult circumstances, we need to have the attitude of Job who said: Shall we indeed accept good from Hashem, and not accept adversity? (Job 2:10). When we suffer we should trust that our Heavenly Father is still good and has our best interests at heart.<br></div>
