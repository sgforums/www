            <div class='col-md body'>i cun realli explain biblical separation well...but if u r catholic or evangelical, u will condemn tis doctrine...its basically saying tat there shld be separation btw christians as we have differences in doctrines...nt toking abt fundamentals but the deeper doctrinal issues...issues like, tribulation, the supernatural gifts, calvinism vs armenianism etc...<br><br>so these christians r saying tat there shld nt be spiritual fellowship among christians of diff. doctrines...tis does nt mean nt making frends wif other christians...it means tat if there was an event like the festival of praise...they shld nt take part as such events involve christians all ard the country...basically, they hold on to tis belief cos they believe they shld hold fast to wad they have been tot n nt to be swayed by other doctrines...<br><br>ecumenism i am toking abt is like the festival of praise...i am nt toking abt diff. religions coming tgr to pray to their diff. gods...(there was 1 such case after the tsunami happened) meaning to say tat let there be no denomination barrier but casting aside our differences, we focus on the common goal...which is to win the lost n be in spiritual unity....<br><br>so u can see tat these 2 beliefs dun see eye-to-eye...christians who practise biblical separation condemn ecumenism saying tat ecumenism will onli lead more n more christians away from the truth...</div>

So if we join hands with everyone of different beliefs and gods, I'm not sure if He will be pleased with that since it involves other gods. What do you think?</div>
