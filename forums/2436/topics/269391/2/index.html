            <div class='col-md body'>I Am With Thee<br><br>"One night the Lord spoke unto Paul in a vision: Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you." Acts 18:9, 10<br><br>"For I am with you." What greater comfort and encouragement could we have than the assurance of His Presence with us? Paul had started his ministry in Corinth, but the people's resistance, abuse, and rejection of his message caused him to turn from them unto the Gentiles. The Lord comforts Paul with these blessed words: "Do not be afraid, for I am with you."'<br><br>God often allows circumstances to enter our lives for the trial of our faith, for the refining of our spiritual life, or for the manifestation of His Truth and faithfulness. When we find ourselves in dire straits, in darkened circumstances that are beyond our strength and ability to confront, we too can find refuge in the "secret place of the Most High." God has provided a Hiding Place, a Strong Habitation, the Secret of His Presence, where we can find the resources and sufficiency of God to be our comfort and strength. How blessed are the words of Psalm 91: "He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in Him will I trust. For He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways."<br><br>Have you found this Blessed Refuge in God? Have you experienced the Peace of God that comes when you enter the Secret of His Presence and hear Him say, "Be still and know that I am God."? Let's look at the life of one who knew the reality of His Presence and Power.<br><br>Dr. Raymond Edman, in his booklet "How They Were Won," writes of a missionary whose heart was in Africa, but his body was buried in Westminster Abbey in London. At his death, natives gently removed his heart and buried it in the soil of Africa that he so dearly loved. For nine months, the African natives carried his body through the jungle to the coast, where it was shipped back to England for burial. His name was David Livingston. What sustains men who leave behind family and comfort to go to some remote mission field, to carry the Gospel to people who have never heard of the love of God and His saving grace through Jesus Christ, as David Livingston did? He answered that question himself. On one occasion when he returned to Scotland for a brief stay, he was asked to speak at the University of Glasgow. As a result of a lion attack, one of his arms was rendered useless. His body bore physical evidence of the suffering he endured from 27 bouts of jungle fever. His face was leathery brown from continued exposure to the African jungle, and creased from the cares of a hard life battling the Turks and slave traders who had little use for him. The students were in awe as they listened to this great man. "Shall I tell you what sustained me amidst the trials, hardships, loneliness, and extreme difficulty of my exiled life in Africa?" he asked. "It was a 'promise of a Gentleman' of the most sacred honor. It was the promise of Jesus Christ, LO, I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS, EVEN TO THE END OF THE WORLD."<br><br>Ed Powell</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Keeping Oaths<br>Joshua 9:20<br>This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them.<br><br>Joshua and the people of Israel were in the Promised Land. They were winning battles and were feeling good about their progress. One day a band of Gibeonites came by dressed as travelers in order to fool Joshua. They wanted to make Joshua believe they were merely travelers instead of enemies. The Gibeonites asked Joshua to make a peace treaty with them. Since Joshua chose to believe their story, he did just that. That was a mistake on Joshua's part. The Bible says Joshua did not inquire of the Lord about the Gibeonites. This forced Joshua to uphold the peace treaty with the Gibeonites, even though it was made under false pretenses.<br><br>Keeping our oaths before the Lord is a serious matter. One might think that Joshua had every right to consider the agreement with the Gibeonites null and void since it was done on false pretense. However, Joshua knew how God viewed oaths. He knew that a man's word, once it was given, should be good as done. There was no reversing it. He also knew that if he did not keep his oath, he was subject to God's disfavor, which meant his ways would not be blessed.<br><br>Whenever we become a child of God, we represent Him. When His children follow unrighteousness, He takes this personally. Unrighteousness opens us up to satan's attack. God's protection shield is removed. So Joshua knew that if he did not honor his oath, he would be subject to God's judgment.<br><br>Is there any unfulfilled oath you have made to anyone? Ask God this morning if you have not fulfilled a commitment to anyone. Then, if there is, go and fulfill. Otherwise, you will be subject to God's judgment for your unrighteousness.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fear Not!<br>2 Timothy 1:7<br>For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.<br><br>God calls each of us to engage in spiritual warfare at times. Whenever satan wants to come against one of God's children, he does so by trying to intimidate through fear.<br><br>Goliath's formidable size and arrogant boasting intimidated Saul and Israel's army. And because God's anointing had fallen from Saul, he was unable to respond with courage to Goliath's charge. Fear paralyzes and torments. That is why Saul could not respond.<br><br>The anointing had fallen on David, who was just a young boy, but mighty in spirit. David did not cower at the size or shouts of the giant Goliath. He saw Goliath through the eyes of God, who saw him as a mere speck. David had righteous indignation for an affront to the armies of the living God.<br><br>David did not weigh the risk of failure because his faith was resting totally in God. That is another important factor in overcoming fear-complete trust in God.<br><br>When the Lord began training me to confront fear, the training grounds were a groundless lawsuit, intimidations, and calamity that confronted my very existence. Learning that these were merely tactics of the enemy, designed to instill fear, allowed me to stand firm in God's power to overcome.<br><br>Do not fear sudden calamity if you are walking uprightly before God. It may be setting the stage for a great victory that will bring praise and honor to your heavenly Father. These battles are training grounds for greater victories to come.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Headed Homeward</strong><br>by Max Lucado<br><br>Aging is GodÂ’s idea. ItÂ’s one of the ways he keeps us headed homeward. We canÂ’t change the process, but we can change our attitude. Here is a thought. What if we looked at the aging body as we look at the growth of a tulip?<br><br>Do you ever see anyone mourning over the passing of the tulip bulb? Do gardeners weep as the bulb begins to weaken? Of course not. We donÂ’t purchase tulip girdles or petal wrinkle cream or consult plastic-leaf surgeons. We donÂ’t mourn the passing of the bulb; we celebrate it. Tulip lovers rejoice the minute the bulb weakens. Â“Watch that one,Â” they say. Â“ItÂ’s about to blossom.Â”<br><br>Could it be heaven does the same? The angels point to our bodies. The more frail we become, the more excited they become. Â“Watch that lady in the hospital,Â” they say. Â“SheÂ’s about to blossom.Â” Â“Keep an eye on the fellow with the bad heart. HeÂ’ll be coming home soon.Â”<br><br>Â“We are waiting for God to finish making us his own children, which means our bodies will be made freeÂ” (Rom. 8:23).<br><br>Are our bodies now free? No. Paul describes them as our Â“earthy bodiesÂ” (Phil. 3:21 MSG). Or as other translations state:<br><br>Â“our lowly bodyÂ” (NKJV)<br>Â“the body of our humble stateÂ” (NASB)<br>Â“these weak mortal bodiesÂ” (NLT)<br>Â“our vile bodyÂ” (KJV)<br>Â“our simple bodiesÂ” (NCV)<br><br>You could add your own adjective, couldnÂ’t you? Which word describes your body? My cancerous body? My arthritic body? My deformed body? My crippled body? My addicted body? My ever-expanding body? The word may be different, but the message is the same: These bodies are weak. They began decaying the minute we began breathing.<br><br>And, according to God, thatÂ’s a part of the plan. Every wrinkle and every needle take us one step closer to the last step when Jesus will change our simple bodies into forever bodies. No pain. No depression. No sickness. No end.<br><br>This is not our forever house. It will serve for the time being. But there is nothing like the moment we enter his door.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He Routs Our Enemy<br>"He hath cast out thine enemy"   (Zephaniah 3:15).<br><br>What a casting out was that! Satan has lost his throne in our nature even as he lost his seat in heaven. Our LORD Jesus has destroyed the enemy's reigning power over us. He may worry us, but he cannot claim us as his own. His bonds are no longer upon our spirits: the Son has made us free, and we are free indeed.<br><br>Still is the archenemy the accuser of the brethren; but even from this position our LORD has driven him. Our Advocate silences our accuser. The LORD rebukes our enemies and pleads the causes of our soul, so that no harm comes of all the devil's revilings.<br><br>As a tempter, the evil spirit still assails us and insinuates himself into our minds; but thence also is he cast out as to his former preeminence. He wriggles about like a serpent, but he cannot rule like a sovereign. He hurls in blasphemous thoughts when he has opportunity; but what a relief it is when he is told to be quiet and is made to slink off like a whipped cur! LORD, do this for any who are at this time worried and wearied by his barkings. Cast out their enemy, and be Thou glorious in their eyes. Thou hast cast him down; LORD, cast him out.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Self-Righteousness</strong><br><br>Ekev : "Because"<br>Torah : Deuteronomy 7:12-11:25<br>Haftarah : Isaiah 49:14-51:3<br>Gospels : Acts 6-7<br><br><strong>Thought for the Week:</strong><br><br>Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a<br>tax collector. The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: "God, I<br>thank you that I am not like other men-- robbers, evildoers,<br>adulterers-- or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and<br>give a tenth of all I get." But the tax collector stood at a distance.<br>He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said,<br>"God, have mercy on me, a sinner." I tell you that this man, rather<br>than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who<br>exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be<br>exalted. (Luke 8:10-14, NIV)<br><br><strong>Commentary:</strong><br><br>Do not say in your heart when the LORD your God has driven them<br>out before you, "Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me<br>in to possess this land ." (Deuteronomy 9:4)<br><br>Moses earnestly warns Israel against feeling self-righteous. He warns<br>them not to attribute their successes to their own merit. He tells<br>them, "it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God<br>is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn<br>people" (9:6). If not for Moses' intercession and atonement on their<br>behalf, Israel would not have even survived the journey from Egypt.<br>They had Moses to thank for their deliverance thus far. Furthermore,<br>Moses reminded them that the LORD was giving them the land of Canaan<br>to fulfill His covenant obligations to the patriarchs. There could be<br>no talk of merit and righteousness.<br><br>In addition, he said, "It is not for your righteousness or for the<br>uprightness of your heart that you are going to possess their land .<br>the LORD your God is driving them out before you, in order to confirm<br>the oath which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and<br>Jacob." (Deuteronomy 9:5). In other words, God was blessing Israel,<br>not because they merited His blessing but because He was fulfilling<br>covenantal obligations to the patriarchs.<br><br>These lessons are important for believers to remember. It is easy to<br>start to feel self-righteous about our relationship with God. Perhaps<br>those who practice the Torah have an even greater tendency to do so.<br>We must be vigilant to guard against any such vain imaginings of<br>ourselves. God did not save us because of our righteousness, nor does<br>our righteousness sustain our salvation. Instead, God sent His Son<br>Yeshua precisely because of our unrighteousness. Just as Moses<br>interceded for Israel, sparing them from the wrath of God in the<br>wilderness, so too Messiah intercedes for us by means of His<br>sacrificial death.<br><br>Paul demonstrates that our salvation does not come from our own<br>righteousness. We do not earn salvation through obedience to Torah.<br>Instead, the Torah condemns sin. All men have sinned and fallen short,<br>and all men stand equally condemned by Torah. No one's righteousness<br>is adequate. Therefore, salvation is based upon the Torah's covenantal<br>promises to Abraham. He says, "The promise to Abraham or to his<br>descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through<br>[observance of] the Torah, but through the righteousness of faith"<br>(Romans 4:13).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Upon Your Heart</strong><br>VaÂ’etchanan : Â“And I besoughtÂ”<br>Torah : Deuteronomy 3:23Â–7:11<br>Haftarah : Isaiah 40:1Â–26<br>Gospel : Acts 3-5<br><br><strong>Thought for the Week:</strong><br>In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvationÂ—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory. (Ephesians 1:13-14)<br><br><strong>Commentary:</strong><br>In the recitation of the Shema (Hear O Israel), the Torah speak in the future tense when it says, Â“These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heartÂ” (Deuteronomy 6:6). This means that we are to endeavor to keep the commandments by placing them on our hearts, but it could also be read to imply an assurance of the future. Jeremiah 31:33 promises that in the new covenant, God will write his Torah upon our hearts. He says, Â“I will put My Torah within them and on their heart I will write itÂ” (Jeremiah 31:33). This means that God will actually change our nature, circumcising our hearts as it were, to remove from us the waywardness of our evil inclinations. Paul speaks of this transformation as Â“the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy SpiritÂ” (Titus 3:5). In another passage, Paul says, Â“Therefore if anyone is in Messiah, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have comeÂ” (2 Corinthians 5:17). Paul points to the lives of believers as evidence of the new covenant when he says, Â“You are a letter of Messiah, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human heartsÂ” (2 Corinthians 3:3). All of this happens to believers as a fulfillment of the promise of the new covenant. The Holy Spirit is responsible for writing the commandments of God upon our hearts:<br><br>Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances. (Ezekiel 36:26Â–27)<br>But as of yet, we have not experienced this regeneration in its fullness. The completion of the promises of the new covenant awaits the coming of Messiah who is the Â“guarantee of a better covenantÂ” (Hebrews 7:22). Paul tells us that God Â“gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledgeÂ” (2 Corinthians 1:22). A pledge implies a down payment on a sum which will be paid in full in the future. The down payment is the Holy Spirit within us now. The amount to be paid in full in the future is the Torah written on our hearts.<br><br>Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge Â… a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory. (2 Corinthians 5:5; Ephesians 1:13-14)<br>In that day of redemption, the words of Deuteronomy 6:6 will be made true. Â“These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heartÂ” (Deuteronomy 6:6).<br><br></div>

(8:3)<br><br>R' Chaim ben Betzalel z"l (1515-1588; rabbi of Friedberg, Germany; often referred to as "Rabbeinu Chaim, brother of the Maharal of Prague) observes: The phrase, "in order to make you know that not by bread alone does man live," implies that man does not live by bread alone, but of course he needs bread as well. Yet, the next phrase, "rather by everything that emanates from the mouth of G-d does man live," implies that man does not need even bread--only the word of G-d keeps man alive. Which inference is correct?<br><br>He answers: If a person merited, he could live without bread, as Moshe did on Har Sinai for 40 days and as Eliyahu Hanavi did also (see Melachim I 19:8 ). However, the typical person cannot do this. He does need bread. Nevertheless, know that man does not live on bread alone; he must combine the word of G-d with it. In particular, when he eats, he should bring the word of G-d to the table [for example, by reciting a Dvar Torah or studying a Torah work during the meal].<br><br>How do we know that a person should not feel guilty about the fact that he needs to eat? The Torah says (Vayikra 11:2-4), "These are the creatures that you shall eat from among the animals that are upon the earth. Everything among the animals that has a split hoof, which is completely separated into double hooves, and that brings up its cud -- that one you may eat. But this is what you shall not eat..." Isn't that last verse redundant? If the Torah says what I may eat, is it necessary to say what I may not eat? Could we not figure that out by ourselves through process of elimination? The purpose of the redundancy is so that we will not interpret the first verse merely as permission, but as a directive: A normal person needs to eat.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"It will be that if you listen to My commandments that I command you today, to love Hashem, your G-d, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul." (11:13)<br><br>Rashi asks (paraphrasing the Sages), "Serve Him with a service that is in the heart, i.e., prayer, for prayer is termed service (`avodah')."<br><br>R' Yaakov Krantz z"l (1741-1804; the Dubno Maggid) asks: What is the purpose of prayer? G-d already knows our needs and our desires. If something we want is good for us, let Him give it to us. If it is not good for us, then prayer can have no effect. We are all witnesses to the fact that a person will sometimes pray for something 1,000 times and still not be answered.<br><br>The answer is that Hashem wants us to sense the difference between good circumstances and bad ones. If Hashem gave us everything we needed before we asked for it, we would never sense His beneficence. We would think that everything comes about naturally.<br><br>For example, a person who is healthy, who is whole in body and limb, whose eyes can see and whose ears can hear, and so on, does not usually rejoice over his physical faculties. He is not aroused to bless his Creator for these gifts. Only a person who is lacking one of these faculties and then is cured is aroused to appreciate what he now has.<br><br>To what may prayer be compared? To night watchmen who call out every hour, "It is such-and-such o'clock and all is well." Why do they wake up sleeping townspeople to make this announcement? Not because the townspeople need to know the time, but in order to prove that the watchmen are awake and alert. Likewise, Hashem does not need our prayers. Rather, we pray to prove that we are "awake."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Worldly Planning </strong><br>2 Corinthians 1:17<br>Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, "Yes, yes" and "No, no"?<br><br>The apostle Paul was discussing his plans to come to the church at Corinth. He was acknowledging the serious nature of his trip and informing the Corinthians that he did not flippantly come to this decision to visit them. It was a matter that had been given serious prayer, not one made in the spur of the moment.<br><br>Planning from God's view is a process. It isn't merely an exercise in reason and analysis. It requires entering into the mind of Christ together with our minds to determine which course to take. In the Old Testament, the priests wore breastplates with the urim and thummim in a pouch on their breasts. It was like a roll of dice that the priests were required to perform to know which direction they were to take on a matter. It was the ultimate release of all decisions into God's hand. God did not want the priests to rely on their own intellects for final decisions.<br><br>We have an uncanny ability to make decisions based on our own needs and wants. However, God desires that we seek Him to know His plans for us. David was a skilled warrior who never lost a battle. He consulted God on every decision. He knew the results of the battle rested in God's hand. So, if he was to gain victory, he had to know God's mind on the matter. Sometimes this requires more time given to the process in order to hear His voice. Sometimes it may even require fasting and prayer. Sometimes it may require input from other godly friends.<br><br>Are you a man or woman who makes decisions based on God's purposes for your life? Do you take every major decision and put it before the throne to determine God's mind on the matter? If so, you will avoid making decisions in a worldly manner.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>On Cue</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>Not often does G-d Almighty tell anybody to leave him alone. But then again, Moshe isn't everybody.<br><br>This week, Moshe recounts the sad tale of the Golden Calf. Moshe had promised to return from Mount Sinai after receiving the Torah in forty days, but the Jews miscalculated. According to their calculations, he was late. Fearing that Moshe would never return from his celestial mission, the Jews made themselves a golden calf and worshipped it while proclaiming, "this is our god that took us out of Egypt." Obviously, the calculations and miscalculations of the Jewish People are not as simple as they appear on the surface. That, however is an entirely different issue.<br><br>I'd like to focus in on the aftermath of the calamity of the Golden Calf. Hashem actually wanted to destroy the Jewish Nation and rebuild a new folk with Moshe, as its patriarchal leader. "Release me," said G-d, "and I will destroy them and build a new nation from you" (Deuteronomy 9:14)). Immediately after the words, "release me" Moshe sprung into action. In the Book of Exodus, it details how Moshe pleaded, cajoled, and reasoned with Hashem with a multitude of persuasive arguments that calmed His wrath. The Jews were spared.<br><br>What is troubling is Moshe's chutzpah. Didn't Hashem specifically tell him, "leave me alone"? What prompted him with the audacity to defy a direct command of Hashem?<br><br>Herbert Tenzer served as a distinguished congressman from New York in the 1960s. More importantly, he was an observant Jew who was a proud activist and was instrumental in providing relief for many Holocaust survivors. A few months before his passing, some years ago, he related to me the following story:<br><br>The energetic and often outspoken Rabbi Eliezer Silver of Cincinnati, Ohio was a prominent force in the Vaad Hatzallah Rescue Committee. He worked tirelessly throughout the terrible war years and their aftermath to save and place the victims of Nazi depravity. In addition to his prominence in the Jewish world, Rabbi Silver enjoyed a personal relationship with the very powerful Senator Robert Taft of Ohio.<br><br>Rabbi Silver had a very difficult request that needed much political pressure and persuasion to accomplish. He asked Mr. Tenzer to accompany him to the Senator.<br><br>"Shenator Taft!" he exclaimed, mixing his distinct accent in which the s would sound as sh, with a high pitched intoning of emotions. I have a very important and difficult requesht!"<br><br>Rabbi Silver went on to plead his case of obtaining a certain number of visas for some refugees who may not have met all the criteria. Senator Taft looked nonchalant and non-committal. The Senator thought for a while then grimaced. He slowly and carefully stretched his response. "It would be arduous and burdensome," he began. "but technically," he continued, implying all the while that he was not the least bit anxious to get his hands dirty, " it can be done."<br><br>But Rabbi Silver did not hear anything except the last three words.<br><br>"IT CAN BE DONE?" He shouted with joy. "SHO DO IT!" Needless to say the stunned Senator got to work immediately and obtained the visas for the beleaguered Jews.<br><br>Moshe heard one line from Hashem, "leave me alone, and I will destroy them." That was his cue. The Talmud in Berachos explains that hearing those words, Moshe knew that now it all depended on him. The only way Hashem would destroy His people was if Moshe left him alone. And he didn't. Moshe badgered, cajoled, and pleaded with the Almighty and we were spared.<br><br>My Rebbe once quoted legendary slugger Ted Williams, the last player to achieve a batting average of over .400. "Every player gets one pitch that he definitely can hit. To hit .400, don't miss that pitch." Instead of recoiling at the words "release me" or "leave me be," Moshe saw his pitch. And he hit it awfully hard.<br><br>In life there are many cues. This week Moshe teaches his nation that when you get your cue, don't miss it. Even if it takes a little chutzpah.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Letting Go</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>In this week's portion Moshe talks about what was perhaps the most traumatic moment of his career. After spending 40 days and nights on the highest level of spiritual elevation, he returned from Mount Sinai to a scene that filled him with horror. At the foot of the mountain the Jews were reveling around a golden calf.<br><br>Naturally Moshe was appalled. Here he was, holding the luchos (tablets), a G-d-given immortal gift, and he faced a nation plunged into an act of idolatry. He smashes the luchos.<br><br>But if we analyze the narrative there is an interesting word that Moshe inserts as he describes his actions on that day. "I descended from the mountain and the two tablet were in my hands. Then I saw and behold! You had sinned unto G-d; you made yourselves a molten calf. So I grasped the two luchos and I threw them from my two hands and smashed them in front of your eyes" (Deuteronomy 9:15-17).<br><br>Moshe was holding the tablets when descending the mountain. Why did he clutch them before throwing them from his hands? Weren't they already in his hands?<br><br>Shouldn't the verse tell us "Then I saw and behold! You had sinned and you made yourselves a molten calf. So I threw the tablets from my two hands and smashed them in front of your eyes." Why, and in what way did he grasp them?<br><br>A friend of mine told me a story about his great grandfather, a brilliant sage and revered tzadik. Whenever he saw one of his children commit an action that was harmful to their physical or spiritual well-being he would stop them. But this sage knew that stopping a child is not enough. The youngster would need a punishment too, whether it be potch (Yiddish for slap), reprimand, lecture, or the withholding of privileges.<br><br>But when a potch or harsh rebuke was due, the rabbi would not give it immediately. He would jot the transgression down in a small notebook and at the end of the week he would approach the young offender. After giving the child a hug and embrace, he reminded the child of the incident and explained to the child that his actions were wrong.<br><br>"I should have punished you immediately when I saw you commit your act," he would say, "but honestly, I was angry then, and my punishment may have been one spurred by anger, not admonition. Now, however, that occurrence is in the past and I am calm. Now I can mete your punishment with a clear head. And you will know that it is given from love, not anger."<br><br>He then proceeded to punish the child in a way that fit the misdeed. Moshe was upset. But he did not want to throw the luchos down in rage. He therefore grabbed them and held them tight before hurling them. Moshe, in his narrative tells us that he seized the luchos before breaking them. He wanted to send a clear message to the revelers below. That the mussar (ethical reprove) that he was affording with this action was not born out of irrational behavior or in anger.<br><br>Before smashing the luchos Moshe embraced them, just as a father hugging a child that he would soon admonish. Because Moshe wanted to tell us that before we let loose, we have to hold tight.<br><br></div>

You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!" </span><br><br>Testing allows one to discover how well a product is made when placed under extreme stress. Increasing the pulling pressure between two objects reveals the amount of tension that can be withstood in a chain link. Eventually, the "choking" point occurs. In sports, we ascertain the "choking" point for athletes by putting them into a pressure situation. At what point will the athlete lose concentration and collapse under the pressure? It is under these stressful times that we discover how well we have been trained to withstand the pressure and make right decisions regardless of outside influences.<br><br>In my younger days I played sports. I came to observe that we fail under pressure usually because we reach a point where our ability to focus on execution yields to concern about outcome. This worry about outcome forces us to lose our concentration. The fear of failure begins to rule our emotions and actions, which ultimately results in our failure. What we fear has come upon us. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br><br>In life, we see giving in to pressure in the form of compulsive behavior, withdrawal, anger, abuse, moral failure, and dishonesty, to name just a few manifestations.<br><br>Jesus never yielded to pressure. He never made decisions based on outcome. He always made the right decision. He always performed the same no matter what the circumstance. He lived a life based on absolutes, not circumstances. He never gave in to "situational ethics."<br><br>As God entrusts us with more and more responsibility, He brings more and more pressures into our lives to "test the product," to make sure that He can give even more responsibility to us. This process helps us see where we are in our maturity and determines our level of future responsibility.<br><br>Are you a product that can withstand the product test? Will you perform as the Maker designed no matter what outside pressures come? Know that you cannot perform well unless you are continually in relationship with and obedient to the one who made you. Trust the product developer today. He has made you to perform well under pressure.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

Wist ye not that I must be about My Father's business? </span><br><br>Earth is God's business. He has set up many franchises (churches) designed to send His representatives (Body of Christ) into the world to make known the best product ever given to mankind (Jesus). His branch managers (pastors) have been given the responsibility to teach and support those in the field. God's goal is to establish a franchise in every nation, state, and city. It is the ultimate business because when you introduce someone to His product (Jesus), you receive a reward from the home office (Heaven). God has promised that His representatives will have all the tools and customer support needed to accomplish their strategic plans.<br><br>Jesus knew that He was to be about His Father's business. He knew He was sent to earth not to enjoy the pleasures of lowly man, but to accomplish a task for which He alone was sent. When He had accomplished His mission, He was to entrust this mission to other representatives into whom He poured His life for three years. This field training allowed Jesus to mentor, model, befriend, and demonstrate firsthand the model for a successful business to be launched and sustained.<br><br>God has big plans for His franchise.

The physical symptom is control, and when you cannot control, you get angry because of unmet expectations." These were the words I spoke during a conversation in a restaurant to my friend who was separated from his wife. He described his anger and how he never saw some of these characteristics in his life until he entered this marriage.<br><br>A friend once said to me, "Anger is like the lights on a dashboard. They tell you something is going on under the hood. You must find out the source of the problem." Whenever we have expectations of another person and those expectations do not materialize, our tendency is to get angry. The source of the anger is often the fear that the unmet expectation will negatively impact us. We fear that our finances, our well-being, our image, or any number of things may be impacted by the unmet expectation. My friend's wife had not met his expectations in many areas of his life, so then, many times it resulted in harsh words that damaged his wife's self-esteem. Now, it was leading to a marriage crisis.<br><br>Jesus often spoke of living as though we were dead. How can you live as though you are dead? "In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 6:11). It is a choice each of us must make. Once you become dead to that which stirs an emotion in you, God is free to change that situation. Until then, you can expect God to allow that situation to remain until you reckon yourself dead to the effects of the issue that causes you to struggle.<br><br>Is there something that causes anger within you? Ask God what the source of that anger is. You might be surprised at what you find. Then ask God to give you the grace to reckon yourself dead to that issue. You will find new freedom in your relationships and your own peace of mind.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Question of Ownership </strong><br>Matthew 10:39<br>Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.<br><br>Otto Koning was a missionary in New Guinea. He worked among a native tribe that had known only their village ways. One of those village ways was stealing from others. When Otto and his wife arrived and moved into a hut, the natives often came by to visit. The Konings would notice that after the natives left the missionaries' home, various household items had disappeared. They saw these items again when they went to preach in the natives' village.<br><br>The only fruit Otto could grow on the island was pineapples. Otto loved pineapples, and he took pride in the pineapples he was able to grow. However, whenever the pineapples began to ripen, the natives would steal them. Otto could never keep a ripe pineapple for himself. This was a frustration, and he became angry with the natives. All during the seven-year period in which this took place, Otto preached the gospel to these natives, but never had a conversion.<br><br>The more the natives stole, the more angry Otto became. Finally, one day Otto had a German Shepherd dog flown in from another missionary to protect his pineapple garden after other frustrated efforts failed. This only further alienated the natives from him.<br><br>Otto took a furlough to the United States and attended a conference on personal rights. At this conference, he discovered that he was frustrated over this situation because he had taken personal ownership of his pineapple garden. After much soul searching, he gave his garden to God. Soon the natives started having problems among their tribe. They discovered that Otto was the reason for their problems because he gave his garden to his God. The natives saw a correlation between what Otto had done and their own lives being affected by calamities in their village. When Otto gave his garden to God, he no longer got angry and was free from worry. The natives started bringing him fruit from the garden because they didn't want any more calamities to come into their village.<br><br>The light came on one day when a native said to Otto, "You must have become a Christian, Otto. You don't get angry anymore. We always wondered if we would ever meet a Christian." They had never associated Otto with the kind of person he was preaching about because his message did not line up with his life. Otto was broken in spirit when he realized he had been such a failure.<br><br>At the end of seven years, he witnessed his first conversion, and many began coming to Christ once he fully gave his garden to God. The fruit grew so abundant that Otto began exporting it and growing other types of fruit, such as bananas. His village became the most evangelized in the whole region, yet for seven years he had not one convert.<br><br>Otto realized something each of us must realize: To gain your life you must lose it, along with your possessions. It was only when he gave all his possessions to God that he became free from them. God measured back to him manyfold once He had complete ownership.<br><br>Do you have some possessions that you need to give up to God today? Let God have all that you have. Become a steward, not an owner. You will be surprised at how well God can take care of His possessions.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

Have you ever thought your prosperity was due to your ingenuity? Has your material success been a testimony to others that God is the ruler of all aspects of your life, even the material side?<br><br>Joseph's greatest test was not his temptation to be bitter against his brothers. It wasn't the sexual temptation that came inside Potiphar's house. It wasn't even the discouragement of years of imprisonment for being wrongfully accused. It was the temptation of prosperity and ownership. Once he was elevated, he was given choices that he never had before. It was totally up to him as to which choice he would make. Stewardship reveals what we believe about God and ourselves.<br><br>Not every man can carry a full cup. Sudden elevation frequently leads to pride and a fall. The most exacting test of all to survive is prosperity.-Oswald Chambers<br><br>Do you have a proper understanding of who you are? Do you understand that it is God who has given you the ability to work and achieve? He is the source of all good things. Ask God today if your life models this belief.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong>One Flock, One Shepherd </strong><br>John 10:16<br>I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to My voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.<br><br>A friend of mine told me a story about an experience he had in Israel. They were in the country visiting some of the famous biblical sites when they saw a group of sheepherders. A shepherd brought his flock of sheep into a round pen for the night. Then, a few minutes later, another shepherd brought his flock into the pen. Then, a few minutes later, yet another shepherd brought his sheep into the pen. There were three groups of sheep in the pen with no identifying marks among any of them. My friend wondered how in the world they would separate their sheep the next day.<br><br>The next morning, a shepherd came over to the pen and made a comment to his sheep. One by one, the sheep filed out to follow him. Only his sheep followed his voice. My friend said it was an amazing scene to see only that shepherd's sheep follow him and the others remain in the pen. What a picture of Jesus' words spoken centuries earlier.<br><br>Hearing and responding to Jesus' voice is the key to having a two-way relationship with God. It is the difference between having religion and a relationship. Can you recognize God's voice in your life? Are you listening to the Shepherd's voice? Do you respond when He calls? Ask Jesus to help you increase your ability to hear. Give more time to spending quiet moments in His presence to hear His voice. He wants to be your Good Shepherd.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Reason for Singing </strong><br><br>"The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; He will save, He will rejoice over thee with joy; He will rest in his love, He will joy over thee with singing"   (Zephaniah 3:17).<br><br>That a Word is this! Jehovah God in the center of His people in all the majesty of His power! This presence alone suffices to inspire us with peace and hope. Treasures of boundless might are stored in our Jehovah, and He dwells in His church; therefore may His people shout for joy. We not only have His presence, but He is engaged upon His choice work of salvation. "He will save." He is always saving: He takes His name of Jesus from it. Let us not fear any danger, for He is mighty to save. Nor is this all. He abides evermore the same, He saves, He finds rest in loving, He will not cease to love. His love gives Him joy. He even finds a theme for song in His beloved. This is exceedingly wonderful. When God wrought creation He did not sing but simply said, "It is very good"; but when He came to redemption, then the sacred Trinity felt a joy to be expressed in song, Think of it, and be astonished! Jehovah Jesus sings a marriage song over His chosen bride. She is to Him His love, His joy, His rest, His song. O LORD Jesus, by Thine immeasurable love to us teach us to love Thee, to rejoice in Thee, and to sing unto Thee our life-psalm.<br><br>CH Spurgeon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Because He Chooses ToÂ…<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>Love. WeÂ’ve all but worn out the word. This morning I used love to describe my feelings toward my wife and toward peanut butter. Far from identical emotions. IÂ’ve never proposed to a jar of peanut butter (though I have let one sit on my lap during a television show). Overuse has defused the word, leaving it with the punch of a butterfly wing.<br><br>Biblical options still retain their starch. Scripture employs an artillery of terms for love, each one calibrated to reach a different target. Consider the one Moses used with his followers: Â“The LORD chose your ancestors as the objects of his loveÂ” (Deut.10:15 NLT).<br><br>This passage warms our hearts. But it shook the HebrewsÂ’ world. They heard this: Â“The Lord binds [hasaq] himself to his people.Â” Hasaq speaks of a tethered love, a love attached to something or someone. IÂ’m picturing a mom connected by a child harness to her rambunctious five-year-old as the two of them walk through the market. (I once thought the leashes were cruel; then I became a dad.) The strap serves two functions, yanking and claiming. You yank your kid out of trouble and in doing so proclaim, Â“Yes, he is as wild as a banshee. But heÂ’s mine.Â”<br><br>In this case, God chained himself to Israel. Because the people were lovable? No. Â“GOD wasnÂ’t attracted to you and didnÂ’t choose you because you were big and importantÂ—the fact is, there was almost nothing to you. He did it out of sheer love, keeping the promise he made to your ancestorsÂ” (Deut. 7:7Â–8 MSG). God loves Israel and the rest of us because he chooses to.<br><br>Max Lucado</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Seeing the Big Picture </strong><br><br>Genesis 42:36<br>..."Everything is against me!"<br><br>Jacob had come to the end of his rope. He had lost Joseph. Simeon was in jail in Egypt. Now, in order to free Simeon, Benjamin, Jacob's youngest son, would have to go to Egypt. It was more than Jacob could handle. Jacob could not see the years of preparation for what would be the most exciting time of his life and the life of a nation. The darkest hour is the hour just before daybreak. Jacob was in his darkest hour just before God's daybreak in his life. God's big picture is often too big for us to comprehend. The heartaches don't seem to add up, but Jacob was about to understand the big picture.<br><br>Eventually, Benjamin along with Jacob's other sons learned that their brother Joseph was second in command in Egypt. Joseph revealed his identity, and Jacob was reunited with his son whom he had not seen for more than 13 years. He had thought Joseph to be dead.<br><br>So often we believe our dreams are dead. There seems to be nothing left in our world to live for. Everything appears to be against us. During these times, God is doing His deepest behind-the-scenes work. During these times, God is performing a deeper work in each of us-a work that cannot be seen.<br><br>When clients began leaving my ad agency and it dried up for no apparent reason, it appeared "everything was against me." I could not see that God was orchestrating a whole new calling on my life. At the moment, it seemed like the worst thing in the world. It seemed that I had been a failure. But God said, "No." All the years before had been preparation for what God's ultimate calling would be. One of God's methods for directing His children's steps is through drying up resources: a job loss, a career change, or a disaster. In these times we are willing to listen more intently, and to seek God in ways we would not normally do. C.S. Lewis once wrote, "God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains; it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world." [C.S.Lewis, The Problem of Pain (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1962), 93.]<br><br>Os Hillman</div>
