            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Constantly Challenged</strong><br>Rabbi Pinchas Avruch<br><br>This week's portion is the first from the book of Devarim, or Deuteronomy. The dictionary definition of Deuteronomy is "fifth book of the [Bible], derived from the Greek words deuteros ("second" ) and nomos ("law" )Â…it is a repetition of previous laws with an urgent appeal to obey them. Jews use the first word or first significant word of the text of each of the first five books of the Bible, or Pentateuch, as titles. Thus Deuteronomy is known in Hebrew as Devarim ("words" )."<br><br>It is no coincidence that the Rabbis aligned the calendar so that this portion is read this week. Before the repetition of the laws commenced, Moshe recounted the events that brought them to where they were on that day - the first of Shevat of the fortieth year since they left Egypt. The pivotal event that caused the trek to be one of forty years was the national tolerance of and concurrence with the slanderous report of the spies. "But you did not wish to ascend, and you rebelled against the word of Hashem, your G-d. You slandered in your tents and said, 'Because of Hashem's hatred for us did he take us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorite to destroy us...'" (1:26-27) So convinced were the entire Jewish people that their entry to the Holy Land was doomed that they spent the entire night weeping for their loss. For their acceptance of the report they were punished with forty years in the wilderness; but for their reaction, the Talmud in Tractate Ta'anis (which deals with the Jewish fasts)(29a) relates that Hashem responded, "You cried [this time] in vain; I will give you reason to cry through the generations." The night of this cry, the ninth of Av, would be the night that both Batei HaMikdash (Holy Temples, in Jerusalem) would be destroyed, that the revolt at Betar would be quashed, that the Temple Mount would be plowed over, that the Expulsion of Spanish Jewry following the Inquisition would occur. It would become a night that would be soaked in Jewish blood and Jewish tears.<br><br>And it was so avoidable. Inasmuch as the spies believed their motives were pure and noble, Moshe, Yehoshua (Joshua) and Calev knew that it was a mission fraught with spiritual dangers. Moshe added the letter "yud", a portion of Hashem's name, to Yehoshua's name, changing it from Hoshea, as a source of blessing and divine assistance. Calev went to Chevron, to Me'aras HaMachpailah (the Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs) to pray to Hashem that He grant him divine assistance in this mission. We know the spies were of the greatest Torah scholars of their time, pious devout people. Why did they not take the same precautions?<br><br>Michtav Me'Eliyahu (collected writings and discourses of Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler (1891-1954) of London and B'nai Brak, one of the outstanding personalities and thinkers of the Mussar movement) explains that the yetzer hara (internal desire to act contrary to G-d's will; in many experiences it is the side of the internal tug-of-war that pulls us to do what we know we should not) never gives up on his mission. When someone is well fortified in his dedication to the Divine Will, the yetzer hara feeds the feeling of accomplishment specifically to encourage the person to let his guard down, thus opening an opportunity for the yetzer hara to find success. This complacency is a key weapon of the yetzer.<br><br>This, continues Rabbi Dessler, was the error of ten spies. They assumed that because they were literally putting their lives at risk for the benefit of the Jewish people that this alone would arouse Hashem's mercy to protect them from the yetzer hara and his deceptions. In fact, this complacency was the root cause of their demise. Rabbi Dessler contrasts the spies to our patriarch Yitzchak (Isaac) at the time his father, Avraham, was tested with the charge of sacrificing his son. As they approached Mount Moriah (future home of the Bais HaMikdash), they got off their donkeys and carried their supplies, with Avraham placing the wood on Yitzchak's back. How could Avraham, the paradigm of chessed (acts of loving kindness), in the last moments before he would offer his beloved son, use him as a common wood carrier? Because even by adding to this most awesome trial some small additional element of challenge, Yitzchak maintained the intensity of his battle with his yetzer hara, not only assuring the success in the greater test, but more so, teaching Yitzchak one never "graduates" in the realm of spiritual growth.<br><br>Have a good Shabbos!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Taking Stock</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This week we begin Deuteronomy, the last of the five books of the Torah. In this portion we learn how as the Jewish nation neared the Promised Land, Moshe Rabeinu reviewed the nation's deeds and experiences during the years in the wilderness. There they were, about to begin one of the most incredible chapters in the existence of our nation. So why, we might ask, was it necessary to look into that generation's past deeds at such an auspicious moment? Wasn't this a time for looking toward the future?<br><br>We can better understand the need for taking stock by examining the following parable:<br><br>A servant of a king, after many years of faithful service, was about to be given a highly responsible position in the kings palace. He was even being allowed to take up residency in the palace itself! The day for the servant to move his possessions into his new royal quarters would soon approach. The servant, was naturally elated and proud. The king asked his second-in-command, to offer the royal resident-to-be some counseling. This was out of kindness to the servant, to prepare him for the future and its new demands. The advice came in the form of reviewing the servant's past record over the years. The counselor not only reviewed the deeds of the servant which had brought glory to the king, but also where he had fallen short in his duties. Bringing reality down to earth during such a heady moment in the servant's career would ensure that a sober attitude would accompany his joy. This attitude would then be the catalyst towards his successful serious service of the king.<br><br>So it was with the Jewish people. Moshe reviewed the past events during the nation's sojourn in the desert, both positive and otherwise. Precisely because of this review, they would be equipped with the best attitude for the serious business at hand. Soon they would take up residence in the "palace" of the Holy Land. This would bring with it the challenge of fulfilling the many commandments which only apply when living there. They would also be responsible for the many commandments connected to the building of and service in the Holy Temple. Thus, taking stock of past deeds was actually the wise advise of Moshe Rabeinu, the King's counselor to the Jewish nation. Only a sober attitude would enable them to be successful in their new position. They would experience the seriousness and the joy of their upcoming service of G-d in the Holy Land. Moshe had helped prepare their future in a practical way by examining their past record, not by touting a fancy future, free of any awareness of the magnitude of their responsibilities.<br><br>The Jewish concept of repentance hinges on this same idea. The sages say that when the Torah uses the word "atah" (spelled with an ayin), meaning "now", it refers to repentance. The underlying idea is that reflecting on the past is for the purpose of improving the present and the future. The focus is improvement. There is no room for depression or despair, as the future looks bright in the light of the committment to improve.<br><br>The student of Torah knows that what comes along with his glorious status of being a servant of G-d is the need for a serious attitude coupled with joy, to strengthen him as he builds a foundation toward spiritual goals. May we merit to see the culmination of our ultimate goal as a nation in the recognition of G-d's majesty the world over. Good Shabbos.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Unquestioned Answers<br>Recently, the expression that Jews traditionally wished each other before the start of the Tisha B'Av fast was replaced by what one might call a more evocative one. What was once "have an easy fast" has been transformed into "have a meaningful fast." While "easy" or "meaningful" are not necessarily contradictory, nevertheless, in order to make any fast meaningful, we first must understand why we are fasting. And in order to understand why we are fasting, we must think. A good place to begin is a verse in Eicha, the Book of Lamentations, composed by the prophet Yirmiyahu as he watched the Temple, and the society of his times, erode and crumble, and the Jewish people go into exile.<br><br>Despite suffering a terrible fate, seeing his leaders, his beloved people, and his cherished Temple all destroyed, he tells the nation: "Of what shall a living man complain? A strong man for his sins! Let us search and examine our ways, and return to Hashem" (Lamenetations 3:39-40).<br><br>The prophet's question, "Of what shall a living man complain?" is difficult to understand. People always complain. Didn't Yirmiyahu experience enough to complain about? Also why does Yirmiyahu ask about a living man? Dead men don't tell tales, and they don't complain either. So why the extra word?<br><br>Perhaps the second question answers the first, and the second verse emphasizes the answer.<br><br>The Chasam Sofer once met a very old man and asked him the secret of his longevity.<br><br>"I know that long life is a gift," the great sage said. "Tell me, what exemplary act did you do that merited you these long years?" The old man looked up and smiled. "Actually, I did nothing special. You see I have a different theory about long life. I stuck to my theory, and it worked for me."<br><br>"And what is that theory?" the great sage inquired.<br><br>The old man wrinkled his deeply lined face. "Like myself, all my friends went through their share of tzorus and misfortunes. We all do. They are, however, not here any longer. I am."<br><br>"But why?" prodded the Chasam Sofer. "That was exactly my question. What is the secret of your longevity? Yes! We all have our tzorus. But they didn't break you! You are still alive and in very good health. What is the difference between you and your friends?"<br><br>"You see," answered the old man., "my friends asked 'Why?' I, however, did not."<br><br>The Chasam Sofer seemed puzzled, but the man continued his monologue. "You see, every time tragedy struck, my friends would ask the Almighty, why did this happen? How did I come to deserve this? They would plead and prod the Creator for answers that no mortal mind could understand. And you know what happened?"<br><br>The Chasam Sofer shook his head, careful not to interrupt the man's train of thought.<br><br>"Hashem said, 'Do you really want to understand? Come, I will show you.' And so He took them to a place where all the mysteries of life are revealed, a place where the past and the future collide and today's actions are the answers to history's expostulations."<br><br>The man continued. "I, on the other, hand, was not so curious. And if I was, I did not turn to Hashem and ask, 'Why?' Rather, I accepted what happened."<br><br>Then the man's face began to glow. "And do you know what? He never invited me upstairs to explain anything!"<br><br>Perhaps the essence of our annual mourning service can be summed up with Yirmiyahu's word's that analyze a mortal approach to immortal justice. "Of what shall a living man complain? A strong man for his sins! Let us search and examine our ways, and return to Hashem."<br><br>We may have questions, but such questions do not require us to obsess about finding new answers. Instead, the only answer we can have is to search our own souls with introspection and return to Hashem.<br><br>In truth, we are not put in this world to demand answers. We are here to improve ourselves and ultimately, the world. And we are here to understand when to turn to our own lives for answers, instead of to the Almighty with questions, so that we may survive the tragedies with both faith and life intact.<br><br>Have a meaningful (and easy) fast.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Don't Forget</strong><br><br>In Parshas Va'eschanan we find the very famous portions of the Torah that are imbedded in the soul of the nation: The Ten Commandments and the Shema Yisrael.<br><br>Although every word of the Omnipotent carries equal force, these commanding portions are better known, if not better observed, by the nation.<br><br>But powerful as they are, they were not given in a vacuum. Moshe forewarns the nation not to forget the message of Sinai and to impart its message and its relevance to future generations.<br><br>Â“Only beware for yourself and greatly beware for your soul, lest you forget the things that your eyes have beheld and lest you remove them from your heart all the days of your life, and make them known to your children and your children's childrenÂ” (Deuteronomy 4:9).<br><br>In order to comprehend the posuk, it must separated into two distinct parts. Â“Beware not to forget the things that your eyes have beheld from your heart all your days.Â” In addition, the Torah adds, Â“you shall teach the Torah to your children and childrenÂ’s children.Â”<br><br>Nevertheless, the grammar is surely questionable, Â“lest you remove them from your heart all the days of your life, and make them known to your children.Â” In its simplest form, the verse seems at best contradictory. Look at the words. Beware that you do not remove the teachings from your heart and make them known to your children. How is that possible? If one removes the teaching from his own heart, how can he pass it to his children? The Torah should have overtly inserted some phrase or word clarifying the transition.<br><br>The perplexing composition in its simplest form surely leaves for a creative interpretation, perhaps the omission of the transitional word lends itself to a drash that deviates from the obvious meaning.<br><br>Thousands of people receive this weekly DÂ’var Torah. In return, I receive many stories for possible use as anecdotal parables. Here is one from the archives.<br><br>Junior came home from day camp one day without towel.<br><br>Â“Where is your towel?Â” asked his mom.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know,Â” he sighed. Â“I could not find it after swimming. Maybe someone took it.Â”<br><br>The mother was irate. Â“Who could have taken your towel? It was a great towel! Junior you would never take someone elseÂ’s towel. You know I raised you differently than that. Right?Â”<br><br>A few moments later, she was on the phone with the day camp director.<br><br>Â“Hello. There is a young thief in your camp!Â”<br><br>Â“How so?Â” Â“My son had a towel stolen from camp! He brought it in today and it was nowhereÂ”<br><br>Â“Calm down,Â” came the voice on the line. Â“I am sure that no one stole it. Please describe the towel to me.Â”<br><br>Â“Sure I can! It was white and big. You could not miss it. It had the words Holiday Inn emblazoned on it!Â”<br><br>The Leket Amarim interprets the verse in its purest and most simplistic form, revealing a deeper meaning that belies the simplicity of the verse.<br><br>Â“Only beware for yourself and greatly beware for your soul, lest you forget the things that your eyes have beheld and lest you remove them from your heart all the days of your life, and make them known to your children and your children's children.Â”<br><br>Often when it comes to our actions, we forget the principles that we were taught as youngsters, but we remember them when chiding our children and pontificating.<br><br>We may give our children a speech about honesty and integrity, and only minutes later command them to tell a caller on the telephone that, Â“my father is not home.Â”<br><br>We may give speeches about integrity and corporate greed only to have pushed our own portfolios in a certain direction through creative manipulation.<br><br>And so, the Torah warns us not to forget its principles for ourselves yet to teach them to our children. Consistency is the message of the moment. For yourself. For your children. For eternity<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Copyright Â© 2002 by Rabbi M. Kamenetzky<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I Have Just Begun to See</strong><br><br>Moshe begins this week's portion by telling the Jewish people how he pleaded with the Almighty to let him see the Land of Israel. He relates: "I implored Hashem at that time, saying: 'My Lord, Hashem you have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand, for what power is there in the heaven or on the earth that can perform according to Your deeds and according to Your mighty acts? Let me now cross and see the good Land that is on the other side of the Jordan, this good mountain and the Lebanon" (Deuteronomy 3:23-25).<br><br>The prelude and the plea seem disjointed. What connection is there between Moshe having begun to see "Hashem's greatness and strong hand," and his next request to enter the Land of Israel?<br><br>It is as if Moshe's stratagem is to tell Hashem, "I have just begun to see Your greatness, please let me culminate this great experience with a grand finale entering Israel." But that seems odd. Is it possible to compare the land he desires to enter with all he saw during the amazing desert trek?<br><br>Is there any sight comparable to the splitting of the sea? Will there be any produce as amazing as the manna? Will there be any water sweeter than that of the rock? Can Moshe honestly be hinting that Israel could be the apex of His glory, as opposed to an anticlimax to forty-years filled with miraculous events?<br><br>When I studied in Israel some twenty-five years ago, I often had occasion to speak to my father's cousin, Rabbi Shlomo Wolbe, author of Alei Shur (a profound mussar work), Mashgiach of Yeshiva Be'er Yaakov, and the founder of the Lehmann Bais HaMussar in Yerushalayim. A student of the great mussar luminaries of the previous generation, Rabbi Wolbe is a very soft-spoken man. In his quiet manner and measured words, his mussar message impacts thousands through profound talks and prolific writings.<br><br>I was at his home. My visit was more familial, than pedagogical, and I was discussing a bit about his Swedish roots and European topography. We came to the subject of the Swiss Alps. "I mentioned, that I heard in the name of the Brisker Rav, the revered mentor of Rav Wolbe's generation, that when the Moshiach will come, he will transport the Swiss Alps and transplant them in Israel.<br><br>Upon hearing me utter those words, Rav Wolbe's tranquil demeanor changed immediately. He stood up to his full height. There was fire in his eyes.<br><br>"Der Brisker Rav hut das kain mohl nisht gezagt! The Brisker Rav could never have said that!" he boomed. Rav Wolbe continued with a soliloquy whose passion never left me. "There are no mountains as beautiful as those in Tz'fas. There are no lakes as beautiful as the Kineret. And there is no city that sparkles like Jerusalem! Moshiach need not bring anything here! It is all here!"<br><br>I am not sure if on an aesthetic level, I am able to concur with his vision or comprehend the reality of his perspective. However, I do feel one thing. Though beauty and glory are subjective, the passion expressed by Rabbi Wolbe is one I, and I hope every Jew, strives to attain.<br><br>Perhaps Moshe was pleading as an expression of the Jew's eternal longing, appreciation, and passion for Eretz Yisrael. His statement, "Hashem, you have just started to show me the power and the glory" was though Moshe understood that all the miracles, the splitting of the sea, the miraculous manna, the water from the rock , were only a prelude to Eretz Yisrael and would not compare to the greatness attainable from the majestic experience of entering the land.<br><br>It is a longing every Jew should have, whether waiting for the redemption from a balcony in Boca, or atop a mountain villa perched high in the Swiss Alps.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br>Dedicated in memory of Ruth Alpert by Mr. and Mrs. Seymour Kramer.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Copyright Â© 2001 by Rabbi M.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Remnant That Prays </strong><br>Luke 11:1<br>One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When He finished, one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."<br><br>God is calling out a remnant of businesspeople throughout the world who understand the role of prayer in their business lives. These people have learned that prayer is not a five-minute exercise in the morning devotion time, but it is a vital strategic tool to discern and know God's will and purposes in their work lives. You see, they have learned that their business lives are their ministries to God and others.<br><br>These men and women have entered into covenant relationships with intercessory prayer partners who help discern the activities they should be involved in. Some even have paid staff who intercede for the decisions and activities in which they will be involved. They are a small remnant of businesspeople who know that skill and technique are not enough to fulfill God's purposes.<br><br>A servant of the Lord has well said: Prayer is the rail for God's work. Indeed, prayer is to God's will as rails are to a train. The locomotive is full of power: it is capable of running a thousand miles a day. But if there are no rails, it cannot move forward a single inch. If it dares to move without them, it will soon sink into the earth. It may be able to travel over great distances, yet it cannot go to any place where no rails have been laid. And such is the relation between prayer and God's work. Without any doubt God is almighty and He works mightily, but He will not and cannot work if you and I do not labor together with Him in prayer, prepare the way for His will, and pray "with all prayer and supplication" (Eph. 6:18 ) to grant Him the maneuverability to so work. Many are the things, which God wills to do, and would like to do, but His hands are bound because His children do not sympathize with Him and have not prayed so as to prepare ways for Him. Let me say to all who have wholly given themselves to God: Do examine yourselves and see if in this respect you have limited Him day after day. [Watchman Nee, Let Us Pray (New York, New York: Christian Fellowship Publishers, 1977), 11.]<br><br>Is prayer a vital part of your strategic business practices? Put prayer on the front lines, instead of making it an afterthought. You will begin to see renewed power in your work life.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Are You God's Next Deliverer? </strong><br>Judges 3:9<br>But when they cried out to the Lord, He raised up for them a deliverer, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, who saved them.<br><br>Have you ever heard of a man named Othniel? Probably not. He was Caleb's nephew. When the people of Israel went into the Promised Land, they were victorious through the courageous efforts of Joshua and Caleb. As this generation grew older, a new generation began to emerge. Israel again fell into sin by worshiping idols. The anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and He allowed them once more to be enslaved by their enemies. However, the people again cried out to the Lord and God heard them.<br><br>Whenever God's people cry out to the Lord, He hears them. When they are truly repentant, He responds. He responds by raising up those whom He has prepared for such a time. Every soldier looks forward to the day he can use the training he has received. God had been preparing a nephew for such a time as this. He had the same Spirit as his uncle, Caleb.<br><br>The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, so that he became Israel's judge and went to war. The Lord gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into the hands of Othniel, who overpowered him. So the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died (Judges 3:10-11).<br><br>Has God been preparing you for a time when you will be called upon to deliver God's people? Millions of men and women are enslaved to the god of mammon and idolatry in the workplace. Has He placed you there to be a deliverer? Pray that you will have the same Spirit as Joshua, Caleb, and Othniel.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Isolation Chamber </strong><br>Psalms 46:10<br>Be still and know that I am God....<br><br>There is a time and place in our walk with God in which He sets us in a place of waiting. It is a place in which all past experiences are of no value. It is a time of such stillness that it can disturb the most faithful if we do not understand that He is the one who has brought us to this place for only a season. It is as if God has placed a wall around us. No new opportunities--simply inactivity.<br><br>During these times, God is calling us aside to fashion something new in us. It is an isolation chamber designed to call us to deeper roots of prayer and faith. It is not a comfortable place, especially for a task-driven businessperson. Our nature cries out, "You must do something," while God is saying, "Be still and know that I am God." You know the signs that you have been brought into this chamber when He has removed many things from your life and you can't seem to change anything. Perhaps you are unemployed. Perhaps you are laid up with an illness.<br><br>Most religious people live a very planned and orchestrated life where they know almost everything that will happen. But for people in whom God is performing a deeper work, He brings them into a time of quietness that seems almost eerie. They cannot say what God is doing. They just know that He is doing a work that cannot be explained to themselves or to others.<br><br>Has God brought you to a place of being still? Be still and know that He really is God. When this happens, the chamber will open soon after.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>God Does His Best Work in Caves  </strong><br>This devotional was written by Robin Dugall<br><br>David left Gath and escaped to the cave of AdullamÂ—1 Samuel 22:1<br><br>Discouragement is a common emotion to us and is one of the great enemies of the Christ-following experience. It is an enemy of personal drive and vision.  It is a cancer that will pull enthusiasm and joy right out of you.  But it is also a test, because how you respond to discouragement when things are not going well is one of the most important challenges that you will ever face as a person who loves and follows Jesus.<br><br>During the reign of King Saul, a prophet of God, Samuel, anointed young David as king.  Even before he served as king, the people of the kingdom immediately fell in love with David.  Everything he touched turned to gold.  He was victorious over one of IsraelÂ’s most feared enemies, Goliath.  When King Saul struggled with emotional issues, David was there to comfort him.  If there was ever a guy who was on a roll, it was David.  It appeared that nothing could go wrong for him.  Then, one by one, the tables turned. Look over this litany of loss on DavidÂ’s part:<br><br>He lost his job.  He went from shepherd boy to acclaimed warrior to fugitive.<br>He lost his popularity, status and income.<br>He lost his wife when King Saul gave her to another man.<br>He lost his mentor when Samuel died.<br>He lost his best friend Jonathan.<br>He lost his home.  The Bible tells us that he eventually ran to Gath, the land of IsraelÂ’s enemies.<br>After all that David went through, he ended up in the cave of Adullam.  He expected a palace but got a cave!  Devastating!<br><br>Does a cave sound like a place youÂ’ve visited before?  The Cave is where you go when all the props, crutches, and all that hold you up gives way; when suddenly, things donÂ’t work out as youÂ’ve envisioned.  Maybe youÂ’ve lost a job, financial security, spouse, dream of family life, mentor, friend or health.  WeÂ’ve all been there.  The truth is, sooner or later, everybody logs some serious time in The Cave.<br><br>But, The Cave is where God does some of His best work.  God molds and shapes us in The Cave like nowhere else.  When you end up in The Cave, I encourage you to welcome it.  Why?  Because when all youÂ’ve got is God, you quickly come to the realization, that He is enough.  Mother Teresa once said, Â“YouÂ’ll never know Jesus is all you need, until Jesus is all youÂ’ve got.Â”  He is able to transform discouragement into encouragement. He transforms fear into confidence. He is able to bring new life out of the most desperate of circumstances.  Are you in The Cave?  Look for Jesus.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Be Authentic  </strong><br>This devotional was written by Jim Burns<br><br>Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it - he will be blessed in what he does.<br>Â— James 1:22-25<br><br>To make a difference in your world you've got to be real. There is nothing worse than a holier-than-thou Christian who never shares his hurts and sorrows. I don't know about you, but I can't relate to perfection. Authentic people make a difference in the world.<br><br>I heard recently of a minister in the Midwest who was going for a walk with a soap salesman in the community who was a real skeptic toward Christianity. They were having quite an active debate while walking through the park. The businessman was getting in some good jabs at the inconsistency of Christians.<br><br>As they were walking through the park the soap salesman questioned the minister, "How can you say that Christianity works when even within the inner-city park you see derelicts of every kind, drugs, and prostitutes? Then you have the problems of the family, war, and disease, not to mention the negative problems of the world. How can you say that Christianity works? Just look around-it's not working." They walked in silence for a few moments, and then the minister turned to him and said, "You're a soap salesman, right?" "Yes, of course," was the reply. "Is it good soap?" "It's the best soap on the market!" was the comment of the salesman. The minister turned and pointed to a small child playing in the park who was covered with dirt and grime, and said, "This boy is dirty and filthy from the mud in the park; doesn't your soap help him?" The salesman said, "Well, you've got to apply the soap." The minister's response was, "So it is with the Christian faith. You must apply the Christian faith in order for it to work."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What Fuel are You Running On?  </strong><br>This devotional was written by Robin Dugall<br><br>Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.Â—Ephesians 5:19-20<br><br>No one can debate that the current rise in gasoline prices is driving most people crazy.  Despite the forces that have contributed to the price hike, many of us would do just about anything to pay less for those precious gallons of gas.  Just about a month ago, I took my four-wheel-drive truck for a short trip up to the mountains.  It didnÂ’t take long to experience a major shock when the final bill for filling up the gas tank topped $50.  If it had been possible, I would have tried about any other type of fuel just to save a buck or two.  Most scientists say that we are getting closer to the wider availability of alternative fuels for our automobiles.  These may come from corn, from garbage, or from a series of batteries charged by the sunÂ… who knows?  But even with the new fuels, our vehicles will have to be modified to run effectively on them.  Think about it.  WouldnÂ’t it be fantastic if your car could run on any type of fuel?  Maybe one day weÂ’ll be sitting around with our friends asking each other, Â“What type of fuel are you running on?Â”<br><br>Have you ever considered what type of fuel your heart was designed to run on?  Did you know that just as a vehicle needs the right kind of fuel and the body needs its fuel of food and rest to work properly, so the heart of a person has been designed by God to run best with a full tank?  You know what fills the tank of the heart?  Worship.  Worship is essentially a life lived in vital communion with God.  Once the heart is vibrantly alive by the presence of God, that energy is then released in a lifestyle that continues to honor Him.  Believe me when I say that there is nothing that gets the Â“motors of the heartÂ” running more than a life lived in relationship with Jesus, and according to His purposes.  Loving people, loving God, and living our lives as ambassadors for His Kingdom will not zap the inner resources of those who are being constantly Â“filled upÂ” by the fuel of worship. The worship of our God Â– whether experienced through song, silence, confession, prayers, longings, acclamations, tears, shouts, bowed heads, lifted hands or obedient lives Â– is what keeps us in the place where life has its most powerful meaning.<br><br>You can try other fuels for your life, but eventually, your tank will run dry.  Relationships will disappoint you. Work will not always satisfy your desire for ultimate purpose in life.  Your money can disappear, and achievements donÂ’t always pan out to bring our lives what we thought they might bring.  Real significance and fulfillment can only be experienced with the fuel of worship.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Going Without Jesus </strong><br>Luke 2:43<br>...they were unaware of it.<br><br>Mary and Joseph traveled to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. Jesus was 12 years old. They were evidently very distracted by the excitement and business of the Feast. In fact, Mary and Joseph began their return trip to Nazareth only to realize well into the trip that Jesus was not with them. It would be three days before they would be reunited with their 12-year-old son. It caused quite a scare in Mary and Joseph, and they reprimanded Jesus for "wandering" off.<br><br>As a parent, I find this story truly amazing. How can parents of the Son of God not know their son is not in their presence? Yet this story illustrates how each of us can become so busy that we continue to operate not realizing that Jesus is no longer with us. Obviously, there was very little fellowship taking place between Jesus and His parents during the trip.<br><br>Are you experiencing daily, even moment-by-moment, fellowship with Jesus? If not, you will wake up one day and realize Jesus is not with you in your endeavors. It may, like Mary and Joseph, create a certain fear in you that you may have lost a very important relationship. Doing business without Jesus' presence leaves us powerless and prone to live in fear. Jesus said He would never leave or forsake His children. However, we can walk away from His fellowship by refusing to be with Him. Do not let this happen to you. He longs to have daily fellowship with you because He loves you.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.<br><br>Several years ago, a movie was made called Field of Dreams. The story is about a man who had a vision to build a baseball field in the middle of a cornfield on his rural farm. He did not know why; he just knew he was to do it. To the chagrin of his neighbors, he built the baseball diamond in the farm community. One night some players showed up. The man realized these were no ordinary players, but were actually the great players from the past. When the skeptical neighbors came to view this phenomenon, they were unable to see what the farm owner could see. This made it even worse for him. Now he was really a lunatic in their eyes.<br><br>This fictitious story has a spiritual application for us. First, if God tells us to "build a ball field," we should do it. It is not for us to determine the reason we are instructed to do it. Once we are obedient, God will allow us to see what others cannot see. It is the rite of passage for those who are willing to risk all for God's purposes. God increases the spiritual senses to levels we never knew before. Those around us will observe this.<br><br>Do you want to see what others cannot see? If so, it will require a level of obedience that will go beyond human reason. It may require risk and ridicule from others. But you will see what others cannot see.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Moving in Presumption </strong><br>Numbers 14:44<br>Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the high hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the Lord's covenant moved from the camp.<br><br>The people of Israel were brought out of Egypt to enter a new land-the Promised Land. This land was not handed over to them freely; it required the removing of God's enemies through battle. It required a partnership between God and the people. As long as the people remained true to God, they were victorious.<br><br>The people were camped at Kadesh Barnea, near the border entrance to the long-awaited Promised Land. All the hardships of their journey from Egypt were now culminating at this important crossing. However, Joshua and Caleb were the only scouts who proclaimed faith in God to take them into the land and conquer their enemies. The other spies saw all the dangers and refused to take the risk. The people of the camp shrank in fear because of their report. They decided not to enter in.<br><br>God was angered at the people for their lack of faith. Moses had to intercede on their behalf. Once they realized what they had done, it was too late. But they thought their repentance was enough to right their wrong. They presumed this was all that was necessary.<br><br>Moses informed them they were deceived in their presumption of God's favor. They went to battle against the Amalekites only to be soundly defeated. Those who returned did not understand why they lost the battle.<br><br>It is important for us to know whether we have God's hand upon our endeavors. Presumption leads to failure. God's favor leads to success. Ask God to confirm His hand on your endeavors.<br><br>..."If Your presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here" (Exodus 33:15).<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Film Director<br>This devotional was written by Kelly McFadden<br><br>Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.Â—1 Corinthians 11:1<br><br>The role of the film director is to track the artistic and dramatic vision of a film, control the context and flow, direct the performance of actors, select shoot locations, and manage technical details.  The directorÂ’s role is complex and large; however, you may be surprised to learn that the director, although having a highly important and prestigious job, does not have the final say on a film.  It is not the director who ultimately chooses how things end up.  That role belongs to the producer, who makes decisions based on different criteria: the network, the production company and the studio.  So it is the director who follows the producer.<br><br>In my life, I have a director and a producer.  For the past few years, I have sought out the advice of an older woman who has experienced an incredibly fulfilling Christ-centered life.  She has a marriage and attitude I want to model my life after because she always puts the Lord first.  Whenever we get the opportunity to see each other, she is always asking how things are going and inquiring into what the Lord is teaching me.  She helps keep me on track Â– always loving me, but making sure I am living within the parameters the Lord has set out for me.  I try to follow her example as she follows ChristÂ’s example.<br><br>Even though she is a wonderful leader for me, I do not follow her blindly.  She is not my ultimate guide.  It is whom she follows that matters.  Like a director who makes many decisions but ultimately reports to a producer, this mentor looks to the Lord for guidance and direction, and encourages me to look there as well.<br><br>Do you have a director in your life?  Someone who can speak into your life with the wisdom of Christ and say, Â“follow me as I follow ChristÂ”?  It is crucial to surround yourself with people who can help guide you in your Christian walk.  We all need someone who can help catch us before we stray too far, encourage us as we make decisions, and love us no matter what.   Mostly, we need to have someone who will  make sure we are looking the right direction, keeping our eyes on Christ.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arrhythmia of the Soul  </strong><br>This devotional was written by Jim Liebelt<br><br>See to it, brothers, than none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sinÂ’s deceitfulness. We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly to the end the confidence we first had.Â—Hebrews 3:12-13<br><br>One night, lying in bed, something didnÂ’t feel quite right. I was experiencing a strange sensation in my chest. Checking my pulse, I couldnÂ’t find anything that resembled a normal rhythm. Talk about a strange feeling! I got up and walked around the house, hoping my heart would kick back into normal rhythm. It didnÂ’t. The odd thing was that I didnÂ’t feel bad physically, but just had that strange sensation in my chest. I returned to bed and spent a restless night of sleep.<br><br>In the morning when I got up, I still had the strange sensation. I did all of my normal morning routines including working out, but my pulse was still all over the map. Finally, later in the morning I called my doctor and got in to see him right away. He performed an electrocardiogram on me and found that I had an arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. Apparently, many people have this problem. ItÂ’s something that people can live with over a long period of time, but left untreated, some people can never return to a normal rhythm. Realizing that this was a new occurrence for me, the doctor sent me to the hospital where my heart was shocked back into normal rhythm. Since then, itÂ’s been important to me to learn to manage the triggers of this arrhythmia, making sure that I get enough sleep, and avoid too much caffeine and stress.<br><br>This experience reminded me that many of us also experience arrhythmia of the soul. We sense that something is not quite right with our souls. Perhaps our passion for pursuing Christ has waned. Perhaps our joy in life has diminished. Perhaps our behaviors are no longer reflecting a commitment to Christ. Perhaps our prayers have become just one more thing to check off our Â“to-doÂ” list and it seems they just bounce back off the ceiling. We feel dry spiritually. We sense something isnÂ’t right.<br><br>In those moments, before too much time passes, before we lose the sensation of something being wrong, itÂ’s wise to take action. We are all vulnerable to becoming used to a sickly soul; believing that everything is okay when it really isnÂ’t. Arrhythmia of soul, left untreated, robs us of the full and healthy spiritual life that God intends for us to have. Fortunately, through self-evaluation, confession, prayer, the study of the Scriptures, and encouragement and counsel from fellow Christ-followers, God provides the means to regain a healthy rhythm of the soul.<br><br>Today, if you are feeling a strange sensation of the soul, donÂ’t ignore it. Run quickly to the Great Physician who is able to make you whole once again.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Letting Go of the Myth </strong><br>This devotional was written by Mike DeVries<br><br>The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.Â—Zephaniah 3:16<br><br>From my spot as first base coach, the situation looked pretty dire. The Orioles, my sonÂ’s team, was in the first game of a three-game series for the league championship. It was the top of the fourth inning and we were losing 7-2.<br><br>The bases were loaded with one out, and into the batterÂ’s box steps #17, my son. A week earlier, he had missed a home run by a few feet. I donÂ’t know what he was thinking, but I was thinking, Â“Now would be a pretty good time.Â”<br><br>Strike one. Ball one. Strike Two. Ball Two.<br><br>As the pitcher released the next pitch, I could see that it was going to be a strike. At that moment, everything came together. The swing of the bat. The crack of the ball. It was a deep fly ball to right field, which had definite possibilities. I remember thinking, Â“That ball could be out of here.Â”<br><br>The right fielder went back the fence and looked up Â– a Grand Slam.<br><br>When my son reached home plate, he was mobbed by his teammates. One of the younger players watching the game ran out into the parking lot to retrieve the ball. IÂ’ll never forget the look in my sonÂ’s eyesÂ…it was like a dream come true.<br><br>In fact it was. All season he had talked about what it would feel like to hit a home run. I even found him after practice one day, swinging the bat and Â“watchingÂ” the ball as it went out over the right field fence. Â“Someday,Â” the look on his face told me.<br><br>As I tucked him in bed the night, he clutched the ball. I lay down next to him to relive the moment. Â“What was it like to hit a ball that far? How does it finally feel to hit a home run?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“Good. But you know what, I still feel like me.Â”<br><br>I think we live with a myth that weÂ’ll finally be somebody when we accomplish whatever it is we think we want to accomplish in life. Â“If only I couldÂ…Â” becomes the defining thought of our lives Â– hoping and awaiting to arrive Â– Â“Â… then, IÂ’ll be somebody.Â”<br><br>But the fact of the matter is this: If you are not enough without it, youÂ’ll never be enough with it.<br><br>As you look in the mirror, deeply searching the image you see, what are you living for? Are you living the myth of someday Â– seeing your identity and worth wrapped up in the attainment of that elusive dream?<br><br>Perhaps itÂ’s time to remember that God sees you as enough without it, so attaining that dream isnÂ’t going to change a thing. Perhaps itÂ’s time to let go of the myth, and be embraced by the One who sees you as one who as already arrived.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Command of Love</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>"And you shall love the L-rd your G-d..." [Dev. 6:5]<br><br>How does one command love? We may think that regarding love, you either have it, or you don't. That, however, must not be correct -- for if it were, it couldn't be a Commandment. We must have tools in hand that help us to develop this love.<br><br>Both the Sefer HaChinuch and the Rambam (Maimonides) list all of the Commandments, and approach this one in much the same way. They quote the Midrash, which reads (in approximate translation) as follows:<br><br>"When the Torah says 'And you shall love the L-rd your G-d', I do not know how one is to love the Supreme Being. Thus the Torah says 'And these words, which I command you this day, shall be upon your hearts...' [v. 6], because from this a person will come to recognize He Who spoke and created the world." The Sefer HaChinuch explains: By concentrating upon Torah, love for G-d will come naturally into your heart. How? If we think about His actions and His ways, we will come to recognize him according to our abilities, and that recognition will afford us great enjoyment.<br><br>The scholars of the Midrash, the author of the Sefer HaChinuch, and Maimonides -- all say essentially the same thing: deep involvement in Torah learning, if done with the proper intent and desires, brings a person to recognition of his Creator.<br><br>The Toldos Yaakov Yosef says that at the very core of all of Torah and Mitzvos, and our prayers, is preparation to come to fulfillment of "And you shall love the L-rd your G-d..."<br><br>Similarly, Maimonides lists love of G-d at the very beginning of his list of Mitzvos, immediately after belief in G-d's existence. The same is true in his 14-volume work on the full breadth of Jewish law -- it is found in the first volume, Fundamentals of Torah, after belief.<br><br>The Nesivos Shalom asks: if it is true that love of G-d is so important, so central, then why is it not found until now, in the book of Devarim? Devarim is called "Mishneh Torah," review of Torah, because in it Moshe reviews the lessons learned with the Children of Israel. If this is such an important Mitzvah, why isn't it found with "I am HaShem your G-d," G-d's first words to the Jewish People in the Ten Commandments?<br><br>His answer again refers to to the concept that all the other Commandments, especially Torah learning, prepare and enable us to love G-d. He says that since love of G-d is not something that comes directly to the heart of a person, but rather is something we cannot feel properly without development in learning and Mitzvos -- the Mitzvah is to do all the preparation, to heal ourselves of the things which block our hearts from love of G-d, and thus to come to feel that love properly.<br><br>Only after learning Torah and doing Mitzvos can one hope to come to the appropriate level of love of G-d. It's not something that happens overnight. So it is appropriate to teach this Mitzvah in Devarim, after teaching us the Torah, Mitzvos, all of the ways we can follow in His Pathways -- because these are the things which help us achieve love of G-d.<br><br>It is certainly possible for a person to learn for a while, do some Mitzvos, and wonder why he or she doesn't feel more. Isn't the sky supposed to open up, or something similarly profound supposed to happen? The answer is that nothing like that is guaranteed, or even expected. Judaism isn't about leaps of faith, but about slow, logical steps, a progression of ongoing development and self-perfection. This is something that lasts a lifetime -- the obligation isn't to feel everything tomorrow, but to begin taking the necessary steps to achieve that feeling, today!<br><br>Good Shabbos,<br><br>Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That Ye Increase More and More<br><br>"For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness ... to love one another ... that ye increase more and more." 1 Thessalonians 4:7-10<br><br>It is the way of wisdom to make principle and practice go together. In relation to spiritual things, we often find many who seek to separate what God has united. For example, some make the Gospel nothing more than a system of moral duties, creeds, form, and tradition. Others omit duty altogether, and seek to established their own peculiar views of its doctrines. Both of these concepts are "wrong in themselves," apart from one another.<br><br>A superstructure is nothing without a foundation. Neither is a foundation anything without a superstructure. Each has its appropriate place; both are equally important; and each complements the other. The superstructure will fall without an adequate foundation. The foundation is basically useless without some type of superstructure built upon it. Paul wrote, "As a wise master builder" laid his foundation deep and secure, he then proceeded to carefully raise upon it a beautiful edifice to the glory of God.<br><br>Paul taught new Believers the importance of being "grounded in their Faith" so they would not be easily persuaded by the Deceiver. He taught them to be "steadfast in their stand" so they would not fall when they encountered persecution, trials, and adversity. It was imperative for them to have "knowledge of the Truth," for it would be the foundation upon which their whole Christian experience and faith would be built. He realized how important it was for these truths to be not only firmly established in their minds, but to penetrate their hearts, and become applicable and effective in their everyday lives, putting into practice the faith they held dear and proclaimed to others.<br><br>It is wonderful to see people receive Christ as their Saviour and Lord, but sad to see a stagnant life that does not "grow in grace and knowledge of His Word." Often the problem lies with us for not coming alongside of these new converts to encourage and disciple them in their Spiritual Journey. We need to stand with them, encourage them in the Word, and pray that God will create within their hearts a hunger and thirst for His Word, so that they will be established in the faith. That was heavy upon Paul's heart in writing to these new Believers in Thessalonica. He was anxious to return unto them in order to "perfect [bring to maturity or completeness] that which was lacking in their faith."<br><br>Principle and Practice ... Truth and Application ... must complement one another, bound together with one objective and one purpose. The same principle carries through when James wrote concerning Paul's teaching on Faith. He wrote, "Faith, if it hath not works is dead. You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my works." James was simply saying that Principle and Practice go hand in hand. Truth and Application must stand inseparably together. Paul rejoices in the progress they had made, but seeks to encourage them to excel and press forward to even greater attainments in holiness, commitment to God, and a deepening of their love to God and to one another. The challenge is also to us today. Paul says, "As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord [by faith], so walk in Him." May this be the desire of our hearts: "That in all things He will be magnified."<br><br>Ed Powell</div>
