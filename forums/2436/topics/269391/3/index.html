And [the serpent] said to the woman, 'Did God really say, "Do not eat of every tree of the garden?"'"  Breshiyt (Genesis) 3:1<br><br>"Did God really say...?"  It's the question of every curious mind, and the assertion of every rebellious heart.  Adonai 'Elohiym had spoken Creation into existence through His Word, only to have doubt immediately cast upon Him.  With one simple question, the Creator's authority was undermined, His sovereignty questioned:  "Did God really say...?"<br><br>Did God really say not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil?  Did God really say that the man and woman would die if they did?  Whether we are being seduced by a snake or questioning our own convictions, it always comes back to one thing: "Did God really say...?"  Though our hearts and minds may defiantly pose the question, what's most important is that we get the right answer--and that we trust that it's true, despite the lies we might otherwise believe.<br><br>P R A Y E R<br><br>Adonai 'Elohiym, I praise Your great Name! Remove from my heart any spot of rebelliousness that would haughtily question your ways. Teach me Your truth, O God, and guide me through the lies that cast doubt upon Your Word. I bless You, Uncreated One, for you show me the ways of your simple truth, that I may trust and hold fast to every word You say...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Walk Habitually Before Me</strong><br><br>"...Adonai appeared to Av'ram and said to him, 'aniy-el shadai (I am God Almighty) -- walk habitually before Me, and be perfect....  This is My covenant which you [must] keep...: Every male of your [offspring] is to be circumcised... [in] the flesh of your foreskin, and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and you.'" B'reshiyt (Genesis) 17:1-11<br><br>When we are far from the Lord, sometimes it is not fear that is our worst enemy, but forgetfulness.  It is in this frame of mind that we seek solutions in our own strength, and the promises of God are absorbed into oblivion.  This is how Adonai found Av'ram in his ninety-ninth year:  father of a teenage son, yet childless with regard to the covenant.<br><br>Our father Av'raham received the mark of circumcision as a reminder to never forget the covenant Adonai made with the sons of Yis'rael.  Faith and obedience will always be under attack by forces bent on derailing us from our destiny.  So, at the place that our faith always fails -- in our flesh -- Adonai marked us for Himself.   It is a sign between Adonai and the children of Yis'rael forever, saying, "walk habitually before Me... obey, have faith, and remember...."<br><br>P R A Y E R<br><br>Adonai, God of Av'raham, through faith and obedience do I "get [myself] away" from my former life and into "the land which [You will] show [me]."  I praise You, for You are my shield -- you never fail to restore my faith even when fear and doubt overwhelm me.  Thank you, Lord, for calling and marking me as Your own, that I may be the beneficiary of the covenant You made with my father Av'raham.  I bless Your Name, Adonai, for You are forever faithful to remember your promises -- even when I continually and habitually forget...<br><br></div>
