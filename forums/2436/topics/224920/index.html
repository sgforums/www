            <div class='col-md body'>hello, i am back again...juz tot of posting another thread on one of those fine line issues...so clear or dead conscience, is there a diff? below is my illustration...<br><br>a man is dying of cancer, everyday he has to take large doses of painkillers to ease himself from the sufferings. after taking painkillers, the pain leaves him. he can nw feel at ease for next few hrs. nw the qn is: has the pain indeed left him? the man is nt in pain anymore for few hrs but is the pain stil there? sadly the answer is yes. the truth is the pain nvr left him. it was n has been there all along. the man dun feel it cos the nerves of tat particular organ had been numbed. hence he cun feel the pain though the pain is stil there...<br><br>wad does the above illustration mean? u see, a dead conscience is juz like the effects of painkillers. i have heard many who do undesirable things then say: my conscience is clear...is tat realli true? or is it cos they have done the same undesirable act so many times until they no longer tink its wrong? in tis case, its nt a clear conscience we r toking abt...its a dead conscience. a cead conscience has no guilt, shame or remorse. but the absence of these feelings doesnt mean our conscience is clear. truth is these feelings stil exist but because we have done the same wrong thing so many times, our conscience has been numbed to guilt, shame n remorse. in fact, a dead conscience is wad cos many to keep sinning wilfully.<br><br>forumers, be careful when u say u have a clear conscience. examine urself...make sure its realli a clear conscience n nt a dead conscience. most of the time, when we do wrong, we wil feel guilt, shame n remorse but when we do wrong so often, these feelings wil slowly seem to fade away over time. though truth is they r stil there, we can no longer feel them.<br><br>like wad adolf hitler once said: a lie when told often enuff, loud enuff n big enuff, it becomes a truth...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A dead conscience could also result from the lack of knowledge of God and His Word. If we truly had a relationship with God, we would endeavour to be sensitive to His Spirit and the last thing we would want to do is continue sinning until we are so deceived that our conscience dies</div>

What I think in my conscience may not be acceptable to your conscience, which is why we have always got to return to the Word and see what it says. The Word is our ultimate judge, irrespective of whether we "feel" something is good or bad, right or wrong.</div>
