            <div class='col-md body'>I am posting this as something for us to consider... breytonhartge<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Scripture says that the old serpent called the Devil and Satan has deceived the whole world (Rev. 12:9). Do you realize just how deep that deception is? This article will reveal some of the depths of deception to those who are able to receive it.</span></strong><br><br>To many Christians the above question would be blasphemous to even contemplate! They would never even consider the thought much less study like the noble Bereans of whom it is written in the Scriptures: "Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica who received the word with great eagerness, and searched the Scriptures daily, if these words were so." (Acts 17:11)<br><br>But knowing that the Scriptures reveal to us: "And the great dragon was thrown out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who leads all the world astray." (Rev. 12:9)<br><br>In light of this, does it not behoove us to study the Scriptures in order to see if we too have been led astray by the old serpent, called the Devil and Satan? More so in light of the following Scripture which explicitly tells us that salvation comes in only one exclusive name: "And there is no deliverance in anyone else, for there is no other name under the heaven given among men by which we need to be saved." (Acts 4:12)<br><br>Is it not evident then according to the above quoted verse that if Satan wants to keep us from being saved or delivered all he has to do is to deceive us into calling on another name rather than the one exclusive name that has been given for that very purpose by our Creator?<br><br>I am always shocked and amazed at the ignorance of the Creator's professed people who cannot understand the simple fact that one is one and never two, three, four, five, etcÂ… Now surely if there is only one name given how can these professed believers say that it doesnÂ’t matter what name they call on? Are they not deceived by that old serpent Satan the Devil if they are calling on any other name other than that one exclusive name that was given by our Creator Himself? Surely you can see that the only answer to our questions isÂ—yes, they have most definitely been deceived!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>WHO OR WHAT IS BAAL?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To find the answer to this question a good place to begin is using the StrongÂ’s Hebrew Dictionary.</span><br><br>#1167 baÂ’al, bahÂ’al; from 1166; a master; hence a husband, or (fig.) owner (often used with another noun in modification of this latter sense):- + archer, + babbler, + bird, captain, chief man, + confederate, + have to do, + dreamer, those to whom it is due, + furious, those that are given to it, great, + hairy, he that hath it, have, +horseman, husband, lord, man, + married, master, person, + sworn, they of.<br><br>Now if these were the only uses of the word baal we really couldnÂ’t complain could we? Why? Because even Scripture reveals that YAHWEH was a husband to Israel. (cf. Isa. 54:5; Jer. 31:32). This in Hebrew would be YAHWEH is baal to Israel. Thus, baal is used in a good sense. But this is not the only usage of the word base as we shall show.<br><br>#1168 baÂ’al, bahÂ’al; the same as 1167; Baal, a Phoenician deity:-Baal, (plur.) Baalim.<br><br>Here we bind another Baal, a bad one, a false deity. Can we find out more about this false deity? Yes, let me quote page 1212 in the Explanatory Notes of The Scriptures:<br><br>BaÂ’al: This word it seems, gradually became a proper name. A similar Semitic word derives from the Aryan root Bhal, which means "to shine," according to some. According to W. H. RoscherÂ’s well-known lexicon of mythology, BaÂ’al (Bel, Belos) was the ancestral and national deity of the Semites, and says that BaÂ’al was the founder of Babel (Babylon), according to secular history. He is identified with Zeus, Jupiter, Ammon, Asshur, Assur, Kronos, and Bel-Markud. Morris Jastrow, Max MÃ¼ller, and W. H. Roscher all three agree: Baal is the Babylonian sun deity. The BaÂ’als of the nations were sun deities, and BaÂ’al worship means sun worship.<br><br>Quite revealing isnÂ’t it? Now, would YAHWEH appreciate it if we called Him after the name of a false deity? A closer look at a couple of Scriptures will answer that question easily! Let us see just what the Mind of YAHWEH is in regards to the above question.<br><br>"And in all that I have said to you take heed. And make no mention of the name of other mighty ones, let it not be heard from your mouth," Ex. 23:13.<br><br>"...And make no mention of the name of their mighty ones, nor swear by them, nor serve them, nor bow down to them," Josh. 23:7.<br><br>YAHWEH has explicitly spoken to us by the above verses of Scripture not to mention the name of the other mighty ones even to the point that they not be heard coming out of our lips. So the answer to our question is: NO! YAHWEH would not be pleased if we called Him by the name of any other mighty one! So YAHWEH would not be pleased if we called Him Baal in the bad sense. But how is it we can call Him Baal in a good sense and be right but yet use the same word and it be in a wrong sense and YAHWEHÂ’S anger burn against us? What is the answer to this apparent contradiction of YAHWEH'S word?<br><br>To find the answer look again at StrongÂ’s #1167. Read it again, please. Did you see the answer? ItÂ’s really simple! Notice that it says: #1167 Baal isÂ…. (often used with another noun in modification of this latter sense.):<br><br>But what does this mean? To find the answer we need to research a few more Scriptures that will shed much needed light on the subject. The three Scriptures I want us to look at relate to a place in Syria called Baal Gad.<br><br>"Thus YAHshua took all this land: the mountain country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the low country, and the desert plain, and the mountains of Yisrael and its low lands, from Mount Halag that goes up to Seir, and as far as Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon below Mount HermonÂ…," Josh. 11:16-17.<br><br>"And these are the sovereigns of the land which YAHshua and the children of Israel smote beyond the Jordan, on the west, from Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon as far as Mount Halaq that goes up to Seir, which YAHshua gave to the tribes of Israel as a Possession according to their divisions," Josh. 12:7.<br><br>"And the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon as far as the entrance to Hamath," Josh. 13:5.<br><br>Have you noticed that in each of the above quoted texts reference is made to a place called Baal Gad? Just what and where was this place called Baal Gad? LetÂ’s again go to the StrongÂ’s Hebrew Dictionary for the answer.<br><br>#1171 Baal Gad, bahÂ’al gawd; from 1168 and 1409; Baal of Fortune: Baal Gad, a place in Syria:- Baal-gad.<br><br>Now that wasnÂ’t much of an answer was it? We still havenÂ’t found out who or what Baal of Fortune was. Let us dig deeper to find out the truth by looking up the reference that was given under StrongÂ’s #1409 for more light.<br><br>#1409 gad, gawd; from 1464 (in the sense of distributing); fortune:- troop.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>WORD GAMES</strong><br><br>Now that still doesnÂ’t give us much light, you might say. YouÂ’re just giving us the run around with word games, you might say. Well, thatÂ’s exactly what Satan, that old deceiver wants you to think! You see, he doesnÂ’t want you to be diligent seekers for truth. He doesnÂ’t want you digging up in the treasure house of the Hebrew language, because if you do, he knows you will find out the deceptive word games heÂ’s played on you!<br><br>DidnÂ’t YAHshua tell us our search for truth would be like searching for hidden treasure? (c.f. Mt. 13:44). Do you find hidden treasure just lying on top of the ground or do you have to take a spade or shovel and work hard, digging to find it?<br><br>Believe me, the answer was revealed under StrongÂ’s #1409 if you know where to find the Scripture that reveals this false deityÂ—Baal of fortune! Actually it will be quite revealing once you see it!<br><br>"But you are those who forsake YAHWEH, who forget My set-apart mountain, who prepare a table for Gad [that troop, KJV], and who fill a drink offering for Meni [than number, KJV]. And I shall allot you to the sword, and let you bow down to the slaughter, because I called and you did not answer, I spoke and you did not hear, and you did evil before My eyes and chose that in which I did not delight," Isa. 65:11-12.<br><br>If you have a KJV Bible, you will find for Gad it says "that troop" (StrongÂ’s #1409). In fact many Bibles have center or side column references that inform the readers that (that troop) or Gad is a false deity!<br><br>This can also be discovered by looking at StrongÂ’s #1408.<br><br>#1408 Gad, gad; a var. of 1409; Fortune, a Bab. Deity:- that troop.<br><br>Here is where Satan has played word games to deceive the whole world into worshipping a false Babylonian deity of Fortune! But who is really being worshipped behind the name of this ancient idol Baal-Gad? And how has Satan accomplished this so easily? Word Games! Remember Acts 4:12 (Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven whereby we must be saved. Remember that YAHshua also said, "...if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive." )<br><br>Notice under StrongÂ’s #1167, one of the definitions of the word Baal into English is lord!<br><br><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>GAD, GAWD, GOD</strong><br><br>Are you beginning to see that Baal = lord or LORD or master and that Baal is none other than Satan himself?! But coupled with SatanÂ’s title of Baal which equals lord, or Lord, or LORD, or master is the word Gad. Gad meant Fortune or that troop. Could the old saying about a person sold their soul to Satan have any bearing here? Satan will give you a fortune for your soul, but once you have sold it to him, he will usually double cross you and take your life (soul) away! How many troops of lost souls does Satan have through his deceptions?!<br><br>Notice how the Massoretics vowel pointed the word Gad in Hebrew in 1409 like this: dG:. When pointed like this, the word is pronounced Gawd or God or god in Hebrew. Now if we translate Baal Gad into English what does it become? Does it not become LORD GOD? Or lord god? Or Lord God? The capitalization doesnÂ’t change the sound of the word in any way and even so the fact is Baal Gad is the Lord God who is Lord Satan or Master Satan!<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PUTTING IT TOGETHER!</strong><br><br>Let me quote another explanatory note from pages 1214-1215 of The Scriptures: Gad: Apart from Gad, the son of YaÂ’aqob (Jacob) there was another "Gad." The astrologers of Babel called Jupiter (Zeus) by the name "Gad." He was also well known among the Canaanites (the KenaÂ’anites) where his name was often coupled with Baal, Baal Gad, which according to the Massoretic vowel pointing in the book of Yehoshua (Joshua) is pronounced: Baal God. This same name is discovered in the ancient Germanic languages as Gott, Goda, Gode, God, Gud, Gade. And searching further back into its Indo-Germanic (Indo-European) roots, we find that it traces back to the word GHODH, which means "union" even "sexual union." No wonder this meaning is still evident in the Dutch and German gode. It is also not difficult to see it in the English "gadfly" and "gadding about."<br><br>It is no wonder then that Satan was termed Baal Zebuwb in Hebrew and Beel Zeboul in Greek! So we have seen that both mean Lord of the flies (See Brown, Driver &amp; Briggs Hebrew Lexicon to the Old Testament under 1176).<br><br>How ironic that Satan was pictured as a gadfly or as one who gads about! A look at the definition of these two words in WebsterÂ’s New World Dictionary is quite revealing: gadÂ·fly n., pl. fliesÂ’ [GADÂ² + FLYÂ²] 1. a large fly that bites livestock 2. One who annoys others.<br><br>gadÂ·aÂ·bout n. a person who gads about; restless seeker after fun, etc.<br><br>GadÂ¹ (gad) [Heb. gadh, lit., fortune] Bible 1. The seventh son of Jacob 2. The tribe of Israel descended from him<br><br>GadÂ² (gad) interj. [euphemism for GOD] [also g-] a mild oath or expression of surprise, disgust, etc.<br><br>gadÂ¹ (gad) vi. gadÂ’ded, gadÂ’ding [LME gadden, to hurry, perhaps back-formation &lt; gadeling, companion in arms &lt; OE. gÃ¦deling: for IE. Base see GATHER] to wander about in an idle or restless way, as in seeking amusementÂ—n. an act of gadding: chiefly in the phrase on (or upon) the gad, gadding aboutÂ—gadÂ’der n.<br><br>Now letÂ’s compare the meanings here with Isa. 65:11 where Gad has been translated as "that troop." 1. A troop is defined as a group of persons, animals, or, formerly, things; herd, flock, band, etc. 2. Loosely, a great number; lot 3. A body of soldiers 4. A subdivision of a calvary regiment that corresponds to a company of infantry 5. A unit of Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts under an adult leader 6. [Archaic] a group of actors; troupe, etc. (WebsterÂ’s New World Dictionary).<br><br>These definitions would cause the meaning of this word to fall in the category of gadÂ¹ in the sense of "gather" which is why the translators rendered Gad as "that troop." GadÂ¹ corresponds with the meaning of the deity of fortune which also was YAHWEHÂ’S intended purpose for using the word, while GadÂ² ties it all together in the sense of a "euphemism for God."<br><br>In the book of Job, when Satan appeared with the sons of Elohim before YAHWEH, he was asked, "Whence comest thou?" SatanÂ’s answer was, "From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it." (Job. 1:7, 2:2) Satan as Baal-Zebub (Lord of flies) does exactly what a gadfly and a gadabout does. He is a restless seeker after fun. He goes to and fro, up and down seeking to annoy others (especially man, but also YAHWEH) which he thinks is fun.<br><br>Satan does have a terrible bite and he can be very annoying tooÂ—just like a gadfly! Also he gads about looking for souls to devour and it must be a lot of fun for him to deceive and cause so much misery and suffering upon humanity. (c.f. Job chapters 1 &amp; 2 again; 1 Pet. 5:8 ). No wonder Mr. Strong said that Beelzeboul was a name for Satan (c.f. StrongÂ’s #954 Greek Dictionary).<br><br>So what have we learned from our study of a few Scriptures using the inspired Hebrew language and a few Greek words? We have learned that God was originally the name of an idol once worshipped in Babel (Babylon). It was later spread throughout the land of Canaan being picked up by the Canaanites and adopted by the children of Israel when they went into apostasy!<br><br>We also have learned from Isa. 65:11-12 the shocking truth that many of YAHWEHÂ’S people have been tricked into forsaking YAHWEH for this pagan idol by Satan playing word games. (c.f. Jer. 2:10-13 and our article entitled "The Devices Of Satan." )<br><br>The saddest part of all is that behind this pagan idol called Baal GadÂ—Lord God stands the real being who is worshipped by the whole Christian worldÂ—Satan himself! (c.f. Isa. 13:12-14; Ez. 28:12-19; 2 Thes. 2:3-12). Yes, Christians are awaiting a final anti-Christ to come but do not realize he is already in their midst and worshipped! Christians are preparing a feast table for GodÂ—Satan and they donÂ’t even know it and wouldnÂ’t believe it even if you told them! Christians just donÂ’t realize who stands behind the idol and its name to receive its praise and worship (c.f. Lev. 17:7; Dt. 32:17; Ps. 106:37; 2 Chron. 11:15; 2 Cor. 10:21-22).<br><br>Baal Gad is the LORD God of the Christians but donÂ’t try to tell them I told you so because they wouldnÂ’t believe it even if you showed it to them out of the Hebrew Scriptures themselves! But if you are a Christian and you see the truth herein presented, what should you do about it? The Scriptures have the answer: "Truly, then, having overlooked these times of ignorance, YAHWEH now commands all men everywhere to repent," Acts 17:30.<br><br>"Come, and let us turn back to YAHWEH. For He has torn but He does heal us. He has stricken but He binds us up. After two days He shall revive us, on the third day He will raise us up, so that we may live before Him. So let us know, let pursue to know YAHWEH. His going forth is as certain as the morning. And He comes to us like the rain, like the latter rain watering the earth," Hos. 6:1-3.<br><br>"O Yisrael, return to YAHWEH your Elohim, for you have stumbled by your crookedness. Take words with you, and return to YAHWEH. Say to Him, Â‘Take away all crookedness, and accept what is good, and we will render the bulls of our lips. Ashshur does not save us. We do not ride on horses, nor ever again do we say to the work of our hands, Â‘Our mighty ones.Â’ For the fatherless finds compassion in you," Hos. 14:1-3.<br><br>And YAHWEH says in response to our repentence: "I shall heal their backsliding, I shall love them spontaneously, for Thy displeasure has turned away from Him. I shall be like the dew to Yisrael. He shall blossom like the lily, and cast out His roots like Lebanon. His branches shall spread, and His splendour shall be like an olive tree, and His fragrance like Lebanon. Those who dwell under His shadow shall return. They shall revive like grain, and blossom like the vine, and become as fragrant as the wine of Lebanon. What more had Ephraim to do with idols? It is I Who answer and look after him. I am like a green cypress tree, your fruit comes from Me. Who is wise and understands these words, discerning and knows them? For the ways of YAHWEH are straight, and the righteous walk in them, but the transgressors stumble in them," Hos. 14:4-9.<br><br>As the Apostle Peter cried out, "Repent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of YAHshua the Messiah for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit," Acts 2:38.<br><br>In another place he reveals that the name of the Messiah is the only name under heaven whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12).<br><br>It is the admonition of this ministry that we repent of our sins and fulfil the criteria revealed in Acts 2:38 and 4:12. May YAHWEH bless you to see, hear and understand these things and may you be led to fulfil them in your life.<br><br>By Donald Adkins<br><br></div>
