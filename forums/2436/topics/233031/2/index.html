            <div class='col-md body'>By the way, I agree with Brey.<br><br>Jesus must be understood the Jewish way. Even secular scholars agree when they research about the historical Jesus.<br><br>But the Church Fathers are kind of anti-semitic. Just look at Justin Martyr and later Martin Luther.<br><br>It is no wonder Brey doesn't believe in the Catholic definition of Trinity.

A more accurate translation would be creative efforts.<br><br>But how does the Torah define Melakhah? Specifically, what is considered work? Turning on and off a light?  Warming food in the Microwave?<br><br>When the Jews were brought out of Egypt, the Sabbath prohibition against Melakhah meant refraining from acts which were necessary for the construction and furnishing of the Mishkan, the tabernacle the Jews were commanded to build in the desert. Melakhah, as we know it today, stems from the following 39 categories of forbidden acts which were used in building the Mishkan.  In Hebrew these 39 categories are called the Lamed Tet Melakhot. They include:<br><br>Ploughing; Sowing; Reaping; Sheaf-making; Threshing; Winnowing; Selecting; Sifting; Grinding; Kneading; Baking; Sheep-shearing; Bleaching; Combing raw material; Dyeing; Spinning; Inserting thread in a loom; Weaving; Removing the finished article; Separating into threads; Tying a knot; Untying a knot; Sewing; Tearing; Trapping; Slaughtering; Skinning or flaying; Tanning; Scraping; Marking out; Cutting to shape; Writing; Erasing; Building; Demolishing; Kindling a fire; Extinguishing a fire; The final hammer blow; and Carrying in a public place.<br><br>Refraining from Melakhah, is refraining from influencing the physical world. It has nothing to do with switching on and off a light, or with starting the car, acts which do influence the physical world, but obviously are not "hard work."<br></div>
