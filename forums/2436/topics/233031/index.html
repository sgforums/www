Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but He rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.<br><br>[5] Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.<br><br>[6] You shall not murder.<br><br>[7] You shall not commit adultery.<br><br>[8] You shall not steal.<br><br>[9] You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.<br><br>[10] You shall not covet your neighbor's house.
