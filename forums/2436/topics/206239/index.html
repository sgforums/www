Yiddish is a language in its own right, it belongs to the Indo-European family and is therefore completely removed from the Semitic group of languages. It developed in the Middle Ages when Poland invited the Rhineland Jews to move into Poland for the express purpose of forming a trading class between the nobility and the serfs. The Jews retained their Low German language but began to write it with Hebrew characters. The language grew by absorbing from Polish, Russian and of course Hebrew. The original term for the tongue was Judisch Deutsch, Jewish German, and 'Yiddish' is a corruption of Judisch.<br><br>True?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Ashkenazi culture that was taking root in 10th-century Central Europe derived its name from Ashkenaz, the medieval Hebrew name for Germany (Genesis 10:3). Its geographic extent did not coincide with the German Christian principalities, and Ashkenaz included Northern France. It also bordered on the area inhabited by the Sephardi, or Spanish Jews, which ranged into southern France. Later, the Ashkenazi territory would spread into Eastern Europe as well.<br><br>Nothing is known about the vernacular of the earliest Jews in Germany but several theories have been put forward. It is generally accepted that it was likely to have contained elements from other languages of the Near East and Europe absorbed through dispersion. Since many settlers came via northern France, it is also likely that the Romance-based Jewish language of that region was represented. Traces of this remain in the modern Yiddish vocabulary, particularly in Western Yiddish; for example, Ã¡Ã²Ã°Ã¨Ã¹Ã¯ (bentshn, to say a blessing said after dining), from the Latin benedicere, and the Western Yiddish orn (to pray), from the Latin orare.<br><br>The first language of European Jews may also have been Aramaic (Katz 2004), the vernacular of the Jews in Roman era Palestine, and ancient and early medieval Mesopotamia. The widespread use of Aramaic among the large non-Jewish Syrian trading population of the Roman provinces, including those in Europe, would have reinforced the use of Aramaic among Jews engaged in trade.<br><br>Members of the young Ashkenazi community would have encountered the myriad dialects from which standard German was destined to emerge many centuries later. They would soon have been speaking their own versions of these German dialects, mixed with linguistic elements that they brought into the region, themselves. These dialects would have adapted to the needs of the burgeoning Ashkenazi culture and may, as characterizes many such developments, have included the deliberate cultivation of linguistic differences to assert cultural autonomy. The Ashkenazi community also had its own geography with a pattern of relationships among settlements that was somewhat independent of its non-Jewish neighbors. This led to the consolidation of Yiddish dialects the borders of which did not coincide with the borders of German dialects.<br><br>The further development of the Eastern Yiddish dialects involved the absorption of many words from Slavic languages.<br><br>for more information see the wiki's page here...<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish_language" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish_language</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the start of the 20th century, Yiddish was emerging as a major Eastern European language. Its rich literature was ever more widely published, Yiddish theater and Yiddish film were booming, and it had even achieved status as one of the official languages of the Belarusian SSR. Educational autonomy for Jews in several countries (notably Poland) after World War I led to an increase in formal Yiddish-language education, more uniform orthography, and to the 1925 founding of the Yiddish Scientific Institute, later YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. Yiddish emerged as the national language of a large Jewish community in Eastern Europe that rejected Zionism and sought to obtain Jewish cultural autonomy in Europe. It also contended with Modern Hebrew as a literary language among Zionists.<br><br>On the eve of World War II, there were between 11 and 13 million Yiddish speakers (Jacobs 2005). The Holocaust, however, led to a dramatic, sudden decline in the use of Yiddish, as the extensive Jewish communities, both secular and religious, that used Yiddish in their day-to-day life were largely destroyed. Although millions of Yiddish speakers survived the war (including nearly all Yiddish speakers in the Americas), further assimilation in countries such as the United States, Soviet Union and the status of Modern Hebrew as the official language of Israel led to a decline in the use of Eastern Yiddish similar to the earlier decline in Western Yiddish.<br><br>Ethnologue estimates that in 2005 there were 3 million speakers of Eastern Yiddish [1]. Western Yiddish, which had "several tens of thousands of speakers" on the eve of the Holocaust, is reported to have had an "ethnic population" of slighty below 50,000 in 2000 [2]. Further demographic information about the recent status of what is treated as an Eastern-Western dialect continuum is provided in the YIVO Language and Cultural Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry (LCAAJ).<br><br>There have been frequent episodes of debate about the extent of the linguistic independence of Yiddish from the languages that it absorbed. Some commentary dismisses Yiddish as a mere jargon, although precisely that term, in Yiddish, is also used as a colloquial designation for the language, but without pejorative connotation. There have been periodic assertions that it is a German dialect and, even when recognized as an autonomous language, it has sometimes been referred to as Judeo-German. A widely-cited statement of the situation in the 1930s was published by Max Weinreich, quoting a remark by an auditor of one of his lectures: Ã Ã‡ Ã¹Ã´ÃŒÃ¸Ã Ã‡Ãª Ã Ã©Ã¦ Ã Ã‡ Ã£Ã©Ã Ã‡Ã¬Ã²Ã·Ã¨ Ã®Ã©Ã¨ Ã Ã‡Ã¯ Ã Ã‡Ã¸Ã®Ã©Ã© Ã Ã¥Ã¯ Ã´Ã�Ã¬Ã ÃˆÃ¨ (a shprakh iz a diyalekt mit an armey un flot). "A language is a dialect with an army and navy" (facsimile excerpt at [3]; discussed in detail in a separate article).<br><br>[edit]<br>Israel<br>The national language of Israel is Modern Hebrew. The rejection of Yiddish as an alternative reflected the conflict between religious and secular forces. Many in the larger, secular group wanted a new national language to foster a cohesive identity, while traditionally religious Jews desired that Hebrew be respected as a holy language reserved for prayer and religious study. In the early twentieth century, Zionist immigrants in Palestine tried to eradicate the use of Yiddish amongst their own population, and make its use socially unacceptable.<br><br>This conflict also reflected the opposing views among secular Jews worldwide, one side seeing Hebrew (and Zionism) and the other Yiddish (and Internationalism) as the means of defining emerging Jewish nationalism. Finally, the large post-1948 influx of Jewish refugees from Arab countries (to whom Yiddish was entirely foreign, but who already spoke a Semitic language in daily life) effectively made Hebrew the only practical option. But even though this social factor would have anyway doomed any chance for Yiddish to prosper, state authorities in the young Israel of the 1950s went to the extent of using censorship laws inherited from British rule in order to prohibit or extremely limit Yiddish theatre in Israel.<br><br>Many of the older immigrants to Israel from the former USSR (usually those above 50 years of age) speak or understand some Yiddish.<br><br>In religious circles, it is the Ashkenazi Haredi Jews, particularly the Hasidic Jews and the Mitnagdim of the Lithuanian yeshiva world, who continue to teach, speak and use Yiddish, making it a language used regularly by hundreds of thousands of Haredi Jews today. The largest of these centers are in Bnei Brak and Jerusalem.<br><br>There is a growing revival of interest in Yiddish culture among secular Israelis, with Yiddish theater now flourishing (usually with simultaneous translation to Hebrew and Russian) and young people are taking university courses in Yiddish, some achieving considerable fluency (albeit with an accent that would seem very strange to native speakers).<br><br>[edit]<br>Soviet Union<br>In the Soviet Union, much effort was invested in promoting the use of Yiddish during 1920s. It was then regarded as the language of "Jewish proletariat". At the same time, Hebrew was considered a "bourgeois" language and its use was generally discouraged. After the Second World War, growing anti-Semitic tendencies in Soviet politics drove Yiddish from most spheres, and publication in Yiddish was largely curtailed.<br><br>[edit]<br>Sweden<br>In June 1999, the Swedish Parliament enacted legislation giving Yiddish legal status as one of the country's official minority languages (entering into effect in April 2000). The rights thereby conferred are not detailed, but additional legislation was enacted in June 2006 establishing a new governmental agency, the mandate of which instructs it to, "collect, preserve, scientifically research, and spread material about the national minority languages", naming them all explicitly, including Yiddish. When announcing this action, the government made an additional statement about "simultaneously commencing completely new initiatives for Â… Yiddish [and the other minority languages]".<br><br>The Swedish government publishes documents in Yiddish, of which recent ones detail the action leading to the establishment of the new agency, the national action plan for human rights, and an earlier one provides general information about national minority language policies.<br><br>[edit]<br>United States<br>In the United States, the Yiddish language bonded Jews from many countries. Ã´Ã Ã¸Ã¥Ã¥Ã²Ã¸Ã¨Ã± (forverts = The Forward) was one of seven Yiddish daily newspapers in New York City, and other Yiddish newspapers served as a forum for Jews of all European backgrounds. Interest in klezmer music provided another bonding mechanism. Thriving Yiddish theater in New York City and (to a lesser extent) elsewhere kept the language vital. Many "Yiddishisms," like "Italianisms" and "Spanishisms," continued to enter spoken New York English, often used by Jews and non-Jews alike unaware of the linguistic origin of the phrases (described extensively by Leo Rosten in The Joys of Yiddish). However, mother-tongue Yiddish speakers tended not to pass the language on to their children, who assimilated and spoke English.<br><br>In 1978, the Polish-born Yiddish author Isaac Bashevis Singer, a resident of the United States, received the Nobel Prize in literature.<br><br>[edit]<br>Religious communities<br>The major exception to the decline of spoken Yiddish can be found in Haredi communities all over the world. In some of the more closely-knit such communities Yiddish is spoken as a home and schooling language, especially in Hasidic communities such as Brooklyn's Borough Park, Williamsburg and Crown Heights, and in Monsey, Kiryas Joel, and New Square. (Over 88% of the population of Kiryas Joel is reported to speak Yiddish at home [4]). Yiddish is also widely spoken in smaller Haredi communities in such the ones as London, Antwerp and Montreal. Among most Haredim, Hebrew is generally reserved for prayer and religious studies, while Yiddish is reserved as a home and business language. In Israel, however, Haredim commonly speak Modern Hebrew, with the notable exception of many Hasidic communities. Nevertheless, the vast majority of Haredim who use Modern Hebrew also understand Yiddish. Members of movements such as Satmar Hasidism, which views the commonplace use of Hebrew as a form of Zionism, use Yiddish almost exclusively.<br><br>Hundreds of thousands of young children have been, and are still, taught to translate the texts of the Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy into Yiddish. This process is called Ã¨Ã©Ã‡Ã©Ã¨Ã¹Ã¯ (taytshn) Â— taytsching or "translating" . Most Ashkenazi yeshivas' highest level lectures in Talmud and Halakha are delivered in Yiddish by the Rosh yeshivas as well as ethical talks of mussar. Hasidic rebbes generally use only Yiddish to converse with their followers and to deliver their various Torah talks, classes, and lectures. The linguistic style and vocabulary of Yiddish have influenced the manner in which many Orthodox Jews who attend yeshivas speak English. This usage is distinctive enough that it has been dubbed "Yeshivish".<br><br>While Hebrew remains the language of Jewish prayer, the Hasidim have mixed considerable Yiddish into their Hebrew, and are also responsible for a significant secondary religious literature written in Yiddish. For example, the tales about the Baal Shem Tov were written largely in Yiddish.<br><br>from wiki's....</div>

Yiddish is a language in its own right, it belongs to the Indo-European family and is therefore completely removed from the Semitic group of languages. It developed in the Middle Ages when Poland invited the Rhineland Jews to move into Poland for the express purpose of forming a trading class between the nobility and the serfs. The Jews retained their Low German language but began to write it with Hebrew characters. The language grew by absorbing from Polish, Russian and of course Hebrew. The original term for the tongue was Judisch Deutsch, Jewish German, and 'Yiddish' is a corruption of Judisch.<br><br>True?<br><br></div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
