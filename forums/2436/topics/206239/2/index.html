            <div class='col-md body'>Earth is closest to the Sun is the summertime...or, it is warmer in summer because Earth is closer to the Sun...<br><br>False. This is by far the most common misconception about the relationship between Sun and Earth, one that is unfortunately perpetuated by lousy diagrams in most school textbooks. When someone says we are closer to the Sun in the summertime, do you ever remind them that while it may be summer in the northern hemisphere, it is wintertime in the southern hemisphere...and six months from now, the seasons and Earth's position will be reversed? In fact, in summer in the northern hemisphere, Earth is actually at its farthest point away from the Sun. So how can that be?<br>Despite what you learned in school about Earth's "elliptical" orbit around the Sun, that elliptical orbit is pretty close to being circular (not the extended oval you see in most books). The change of seasons is mainly the result of the tilt of Earth's invisible spin axis, which is inclined 23.5 degrees in comparison to the axis of the Sun. Sometimes Earth's axis is tilted toward the Sun and sometimes away from it -- and somewhere in between for the rest of the year. It is this tilt -- combined with the motion of the Earth around the Sun -- that causes more or less light to fall on one hemisphere or the other during each of the seasons. This means that the amount of sunlight falling directly on a parcel of Earth changes throughout the year. It also means that days get longer or shorter, causing the Sun to warm part of the Earth for longer and shorter periods of each day.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Sun has a solid surface...<br><br>False. The song by Smash Mouth says, "You might as well be walking on the Sun." Fat chance. The Sun is made entirely of gas, so there isn't a fixed, solid surface. The part that looks like the surface -- the photosphere -- is simply the region of gas on the edge of the Sun that emits light in wavelengths that we can see. (Did we mention that you would be vaporized before you got close enough to walk on the Sun?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Space is empty, a complete vacuum...<br><br>False. Space is filled everywhere by plasma, the fourth state of matter (solid, liquid, gas, and plasma). Plasma is a gas in which electrons have been separated from their atoms (ions), making it electrically charged. Plasma is extremely rare on Earth; you can only find it in candle flames, lightning, and fluorescent lights. But in fact, 99% of the universe is made up of plasma. Of course, space is so vast that all this plasma gets spread out to a point where it seems like a vacuum by our earthly standards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Years of Service.<br><br>In stable, predictable times, in organizations where employees have a job for life, marking milestones toward retirement makes a lot of sense. Today few, if any, employees take jobs expecting to be there 20 or 30 years later. Some incentive companies are quick to point out that almost every North American company offers length-of-service awards. ItÂ’s as if this fact, in and of itself, is some sort of proof that they work.<br><br>Just because such recognition programs exist, that doesn't necessarily mean they are a source of motivation for today's employees. In one Fortune 500 organization with which I recently worked, over half of all surveyed employees didn't view years-of-service awards as a form of recognition at all. In another organization, a long-term employee told me they had to go to personnel and demand their 20-year pin! (She showed it to me--it was still in the box.)<br><br>In most organizations today, years-of-service awards have become more associated with endurance than performance. They've become a badge of honor that "I survived"--all the more so if the organization has experienced a merger or layoff in recent years. Sure, you want to retain your employees--especially your top performers--for as long as possible, but it's increasingly not the clock they get on their 10-year anniversary that keeps them with the organization and energizes them to do their best work.<br><br>Holding celebrations and giving gifts for employee retirements or new-employee orientation are versions of the same thing.<br><br></div>
