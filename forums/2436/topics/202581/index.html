So I would think that it would be important which day is it. Our Yahweh is not a careless God, He is concerned with the minutest details... He organised the stars and the course of the planets... the seasons etc... I think He would be mindful of the Sabbath. It is stated in the commandments, you will observe the sabbath to KEEP it HOLY. I am sure you don't want to do it on the wrong day... ? Just my opinion, maybe I am more particular about such things, but I find in my walk with Yahweh, that He is a particular God.<br><br>With things that are really important to Yahweh, He repeats the point over and over... in my opinion the problem with christianity today is that they lack the fear of the Lord because it is so watered down by the message of grace such that christians today think that Yahweh does not care about anything else just so long as they believe and they are saved...</div>

So I would think that it would be important which day is it. Our Yahweh is not a careless God, He is concerned with the minutest details... He organised the stars and the course of the planets... the seasons etc... I think He would be mindful of the Sabbath. It is stated in the commandments, you will observe the sabbath to KEEP it HOLY. I am sure you don't want to do it on the wrong day... ? Just my opinion, maybe I am more particular about such things, but I find in my walk with Yahweh, that He is a particular God.<br><br>With things that are really important to Yahweh, He repeats the point over and over... in my opinion the problem with christianity today is that they lack the fear of the Lord because it is so watered down by the message of grace such that christians today think that Yahweh does not care about anything else just so long as they believe and they are saved... </div></blockquote>cause the typical kiasu + kiasi theory... cannot decide which one of the seven days to keep holy, just keep all seven lah, sure confirm hit one, the rest can take as extras.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>serious, the original commandments on this is<br><blockquote>Exodus 20:8-11<br>8 "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. 11 For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.</blockquote>Personally, I feel the main principle is this, Six days, we work, on the Seventh,  a Sabbath, rest.<br><br>The secondary issue is, which is the first day, and which is the seventh dat? to this, I will rather leave it to individual convictions.<br><br>Shalom...<br></div>
