So it is still biblically acceptable and clean. I still have not crossed the line. The whole thing about eating biblically clean food is so that we are HOLY and for no other reason. If you want to be a child of Yahweh, you have to be HOLY. I am undergoing this change as I learn more, it is a process, but only you can start it.

Shabbat is meant to be kept from sundown friday to sundown saturday. If you want to go to church everyday during the week that is fine as well, but do not pretend to make Sunday Yahweh's day of rest or to call it the Lord's day. It is clearly not.<br><br>The point that I am alluding to here is that why then would CE go to church on easter sunday? To attend an easter sunday service... I am not condemning you but you have to ask yourself, whether if Yeshua came back would be pleased? By having an easter sunday service, the church then associates itself with all the pagan symbolism behind the celebration of easter, thereby creating a form of idolatry.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Croissants<br>The origin of the croissant is one of the great food legends of all time. The Larousse Gastronomique offers this explanation regarding the origin of the croissant:<br><br>"Croissant...This delicious pastry originated in Budapest in 1686, when the Turks were besieging the city. To reach the centre of the town, they dug underground passages. Bakers, working during the night, heard the noise made by the Turks and gave the alarm. The assailants were repulsed and the bakers who had saved the city were granted the privilege of making a special pastry which had to take the form of a crescent in memory of the emblem on the Ottoman flag."<br>---Larousse Gastronomique, Jenifer Harvey Lang, editor [Crown:New York] 1988 (p. 338 )<br><br>It's an interesting story. Is it true? Alan Davidson, noted food historian, expresses his doubts:<br><br>"Culinary mythology--origin of the croissant<br>According to one of a group of similar legends, which vary only in detail, a baker of the 17th century, working through the night at a time when his city (either Vienna in 1683 or Budapest in 1686) was under siege by the Turks, heard faint underground rumbling sounds which, on investigation, proved to be caused by a Turkish attempt to invade the city by tunnelling under the walls. The tunnel was blown up. The baker asked no reward other than the exclusive right to bake crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the incident, the crescent being the sympol of Islam. He was duly rewarded in this way, and the croissant was born. The story seems to owe its origin, or at least its wide diffusion, to Alfred Gottschalk, who wrote about the croissant for the first edition of the Larousse Gastronomique [1938] and there gave the legend in the Turkish attack on Budapest in 1686 version; but on the history of food, opted for the 'siege of Vienna in 1683' version."<br>---Oxford Comapion to Food, Alan Davidson [Oxford Companion to Food:Oxford] 1999 (p. 232)<br><br>While the history of pastry dates back to ancient times, the history of the croissant [as we know it today], seems to be a relatively new invention. Part of the problem may be how one defines "croissant." Food history sources confirm that crescent-shaped pastries were baked in Vienna during the 17th century and that they migrated to France soon thereafter. They recount, but do not confirm/deny the story of the brave bakers who supposedly created the first croissants. This is what Mr. Davidson has to say:<br><br>"...croissant in its present form does not have a long history...The earliest French reference to the croissant seems to be in Payen's book "Des substances alimentaires," published in 1853. He cites, among the "Pains dit de fantasie ou de luxe," not only English 'muffins' but 'les croissants'. The term appears again, ten years later, in the great Littre dictionary [1863] where it is defined as 'a little crescent-shaped bread or cake'. Thirteen years later, Husson in "Les Consommations de Paris" [1875] includes 'croissants for coffee' in a list of 'ordinary' (as opposed to 'fine') pastry goods. Yet no trace of a recipe for croissants can be found earlier than that given by Favre in his Dictionnaire universel de cuisine [c. 1905], and his recipe bears no resemblance to the modern puff pastry concoction; it is rather an oriental pastry made of pounded almonds and sugar. Only in 1906, in Colombie's Nouvelle Encyclopedie culinaire, did a true croissant, and its development into a national symbol of France, is a 20th-century history."<br>---Oxford Companion to Food (p. 228 )<br><br>A mid-19th century French recipe for croissants:<br><br>Almond Paste Crescents<br>Blanch, peel, and pound 10 oz. of almonds; add 10 oz. of pounded sugar, and moisten, to a stiffish paste, with some white of egg; Sprinkle a pasteboard with fine sugar; roll the paste on it to a 1/4-inch thinckness, and cut it out, with a 1 1/2-inch round cutter, into crescent-shaped pieces, 3/4 inch wide; Bake the crescents in a slack oven; and, when cold, glaze them with some Glace Royale, flavoured with Kirschenwasser; strew some coarsely sifted sugar on the top, and dry them in the oven for two minutes."<br><br>---The Royal Cookery Book, Jules Gouffe, translated and adapted for English use by Alphone Gouffe [Sampson Low, Sone &amp; Marson:London] 1869 (p. 548 )<br>The lesson here is never completely trust the first source you use when researching history, even if it is a standard reference volume. Sometimes it takes a little work to separate the legends from the fact<br></div>
