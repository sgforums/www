Does God care about whether one believe sabbath is Saturday or Sunday. I am ok if one thinks that sabbath is saturday. But this is not the case, the case is: someone thinks that it is wrong to have sabbath on sunday. I have always been willing to compromise in such interpretation.<br><br>As I had said before, I have not said even once that brey is wrong. All I am hoping for is baseless denounciation that everything the church is in error and that the hebraic way is the only correct way.<br><br>Ok, I'd give him the benefit of doubt, say he is right. <strong>All he needs to tell me is that much effort is done and recorded that Hebrew evangelists had done all they can to prevent the corruption of the gospels by the Greeks and the Romans.</strong> If he can prove that, I will apologise and retract all my statements and I might even convert to his way of living.<br><br>If brey cannot, he is insulting the work of God through the many martyrs that had gone on ahead and had done so much that we can never imagine! Not to mention insulting God because it would seem that God was not in control of what happened in the world in the absence of any Jewish missionaries.<br><br>It is not about me, it's about the respect I have for those who has brought the message to this parts of the world so that I am now saved. Now at the strike of a keystroke, these people are deemed to be in error?<br><br>I need to answer your questions because <strong>when we talk about unity, we need to give and take.</strong> I can give - I repeat I have not said he is wrong, in the hebraic context and the world he is living in, it's quite ok. Can he give? I doubt so, because his conviction leads him to an uncompromising path where there is no room to manuvere, (?sp) to agree to disagree.<br><br><strong>Appropriate way to do things? </strong>Very easy for you and I, we live and let live. I am ok with anyone choosing a charismatic, pentecostal, presbyterian or even hebraic way of theology. I don't speak in tongues and do not think that it is Biblical (personal reasons), but I will never ever speak out against someone on this, afterall, who am I in the eye of God?<br><br>Can brey do this? Live and let live? I doubt so! Denounciations after denounciations about how the church has got it wrong, how the evangelists had got it wrong, how Christians had got it wrong.... Vince, the line was drawn even before I start the argument.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Appropriate way to do things? What do you guys think?</span><br></div>

Does God care about whether one believe sabbath is Saturday or Sunday. I am ok if one thinks that sabbath is saturday. But this is not the case, the case is: someone thinks that it is wrong to have sabbath on sunday. I have always been willing to compromise in such interpretation.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote><span style="color: red;">Does Yahweh care? If you know the ten commandments, of course He cares! Did Yeshua keep the sabbath? Of course He did. Did Shaul keep the sabbath? Yes to that too... so what does Yeshua tell us. To be like Him.Following Yahweh is not about compromise, its about doing what He wants us to do as right in HIS eyes by HIS standards and not ours. What sets that standard? His word. I am not telling you any different from what is written in your bible. So when the word tells me that someone is doing some thing wrong in the eyes of Yahweh, do I compromise? Say its ok... ?? Even in the OT, it was never about compromise, its about you keep yourselves HOLY, set apart... and I will destroy the rest. We are a commonwealth of Israel, so please do not tell me different. We become part of Israel and not the other way around. </span><br><br>Vince sorry. This had to be answered.</div>

Likewise, I can say the church also have YHWH so we also don't need to prove anything, right or wrong. Don't have say don't have, no need to twist and shout <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>My point remains: there is no discernable evangelistic activities after the demise of Paul and Peter while most of such activities are western based. If these western evangelists did anything wrong it's probably because there is apparently no one to challenge this supposed "erroneous stand"<br><br>So you folks do need to do because the Father is the most prominent evangelist? Then why do anything now? Why the need to write what you write? Why the sudden impulse to correct anything? A total oxymoron!<br><br>So you folks don't do, other people do, and you accuse them of getting the issues wrong? A remarkable case of SHIFTING THE BLAME!<br><br>Let me make a guess as to what you guys are doing: checking with every site and every resource to look for prominent Jewish evangelists during those periods. Otherwise, this is the perfect time to throw CE's arguments on the floor.
