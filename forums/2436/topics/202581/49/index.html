One thing I find that is lacking in modern society today is that children these days lack discipline... that could be part of the problem...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">u mean, becos english is the key to other subjects?<br><br>i dont know..but some people can go thru maths and science with lousy english<br><br></div></blockquote>Secondary school, maybe.... but maths - you need to understand what is being asked. Science - you need to be able to express your answers and use the correct words.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">but with things as they are in singapore, and the high cost of living... it is also hard for parents... i know my dad was never around when I was younger, he was always working... never at home. Always at the hospital and my mum was always at work too. It sometimes also depends on the individual child. One thing I find that is lacking in modern society today is that children these days lack discipline... that could be part of the problem...</div></blockquote>Yup, I am not saying all kids that has less parental support turn out bad. For most cases, it is those in the lower income group.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">some people can understand math without english and maybe physics, but I find that people generally struggle with chemistry and biology with weak english... </div></blockquote>As I'd said, the english thing is mostly for the primary level. Maths and physics generally deal with more formulas than language. Poor English? It'll affect, not only chem and bio, but history, literature, and geography (in Secondary level)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by vince69:</div><div class="quote_body">yes, English is the key to all subjects (except chinese), the new syb for primary schools will be geared towards testing the students in their ability to understand questions, and articulate the solutions, and these may not be straight forward ones, but those that may even involved in playing of words.<br><br>I spoke with this Primary school teachers last week about this, her comment is that, the new syb will be more tough, especially for pri 3 onwards.</div></blockquote>Yup, the syllabus for primary school is really tough. For most parts, they are teaching things that I learnt only in Sec 2. Science questions involve describing the entire process of an experiment step by step.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">In fact, most of my friends tutoring primary and secondary school kids say that the PSLE and O level is getting harder, more towards IQ type questions<br>and the troubling fact is that even my friends are struggling with these questions and the students are stressed out from work overload<br>seems, nothing improves<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>That was my original thought too. Having said that, I am also able to learn how to cope as a parent, ie, I need to learn the way to mentor my boys over such situations. Generally, my boys are doing well in school, without tuition. Secondary boy is in the middle of his final exams, expectation for his results is most A1s or A2s, with the exception for one or two subjects. Primary boy should be getting band 1 for at least 2 subjects and high band 2 for the other two.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by vince69:</div><div class="quote_body">yes, according to that teacher I spoke with, most of the students that have problem are those that have problem expressing their ideas (lack of vocab ..etc)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Lack of vocabulary is a big issue. My family is heavily into Scrabble. On a good day, my primary boy can kick my butt. Scrabble is also not only about vocab, but strategy, so it teaches them planning. My older son is in the school team.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">then maybe the problem is deeper than just an issue of languages... the singaporean system of learning is too narrow, and now broad enough... the approach should really be broader, to enhance creativity and to encourage lateral thinking, as well as understanding of basic principles so that once they are understood, one can then reason out the conclusion of a problem based on these basic principles... </div></blockquote>every system has it's problem.... to me it's probably the student/teacher ratio. Nothing much can improve if the teachers are stretched.<br>The other thing is probably MOE's spineless approach - got problem only, leave it to the school to deal with. Give schools too much autonomy sometimes, principal too kiasu to offend parents, many times teachers take the blunt of the problem, whether it is poor discipline, or poor welfare.</div>
