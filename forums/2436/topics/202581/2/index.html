            <div class='col-md body'>Monday is considered either the first or second day of the week, between Sunday and Tuesday. It gets its name from the Moon, which in turn gets its name from Mani (Old English Mona), the Germanic Moon god. Similarly, the Italian name (lunedi), the French name (lundi) and the Spanish name (lunes) come from the Latin name for the moon, Luna.<br><br>Tuesday is considered either the second or the third day of the week, between Monday and Wednesday. The word "Tuesday" comes from Middle English Twisday, from Old English Tiwes dÃ¦g, a rendering of Latin Martis dies. The English and Scandinavian names are derived from the Nordic god Tyr (in Old English, Tiw, Tew or Tiu. In Swedish, Tisdag, Danish: Tirsdag, Finnish: Tiistai and in Norwegian: Tirsdag.) Tyr was the Norse equivalent of the Roman war god Mars, hence Martis dies ("Mars's day" ).<br><br>Wednesday is considered either the third or the fourth day of the week, between Tuesday and Thursday. The name comes from the Middle English Wednes dei, which is from Old English Wodnes dÃ¦g, meaning the day of the Germanic god Woden who was a god of the Anglo-Saxons in England until about the 7th century AD. Wodnes dÃ¦g is like the Old Norse Othinsdagr ("Odin's day" ), which is an early translation of the Latin dies Mercurii ("Mercury's day" ).<br><br>Thursday, according to ISO 8601, is the fourth day of the week, falling between Wednesday and Friday. In countries that adopt the Sunday-first convention, it is considered the fifth day of the week. (see Days of the week for more on the different conventions.) The contemporary name Thursday comes from the Old English ÃžunresdÃ¦g, meaning "Day of Thunor", this being a rough Germanic equivalent to the Latin Iovis Dies, "Jupiter's Day."<br><br>Friday is the fifth day of the week, falling between Thursday and Saturday. In countries that adopt a Sunday-first convention, it is commonly considered the sixth day of the week. (see Days of the week for more on the different conventions.) The name Friday comes from the Old English frigedÃ¦g, meaning the day of Frige, the Germanic goddess of beauty, with similar cognates existing in most Germanic languages. The word for Friday in most Romance languages is derived from the name of Venus (vendredi in French, venerdi in Italian, viernes in Spanish, vineri in Romanian etc.), while in Germanic languages it is named after Freya (Freitag in Modern German, vrijdag in Dutch, fredag in Swedish, Norwegian, Danish etc.) .<br><br>Saturday is the seventh (sixth in some countries) day of the week, between Friday and Sunday. It is the only day of the week to retain its Roman origin in English, named after the Roman god of time Saturn, calling it dies Saturni, "Saturn's Day". Many of the other days of the week adopted names of Saxon gods in Northern Europe, in Anglo-Saxon. There also exists a possibility that the modern English form derives from Anglo-Saxon 'Saeter daegv', as Saeter "Saturn" was regarded as a correlary of Loki by Northern Germanic peoples.<br><br>Sunday is traditionally the first day of the Judaeo-Christian seven-day week, between Saturday and Monday, and the second day of the weekend in some cultures. It is considered a holiday in lands of Christian tradition, and is the day when most Christians attend Church.<br><br>In some countries, including most of Eastern Europe, Sunday is held to be the last day of the week as they consider Monday the first day of the working week. In others, including the United States, Canada, and in parts of Africa it is seen as the first day, a traditional view derived from ancient Jews, Egyptians and the Holy Roman Empire.<br><br>Above quoted from Wikipedia.<br><br>The origin of days can hardly be considered Hebrew. Sure, the 7-day week concept is mentioned in Genesis, but the naming of the days as we know them now can be viewed as paganistic.<br><br>Should we then revert to the Hebrew way of calling the days? Might be possible for some, but how practical can it get in our dealings with the world?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">Question<br><br>We know the Romans used Julian calendar, and Christians used them for certain time until the creation of the currently used Gregorian calendar (sniggers at this name)...<br><br>So what was the calendar system used by the Jewish in the ancient past?</div></blockquote>i think it was the lunar calendar... if I am not mistaken...<br><br>The Jewish calendar is based on three astronomical phenomena: the rotation of the Earth about its axis (a day); the revolution of the moon about the Earth (a month); and the revolution of the Earth about the sun (a year). These three phenomena are independent of each other, so there is no direct correlation between them. On average, the moon revolves around the Earth in about 29Â½ days. The Earth revolves around the sun in about 365Â¼ days, that is, about 12.4 lunar months.<br><br>The Gregorian calendar used by most of the world has abandoned any correlation between the moon cycles and the month, arbitrarily setting the length of months to 28, 30 or 31 days.<br><br>The Jewish calendar, however, coordinates all three of these astronomical phenomena. Months are either 29 or 30 days, corresponding to the 29Â½-day lunar cycle. Years are either 12 or 13 months, corresponding to the 12.4 month solar cycle.<br><br>The lunar month on the Jewish calendar begins when the first sliver of moon becomes visible after the dark of the moon. In ancient times, the new months used to be determined by observation. When people observed the new moon, they would notify the Sanhedrin. When the Sanhedrin heard testimony from two independent, reliable eyewitnesses that the new moon occurred on a certain date, they would declare the rosh chodesh (first of the month) and send out messengers to tell people when the month began.<br><br>The problem with strictly lunar calendars is that there are approximately 12.4 lunar months in every solar year, so a 12-month lunar calendar loses about 11 days every year and a 13-month lunar gains about 19 days every year. The months on such a calendar "drift" relative to the solar year. On a 12 lunar month calendar, the month of Nissan, which is supposed to occur in the Spring, would occur 11 days earlier each year, eventually occurring in the Winter, the Fall, the Summer, and then the Spring again. To compensate for this drift, an extra month was occasionally added. The month of Nissan would occur 11 days earlier for two or three years, and then would jump forward 29 or 30 days, balancing out the drift. In ancient times, this month was also added by observation: the Sanhedrin observed the conditions of the weather, the crops and the livestock, and if these were not sufficiently advanced to be considered "spring," then the Sanhedrin inserted an additional month into the calendar to make sure that Pesach (Passover) would occur in the spring (it is, after all, referred to in the Torah as Chag he-Aviv, the Festival of Spring!).<br><br>A year with 13 months is referred to in Hebrew as Shanah Me'uberet (pronounced shah-NAH meh-oo-BEH-reht), literally: a pregnant year. In English, we commonly call it a leap year. The additional month is known as Adar I, Adar Rishon or Adar Alef. It is inserted before the regular month of Adar (known in such years as Adar II, Adar Sheini or Adar Bet). Note that Adar II is the "real" Adar, the one in which Purim is celebrated, the one in which yahrzeits for Adar are observed, the one in which a 13-year-old born in Adar becomes a Bar Mitzvah. Adar I is the "extra" Adar.<br></div>
