Does the mooncake thing mix with christianity to call a pagan festival a christian one?<br><br>But you who celebrate easter and christmas, celebrate well know pagan rituals which have been absorbed into the church and also documented by the RC church so as to gain converts from paganism.

OK lah, let me be more specific: between, say, years 400AD to say, 1800AD... any prominent Jew that may have done something very important to fulful the great commission and prevented the church from being corrupted?<br><br>Weird isn't it? Paul and Peter travelled as evangelist, and you said the church only evangelised but not discipled? Maybe they didn't travel far enough, after all, only reach Asia Minor and the Meditterranian Sea area.... and of course Rome.... maybe that's the mistake, they SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE TO ROME!<br><br>Weird isn't it? If Jesus gave the great commission, after Paul and Peter were matyred, who took up the challenged? See dates above...<br><br>Weird isn't it? Nothing was done by the Jews in between the periods of Paul and the modern hebraic folks, so nothing is wrong? But Western evangelists and preachers went out, and all they did was to get it wrong?
