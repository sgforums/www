To be like Him.Following Yahweh is not about compromise, its about doing what He wants us to do as right in HIS eyes by HIS standards and not ours. What sets that standard? His word. I am not telling you any different from what is written in your bible. So when the word tells me that someone is doing some thing wrong in the eyes of Yahweh, do I compromise? Say its ok... ?? Even in the OT, it was never about compromise, its about you keep yourselves HOLY, set apart... and I will destroy the rest. We are a commonwealth of Israel, so please do not tell me different. We become part of Israel and not the other way around. </span><br><br>Vince sorry.
