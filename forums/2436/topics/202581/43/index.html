Nothing spiritual about that. The shapes of the moon cake reflect the fullness of the moon at the middle of the month. Nothing untoward there.<br><br>these two events are totally different, there is no spiritual significance in the celebration of the midautumn festival, where there is much significance in celebrating Yeshua's ressurection as easter.

The emperor ordered a famous archer to shoot down the nine extra suns. When the task was accomplished, he was awarded a pill that would make him immortal but it was only eaten by his beautiful wife Chang O.<br><br>After taking the pill, she floated all the way to the moon and it is said her beauty is greatest on the day of the moon festival that takes place on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month.<br><br><strong>In the most famous legend, however, mooncakes are used to conceal secret messages sent among Chinese revolutionaries plotting the overthrow of the Mongol invaders in the 14th century.</strong><br><br>Whilst there may be varying versions of the significance of mooncakes, you have to note that the story that is most told and one that I was told when I was young was the third one, which I have highlighted in bold. There IS NO SPIRITUAL significance attached to this story.</div>

For whatever reasons, Christians and Muslims, I am not sure about Judaism, are more dogmatic and follow their doctrine more closely than members of other faiths. Lets not forget that there is a very strong proactive evangelism, if not provocative evangelism on their part.<br><br>It would then be natural for people to question back what you would choose to believe and what you would not choose to believe.
