            <div class='col-md body'>David Hilsley<br><br>In Matthew 24:3 Jesus is answering a question asked of Him by the disciples, concerning the time of His return and the end of the age. He responds by giving many of the Signs of the Times and the End of the Age. In the course of the discussion Jesus refers to a passage in Daniel 9 verses 24-28. Remember when Jesus teaches He often uses a technique called Remez, hinting at or alluding to. This time He is drawing the disciples attention to the prophecy of DanielÂ’s seventy weeks.<br><br>What follows, in this paper and others of the series, is a plausible interpretation of the whole picture of Daniel's 70 weeks. This is open to comment and for each of us to refine as the days go by. This interpretation itself is the fruit of many years of study, but nevertheless there are always new things to see and refinements to be added. Surprisingly, every small item can take many hours of prayerful study.<br><br>Daniel is an amazing book because it gives detailed and accurate prophecies relating to world history that have come to pass and that are yet to happen.<br><br>All the dates given in the Book of Daniel are approximately between 612 and 520 BC. That period of time is called the period of accepted chronology (i.e. most chronologists agree with the dates of the period. There may be a difference of a year either way, but most people accept those dates including Christians and non-Christians).<br><br>Daniel himself dates his book, in Daniel 1:1 Â“In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.Â” The date is 606 BC, some say 607, some say 605, but there is never more than a yearÂ’s difference. Daniel 1:21; Â“Daniel continued to the first year of King Cyrus.Â” The date of King Cyrus, who was Persian, is 539 BC. In the first chapter of Daniel you have a description of events occurring in 606BC and ending 539 BC. Daniel 2:1; Â“Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar reign,Â” the date is 604BC. Daniel 7:1; Â“In the first year of Belshazzar King of Babylon.Â” The first year of King Belshazzar was 553 BC. Daniel 8:1; Â“In the third year of King Belshazzar.Â” The third year 551 BC. Daniel 10:1; Â“In the third year of King Cyrus of Persia.Â” The third year of King Cyrus takes us to 537 BC.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part2<br><br>While we are dealing with the dating of the book of Daniel we need to take account of the difference of dates between Daniel and Jeremiah. In Daniel 1:1 we read, Â“In the third year of King Jehoiakim Nebuchadnezzar came and besieged Jerusalem.Â” When you read Jeremiah 25:1 which is talking about the same event we read, Â“In the fourth year of King JehoiakimÂ” so it appears that we have a difference in the dating. Some would say this proves the Bible cannot be trusted, but the truth is it proves the exact opposite!<br><br>Jeremiah was a Jewish person who was educated among the Jewish people and they counted the years of their kings like we do. When a king comes to the throne that is year one and the years go on accordingly 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Daniel however was taken as a young man into Babylon and trained in the Babylonian ways and the Babylonians did not count their king years by the same method as the Jewish people did. The Babylonians counted their king years this way. The year that a new king came to the throne it was called the Â“Accession Year,Â” the next year was year one, the following year then went on 2, 3, 4, etc.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part3<br><br>In Daniel we have the Â“accession yearÂ” and then one, two, three, etc. in Jeremiah we have one, two, three, four, etc. Instead of having a contraction between Daniel and Jeremiah what we actually have is an agreement.<br><br>The fact that the Babylonians counted their kings years differently was discovered not that long ago by Dr. E. Thiel, the great chronologist of the Hebrews, who wrote a book called Â“The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew KingsÂ” where if you are interested you will find a lot of useful information about the Kings.<br><br>Daniel 9: 1<br>Daniel 9 opens with the Jewish people under the LordÂ’s discipline, scattered among the nations and living in captivity in the land of Babylon. In 606 BCE king Nebuchadnezzar overran the land of Israel and took the city of Jerusalem. He then took some of the Jewish people into captivity in Babylon. So in Daniel 9 we have Daniel living in Babylon among the Jewish people and something dramatic has happened. Overnight the Medes and the Persians have overthrown the Babylonian Empire, which had controlled the Jewish people for sixty years. The man who overthrew the Babylonian Empire was the King of the Medo/Persian Empire a man called Cyrus the Great. Cyrus had an uncle called Darius the Mede and we find Biblical reference to him in<br><br>Daniel 5: 31<br>So Daniel 9: 1 tells us that it is DariusÂ’ first year of rulership and the date, which is very important to us, is 537 BCE (a useful source for checking this date and other historical details of the Empires of Babylon and of the Medes and Persians is the Cambridge Ancient History). At this time Daniel was a fairly old man, a highly placed political leader in Babylon and he turns to the book of Jeremiah and starts reading through his prophecies. Jeremiah lived before the Jewish people went into captivity in Babylon. Year after year Jeremiah preached to the Jewish people that if they continued in their ways, God would remove them from the land. When it occurred Jeremiah wrote about the history of King Nebuchadnezzar taking the land, and taking over Jerusalem. But he did not stop there, and in a remarkable passage in<br><br>Jeremiah 29: 1-15<br>Jeremiah gives the people of Israel hope, assuring them that the captivity will only last seventy years.<br><br>Daniel 9: 2<br>Daniel is reading Jeremiah and he knows the captivity will last seventy years and the first phase of the exile began in 606 BCE. If you add seventy years to 606 BCE you come to 536 BCE, so Daniel knows that if the 70 years began at the first phase of exile then IsraelÂ’s captivity will end in 536. Daniel started praying and<br><br>Daniel 9: 3-20<br>Is DanielÂ’s prayer God gives the answer in<br><br>Daniel 9: 21-23<br>The angel or archangel Gabriel, the same archangel who is going to announce the birth of the Messiah to Miriam (Mary), is going to give the GodÂ’s answer to DanielÂ’s prayer. The answer is<br><br>Daniel 9: 24-28<br>Just four verses and we will look at them in detail.<br><br>Daniel 9: 24<br>Notice first of all, the seventy weeks are determined on DanielÂ’s people the Jewish people and the city of Jerusalem. We have a problem because we all know what a week is it starts on Sunday and runs for the next seven days. So we read into the Scripture what we already know that seventy weeks are determined, but if we take this Scripture as literally seventy weeks, we will run into an awful lot of problems. The Hebrew word week is the word Shavua and it means seven it does not mean days, weeks, months, or years, it is the word for seven. Daniel 9: 24 is saying seventy times seven are determined on the Jewish people and the city of Jerusalem and there is no indication that it is days, weeks, months, years or anything else. There is another place in Daniel where the word Shavua is mentioned and this time it gives a clear time period to it.<br><br>Daniel 10: 2-3<br>In that passage the word Shavua is mentioned but it literally says in the Hebrew Shavua of days so here in this passage it is three seven of days. It is obvious it is not months or years, as no one could fast for twenty-one months let alone twenty-one years. In Daniel 9: 24 there is no qualification on the word Shavua.<br><br>Remember Daniel is standing in Babylon in 537 BCE, he is reading Jeremiah who said the captivity would last seventy years, and Daniel knows if you add seventy to 606 BCE the year the first phase of captivity began, you come to 536 BCE so Daniel knows in the next year or so the captivity may be over.<br>There are three points in GodÂ’s plan that we need to see;<br><br>To finish the transgression. In other words the Jewish people have sinned against God some time in the next year the judgement is over.<br>To make an end of sin, or in other words God is going to count them no more.<br>To make reconciliation for iniquity.<br>These three have to do with sin and it is both a lovely answer to DanielÂ’s prayer because the three Hebrew words here in relation to sin are the three words Daniel used when confessing the sin of the nation.<br><br>Daniel 9: 5<br>GodÂ’s answer to Daniel is that in seventy sevens it is all finished.<br><br>Thus it seems that there may have been an immediate application of the seventy sevens, namely the end of the exile in Babylon (the time between DanielÂ’s prayer and the first stage of the return from exile). Daniel may have been able to give immediate hope to his people, knowing that a decree would be given to herald the end of the exile after 70 years, and then after just over a year (reckoning the weeks literally) Jerusalem would be rebuilt. Yet, when it happened, the beginning of the return did not contain all of the elements of the 70 weeks, particularly the coming of the Messiah, whom we now know to be Jesus (Yeshua) and also the coming of the Abomination of Desolation. In addition, we now know that more about the history of the return at the time of Ezra and Nehemiah and so can add to the interpretation that Daniel might have imagined. In further studies we will look at the possible implication for other interpretations, which pointed more to the distant future.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part4<br><br>In this study we will look at the possible implication for other interpretations, which pointed more to the distant future. Last time we saw that Daniel 9:5 was GodÂ’s answer to Daniel, that in seventy sevens it is all finished. The first application of this prophecy is finished and the second application begins at a certain point and it will end at a certain point but when it ends sin will be dealt with, iniquity will be dealt with, reconciliation will have come in, there will be righteousness. As we can see that is clearly not the present situation in the world. That means that we have to look at what else this prophecy contains to see what if any has been fulfilled.<br><br>Daniel 9: verse 25 is the starting point and if we take the time period to be years then we have 490 years, and if that is case then it has to with the rebuilding of the Temple. In the fulfilment of prophecy when Nebuchadnezzar marched out of Jerusalem in 586 BCE all he left was a pile of rubble. He destroyed the whole place; it was a scene of total devastation.<br><br>Jeremiah 4: 4<br>Here is a prophecy; Gabriel says a day is going to come when someone will give an order to rebuild Jerusalem to its former glory. Now it is crucial to know when that decree was made. Which decree was it that applied? There are four possibilities in the Bible so let us look at them.<br><br>There was a decree by King Cyrus the Persian<br>By a man called Darius he was a Persian but not the one at the beginning of Daniel 9.<br>The first of two decrees given by a man called Artaxerxes Longimanus. Longimanus by the way simply means long handed one.<br>The second of the two decrees of Artaxerxes Longimanus.<br>It is critical to know which one of these decrees it is, because if we do not know which decree it is we do not know from which point the 490 years begins nor when it ends. Let us look at these decrees to see which one it is. The book of<br><br>Ezra 1: 1-3<br>This is the Cyrus decree and as we can see this is not the decree. It is a decree to build the Temple it is not to do with the city of Jerusalem.<br><br>Ezra 6: 1-3<br>This is the Darius decree, which is simply a restatement of the Cyrus decree so it is not that one.<br><br>Ezra 7: 11-17 &amp; 27<br>This is the first decree of Artaxerxes Longimanus. Did you know that the Persians were very good to the Jewish people? This decree is to do with the beautifying of the temple, so it is not this decree.<br><br>continued...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Part5<br><br>That only leaves us with number four, which is found in<br><br>Nehemiah 2: 1-8<br>This is the decree to rebuild the city and this is seventy or eighty years after the archangel Gabriel spoke. It is Artaxerxes LongimanusÂ’ second decree. The 490-year period begins with this decree found in<br><br>Nehemiah 2: 1 &amp; 8<br>The decree is given in the twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus so we can say, Â“great we have got the yearÂ”. Here comes the bad news most Christians disagree about the date. In fact people who have studied chronology all come up with different answers. They agree in batches but there is a twenty to twenty-five year difference and you need to be very careful when you date something like this that you take only Biblical information when you are dealing with dates. Many of these dates that non-Christian chronologists use are based on years of kings reigns given by Egyptian and Greek Scholars and different scholars disagree about the dates of the kings. In fact the Egyptian scholars are coming to the view that they have their dates wrong in many cases concerning the kings. The different views on the dates present us with a problem. I will give the view of the date that I take whilst recognising that there are differing views. The beginning date as far as I am concerned is 458 BCE. If you do a bit of arithmetic here and are careful when you cross from 1 BCE to 1 CE to make an adjustment, then take the year 458 BCE and add 490 years you come to 33 CE. Now we have the beginning part.<br><br>Daniel 9: 25<br>Unto Messiah the prince. So we have got 458 BCE, which is the beginning, and then we come through to a period of time connected to Messiah the Prince. And a division is given.<br><br>First there shall be seven sevens so there is seven weeks which we know is a period of 49 years.<br>The second section is 62 weeks, and if we multiply 62 *7 it is 434 years.<br>This section begins in 458 BCE and ends with Messiah the Prince but I am dividing up the time given by the archangel. The time is divided into 7 weeks and 62 weeks if you add those two up they come to sixty-nine weeks. 49 years and 434 years added together come to 483 years and there are the divisions. We know that the total time period is 490 years or seventy sevens so the time of Messiah the Prince must be seven years. One week or seven years. We have got seven sevens or 49 years then 62 sevens or 434 years then one seven or seven years making a total of 70 sevens and 490 years. All that is being said in Daniel is, instead of 490 years being one section of time; divide it up into three sections.<br><br>Daniel 9: 25<br>There is one part in the King James Version that, according to some scholars, has been translated incorrectly. It says in Â“troublest timesÂ” and scholars say it should be translated Â“in the little bitÂ”, Â“straight bitÂ”, or the Â“narrow bit of timeÂ”. If this is so, what is being said is that in the straight, narrow or little bit of time, the last week the city will be completed. Verse 25 looks very complicated but, taking this view, it really is very easy. At the end of forty nine years starting at 458 BCE the city will be completed, and then, as the angel said, there will be a period of sixty two sevens until you get the period of time connected with Messiah the Prince. This will be the subject of the next study.</div>
