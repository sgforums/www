            <div class='col-md body'>Five-Fingered Prayer<br>This devotional was written by Kelly McFadden<br><br>Â“And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.Â”  Ephesians 6:18<br><br>Recently, an email was sent to me that demonstrated how to use your fingers to pray.  Each finger can be used to bring to mind different ways to pray for those around you.  If youÂ’re looking for ideas to improve your prayer life, give it a try.<br><br>Thumb:  The strongest digit on your hand. Give thanks for all the strong things in your life, like home and family, or relationships that support and sustain you.<br><br>Index finger:  This is the pointing finger. Pray for those people and things that guide and help you in your life. Friends, teachers, doctors, nurses, emergency services and so on.<br><br>Middle finger:  The tallest finger. Pray for all the important people who have power in the world, like world leaders and governments, members of parliament and local councilors, city mayors and aldermen, our president.<br><br>Ring finger:  The weakest finger on your hand. It cannot do much by itself (ask anyone who plays piano). Remember the poor, the weak, the helpless, the hungry, the sick, the ill and the bereaved.<br><br>Little finger:  The smallest and the last finger on your hand. Pray for yourself.<br><br>One of the things I like most about this guide to prayer is that it reminds me to keep others before myself.  Too often when I pray, I immediately present God with my needs, wants and desires, and then lose my train of thought before I even think to pray for anyone else. Try using this tool as you drive home from work or go out for a walk.  Prayer is something we can do at all times and this may be just the tool to make it a part of your life, not just something you do before you go to bed or face a difficult situation.   Prayer is an activity we canÂ’t engage in enough.  God hears our prayers and your hand is a good way to remind yourself to pray for someone else.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not of the Extraordinary<br><br>"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside, of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush" (Exod. 3:1,2).<br><br>The vision came in the midst of common toil, and that is where the Lord delights to give His revelations. He seeks a man who is on the ordinary road, and the Divine fire leaps out at his feet. The mystic ladder can rise from the market place to Heaven. It can connect the realm of drudgery with the realms of grace.<br><br>My Father God, help me to expect Thee on the ordinary road. I do not ask for sensational happenings. Commune with me through ordinary work and duty. Be my Companion when I take the common journey. Let the humble life be transfigured by Thy presence.<br><br>Some Christians think they must be always up to mounts of extraordinary joy and revelation; this is not after God's method. Those spiritual visits to high places, and that wonderful intercourse with the unseen world, are not in the promises; the daily life of communion is. And it is enough. We shall have the exceptional revelation if it be right for us.<br><br>There were but three disciples allowed to see the transfiguration, and those three entered the gloom of Gethsemane. No one can stay on the mount of privilege. There are duties in the valley. Christ found His life-work, not in the glory, but in the valley and was there truly and fully the Messiah. The value of the vision and glory is but their gift of fitness for work and endurance. --Selected<br><br></div>

Down beneath the surface that is agitated by storms, and driven about with winds, there is a part of the sea that is never stirred. When we dredge the bottom and bring up the remains of animal and vegetable life we find that they give evidence of not having been disturbed in the least, for hundreds and thousands of years. The peace of God is that eternal calm which, like the cushion of the sea, lies far too deep down to be reached by any external trouble and disturbance; and he who enters into the presence of God, becomes partaker of that undisturbed and undisturbable calm.--Dr. A. T. Pierson<br><br>When winds are raging o'er the upper ocean,<br>And billows wild contend with angry roar,<br>'Tis said, far down beneath the wild commotion,<br>That peaceful stillness reigneth evermore.<br><br>Far, far beneath, the noise of tempest dieth,<br>And silver waves chime ever peacefully,<br>And no rude storm, how fierce soe'er it flieth,<br>Disturbs the Sabbath of that deeper sea.<br><br>So to the heart that knows Thy love, O Purest,<br>There is a temple sacred evermore,<br>And all the babble of life's angry voices<br>Dies in hushed silence at its peaceful door.<br><br>Far, far away, the roar of passion dieth,<br>And loving thoughts rise calm and peacefully,<br>And no rude storm, how fierce soe'er it flieth,<br>Disturbs the soul that dwells, O Lord, in Thee.<br>--Harriet Beecher Stowe<br><br>"The Pilgrim they laid in a large upper chamber, facing the sun-rising. The name of the chamber was Peace."  --Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ready to Move<br><br>"For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens" (2 Cor.5:1).<br><br>The owner of the tenement which I have occupied for many years has given notice that he will furnish but little or nothing more for repairs. I am advised to be ready to move.<br><br>At first this was not a very welcome notice. The surroundings here are in many respects very pleasant, and were it not for the evidence of decay, I should consider the house good enough. But even a light wind causes it to tremble and totter, and all the braces are not sufficient to make it secure. So I am getting ready to move.<br><br>It is strange how quickly one's interest is transferred to the prospective home. I have been consulting maps of the new country and reading descriptions of its inhabitants. One who visited it has returned, and from him I learn that it is beautiful beyond description; language breaks down in attempting to tell of what he heard while there. He says that, in order to make an investment there, he has suffered the loss of all things that he owned here, and even rejoices in what others would call making a sacrifice. Another, whose love to me has been proven by the greatest possible test, is now there. He has sent me several clusters of the most delicious fruits. After tasting them, all food here seems insipid.<br><br>Two or three times I have been down by the border of the river that forms the boundary, and have wished myself among the company of those who were singing praises to the King on the other side. Many of my friends have moved there. Before leaving they spoke of my coming later. I have seen the smile upon their faces as they passed out of sight. Often I am asked to make some new investments here, but my answer in every case is, "I am getting ready to move." --Selected<br><br>The words often on Jesus' lips in His last days express vividly the idea, "going to the Father." We, too, who are Christ's people, have vision of something beyond the difficulties and disappointments of this life. We are journeying towards fulfillment, completion, expansion of life. We, too, are "going to the Father." Much is dim concerning our home-country, but two things are clear. It is home, "the Father's House." It is the nearer presence of the Lord. We are all wayfarers, but the believer knows it and accepts it. He is a traveller, not a settler. --R. C. Gillie<br><br>The little birds trust God, for they go singing<br>From northern woods where autumn winds have blown,<br>With joyous faith their trackless pathway winging<br>To summer-lands of song, afar, unknown.<br><br>Let us go singing, then, and not go sighing:<br>Since we are sure our times are in His hand,<br>Why should we weep, and fear, and call it dying?<br>'Tis only flitting to a Summer-land.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Psalm 124:7<br>Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we escaped.<br><br>Clifford was a strange man. He served his country in Vietnam and spent three years as a prisoner of war. While a prisoner, he amazed his companions by never complaining about their situation. In fact, when questioned about it, he smiled and said, "I'm not really here, anyway." Once Cliff returned to the States, he shared what he had meant. Each day he sat against the stone wall and began listing in his mind all the places he had ever been that he had loved. He pictured those places, and he selected a different one every day. In his mind he journeyed to the beloved spots and he turned off the reality around him.<br><br>As believers, we need to do the same thing. We're not from here. Our true home is with God in heaven. When the reality around us gets too intense and hard to handle, we should turn our thoughts to God. We can be liberated from the trap if we will only call upon the Lord.

            <div class='col-md body'>Seeing a Greater Purpose in Adversity<br>Acts 16:28<br>But Paul shouted,"Don't harm yourself! We are all here!"<br><br>Paul and Silas had just been thrown into prison. An earthquake erupted and the jail cell was opened. It's Paul and Silas' opportunity. "Deliverance! Praise God!" might be the appropriate response. But this is not what Paul and Silas did. In fact, rather than leave, they sat quietly in their cell area. The guard, in fear of his life, knew that it would be automatic death if prisoners escaped. Paul and Silas did not leave because they saw a higher purpose for which they were in prison. They were not looking at their circumstance; they were much more concerned about the unsaved guard. The story goes on to explain how Paul and Silas went home with the guard and his family. Not only did the guard get saved, but his entire household as well.<br><br>What a lesson this is for us. How often we are so busy looking for deliverance from our circumstance that we miss God completely. God is looking to do miracles in our circumstances if we will only look for them. Sometimes as businesspeople we become so obsessed with our goals we miss the process that God involves us in, which may be where the miracle lies. What if that bill collector who has been hounding you is unsaved and he is there for you to speak to? What if a problem account has arisen due to something God is doing beyond what you might see at this time? Our adverse situations can often be the door of spiritual opportunity for those who need it.<br><br>I saw this personally when God allowed me to go through a number of adversities. It took some time, but I saw some great miracles as a result of those adversities. When God said that "all things work together for good for those who are called according to His purposes" (see Rom. 8:2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, He meant all things. It is up to us to find the "work together for good" part by being faithful to the process. In the next adversity you face, tune your spiritual antennae and ask God for discernment to see the real purpose for the adversity.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Proper Foundation<br>Psalms 127:1<br>Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in vain.<br><br>Imagine spending years building an expensive home with the finest materials and craftsmanship. It is a work of art, and the project is almost complete. As the day arrives to move in, a building inspector arrives and hands you a notice that condemns your beautiful home because it doesn't meet code.<br><br>Many Christian businesspeople who invest years in their businesses will one day stand before the Lord and realize they were building the house, not the Lord. God is very picky about motives behind the actions. Before we act, we must ask why? Why are we doing what we are doing? Has God called us to this task? Or is the real motive purely financial? Or control. Or prestige.<br><br>If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work (1 Corinthians 3:12-13).<br><br>David learned this principle by the end of his life. Throughout his life he had learned that God always tested him to find out what was in his heart, and what his motive was in his actions. David instructed his son to "...acknowledge the God of your father, and serve Him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the Lord searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts" (1 Chron. 28:9a).<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.<br><br>How real is the spiritual realm? My lawyer friend from Nigeria tells a personal story of how he was preparing for an important case. He knew that he must be prepared to argue five separate points. He was to appear before his country's supreme court, so it was a very important case.<br><br>As he neared the time in which he was to go to court, he began to pray about how he was to argue the case. He spent much time in legal preparation and intercessory prayer. As he went to court, the Spirit spoke to him and said, "Do not argue point one, point two, point three, or point four. Only argue point five." Imagine my friend's struggle of faith. If he were reading this wrong, the shame and professional fallout would be devastating.<br><br>The time had come to present the case before the judge when my friend said, "Judge, I wish to withdraw points one through four. I wish to argue only point five."<br><br>The opposing counsel stood up and objected. "Your honor, he cannot do that!"<br><br>"Objection overruled, counsel," said the judge.<br><br>My friend went on to present his case around point five only, and then sat down. When the opposing counsel stood to present his case, he stood speechless for 12 minutes. He could not get a word out of his mouth. He finally mumbled a few words and complained to the judge that he was going to have to yield. It seems that the opposing counsel had prepared to argue only points one through four, but failed to prepare for point five. The judge ruled in favor of my friend.<br><br>The unseen Lord wants to help us in the physical realm of our work life. We must acknowledge His presence and tap into this incredible resource He has given to each of us. Seek Him today and ask Him to reveal His perfect plan for you this day.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Shoe Salesman<br>Matthew 19:26<br>Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."<br><br>Dwight L. Moody was a poorly educated, unordained, shoe salesman who felt God's call to preach the gospel. Early one morning he and some friends gathered in a hay field for a season of prayer, confession, and consecration. His friend Henry Varley said, "The world has yet to see what God can do with and for and through and in a man who is fully and wholly consecrated to Him." Moody was deeply moved by these words. He later went to a meeting where Charles Spurgeon was speaking. In that meeting Moody recalled the words spoken by his friend, "The world had yet to see!...with and for and through and in!...A man!" Varley meant any man! Varley didn't say he had to be educated, or brilliant, or anything else. Just a man! Well, by the Holy Spirit in him, he'd be one of those men. Then suddenly, in that high gallery, he saw something he'd never realized before. It was not Mr. Spurgeon, after all, who was doing that work; it was God. And if God could use Mr. Spurgeon, why should He not use the rest of us, and why should we not all just lay ourselves at the Master's feet and say to Him, "Send me! Use me!"<br><br>D.L. Moody was an ordinary man who sought to be fully and wholly committed to Christ. God did extraordinary things through this ordinary man. Moody became one of the great evangelists of modern times. He founded a Bible college, Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, that sends out men and women trained in service for God.<br><br>Are you an ordinary man or woman in whom God wants to do extraordinary things? God desires that for every child of His. Ask God to do extraordinary things in your life. Begin today to trust Him to accomplish great things for His Kingdom through you.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

Years of exposure and experience in life have etched grooves in our memory banks which are triggered by current events.<br><br>For example, if your kind, loving grandfather was named Bill, you probably have a favorable emotional reaction to other people named Bill. But if the school bully was named Bill, your initial reaction to the Bills in your life is probably negative. If your spouse suggests, "Let's name our first child Bill," you might even react, "Over my dead body!"<br><br>I call these long-term emotions which lurk beneath the surface primary emotions . The intensity of your primary emotions is determined by your previous life history. The more traumatic your experience, the more intense will be your primary emotion. Many of these primary emotions will lie dormant and have very little effect on your life until something comes along to trigger them. Have you ever brought up a topic of conversation which upset someone and sent him storming out of the room? "What set him off?" you wondered. He was "set off" because a bad experience in his past was triggered by your topic. The trigger is any present event which he associates with the past conflict.<br><br>Most people try to control their primary emotions by avoiding the people or events which trigger them. But you can't isolate yourself completely from everything which may set off a response. You are bound to see something on TV or hear something in a conversation which will bring to mind your unpleasant experience. You must learn how to resolve previous conflicts or the emotional baggage will accumulate and the past will control your life.<br><br>During the next few days, we will consider ways to resolve our emotional baggage from the past.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Lord, I don't want to be controlled by past events. Show me how I can resolve these issues so I can walk in freedom today.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GOD'S MINISTRY OF DARKNESS<br>2 Corinthians 4:11<br>For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh<br><br>What is the point of troubled times in our lives? What is God trying to do? What is He trying to teach us? Peter wrote, "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you; but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing; so that also at the revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exultation" (1 Peter 4:12, 13).<br><br>In God's ministry of testing, we learn a lot about ourselves. Whatever is left of simplistic advice such as "Read your Bible" or "Just work harder" or "Pray more" gets stripped away. Most people going through testing times would love to resolve the crisis, but they seemingly can't and don't know why.<br><br>In God's ministry of darkness we learn compassion. We learn to wait patiently with people. We learn to respond to the emotional needs of people who have lost hope. We weep with those who weep. We don't try to teach or instruct or advise. If God took away every external blessing and reduced our assets to nothing more than meaningful relationships, would that be enough to sustain us? Yes, I believe it would.<br><br>Perhaps God brings us to the end of our resources so we can discover the vastness of His. We don't hear many sermons about brokenness in our churches these days, yet in all four Gospels Jesus taught us to deny ourselves, pick up our cross daily, and follow Him. I don't know any painless way to die to ourselves, but I do know that it's necessary and that it's the best possible thing that could ever happen to us.<br><br>"No pain, no gain," says the body builder. Isn't that true in the spiritual realm as well (Hebrews 12:11)? Proven character comes from persevering through the tribulations of life (Romans 5:3-5). Every great period of personal growth in my life and ministry has been preceded by a major time of testing.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Lord, I submit to Your testing so I may come to the end of my resources and joyfully discover Yours.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SING AND MAKE MELODY<br>Ephesians 5:18, 19<br>Be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord<br><br>How pathetically unaware we are of the biblical prominence of music in the spiritual realm. It is interesting to note that whenever the evil spirit came upon King Saul, David (the heir apparent to Israel's throne) would play his harp and the evil spirit would depart (1 Samuel 16:23). When Elisha was about to inquire of God, he said, "'Now bring me a minstrel.' And it came about, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him" (2 Kings 3:15). During the reign of David, more than 4000 musicians were assigned to sing in the temple night and day (1 Chronicles 9:33; 23:5). It is the mark of Spirit-filled Christians to sing and make melody in their hearts to the Lord and speak to each other in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs (Ephesians 5:18, 19).<br><br>On the other side of the truth lies the destructive power of secular music. A former satanic high priest showed me numerous symbols on popular record albums indicating commitment and bondage to Satanism. He told me that about 85 percent of today's heavy metal and punk music groups are "owned" by Satanists. They have unwittingly sold themselves to Satanism in exchange for fame and fortune. Few of these artists actually practice Satanism, but most are hopelessly lost and lead others astray through the godless message in their music.<br><br>God created sound and formed our bodies to respond to it. Our ears pick up the sound around us and send a signal to the brain. Some sounds irritate us; others soothe us. There is music that makes you want to march and music that puts you to sleep. Even without lyrics, music with harmony and order can affect the nervous system positively while discord produces a negative effect.<br><br>What role does music play in your life? Are you filling your mind and home with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs? Or are you allowing destructive secular music to rob you of your joy and vitality in the Lord?<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>You are the God who sings over me, Lord. Thank You for the gift of music and for the songs You give me in the night.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DON'T BELIEVE IT<br>Leviticus 19:31<br>Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them<br><br>Where do mediums and spiritists get their "amazing" information and insights? Many of them are demonic channelers, but much of what is called "spiritism" and "psychic phenomena" is no more than clever illusion. hese so-called spiritists give what is referred to as "cold readings." You go to them for advice or direction, and they ask you a few simple, leading questions. Based on the information you give, they make general observations which are probably true of most people in your situation. But you're so impressed with the accuracy of their "revelations" that you start tipping them off to all kinds of details which they can fabricate into their "reading." This is not demonic; it's just mental and verbal sleight-of-hand.<br><br>But the mediums and spiritists that God warned against in Leviticus and Deuteronomy were not con artists, but people who possessed and passed on knowledge which didn't come through natural channels of perception. These people have opened themselves up to the spirit world and have become channels of knowledge from Satan. The charlatan with his phony cold readings is only interested in bilking you of your money. But the false knowledge and direction which comes from Satan through a medium is intended to bilk you of your spiritual vitality and freedom.<br><br>There's big money in psychic/con artist operations, and a lot of magicians are raking it in. Many people crave to know something extra about their lives and their future, and they will pay handsomely if they think you can give them the inside information they desire.<br><br>When a psychic claims to have contacted the dead, don't believe it. When a psychologist claims to have regressed a client back to a former existence through hypnosis, don't believe it. When a New Age medium purports to channel a person from the past into the present, realize that it is nothing more than a familiar spirit or the fraudulent work of a con artist.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Lord Jesus, You are the way, the truth and the life.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let the River Run Deep<br>John Piper<br><br>I have always felt that the works of the famous British New Testament scholar, F. F. Bruce, are unnecessarily dry. In reading his memoirs, In retrospect, I discovered one of the reasons why. He said, "I do not care to speak much-especially in public-about the<br>things that mean most to me."1 When you eliminate what means most to you from your writing and speaking, they will be dry. For myself, I would say just the opposite: "I do not care to speak much-especially in public-about the things that don't mean most to me."<br><br>This raises a question that is larger than the relative transparency of our souls. It raises the question about the way in which deep emotions can be expressed in public. What is the place of spontaneity and form in venting the passions of one's heart? This is more of a<br>problem for me than for Bruce. That's one reason I moved from teaching in college to preaching in the church. I assume passion has a big place in the life of a preacher. So maybe my ruminations on how Jeremiah handles emotions in the Book of Lamentations will fit your soul too.<br><br>I will make two observations about "The Lamentations of Jeremiah" and then draw out some implications for the use of spontaneity and form in the expression of "what means most to us."<br><br>First, Lamentations is a deeply emotional book. Jeremiah writes about what means most to him, and he writes in agony. He feels all the upheaval of Jerusalem in ruins. There is weeping (1:2), desolation (1:4), mockery (1:7), groaning (1:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, hunger (1:11), grief (2:11), and the horrid loss of compassion as mothers boil their own children to eat them (2:20; 4:10). If there ever was intensity and fervor in the expression of passion from the heart, this is it.<br><br>The second observation, then, comes as a surprise: This seems to be the most formally crafted book in the Old Testament. Of the five chapters, chapters 1, 2, and 4 are each divided into twenty-two stanzas (the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet), and each stanza begins with a different letter of the alphabet. They are three acrostics.<br><br>Chapter 3 is even more tightly structured. Again there are twenty-two stanzas, but now each stanza has exactly three lines. The three lines in each stanza begin with the same letter, and each of the twenty-two stanzas begins with a different letter in alphabetical order.<br><br>This is the only chapter that is not an acrostic. But it still has twenty-two lines in conformity with the acrostic pattern of chapters 1-4. Now what do these two observations imply? First, they imply that genuine, heartfelt expression of our deepest emotions does not require spontaneity. Just think of all the mental work involved in finding all the right words to construct four alphabetical acrostics!<br><br>What constraint, what limitation, what submission to form! Yet what passion and power and heart! There is no necessary contradiction between form and fire.<br><br>Chapter 3 of Lamentations is the most personal and most intense. Here first-person references abound: "Remember my affliction and my wanderings, the wormwood and the gall!" (3:19). Here the peak of hope is reached: "Great is your faithfulness!" (3:23). But here the author submits himself to the narrowest form in all the book.<br><br>After reading Lamentations, we can no longer believe that unpondered prayers are more powerful or real or passionate or heartfelt or genuine or alive than prayers that are thoughtfully and earnestly (and painfully?) poured out through a carefully crafted form. The danger of formalism is real. Prayers and sermons that are read from a manuscript are usually stiff and unnatural and artificial.<br><br>But the danger of spontaneity is also great. If the heart is without passion, it will produce lifeless, jargon-laden spontaneity. And if the heart is aflame, no form will quench it.<br><br>But not only is spontaneity no necessary advantage and form no necessary hindrance to deep, personal expression of feeling, but even more, formed affection often strikes deeper. Deeper into reality and deeper into the hearer. Formed grief, while not heaving to and fro with uncontrollable sobs, has a peculiar profundity.<br><br>Imagine a man's response when he first hears that his wife and children have been taken captive by the enemy and slaughtered. He throws himself to the ground, cries out in torment, rips his clothes, and rubs his head in ashes, until his energy ebbs into a pitiable "No, no, no." Here is utter spontaneity, utterly real emotion, no studied design, no conscious constraints.<br><br>But picture this man a week later, when the services are over and the friends have departed, and he is alone with the weight of his loss. The excruciating pain of the first blast is gone, and now there is the throb and ache of an amputated soul. What does he do to express this deep and settling grief? Between the periodic heaving sobs he reaches for a form and begins to make his lamentation.<br><br>Studied, crafted, pondered, full of power. When the time comes, he will read or recite this lamentation. But no one will say of this formed grief: "It is canned." On the contrary, it will strike deeper than the sobs. It will show more of what he has brought up from the depths.<br><br>Emotions are like a river flowing out of one's heart. Form is like the riverbanks. Without them the river runs shallow and dissipates on the plain. But banks make the river run deep. Why else have humans for centuries reached for poetry when we have deep affections to express? The creation of a form happens because someone feels a passion. How ironic, then, that we often fault form when the real evil is a dry spring.<br><br>Years ago I wrote a poem called "The Innkeeper," about the pain that the innkeeper may have experienced when Herod's soldiers came to kill the baby boys and started the slaughter at the innkeeper's place-"the price for housing the Messiah here." In the introduction I pondered why poets struggle to let deep emotion flow through narrow forms of art.<br><br>Why this struggle? Why does the poet bind his heart with such a severe discipline of form? Why strain to give shape to suffering? Because Reality has contours. God is who He is, not what we wish or try to make Him be. His Son, Jesus Christ, is the great granite Fact. His hard sacrifice makes it evident that our spontaneity needs Calvarylike discipline. Perhaps the innkeeper paid dearly for housing the Son of God. Should it not be costly to penetrate and portray this pain?2<br><br>Many pastors are not known for expressing deep emotions. This seems to me especially true in relation to the profoundest theological realities. This is not good, because we ought to experience the deepest emotions about the deepest things. And we ought to speak often, and publicly, about what means most to us, in a way that shows its value.<br><br>Brothers, we must let the river run deep. This is a plea for passion in the pulpit, passion in prayer, passion in conversation. It is not a plea for thin, whipped-up emotionalism. ("Let's all stand up and smile!") It is a plea for deep feelings in worthy forms from Godbesotted<br>hearts and minds.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ReÂ’eh Â“BeholdÂ”- Devarim (Deuteronomy) 11:26- 16:17<br><br>Sh'muel Alef / I Samuel 20:18-42<br>Yeshayahu / Isaiah 54:11-55:5<br>Yaacov / James 2:19<br>By Rabbi Yaakov benYosef Â– ABOUT-Torah.org<br><br>The abundance of religions that exist today makes it difficult to discern the truth. As a result, many individuals are deceived into following false teachings. One of the most extreme cases of false teaching is a group that believes God is an extraterrestrial. They worship a God who they believe is technically advanced, and who will return to earth and reveal himself when humans are ready. Because of this, and other false teachings it is becoming easy for individuals to be confused. People can believe in and worship a God that fits into his or her own personal beliefs. However, HaShem defines Himself clearly in the Torah. Worshiping a God that that fits our personal beliefs can lead us to worship a false God. We must put aside our own impressions of what God is like, and discover the truth of HaShem from the Torah.  In fact, in Mathew 7:13-14 Yeshua stated Â“Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.Â” Deception is easy to accept because the deceiver always presents a God that fits into our perception of what God is supposed to be like. In other words, the deceiver tells us what we want to hear.<br><br>False prophets are some of the most dangerous types of deceivers. A false prophet not only tells individuals what they want to hear, a false prophet also presents his or her teaching in the name of HaShem. Therefore, a false prophet comes appearing as an emissary of the one true God.  Believers are often afraid to confront them, because false prophets come in the name of HaShem. However, Rav Shaul had no problem confronting false prophets. He warned the Corinthians in Corinthians 11:13-14 by saying Â“For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.Â” Even when false prophets come appearing as angels of light we must be prepared to confront them with the truth. In ReÂ’eh HaShem makes it clear that false prophets are to be confronted. ReÂ’eh establishes the guidelines needed to discern between a false prophet and a prophet of HaShem.<br><br>Devarim 13:1-3 states Â“If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder, And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; Thou shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreamsÂ” HaShem makes it clear that a prophetÂ’s use of signs and wonders is not sufficient proof that the prophet is a prophet of HaShem. According to the passage, the only way to determine a false prophet is whether or not the prophet leads individuals away from serving HaShem. We can see the danger of trusting in signs and wonders in Revelations 13:11-14, which states: Â“another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.Â” Following after signs and wonders will deceive many into believing the anti-Christ is a prophet of HaShem. Instead of relying on signs and wonder we must find a more accurate way of determining HaShemÂ’s prophets from false prophets.<br><br>Yeshua expounds on Devarim 13, and explains in Mathew 7:15-20 how to recognize false prophets when he states Â“Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheepÂ’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth-good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth-evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.Â” Yeshua makes it clear that it is by his or her fruit that a false prophet can be recognized. The fruit Yeshua is speaking of is the fruit that leads individuals back to HaShem. We can see this in Devarim 13:2-3 which states Â“Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; Thou shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God prove you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.Â” The desirable fruit of a prophet is to draw individuals and make them followers of HaShem. In other words, true prophets of HaShem produce the fruit of repentance.<br><br>The prophetÂ’s fruit of repentance can be determined by the prophetÂ’s use of the two tools HaShem has given for repentance. The first tool HaShem gives to a prophet to lead individuals to repentance is the Torah. The Torah was given to show the differences between HaShem and false Gods. Therefore, the Torah leads people to HaShem because it defines who He is. This goes against a false prophetÂ’s desire to exult idols, and to lead individuals away from HaShem. Yeshua even clarified that He was using the Torah to lead individuals to repentance in Mathew 5:17 when he stated Â“Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.Â” If a person proclaiming to be a prophet leads people away from HaShem by rendering the Torah meaningless he or she is a false prophet. Secondly, HaShem gave us Yeshua to reveal His own-essence. Therefore, Yeshua is a reflection of HaShem. False prophets lead individuals away from HaShem by negating the importance of Yeshua. One example of this can be seen in 1John 4:3 which states Â“every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.Â” Because a false prophetÂ’s mission is to lead individuals away from HaShem, the fruit of a false prophet will not magnify the Torah or exalt Yeshua.<br><br>The anti-messiah and other false prophets feed on the innate human desire to experience the miraculous. By producing signs and wonders false prophets can deceive individuals into following false gods. Yeshua warns us of this danger in Mathew 24:24 when He states Â“There shall arise false Messiahs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.Â” However, the elect of HaShem will be able to determine a true prophet from a false prophet by the fruit that the prophet produces. A false prophet produces fruit that leads individuals away from HaShem. A true prophet produces fruit that leads individuals into repentance and back to HaShem. Therefore, a true prophet will magnify the Torah and exult Yeshua, and a false prophet will not.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ki Tetze Â“When you goÂ”<br>Devarim (Deuteronomy) 21:10- 25:19<br>Yeshayahu / Isaiah 54:1-10<br>Mattityahu / Matthew 19:3-9<br><br>By Rabbi Yaakov benYosef<br><br>In the Torah, there are many examples of how obedience is a key component of faith. The Brit Hadasha even gives examples of how obedience led individuals to demonstrate their faith to the world. For example, NoahÂ’s obedience led him to build the ark, despite the signs around him. Noah's obedience to HaShem's warning became a witness, to other individuals. Obedience is one of the most effective ways to demonstrate our faith to the world. Every faithful servant has to be obedient. Through obedience, the world witnesses the power and glory of HaShem. Our obedience to HaShem, allows the world to see a visible distinction between the followers of Yeshua and the rest of the world. It is crucial that believers strive to become obedient and serve HaShem in all areas of their lives. In Ki Tetze, we can see that a vow is one form of obedience. However, unlike other forms of obedience a vow is publicly declared. As a result, failure to fulfill a vow makes it a negative public witness. Therefore, believers should not make vows without full consideration of the resulting consequences.<br><br>Devarim 23:21-23 states Â“When you shall vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, you shall not hesitate to pay it: for the LORD your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you. But if you shall not vow, it will not be sin to you. That which is gone out of your lips you shall keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as you have vowed unto the LORD thy God, which you have promised with your mouth.Â”<br><br>HaShem requires all vows to be fulfilled. When we donÂ’t fulfill a vow HaShem considers it sin. Therefore, we must not make impulsive vows. The consequences of a vow made impulsively can either lead us to sin by not fulfilling the vow, or to fulfill a vow that has devastating consequences. Shoftim 11:30-37 states<br><br>Â“Yiftach vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. So Yiftach passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands. And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus, the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. And Yiftach came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. And it happened, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back. And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened your mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for you of your enemies, even of the children of Ammon. And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me:Â”<br><br>Yiftach did not consider the consequences of his vow. As a result, Yiftach's vow led Yiftach to commit sin. Yiftach had two choices, which were to sin against HaShem by not fulfilling the vow, or to sin against HaShem by offering his daughter. When Yiftach made the vow, the vow became Holy. As a result, Yiftach was required to fulfill his vow.  Unfortunately, Yiftach and his daughter paid a very high price for YiftachÂ’s impulsive vow.<br><br>Yeshua also warns his followers not to make vows impulsively. Mathew 5:33-37 states, Â“you have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform unto the Lord your oaths: But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shall thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yes; No: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evilÂ”. Individuals do not have the power to control the consequences of their vows. Therefore, Yeshua prefers, that we not make vows. An impulsive vow can put us in a situation similar to Yiftach. If Yiftach had foreseen that his daughter would be the first out of the door, he would not have made the vow. Yeshua makes it clear that His followerÂ’s obedience should be based on yes or no, instead of a promise to fulfill a vow. Therefore, it is better for believers to witness to the world through a lifestyle of obedience, than demonstrate obedience to the world through the fulfillment of vows.<br><br>A foundational component of faith is obedience. The faithful individuals listed in the scripture, were obedient to HaShem despite their circumstances. One way some individuals choose to display obedience is the vow. However, vows are a public display for the world to see. The Torah considers a vow, to be a Holy action, between an individual and HaShem. As a result, when an individual makes a vow the vow must be fulfilled. Yeshua warns us that it is better to serve HaShem with yes or no, than to make a vow that cannot be fulfilled. Therefore, when a believer makes a vow, the individual must fully weigh the cost. A Believer can be obedient without making a vow. However, when an individual is led to make a vow he or she must be prepared to fulfill the vow despite the consequences.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ki Tavo Â“When you comeÂ”<br>Devarim (Deuteronomy) 26:1- 29:8<br>Yeshayahu / Isaiah 60:1-22<br>Uri / Luke 21:1-4<br><br>By Rabbi Yaakov benYosef<br><br>The Torah describes the tithe and the offering differently. The offering was voluntary and the tithe was mandatory. This distinction between tithes and offerings is understandable, considering that HaShem expected tithes and offerings to be used for different purposes. In HaShemÂ’s plan the offering was used for special purposes that allowed individuals to voluntarily serve HaShem. Shemot 35:4-5 states Â“Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying, Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORDÂ”. HaShem makes it clear to Moshe that he should only collect offerings from individuals who were willing of heart. HaShemÂ’s desire is that all offerings are given because of a heart-felt conviction. Even when individuals brought offerings for sacrifice, HaShem wanted them to bring the offerings voluntarily. This was even true with the complete burnt offering. As a Corban offering, the complete burnt offering was set-aside exclusively for HaShem. However, the offering was not acceptable to HaShem unless it was offered voluntarily. We can see this in Vayikra 1:3 which states Â“If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.Â”<br><br>The tithe was mandatory. This is because the Torah indicates that the tithe was used to support ministries that had already been established. For example, tithes were given as upkeep for the Levitical priesthood as Bamidbar 18:24 states Â“But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.Â” However, there are also other accounts of HaShem using tithes for ministries other than Levitical. BÂ’resheet 14:18-20 states Â“Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered your enemies into your hand. And he gave him tithes of all.Â” It is clear that tithes were always given to ministries that currently existed. Ki Tavo specifically addresses how HaShem used the first-fruit tithe and the tithe of the increase to continue His ministry to the Children of Yisrael.<br><br>Upon entry into the land the Children of Yisrael were required to take the first of all of the produce to the Levites. Devarim 26:1-3 states Â“it shall be, when you come into the land which the LORD thy God gave you for an inheritance, and possesses it, and dwell therein; that thou shall take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shall bring of thy land that the LORD thy God gives you, and shall put it in a basket, and shall go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there. You shall go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD swore unto our fathers for to give us.Â” HaShem required the Children of Yisrael to give the first-fruits of the land as a tithe. Therefore, HaShem was requiring the Children of Yisrael to fulfill the commandment in Vayikra 27:30 which states Â“all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORDÂ’S: it is holy unto the LORD.Â” HaShem wanted the Children of Yisrael to recite the deliverance narrative as they presented the first fruits to the priest. The first-fruit tithe was a remembrance of how HaShem delivered the Children of Yisrael from Egypt. After the completion of tithing, the entire camp used the tithe to rejoiced and celebrate in HaShemÂ’s presence. Therefore, everyone could witness the joy that came, when HaShem delivered the Children of Yisrael from bondage as Devarim 26:11 states Â“you shall rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given you, and your household, you, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you.Â” HaShem used this tithe as a tool for making real the story of the Exodus to each successive generation.  Therefore, this tithe became a teaching ministry to future generations who had not personally experienced the Exodus.<br><br>The second tithe Ki Tavo describes is the tithe of the increase. Devarim 26:12-13 states Â“When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of your increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled; Then thou shall say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:Â” The tithe of increase is also mandatory. However, the tithe of the increase is based on the increase that HaShem provides. The tithe of the increase is based on the amount of blessing that an individual receives. If an individualÂ’s crops, livestock, or other means of support fail to increase, the individual does not have a tithe to give. The tithe of the increase is unique because it is only collected from an individual every third year. HaShem commanded that the tithe of increase be specifically set-aside for the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless and the widow. The Levite, the stranger, the fatherless and the widow were considered unable to provide their own increases. The LeviteÂ’s had no inherited land and therefore relied on others for their sustenance. The stranger is not under the blessings of HaShem. The fatherless was no longer covered by the increase of his or her father. The widow was no longer covered by the increase of her husband. HaShem wanted everyone to share in his bountiful blessings. Therefore, HaShem used the tithe of increase to support those that would not have other wise experienced an increase.<br><br>In the Torah, offerings and tithes are considered differently and used for different purposes. The two primary differences are voluntary and mandatory. HaShem desired offerings to be given from a heart-felt conviction.  Therefore, offerings are voluntary. As a result, offerings were used for special projects and personal sanctification. HaShem realized the importance of continuing ministries that already existed. Therefore, tithes were mandatory, and set aside for the upkeep of ministries. Two tithes that HaShem used for outreach were the tithe of first-fruits and the tithe of increase. The tithe of the first-fruits was used to teach future generations about the deliverance from Egyptian bondage. The tithe of the increase was used share HaShemÂ’s blessings with less fortunate individuals. As a result, all of Yisrael was able to partake of the blessings of increase that HaShem provided. It is clear that HaShem wants us to understand that both duty and conviction are required to support His work.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Way of God<br>Psalms 81:13<br>If My people would but listen to Me....<br><br>God has a specific training ground for leaders. There are three patterns of preparation that have been common among most of God's leaders. First, there is a time when the leader is separated from his old life. Consider Moses, Joseph, Abraham, and Paul. In order for God to mold and shape them into His nature, it appears that He had to remove them from the life of comfort. A teacher once said, "You cannot go with God and remain where you are."<br><br>Next, there is usually a time of solitude. God often brings leaders into a time of solitude in order to speak to them without other distractions. Hosea 2:14b says, "I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her." Paul was sent to Arabia for two years for a time of solitude. Joseph spent years in the solitude of prison. Moses spent 40 years in the desert herding sheep.<br><br>The third characteristic of God's preparation for leaders is discomfort. The setting in which the preparation takes place usually is not a place of comfort. Abraham traveled through the difficult deserts. David lived in caves fleeing Saul. Paul was frequently persecuted.<br><br>Are you ready for the classroom of leadership preparation? If God chooses to bring you into this class, you may have one of three reactions to the events. First, you may say, "I don't need it." Perhaps you know intellectually that you do need this, but God wants you to know it in your heart. Pride prevents us from entering this classroom. The second reaction may be, "I'm tired of it." You decide you've had enough. If so, this will disqualify you from leadership. Finally, God's desired response from us in this preparation is, "I accept it." To accept it with joy is the place of maturity in Christ. God often keeps us in these places until we come to accept and agree that Jesus is enough. Is He all you need?<br><br>Like the people of Israel, I think we have something to do with the timetable of our education. "If My people would but listen to Me, if Israel would follow My ways, how quickly would I subdue their enemies and turn My hand against their foes!" (Ps. 81:13-14)<br><br>Are you ready for the process required for being a godly leader? Ask for His grace to willingly embrace these times of preparation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unless the Lord Goes With Us<br>Exodus 33:15<br>Then Moses said to him, "If Your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here."<br><br>Moses was in the middle of his journey through the wilderness, leading the people of Israel out of Egypt. The people had just sinned by worshiping the golden calf. Moses interceded for them and God spared them their lives. Moses then talked one on one with the Lord. He knew he could not lead this stubborn people without God's presence. He had come to realize that without God's presence, he could not do anything.<br><br>How will anyone know that You are pleased with me and with Your people unless You go with us? What else will distinguish me and Your people from all the other people on the face of the earth? (Exodus 33:16)<br><br>Moses did not want to move farther without the assurance that God was moving with him. He knew it was a life-and-death situation. He sought the Lord with his whole heart on this one matter.<br><br>The question is a good one. If we are to be effective in anything we do for the Lord, the Lord must be in the midst of it. Unless the Lord's power is seen among us, we will be just another person who has religion. Unless we manifest His life to others, they will see only good behavior that is easily counterfeited by moral people.<br><br>Moving out in presumption will end in failure and frustration. Ask the Lord today to assure you of His presence and power in your activities. Then you will be assured that you will be distinguished among all the other people on the face of the earth.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Calling by Name<br>Genesis 36:15<br>These were the chiefs among Esau's descendants: The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz.<br><br>God is big on giving meaning to names. Names often are specific indicators of God's plans and purposes for that individual. A young boy grew up as Moses' servant. His Hebrew name, Hoshea, means "salvation." As the lad grew, Moses could see that he had a "different spirit" from the rest of the Hebrew men. He was selected to be one of the 12 men whom Moses chose to spy out the land of Canaan. Before the expedition, Hoshea was given a new name by Moses-Joshua, which means "the Lord saves." Joshua became the new leader of Israel who would lead them into the Promised Land. He would, in fact, save an entire nation.<br><br>In my own journey I had learned that God gave me a name that had something to do with my future call from Him. I was 44 years old and had just gone through two of the most difficult years of my life. During that time, God brought a man into my life who discipled me in areas where I had never been trained. I was discovering many new spiritual truths about myself and Christians in the workplace. I came to identify with the struggles of Esau and Joseph in their desire to understand their own birthrights. I began to write about these discoveries to help other businesspeople understand their own callings through business. One morning on a weekend getaway in the mountains, my friend looked at me and said, "Do you know the meaning of 'Omar'?"<br><br>Omar is my first name. My real name is Omar Smallwood Hillman III. Dr. Smallwood had delivered my grandfather. No one, not even my mother, knew the origin of "Omar." They put the "O" and the "S" together to call me "Os."<br><br>"You need to know the meaning of 'Omar.' It has something to do with your future," said my friend.<br><br>Startled by his assertion, that night I looked up the name of "Omar" on a computer program. Here is what I found:<br><br>Arabic for "first son" and "disciple," Hebrew for "gifted speaker," and German for "famous." Rooted in the Middle East, this name is rarely used in the West. Omar was the grandson of Esau. [http://www2.parentsoup.com/babynames/baby/o.html]<br><br>I was shocked. I had just completed 300 pages of material on the relationship of Christian businessmen to the life of Esau. My friend quickly concluded that God had called me to free Christian businessmen and women from the "Esau life." And He had allowed me to receive a name that related to the person of Esau. It was the closest thing to a burning bush experience I'd ever had. Could the Lord be this personal with us? Yes, Matthew 10:30 tells us He knows the very hairs of our head.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Tool for Miracles<br>Judges 6:21<br>With the tip of the staff that was in his hand, the angel of the Lord touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the Lord disappeared.<br><br>How does God call people into His service? There is a clear pattern in the way God calls men and women into service for Him. Almost every major leader has been called while he or she was in the midst of performing his or her everyday vocation. Peter was a fisherman; Matthew, a tax collector; Luke, a physician; Paul, a tentmaker; Moses, a shepherd; Jesus, a carpenter; and so on.<br><br>When God called Gideon to free the people of Israel from the oppression of the Amalekites, he did so while Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress. Like Moses, Gideon argued with God, saying his family was nothing special, so how could he be used of God to save Israel? Gideon acknowledged God by preparing an offering to Him. The angel did an interesting thing with Gideon's offering; he took the tip of his staff and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. As with Moses, God chose to do a miracle with a staff, the instrument that symbolized Gideon's work life. Why would God do this? It is because God wants us to know that the tools He has given each of us are the tools He wants to use to demonstrate His power. However, in order for that to happen, we must yield our tools to Him for miracles to be manifested through them.<br><br>Have you yielded your tools to the Lord? God wants you to have an overriding ministry objective to your work life. He doesn't want you to leave your work; He wants to work through your work. Allow Him to do that today.<br><br></div>

For by itself the earth brings forth fruitÂ—first the stalk, after that the head, after that the full grain in the head. And as soon as the crop [is ready to] yield itself, immediately the man sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.Â” Mark 4:26-29<br><br>What proof do we have that the seed we scatter is the same seed that sprouts and grows? The evidence is all circumstantial. We reason that since something grows where we have scattered, it has indeed grown from our seed. The reality is that we never actually witness the seed from the moment it leaves our hand and is tilled in the groundÂ—we simply trust that what we have planted is what will grow. At night we sleep, during the day we are awakeÂ—but how it grows, we just donÂ’t know.<br><br>Â“By itself,Â” the Scriptures say, the soil produces a cropÂ—the Â“earth brings forth fruitÂ” of herself. What a mystery! It is not the seed or the sower that produces the crop, but the soil Â“by itself,Â” with no help from man. The manÂ’s work has already been done: he scattered the seed on the ground. Once embedded in its birthing place, life springs forthÂ—life from the soil of the earth.<br><br>Â“First the stalk,Â” the support structure, planted deep in the life-giving soil.

But even in its grandest state, it stands there, pristine, yet failing to serve its ultimate purpose. It is mature and can grow no moreÂ—Â“the crop is ready,Â” yet it does not live up to its goal. Finally, Â“the man sends forth the sickle.Â” Life gives birth to deathÂ—the crop is cut down in its prime, now able to finally fulfill its destiny.<br><br>We, like the farmerÂ’s seed, have been scattered on the groundÂ—but He is calling us today to sprout and grow. How, we wonÂ’t know. But by itself, the Spirit produces a crop. The Lord is calling us to lay down our lives, for the time is at hand when the head will be full of grain. And as soon as the crop is ready, He will come with his sickle. Let us yield ourselves, Â“because the harvest has come.Â”<br><br>P R A Y E R<br><br>Lord, God, grow me up to cut me downÂ—mature me to my fullest potential, then take me for yourself and use me for your purposes.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Discovery of Planet Earth<br><br>By Tzvi Freeman<br><br>I want to tell you about the greatest discovery of the millennium. It wasn't the printing press. It wasn't America. It wasn't even vaccination. The greatest discovery of the millennium happened near its very end.<br><br>It was the discovery of Planet Earth.<br><br>We were trying to get away from Planet Earth -- ever since we had to leave the garden. We built temples reaching to the heavens, to transcend our earthly bounds. Cities to lock out the earth's wildness, as though we were not a part of it. We told her she was a dark and lowly place, that we needed to escape her to reach our destiny. We ravaged her, raped her, paved her. Our dreams were dreams of overcoming Earth.<br><br>Until finally, in the ultimate of all dreams, we escaped her. We told her, "Earth, we don't need you anymore! After all, you are just one little planet in an awesome universe! We are going out there to conquer planets bigger and better than you. We shall become masters of the stars, of the galaxies!"<br><br>We got to the moon. The moon was barren. We sent probes to Mars. Mars was dead. To the icon of beauty, to Venus. She was dressed in poisonous, burning clouds. And then the pockets of American Congress were also barren to fund our useless dreams.<br><br>It was then that we looked back from outer space and discovered something we had never imagined. A shining jewel in the vast darkness. Never before had we known her beauty. The most beautiful planet a mind could dream of.<br><br>It was then that we realized everything our spirits ever wanted was here. That we need her and she needs us. Our destiny is hers and hers is ours. For we are one.<br><br>We discovered Planet Earth.<br><br>We need to save our Planet Earth. There was one other time she was in peril, and then there was only one man who could save her. Not that he was the only righteous man. There were others. There was Methuselah and his disciples.<br><br>But Noah was not just a spiritual man. He was, as the Torah says, "A man of the Earth." According to our tradition, Noah invented the plow.<br><br>So, G-d looked down at the world He had made and how its soul had been ripped out of it, and He saw these people who prayed and meditated and transcended the bounds of body and earth, and He said, "You people are not the solution. You are part of the problem. Only Noah, who knows to bond body and spirit, heaven and earth, he alone can save My world."<br><br>In our century, during the most horrible crimes of humanity, we have seen how spiritual people were quiet. The ravaging of humanity and of the earth has happened with their permission.<br><br>But now we have discovered Planet Earth. We have discovered spiritual fulfillment and G-dliness within her. And we know that if we cannot make peace with her and with each other, we will not survive much longer.<br><br></div>
