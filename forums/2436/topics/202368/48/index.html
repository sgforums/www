            <div class='col-md body'><strong>When Insecurity Turns Evil </strong><br>Romans 12:15<br>Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.<br><br>Saul was the King of Israel. David was in Saul's army and beginning to build a reputation as a great warrior. One day when David came back from a battle, the women danced and sang: " 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands' " (1 Sam. 18:7).<br><br>Saul was very angry; this refrain galled him. "They have credited David with tens of thousands," he thought, "but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?" (1 Samuel 18:8 )<br><br>This statement caused something to snap in King Saul. From this point on, Saul was never the leader God intended him to be. He allowed insecurity to drive his every decision. Insecurity leads to the need to control people and circumstances. The need to control leads to anger once we realize we are unable to control the circumstance. King Saul could not accept, much less rejoice, over David's success. David's life would never be the same, because Saul sought to kill David every chance he had. Saul had a choice; he could have seen David as an up-and-coming general in his army who could have become an important part of his team and made the kingdom of Israel even stronger. Instead, he looked at him as a threat.<br><br>When you hear good news about fellow workers or associates, do you rejoice with them? If you find yourself comparing your life's circumstances to others and don't feel you measure up, recognize that this is one of satan's greatest ploys to destroy you.<br><br>Christ has given you all things in Him. He has a unique plan for you that cannot be compared to another. He alone is your security. Trust in the purposes He has for your life. And remember, "My God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus" (Phil. 4:19 KJV).<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

Lyons bunted and raced down the first-base line. He knew it was going to be tight, so he dove at the bag. Safe! The TigerÂ’s pitcher disagreed. He and the umpire got into a shouting match, and Lyons stepped in to voice his opinion.<br><br>Absorbed in the game and the debate, Lyons felt dirt trickling down the inside of his pants. Without missing a beat he dropped his britches, wiped away the dirt, andÂ… uh ohÂ… twenty thousand jaws hit the bleachersÂ’ floor.<br><br>Within twenty-four hours of the Â“exposure,Â” he received more exposure than heÂ’d gotten his entire career: seven live television and approximately twenty radio interviews.<br><br>Fortunately, for Steve, he was wearing sliding pants under his baseball pants.<br><br>Now, I donÂ’t know Steve Lyons. IÂ’m not a White Sox fan. Nor am I normally appreciative of men who drop their pants in public. But I think Steve Lyons deserves a salute.<br><br>I think anybody who dives into first base deserves a salute. How many guys do you see roaring down the baseline of life more concerned about getting a job done than they are about saving their necks? How often do you see people diving headfirst into anything?<br><br>Too seldom, right? But when we do Â… when we see a gutsy human throwing caution to the wind and taking a few risks Â… ah, now thatÂ’s a person worthy of a pat on the Â… back.<br><br>So hereÂ’s to all the Steve Lyons of the world.<br><br>HereÂ’s to the Miracles, a choral group out of Memphis, Tennessee, made up of the mentally retarded and the stout-hearted. Just see if you can listen to them and still feel sorry for yourself.<br><br>HereÂ’s to the hero of the San Francisco marathon who crossed the finish line without seeing it. (He was blind.)<br><br>HereÂ’s to the woman whose husband left her with a nest of kids to raise and bills to pay, but who somehow tells me every Sunday that God has never been closer.<br><br>HereÂ’s to the single father of two girls who learned to braid their hair.<br><br>HereÂ’s to the grandparents who came out of retirement to raise the children their children couldnÂ’t raise.<br><br>HereÂ’s to the foster parents who took in a child long enough for that child to take their heartsÂ—then gave the child up again.<br><br>HereÂ’s to the girl, told by everyone to abort the baby, who chose to keep the baby.<br><br>HereÂ’s to the doctor who treats more than half of his patients for free.<br><br>HereÂ’s to the heroin-addict-turned-missionary.<br><br>HereÂ’s to the executive who every Tuesday hosts a 5:30 A.M. meeting for Bible study and prayer.<br><br>HereÂ’s to all of you reckless lovers of life and God, who stand on first base because you paid a price to get there.<br><br>So what if you forget about pleasing the crowd and get caught with your pants down?

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Oath of Office</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>The portion of Matos begins with the laws governing commitments and pledges. In Torah law, words are not taken lightly and when one makes an oath, the implications are exacting. The portion begins, "Moshe spoke to the Roshei HaMatos, the heads of the tribes, saying: This is the thing that Hashem commanded. If a man takes a vow to Hashem or swears to enact a prohibition upon himself, he shall not desecrate his word; whatever he said he shall do" (Numbers 30:2-3). The portion continues to discuss vows that one places upon himself, as well as vows that are between husbands and wives and fathers and daughters. The Torah continues to detail the complex laws of both the obligation and revocation of vows.<br><br>What is strikingly different in this portion is the way it was transmitted. Normally the Torah does not talk about the teaching of the law to the heads of the tribes. Back in Parshas Ki Sisa, the Torah tells us that Moshe would first teach Ahron, then Ahron's children, then the elders, and only then all of Israel (Exodus 34:31-32).<br><br>But the Torah hardly ever reiterates that point. Here, in Matos, Moshe emphasizes his directive to the heads of the tribes. Why? Wasn't the whole Torah given to them first? Why repeat that fact here? Rashi explains that Moshe meted honor to the elders and leaders because they play a vital role in the laws of vows. Unlike other judicial actions, the power of annulment of vows is done by individuals who are experts.<br><br>An expert can rule on vows and has the ability to decide which ones are valid, and which ones are senseless and inconsequential. He can evaluate vows that were made under duress and those invoked out of fear. He has the power to render them void. Therefore, unlike other commandments, Moshe specified the role of the leaders in reference to vows.<br><br>But perhaps there is another important significance to specifying the role of elders when talking about vows.<br><br>Rabbi Akiva Eiger was a world renowned Talmudic sage who wrote on almost every aspect of the Torah. However as the Rabbi of Pozen, which was part of the Austrio-Hungarian empire, his custom was to defer responding to questions that were sent from outside his country. After all, he felt that the stature of other rabbis would be diminished had all their congregants sent their questions to an out-of-town rabbi.<br><br>However, he once received a letter from Bialostock, Poland to which he did respond.<br><br>He began his response: "Although I am unworthy of answering questions from distant lands that are filled with great rabbis and Halachic scholars, and surely Poland is not lacking in either, his time I will answer." Then Rabbi Akiva Eiger added his reason.<br><br>"A few months back I was at a simcha (joyous occasion) at which someone from your town said that he would write me concerning a difficult matter. Though I did not encourage him to do so, I also did not discourage him. In fact, I may have even nodded my head slightly. That may have been taken as a commitment to answer the question. And If I even appeared to have consented, I surely do not want to appear as if I have reneged on a commitment."<br><br>The Torah transmits the laws of oaths through the heads of each tribe because it wants to reiterate to them the importance of a leader's adherence to commitment. The eyes of a nation are focused on their words, their promises, and their commitments. It is only fitting that those who bear the tremendous responsibility of assuring their tribes of their needs and requests, should be the very ones that transmit those laws.<br><br>Unfortunately, the words of contemporary leaders and elected officials don't mean much. Abba Eban once said, "It is our experience that political leaders do not always mean the opposite of what they say."<br><br>The Torah hands the responsibility of the burden of words upon those who are faced with the greatest challenge to meet their commitments. Torah leaders shall personify the commitment to, "all that will come out of his mouth he shall keep." It is no wonder that the Torah specifies the role of the tribal leaders when discussing the importance of commitment. For when the leaders keep their word, the nation follows in step.<br><br>Good Shabbos<br><br>Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Usual Suspects</strong><br><br>This weekÂ’s portion discusses an array of issues, among them entering and conquering of the land of Canaan, which was to occur shortly. The lands that the Israelites passed on their quest to conquer Canaan were inhabited by various tribes and nations: some of them Israel was allowed to conquer, while other lands were forbidden.<br><br>Even while nearing Canaan, there were nations the Israelites were warned not to provoke or attack.<br><br>Moshe tells the people, "Hashem said to me, 'You shall not distress Moab, and you shall not provoke war with them, for I shall not give you an inheritance from their land. For to the children of Lot have I given Ar as an inheritance. The Emim dwelled there previously, a great and populous people, and tall as the giants. They, too, were considered Rephaim, like the giants; and the Moabites called them Emim.'" (Deuteronomy 2:10-11).<br><br>There seems to be an important discussion about the land of the Giants.<br><br>Moshe refers to the Emim, who live in the land that was allocated to Avraham's nephew Lot. The verse seems to extend itself by explaining that the people living there are not Rephaim, rather they are Emim, who are often referred to as Rephaim, because they have Rephaim-like attributes.<br><br>However, Moshe explains to his people that those giants are not really Rephaim, rather they are actually Emim. Obviously, this whole identification process is a bit confusing. Rashi helps us understand the issue. "You might think that this is the land of the Rephaim which I gave (promised) to Abraham (Gen:15:20), because the Emim, who are Rephaim, dwelt there formerly (and they are one of the seven clans whose land you were to possess), but this is not that land, because those Rephaim I drove out from before the children of Lot and settled these in their stead" cf. Rashi on Deut. 3:13.<br><br>Rashi explains that though the land of the Rephaim was promised to Abraham, and as such should be rightfully inherited by the Jews, the land of Ar was not promised to Abraham. Ar was promised to Lot. If the Children of Israel expected to inherit Ar based on the fact that giants who were called Rephaim live there, Moshe corrects their misunderstanding. "You see," explain the commentaries, "these giants are really not the Rephaim variety of giants. They are the Emim variety. The original Rephaim were long gone and replaced. The Jews were promised the land of the Rephaim and not of Emim, who both resemble and are referred to as Rephaim."<br><br>Truth be told, all this seemingly irrelevant classification must have relevance to us students of the Torah. Why, otherwise, would the Torah spend so much time and verbiage on it? Why would it warn us not to confuse the Emim with Rephaim? It should just say, "Keep out of Ar, it goes to Lot!"<br><br>This story is true, I altered the details to spare the concerned.<br><br>Many years ago, during an extreme heat wave, a certain food manufacturer was cited by the Department of Health and the USDA for having an infestation of a particular species of a moth in its manufacturing facility.<br><br>Immediately, the board of directors sent its representatives to inspect the factory as well. After all, having insects in the plant were very bad for business. Not only could the government shut them down, they were a health hazard as well! A team of inspectors came to the plant to see how they should address the problem.<br><br>While going through the factory, a Vice-President popped the lid off a container of raw nuts. Like a tornado rising, a swarm of insects emerged from the bin. Shocked and dismayed, he called over one of the workers. "Do you see this?" he shouted. "Look at these flies!"<br><br>"Don't worry, sir," smiled the worker. "Those ain't the government flies. Those are the regular flies!"<br><br>Often we view adversaries in one fell swoop. An enemy is an enemy is an enemy. A giant is a giant is a giant.<br><br>Perhaps the Torah painstakingly teaches us that every nation has an accounting. Some the Israelites were allowed to inherit. Some they were allowed to attack. Others they were to avoid. Still others the Israelites were allowed to confront and not physically harm.<br><br>As Jews, we must be careful not confuse the Emim and the Rephaim, the Edomites with the Ammonites, or the Sichons, or the Ogs or even the icebergs with the Greenbergs. We may not want to see differences in a world that wants to see black and white. But the Torah teaches us this week that no two nations are exactly the same. And no matter how tall they may appear, no two giants are alike.<br><br>Rabbi M. Kamenetzky</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Paradise Lost</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>The Book of Deuteronomy is basically Moshe's final lecture to his nation. Sometimes softly, sometimes sternly, Moshe chides the nation about their behavior and misbehavior during their 40 years of wandering in the desert.<br><br>He does not merely repeat history. From each of his sentences, a lesson can be gleaned. Even his preface which identifies the arid ports-of-call, where the Jews stopped to rest, contains significant meaning.<br><br>But one of the most significant rebukes concerns the sin of the spies, who after a 40-day mission to Canaan returned with a report that scared the nation into unshakable despair.<br><br>Hashem's retribution turns each day spent spying into a year of wandering thus forty days, becomes a forty-year trek in the desert. But Moshe adds a footnote to the tragedy. A group of Jews regretted their actions and immediately declared, "we will go up and fight like Hashem has commanded. But Hashem said, "Do not arise and fight for I am not with you." The group did not listen. They attempted to conquer the land but the Emorites struck them down" (cf. Deuteronomy 1:41-45)<br><br>This episode is mentioned as part of the sin of the spies. But didn't this action show an unrelenting love for the Land of Israel. Weren't their self-sacrificing actions quite noble? Why weren't they successful? Why did Hashem turn away from them? Weren't their actions ones of repentance?<br><br>Rabbi Samson Rafael Hirsch explains that this act was a transitory one that propelled them from criminal cowardice to criminal conceit. But perhaps there is an additional message here.<br><br>Rabbi Joshua Fishman, Executive Vice President of Torah Umesorah, tells the following story: It was a Friday afternoon and the holy Mezhritzer Maggid had just immersed himself in the hot mikveh in honor of the Shabbos. As he left the bathhouse he drew toward a wonderful scent, an aroma filled with sincerity and devotion. He spotted a small hut and saw an elderly woman stirring a pot and then he realized what the wonderful scent was fried gribenes, chicken rinds.<br><br>Quietly he knocked on the door of the hut and spoke to the women. My dear woman, he began. There is something special in that pot, the aroma I smell comes from the sincerity of your stirring as well as the piety of the slaughterer. The joy of Shabbos is encompassed in those gribenes. So I ask you. Is it possible, that I too can partake in the delicacy that you are preparing for the Shabbos? Please, may I, too, have some of those gribenes?"<br><br>The woman stared directly into the Rebbe's eyes. "Holy Rabbi," she countered, "I am sorry. My husband waits for this delicacy the entire week. My grandchildren have come from a distant city and are expecting to have some gribenes, and" she added "we are having our son-in-law's brother for Shabbos. I am sorry but there are not enough gribenes left for you."<br><br>The Rebbe nodded solemnly and left.<br><br>A few moments later the woman realized what had occurred. "Am I a fool?" she thought. "The Holy Mezhritzer Maggid wanted to eat from my simple pot and I turned him away. Imagine, had the Rebbe partaken from my pot, blessings would bubble from it! Oh! How foolish of me to forego such an opportunity."<br><br>With that the woman raced from her hovel and chased after the Rebbe. Sighting the back of his caftan, she thrust the pot forward and began to shout, "Mezhritzer Maggid! Mezhritzer Maggid! Take the whole entire pot Please!"<br><br>Slowly the Rebbe turned around and shrugged his shoulders. "My dear woman," he sighed. "I would love to taste your gribenes, but I have lost my appetite."<br><br>The Ralbag, a 13th Century commentator, explains, that there are times that Hashem's grace is open to us and opportunity is at our door. It may be in the form of spiritual opportunity or physical and emotional ones as well. We must know that there is a time and a grace for everything,. Moshe reminded his flock, as he reminds us, that we must respond to opportunity when it knocks. The world does not wait for us to be ready. We have the ability to miraculously overcome great obstacles. But we must be ready to act at the moment that grace shines its light on a dark situation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Not To Worry, G-d's In Charge</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Shlomo Jarcaig<br>The book of Devarim is referred to by the Talmud as Mishneh Torah - a repetition of the Torah - a concept alluded to by its Greek name, Deuteronomy. This fifth and final book of the Torah is Moshe's recounting, prior to his death, of the events of the previous forty years. The significance of the repetition of these events is discovered in nuances between the wording describing the events here and the language used when they were previously recorded. These fine distinctions teach us valuable lessons about life.<br><br>After relating how the tribes of Reuven and Gad would inherit the portions of land that they had chosen on the eastern side of the Jordan River, Moshe reminded them of their responsibility to join the rest of the nation in crossing the Jordan and conquering the land of Israel. He charged them to stay with the other tribes "until G-d will give rest to your brothers as unto you, and they will also possess the land..."(3:20). This is somewhat different from what he said at the moment (Bamidbar/Numbers 32:22) when he told them that they only had to stay until they were finished conquering the land, but did not have to wait until everyone divided up their possessions and felt secure. Why did Moshe determine he must add this new obligation?<br><br>Malbim (1) explains that Moshe's initial decision was based on his understanding that the war they would fight would be "before G-d" (ibid 32:21). Moshe anticipated a miraculous victory, the likes of which would leave the rest of the Jews feeling no need for Reuven and Gad to stay with them since it would be clearly evident that G-d was the one who fought on their behalf. Ultimately, however, Moshe realized that the wars would not be so blatantly miraculous and Reuven and Gad would have to cross "before your brothers" (Devarim 3:18 ) and conquer the land in a more natural way. Thus, even after the land would be conquered the Jews would still feel insecure until they divided their inheritance and settled the land. With his reevaluation of the circumstances, Moshe reacted by appropriately refining the course of action.<br><br>Interestingly, the question was the academic one of determining the appropriate degree of human effort to expend relative to the miraculousness of the victory. Either way, they had been given a Divine guaranty that they would succeed and rested assured that if they simply fulfilled their due diligence and maintained their allegiance to and relationship with G-d, they would conquer the Holy Land and not suffer casualties.<br><br>While G-d's presence in our daily lives appears much more hidden than during the miraculous wars of conquest 3277 years ago, we, too, possess G-d given guaranties: He will give us all the financial sustenance we need; He will give us challenges to help us grow, but He will only give us challenges we can master; He will give us mitzvah situations to allow us ample opportunities to forge and foster our relationship with Him. The question is: How do we respond? Do we become agitated and aggravated because we still delude ourselves into believing that we truly control the outcome of life's situations (when we know that we cannot really control anything other than our own emotional responses to these situations)? Or do we progress through life, happy and serene in the knowledge that if we do our due, G-d will do all the rest?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Payment in Full</strong><br>After forty long years in the desert, the Jewish people stood poised to conquer the Holy Land. But there were complications. Two of their most formidable foes were untouchable. The Torah forbade the Jewish people to attack the nations of Ammon and Moav; they had to circle around to the north even though the direct path of invasion led through the lands of these two nations. The Torah did, however, allow the Jewish invaders to make threaten and intimidate Moav, as long as they stopped short of actual combat.<br><br>Why was this special protection granted to these two implacable foes of the Jewish people?<br><br>Our Sages find the answer in an incident that took place five centuries earlier. During a period of famine, the Jewish patriarch Abraham, his beautiful wife Sarah and his nephew Lot went to seek food in Egypt. The pharaoh at that time had a roving eye. Whenever a beautiful woman caught his fancy, he would kill her husband and take her into his harem. Sarah caught his fancy, which led him to focus on Abraham, who had escorted her to Egypt. Had he known Abraham was her husband, he would have killed him on the spot, but Abraham claimed he was her brother and was spared.<br><br>Lot was standing there when Abraham represented himself to the pharaoh as SarahÂ’s brother. If Lot had said one word or made one gesture to arouse the pharaohÂ’s suspicions, Abraham would have been doomed. But Lot remained silent, and the pharaoh accepted AbrahamÂ’s story. The Torah rewarded Lot by forbidding the Jewish people to attack LotÂ’s descendants, the nations of Ammon and Moav.<br><br>The question arises: Why does the Torah protect Ammon and Moav only from an actual assault? Why does the Torah permit threats and other intimidating actions Moav? True, the Torah does forbid the Jewish people to threaten and intimidate the nation of Ammon, but that is not a reward for LotÂ’s actions. It is a reward for his daughterÂ’s efforts to conceal the shameful paternity of her children (which is a subject for a different discussion). LotÂ’s reward for his silence was limited to a protection from assault against his descendants. Why was this so?<br><br>The commentators explain that the deficiencies in LotÂ’s reward were measure for measure for the deficiencies in his act of kindness. Lot was indeed silent when Abraham told the Egyptian pharaoh that he was SarahÂ’s brother. But he did not have the sensitivity and consideration to reassure Abraham that he could count on his silence. He could have told Abraham, Â“DonÂ’t worry. You can count on my silence. I wonÂ’t give your secret away.Â” But he did not. And so, AbrahamÂ’s heart must have been beating wildly throughout that tense confrontation with the pharaoh. Therefore, the Torah only protects LotÂ’s descendants from actual harm but not from threats and intimidation.<br><br>A rich man caught sight of a pauper sitting on a bench and decided to invite him for dinner. But first he had some business to discuss with an associate. A half-hour later, the business was settled. The rich man offered the pauper a gracious invitation and brought him to his house. He seated the pauper in a place of honor and wined and dined him like a king.<br><br>Afterwards, the pauper thanked the rich man and prepared to leave.<br><br>Â“Tell me, did I treat you kindly?Â” said the rich man.<br><br>Â“Oh, yes,Â” said the pauper.<br><br>Â“Could you have been any kinder to you than I was?Â”<br><br>The pauper fidgeted. Â“Do you want me to be honest?Â”<br><br>Â“Certainly,Â” said the rich man.<br><br>Â“Well, you could have invited me before you discussed business with your friend. For that half hour I was afraid that I might have to go to sleep hungry tonight.Â”<br><br>In our own lives, we need to pay close attention not only to what we do but also to how we do it. The full value and quality of a kind deed is determined by considering it in its full context. Indeed, sometimes the manner in which a kind deed is done is more important than the deed itself.<br><br>Rabbi Naftali Reich</div>

Early on, I learned to distinguish the difference between features and benefits. Features represent characteristics of a product or service. Benefits are those things that directly profit or benefit me by using the product or service. For instance, my new computer has incredible speed and lots of memory (feature). This allows me to do things more quickly and easily (benefit). People are more concerned about the benefits than the features.<br><br>God tells us in the above verse that there are some direct benefits to the features of His nature. He is a God who is committed to teaching His children in the way they should go. What is the real benefit of His teaching? He answers this in the next verse. "If only you had paid attention to My commands, your peace would have been like a river, your righteousness like the waves of the sea" (Is. 48:18 ).<br><br>The Lord tells us that the benefit of allowing God to teach us and lead us in the way is peace and righteousness. Here is a guaranteed promise from God. I often use guarantees in my advertising claims. Here is God's immutable guarantee: You will have peace like a river and righteousness like the waves of the sea! What a great promise!<br><br>Are you trusting God with the very details of your life so that He can lead you in the way you should go? Are you allowing Him to teach you? Seek the Lord today for what He wants to teach you and allow Him to lead you, and you will ensure peace and righteousness in your life.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Point Of Spiritual Honour</strong><br><br>"I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians."<br><br>Romans 1:14<br><br>Paul was overwhelmed with the sense of his indebtedness to Jesus Christ, and he spent himself to express it. The great inspiration in Paul's life was his view of Jesus Christ as his spiritual creditor. Do I feel that sense of indebtedness to Christ in regard to every unsaved soul? The spiritual honour of my life as a saint is to fulfil my debt to Christ in relation to them. Every bit of my life that is of value I owe to the Redemption of Jesus Christ; am I doing anything to enable Him to bring His Redemption into actual manifestation in other lives? I can only do it as the Spirit of God works in me this sense of indebtedness.<br><br>I am not to be a superior person amongst men, but a bondslave of the Lord Jesus. "Ye are not your own." Paul sold himself to Jesus Christ. He says - I am a debtor to everyone on the face of the earth because of the Gospel of Jesus; I am free to be an absolute slave only. That is the characteristic of the life when once this point of spiritual honour is realized. Quit praying about yourself and be spent for others as the bondslave of Jesus. That is the meaning of being made broken bread and poured out wine in reality.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Taken from 'My Utmost for His Highest', by Oswald Chambers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Flight to Freedom</strong><br>By Rabbi Pinchas Avruch<br><br>This week's portion is the first from the book of Devarim, or Deuteronomy. The dictionary definition of Deuteronomy is "fifth book of the [Bible], derived from the Greek words deuteros ("second" ) and nomos ("law" )...it is a repetition of previous laws with an urgent appeal to obey them." Before the Torah begins its review of the laws, it starts with Moshe's review of the history that brought the Jewish Nation to that point in history, their waning weeks in the wilderness. As they circumvented the lands of Mount Se'ir, the possessions of their cousins, the Children of Esav (Esau), G-d told them, "Enough of your circling this mountain; turn yourselves northward (in Hebrew: "tzafona" )...You shall not provoke [the children of Esav] for I shall not give you of their land - even the right to set foot - for as an inheritance to the Children of Esav I have given Mount Se'ir." (2:3,5)<br><br>Yalkut Shimoni (most comprehensive Midrashic anthology, covering the entirety of the Tanach (Bible); attributed to Rabbi Shimon HaDarshan of Frankfurt of the thirteenth century) conveys the Oral Tradition of a deeper message embedded within G-d's words to Moshe. "If you see that [the Children of Esav] want to provoke you, hide ("hatzpinu" ) yourselves from them. To where do you flee? To the Torah, for there is no protection other than Torah, as stated, 'He has secured ("yitzpohn" ) the eternal Torah for the upright' (Mishlei/Proverbs 2:7)"<br><br>Ramban (Nachmanides, Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman; 1135-1204; native of Gerona, Spain, he was one the leading scholars of the Middle Ages and successfully defended Judaism at the famed debate in Barcelona in 1263) expounds that the confrontations our forefather Yaakov (Jacob) had with Esav are the model for the destiny of the Children of Israel in our continuing conflict with our cousins, as the generations of the Jewish People will continually experience history repeating itself. Therefore, we must take hold of and follow the lesson of our righteous forebear and prepare ourselves with the same three tools he utilized: prayer for success, gifts of appeasement and preparations for war and escape.<br><br>Chofetz Chaim (Rabbi Yisrael Meir HaKohen Kagan of Radin; 1838-1933; author of basic works in Jewish law, philosophy and ethics and renowned for his saintly qualities) notes that Ramban's guidance of 750 years ago is no less relevant today in our confrontation with our oppressors. Throughout Jewish history, our utilization of the armaments of our forefather - prayer and faith with a non-aggressive defensive posture - has led to our survival through millennia of persecution. Yet when we embraced the strategies of our enemies - reliance on the sword with conquest defining success - and abandoned the successful formula of our forefathers, we have met with misery and great hardship. Rabbi Kagan closes with a simple prayer: May G-d have mercy on us and restore our Judges to their former positions (i.e. bring the Messiah speedily, thus restoring the religious institutions of old which inspired the masses to maintain their dedication to the Divine path).<br><br>One of the great miracles of Jewish history is that no nation has ever survived as an identifiable group after close to 2000 years of exile, dispersion and persecution. But the actualization of this impossibility should not surprise us. Just as the Torah warns us of exile and persecution as the consequence of our misdeeds - commemorated with this coming week's Tisha B'Av observance of the anniversary of the destruction of our Holy Temples in Jerusalem and most of the great tragedies that have befallen our people - the Torah comforts us that G-d will never forsake us. And to arouse the Divine mercy that will end this misery, the Torah offers further instruction: renew our faith in G-d and flee to the Torah.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Speaking Louder</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>Moshe is saying his last good-byes to his beloved nation. He stands at Israel's border and reviews forty years of trials and tribulations, the good times and the bad, and how his nation Israel matured to become the inheritor of the Promised Land. The first verse in this week's portion alludes to the ensuing topics of discussion. The Golden Calf, the incident with the spies, and the time when Israel faltered at the idol Ba'al Pe'or are amongst the many issues that are re-examined.<br><br>But the Torah defines Moshe's rebuke by confining it to a specific time frame. The Torah tells us that only "after smiting Sichon, king of the Amorites, and (the giant) Og, king of Bashan, did Moshe begin explaining this Torah (rebuke) to them." (Deuteronomy 1:4)<br><br>The fact that the Torah makes a point of stating that the reproofs occurred only after Moshe smote two powerful enemies has obvious connotations. Rashi explains: "if the Jews were to say, 'what has Moshe done for us? Has he brought us into the Land? How does he have the right to rebuke us?' Moshe thus waited until the defeat of the last two major enemies before rebuking the nation."<br><br>Perhaps Moshe wanted to tell us a bit more.<br><br>Reb Mendel Kaplan (1913-1985) was a Rebbe at the Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia from 1965 until he passed away. In the later years, he would conduct an early morning class with a select group of students. He would study with them Daas Chachma U'Mussar, the magnum opus of his Rebbe, Rabbi Yeruchum Levovitz, the Mashgiach of the Mirrer Yeshiva of Europe and later Shanghai. Each day the group would meet before Shacharis (morning prayers) and listen to their elderly Rebbe discuss deep philosophical issues concerning the nature of man and the profound eternal struggle he faces.<br><br>One night a heavy snow covered the streets of Philadelphia. As the boys trudged into the classroom they were dazzled by the view of the dawn breaking over the white blanket that softly covered the frozen ground. But an even more amazing sight beheld then inside the classroom. Rav Mendel was at sitting at his desk wearing his boots, gloves, and an overcoat that was as warm as his expression. "Today we will learn the real Mussar (ethics)," he smiled. "Don't take off your boots and coats." He closed the large tome on his desk and pointed to six shovels neatly stacked in the corner of the classroom.<br><br>With that, he took a shovel, walked outside, and began to lead the boys in shoveling a path from the dormitories to the Bais Medrash where the entire school would soon conduct their morning prayers.<br><br>Moshe knew that for forty years he had admonished his nation on issues of faith, trust in Hashem, and belief in the prophets. He had put his honor on the line, as he constantly defended their misdeeds. He prayed for them as they battled with Amalek and prayed for them when G-d's wrath was upon them. But he had yet to do physical battle.<br><br>The call came. Moshe had to fight the most notorious and powerful rulers of the region, Sichon and Og. They were stronger and bigger and surely more aggressive than he was. His faith was on the line. He had to teach real Mussar. Only after conquering those two foes, showing his people that he too can get down in the trenches, did he begin to admonish the nation for forty years of various improprieties.<br><br>Sometimes, if you'd like your friend to become as pure as snow, you can't just talk about it. You have to shovel it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fear Itself</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>Family Feuds. They happen in the best of families though blood somehow is thicker than water. But, obviously, blood is not the sole criteria to hold back the sword. Yaakov's brother Esav is the father of Edom and grandfather of Amalek. And there is no love lost between our two nations.<br><br>Yet the Torah tells us about two families - cousins, albeit very distant - against whom we may not wage war. Moshe tells the Children of Israel that Hashem told him "you may not provoke war with Moav for to the children of Lot I have given Ar as an inheritance" (Deuteronomy 2:9). The Moavites were descendants of Lot, Avraham's cousin. Their forebear, Moav, was fathered through an incestuous union of Lot and his daughter - who named him, unabashedly, Mo Av, from my father.<br><br>Rashi points out that even though the Jews were forbidden to wage war with Moav, they were, however, permitted to antagonize and provoke them. That's why Moav hired the evil Bilaam, prophet, to curse the Jews. They were afraid of them.<br><br>The descendants of Ammon, on the other hand, fared better. Though he, too, was born incestuously, the name Ammon hides that shameful act. In the merit of their mother's modesty, the Jews were not permitted to antagonize the nation of Ammon.<br><br>Lot's children were, however, treated better than any other folk. There is no warning not to taunt or attack the children of Ishmael Avraham's own son. The Midrash explains that it is not Lot's blood-relation to Avraham that sheaved our sword, it is our gratitude. Fearing certain death, when he went down to Egypt with his wife Sora, Avraham claimed that Sora was his sister. Otherwise, the Egyptians would have killed the husband of this beautiful woman and sent her to Pharoah's harem. Lot was with Avraham and Sora on that journey and could have divulged the truth. He did not. Lot went along with the ploy and did not give Avraham and his wife up. His children were rewarded: the Jews could not wage war on them.<br><br>But that merit doesn't stand on its own. It seems that Lot's discretion at the Egyptian border was enough to stop the Jews from waging all out war against his descendants. Yet, instilling fear was not ruled out. Why?<br><br>When Napoleon was fleeing the Russian Army after his defeat in 1813, he escaped into the home of a peasant. "Please hide me," he cried. "When I return to my throne in Paris I will reward you greatly!"<br><br>The farmer hid the emperor under a bed, covering him with some old rags. Moments later, Russian soldiers burst into the tiny home looking for their prey.<br><br>The Russians ransacked the home and prodded the bed with sticks and swords. Napoleon was unharmed. When they left, Napoleon crawled out from under his hiding place and reiterated his pledge. "When I get to Paris, I will call for you. I promise you anything you wish!"<br><br>Months later the farmer was summoned to the palace where he was allowed an audience with Napoleon. After conferring gold and silver upon the pauper the Emperor asked the question. "Ask me anything you want, I will respond in kind."<br><br>"The man looked down at his feet and smiled. "Oh Emperor, I really don't want much. Just one small thing." Napoleon's eyes widened. "And what is that?" "The farmer gathered his courage. "How did you feel when they were poking their swords through the bed?"<br><br>Napoleon flew into a rage. "Is this what you came to request? Is this the way you treat the emperor of France? Arrest this man," he shouted to the guards. "I want him shot."<br><br>The man turned white as they led him to the wall of the outer courtyard. Napoleon accompanied them and declared that he would count to three and the firing squad would do its duty.<br><br>The man was bound, gagged, and blindfolded, and placed in front of the firing squad.<br><br>"One!" shouted the Emperor. The soldiers aimed their rifles. "Two," screamed the Emperor. The soldiers cocked their triggers.<br><br>Suddenly, Napoleon held up his hand. He motioned to the soldiers to lower their arms. He walked over to the innocent man waiting to be executed and removed the blindfold. Then he put his arm around the man's shoulder and whispered in his ear, "That is how I felt!"<br><br>Lot's descendants were spared war with Jews because Lot did not hand Avraham over to be killed. But he never alleviated Avraham's fears while travelling to Egypt. And that fear pierced the heart of Avraham during the entire journey. Kindness must be done with graciousness. And if Lot was supportive of Abraham, he should have been a true, unwavering comrade. His merit should have been for strong loyalty and not for his last second decision not to hand Avraham over to Egyptian authorities. He may have spared Avraham sure death, but he did not spare him fear of it. So his descendants the Moavites, albeit spared from war are reminded that though it may meritorious to spare one from the spear, it is even better to spare one from its fear!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>God's Double-Talk</strong><br>Exodus 4:21<br>The Lord said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go."<br><br>Have you ever had a boss tell you to do something only to have him sabotage your ability to complete the task? Nothing is more frustrating than to begin to carry out a task and have your superior thwart your effort to do what he asked you to do.<br><br>Moses must have felt this way after God told him to go to Pharaoh and tell him to release the people of Israel. He said, "I am going to give you the power to release the children of Israel by the miracles I will do through you." Yet at the same time, He told Moses they would not be released because He was going to put a hard heart in Pharaoh. How do we reconcile this?<br><br>In my own life, I knew God called me to certain endeavors. Yet every time I turned around, a roadblock stood in my way. It took years of plodding along before the light came on as to why there was such a distance between what God called me to do and the manifestation of that calling. When David was anointed king of Israel, it was years before he realized the manifestation of that calling. There were a number of reasons for these delays.<br><br>In the case of Moses and Israel, God wanted to demonstrate His power in such a way that generations would be able to hear the story of their deliverance from their ancestors. God wanted greater glory from the situation. God also wanted to deal with Egypt by sending specific plagues. Finally, the very process built character in Moses and tested Moses to see if he would stay the course.<br><br>There is a time for everything. If God has called you to some endeavor and you are frustrated that it has not manifested, know that times of preparation and simmering are required before the vision can be achieved. Seldom does God call and manifest something at the same time. There is preparation. There is testing. There is relationship building between you and God that must take place. Once this is complete, you will see the vision materialize.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>David's Armor </strong><br>1 Samuel 17:39<br>David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul, "because I am not used to them." So he took them off.<br><br>David, the young shepherd boy, heard the challenge from the Philistines to send someone to fight Goliath. No one volunteered to fight except David. King Saul reluctantly agreed and offered David his armor. David put on the weighty equipment, but quickly concluded he could not fight in this heavy armor.<br><br>God equips each of us in such a way that is unique to our strengths and abilities. David was trained as a shepherd to use another weapon. For David, it was a slingshot. David showed great maturity in realizing he could not be effective with Saul's armor.<br><br>What are the gifts and talents God has given to you? Have you ever tried to accomplish a task with tools you were not trained to use? God allows each of us to develop skills that are unique to our life. He will not call you to use someone else's tools.<br><br>However, this is only half of the equation. These talents must be mixed with faith. Talent alone is not enough. Faith alone is not enough. It is only when the two are combined that God's power is released and manifested in the physical realm.<br><br>Mix your unique gifts with faith today; you will be surprised at the power of God that will be manifested.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Moving toward maturity</strong><br><br>"Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts." (v. 23)<br><br>For reading &amp; meditation:<br>Psalm 139:1-24<br><br>We continue meditating on the right way to handle our negative feelings. We said yesterday that the two wrong ways to handle hurting emotions are to deny them or express them. Denial pushes them down inside us, while expression dumps them on to other people or things. Neither of these, in my view, is a Biblical way of dealing with negative emotions. In fact, recent research by some psychologists shows that the uncontrolled expression of negative feelings can compound, rather than clear up, one's emotional difficulties. In my judgement, the correct and Biblical way to handle negative emotions is to acknowledge them fully before God and share with Him how we feel. Now understand clearly what I am saying, for at this point many have responded to this advice by coming to God when they are hurt or sorrowful and saying: "Lord, please forgive me for feeling hurt." That misses the point entirely. A Christian psychologist puts the issue most effectively when he says: "We are not to pretend that we feel penitent when we feel hurt." When our stomachs are churning with grief, sorrow or hurt, we must come before the One who sees and knows everything, and pray a prayer something like this: "Lord, right now I am hurting more than I think I can endure. I feel like screaming, running away or hitting somebody. I don't want to feel like this, dear Lord - but I do. Thank You for loving me as I am. Help me now to handle my feelings in a way that glorifies You and honours Your Name." When we pray a prayer like that - and mean it - we are on the way to maturity.<br><br>O Father, help me not just to receive this concept into my mind and do nothing about it, but enable me to put it to work in my daily Christian living. I ask this for the honour and glory of Your peerless and precious Name. Amen.<br><br>inspirational devotions by Selwyn Hughes.<br><br></div>
