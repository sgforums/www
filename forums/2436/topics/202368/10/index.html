He wanted<br>covenant with His people, Israel, so He dreamed a literal land for them.<br>The Jewish people's hope of their homeland was lying in waiting for the<br>Lord's timing Â… but the delay was only two thousand years!<br><br>His timetable is not like ours! Forty years is not a long time in God's<br>mind, but it is in our lifetime! We have a microwave theology so 40<br>minutes is a long time. We want it hot in 30 seconds!

Training for reigning is a prophetic journey, a<br>dramatic saga that lasts a lifetime! It is the legacy for future<br>generations with end-time scenarios.<br><br>In World War II, over 6 million Jews were exterminated. By 1942, the<br>Nazi leadership decided to implement the "Final Solution", the genocide<br>of all Jews in Europe, and increase the pace of the Holocaust. The Nazis<br>specifically built six extermination camps to kill Jews.<br><br>Millions of Jews who had been confined to massively overcrowded ghettos<br>were transported to "Death Camps", in which they were either killed upon<br>arrival or put to work until the Nazis could find no more use for them,<br>at which point they were shot or put in mass gas chambers.<br><br>ISRAEL BECOMES A NATION<br><br>It is a modern-day miracle that Israel Â– against all odds Â– became a<br>nation in 1948. They never gave up their destiny. The impossible dream<br>came true! God had a different timetable than mankind, but He never<br>forgot the legacy of His people!<br><br>The enemy thought he was winning by destroying the seed of the Covenant<br>but there is a mystery to this ancient key of suffering. It brought<br>divine reversal and birthed a nation.<br><br>In 1972, the Summer Games were held in Munich, West Germany, and 11<br>members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by Palestinian<br>terrorists. The attempt to free them led to the deaths of the nine<br>abducted athletes, which was called the "Munich Massacre".<br><br>General Shimon Erem, President of the Israel Christian nexus, shared a<br>heart-rending story about the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.

            <div class='col-md body'>THE END TIME REVIVAL<br><br>Shabbat Shalom dearly beloved and a Happy Sukkot!<br><br>Â“On that day I will raise up The tabernacle of David, which has fallen down, And repair its damages; I will raise up its ruins, And rebuild it as in the days of old; That they may possess the remnant of Edom, And all the Gentiles who are called by My name,Â”  Says Yahveh who does this thing. Amos 9:11-12<br><br>The End Time Revival can be summed up in these words:<br><br>THE RESTORATION OF THE SUKKA OF DAVID<br><br>Sukka is the word for booth, tent or tabernacle<br><br>All the strategy needed to release the End Time Revival and Harvest is summed up in these two verses. Let us highlight the major points,<br><br>I WILL raise it up- Yahveh will do it<br>The Sukka of David is what is being raised up (The place where The Ark rested!)<br>It is in disrepair (fallen down)<br>A work of rebuilding is needed<br>According to the Â“Old waysÂ” or the Ancient Foundations<br>The remnant of Edom (from the word Adam or man) will come in. (These are BOTH Jews and  like Ruth the Moabite, non Israelite Gentiles)<br>Gentiles that are called by YahvehÂ’s Name will come in (Jews or Israelites that mixed with the nations and lost their identity like the 10 tribes and the Sephardic Jews due to the Spanish Inquisition)<br>Â“Behold, the days are coming,Â” says Yahveh, Â“When the plowman shall overtake the reaper, And the treader of grapes him who sows seed; The mountains shall drip with sweet wine, And all the hills shall flow with it. Amos 9:13<br><br>The outcome of this amazing restoration will be an abundance of harvest and an outpouring of GodÂ’s goodness!<br><br>I will bring back the captives of My people Israel; They shall build the waste cities and inhabit them; They shall plant vineyards and drink wine from them; They shall also make gardens and eat fruit from them. I will plant them in their land, And no longer shall they be pulled up From the land I have given them,Â” Says Yahveh your God. Amos 9:14-15<br><br>This will also cause the restoration of Israel to be fulfilled BOTH to the Covenant Land and to the God of the Covenant<br><br>The KEY for these amazing happenings is in these following words,<br><br>Â“As in the days of OLD!Â”<br><br>In other words the strategy is the restoration of the age old foundations! That is the restoration of Torah!<br><br>Thus says Yahveh: Â“Stand in the ways and see, And ask for the old paths, where the good way is, And walk in it; Then you will find rest for your souls. But they said, Â‘We will not walk in it.Â’ Jeremiah 6:16<br><br>CONTINUED...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you look back to the ancient paths, you will find REST that is SHABBAT!<br><br>Until now most interpretations of the restoration of the Sukka of David have been incomplete because of Replacement Theology! For most people this restoration means to praise, dance and worship more because David was known as the worshipper of Israel. However this is a very incomplete interpretation and it is already costing us much! If it would only be about more praise and worship then what happened in 2 Samuel 6 would have not happened!<br><br>And when they came to NachonÂ’s threshing floor, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled. Then the anger of Yahveh was aroused against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his error; and he died there by the ark of God. And David became angry because of YahvehÂ‘s outbreak against Uzzah; and he called the name of the place Perez Uzzah to this day.  2 Samuel 6:6-8<br><br>David was bringing The Ark back in order to put it in his Sukka that he had prepared in Jerusalem. He had everything ready, the musicians, the dancers and all the Levites. He just needed The Ark, The Presence. He knew that without the Presence of YAH his efforts would be in vain, so he invested lots of money in a tremendous campaign to bring back the Ark!<br><br>Again David gathered all the choice men of Israel, thirty thousand. And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the Name, Yahveh of Hosts, who dwells between the cherubim. So they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart. And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, accompanying the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark.  Then David and all the house of Israel played music before Yahveh on all kinds of instruments of fir wood, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on sistrums, and on cymbals. 2 Samuel 6:1-5<br><br>This Revival Campaign was well organized, well attended and there was PLENTY of Praise and Worship! Nevertheless it was a FAILURE! YAH was angry with David! Why? Was not King David GENUINE in his efforts? Did he not try his best? How come that Yahveh instead of being grateful, He was ANGRY? What made Him angry? Is there something for us to learn TODAY?<br><br>David was genuine and he did his best but he did not follow GodÂ’s PRESCRIBED way of handling The Ark. He did not look to the Ancient Paths, he did not look to the Torah (Five Books of Moses) to give him the instructions that he needed. He did it according to his INTERPRETATION and not according to PRESCRIPTION!<br><br>This is what is happening today, we are reliving the experience of David. There are campaigns, smoke coming out of the machines, there ar e great bands and worship teams, most of the campaigns are well attended and yet no one is noticing that YAHÂ’s Presence is UNCOMFORTABLE!!! He wants to fall off the back of the flesh! He wants to STOP everything!<br><br>You see? It is not about MORE praise or worship and it is not about more GENUINENESS and Zeal, it is about  the Ancient Paths, Â“as in the days of oldÂ” is missing, the BLUEPRINT IS MISSING! And that blueprint is the Torah! This is called HOLINESS!<br><br>That is why in Malachi 4 we are admonished to REMEMBER the Law of Moses,<br><br>Â“Remember the Law of Moses, My servant, Which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, With the statutes and judgments.Â”  Malachi 4:4<br><br>Then the outpouring of the spirit of Elijah and the most amazing reconciliation of all times; the fathers to the sons and the sons to the fathers, will happen. The Jews to the Christians and the Christians to the Jews; and THEN the BLESSING will be inevitable!<br><br>CONTINUED...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finally after this FORCED STOP, King DavidÂ’s anger subsided, he sought Yahveh and he REPENTED! He looked for the, ancient paths and followed YAHÂ’ instructions!<br><br>Now it was told King David, saying, Â“Yahveh has blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.Â” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with gladness. And so it was, when those bearing the ark of Yahveh had gone six paces, that he sacrificed oxen and fatted sheep. Then David danced before Yahveh with all his might; and David was wearing a linen ephod. So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahveh with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet. 2 Samuel 6:12-15<br><br>Let us see what King David changed when he organized the 2nd campaign of bringing back The Ark:<br><br>The Ark was brought on the shoulders of Prepared and Sanctified Levites (no oxen this time!)<br>The Shabbat Principle was observed: Six paces and on the Seventh a Sacrifice!<br>David wore a linen ephod. (This represents holiness, righteousness, obedience to YahÂ’s Commandments and intimacy)<br>All the rest was the same as before, the gladness and the exuberant praise and worship!<br><br>The difference was in the HOLINESS and the OBEDIENCE TO YAHÂ’S COMMANDMENTS!<br><br>My dear friends, The Ark is about to fall and some Uzzas are about to die! It is time to REPENT and rebuild the Sukka of David as in the Days of Old with no traces of Replacement Theology, lawlessness and the mixture of pagan worship. It is time to restore the ancient foundations of holiness, righteousness and obedience and then the End Time Revival will come and the Presence of YAH that accomplishes marvelous feats will be restored!<br><br>The MAP R evolution Movement is all about the restoration of Sukkat David according to the Ancient Paths in an ultra modern way and without Â“religiosityÂ”!

            <div class='col-md body'>King David saw his relationship with G-d as a shepherd to his sheep. David was able to develop a meaningful trust in G-d, because he was aware of G-dÂ’s care and sensitivity for him. David realized that, just like the shepherd, G-d felt what he felt, wanted what was best for him, and was personally involved with him. Thus, because "G-d is my shepherd - I shall lack nothing."<br><br>However, David was aware, that G-d wanted what was ultimately best for him, and just like a straying sheep, the person is sometimes unaware of what is best for himself. David knew that his spiritual development was ultimately his greatest achievement, and anything that G-d bestowed upon him incorporated this philosophy. Whether good or bad, it was to bring out the best in him. Now, the shepherd generally carries with him a staff to guide his flock, and a rod which he uses, when necessary, to hit the sheep which are in danger of straying into dangerous territories. David compared the adversities which came upon him - being chased by Saul, in particular - to the rod, which brought him to a greater level of spirituality. Although a complete picture was not clear to him at the time, he knew that this was solely beneficial to him. Thus, he proclaimed, "Your rod and Your staff are a comfort to me". With the proper outlook, even the adversities which befell him were comforting.<br><br>Finally, David was brought forth from his misfortunes, and was coronated as king. Indeed, David showed gratitude towards G-d for his kingship, as he said "...you anointed my head with oil...", referring to his anointment as king. However, as we explained in the last segment, he still acknowledged his desire to remain in solitude with Him, as he did in the past. Although kingship brought him much wealth and glory, he still wished to retain his personal relationship with G-d, as he did during his days as a shepherd. Thus, he concludes, "Although only good and kindness pursue me all the rest of my days..." nevertheless, "I shall dwell in the House of G-d for long days".<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Individual Discouragement and Personal Growth<br><br>. . . when Moses was grown . . . he went out to his brethren and looked at their burdens Â—Exodus 2:11<br><br>Moses saw the oppression of his people and felt certain that he was the one to deliver them, and in the righteous indignation of his own spirit he started to right their wrongs. After he launched his first strike for God and for what was right, God allowed Moses to be driven into empty discouragement, sending him into the desert to feed sheep for forty years. At the end of that time, God appeared to Moses and said to him, " Â’. . . bring My people . . . out of Egypt.Â’ But Moses said to God, Â’Who am I that I should go . . . ?Â’ " ( Exodus 3:10-11  ). In the beginning Moses had realized that he was the one to deliver the people, but he had to be trained and disciplined by God first. He was right in his individual perspective, but he was not the person for the work until he had learned true fellowship and oneness with God.<br><br>We may have the vision of God and a very clear understanding of what God wants, and yet when we start to do it, there comes to us something equivalent to MosesÂ’ forty years in the wilderness. ItÂ’s as if God had ignored the entire thing, and when we are thoroughly discouraged, God comes back and revives His call to us. And then we begin to tremble and say, "Who am I that I should go . . . ?" We must learn that GodÂ’s great stride is summed up in these wordsÂ— "I AM WHO I AM . . . has sent me to you" ( Exodus 3:14 ). We must also learn that our individual effort for God shows nothing but disrespect for HimÂ— our individuality is to be rendered radiant through a personal relationship with God, so that He may be "well pleased" ( Matthew 3:17  ). We are focused on the right individual perspective of things; we have the vision and can say, "I know this is what God wants me to do." But we have not yet learned to get into GodÂ’s stride. If you are going through a time of discouragement, there is a time of great personal growth ahead.<br><br>-- Oswald Chambers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Getting into GodÂ’s Stride<br><br>Enoch walked with God . . . Â—Genesis 5:24<br><br>The true test of a personÂ’s spiritual life and character is not what he does in the extraordinary moments of life, but what he does during the ordinary times when there is nothing tremendous or exciting happening. A personÂ’s worth is revealed in his attitude toward the ordinary things of life when he is not under the spotlight (seeJohn 1:35-37 and John 3:30 ). It is painful work to get in step with God and to keep pace with HimÂ— it means getting your second wind spiritually. In learning to walk with God, there is always the difficulty of getting into His stride, but once we have done so, the only characteristic that exhibits itself is the very life of God Himself. The individual person is merged into a personal oneness with God, and GodÂ’s stride and His power alone are exhibited.<br><br>It is difficult to get into stride with God, because as soon as we start walking with Him we find that His pace has surpassed us before we have even taken three steps. He has different ways of doing things, and we have to be trained and disciplined in His ways. It was said of JesusÂ— "He will not fail nor be discouraged . . ." (Isaiah 42:4 ) because He never worked from His own individual standpoint, but always worked from the standpoint of His Father. And we must learn to do the same. Spiritual truth is learned through the atmosphere that surrounds us, not through intellectual reasoning. It is GodÂ’s Spirit that changes the atmosphere of our way of looking at things, and then things begin to be possible which before were impossible. Getting into GodÂ’s stride means nothing less than oneness with Him. It takes a long time to get there, but keep at it. DonÂ’t give up because the pain is intense right nowÂ— get on with it, and before long you will find that you have a new vision and a new purpose.<br><br>-- Oswald Chambers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How Will I Know?<br><br>Jesus answered and said, Â’I thank You, Father . . . that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babesÂ’ Â—Matthew 11:25<br><br>About this cover<br>We do not grow into a spiritual relationship step by stepÂ— we either have a relationship or we do not. God does not continue to cleanse us more and more from sinÂ— "But if we walk in the light," we are cleansed "from all sin" ( 1 John 1:7  ). It is a matter of obedience, and once we obey, the relationship is instantly perfected. But if we turn away from obedience for even one second, darkness and death are immediately at work again.<br><br>All of GodÂ’s revealed truths are sealed until they are opened to us through obedience. You will never open them through philosophy or thinking. But once you obey, a flash of light comes immediately. Let GodÂ’s truth work into you by immersing yourself in it, not by worrying into it. The only way you can get to know the truth of God is to stop trying to find out and by being born again. If you obey God in the first thing He shows you, then He instantly opens up the next truth to you. You could read volumes on the work of the Holy Spirit, when five minutes of total, uncompromising obedience would make things as clear as sunlight. DonÂ’t say, "I suppose I will understand these things someday!" You can understand them now. And it is not study that brings understanding to you, but obedience. Even the smallest bit of obedience opens heaven, and the deepest truths of God immediately become yours. Yet God will never reveal more truth about Himself to you, until you have obeyed what you know already. Beware of becoming one of the "wise and prudent." "If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know . . ." (John 7:17 ).<br><br>-- Oswald Chambers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GodÂ’s SilenceÂ— Then What?<br><br>When He heard that he was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was Â—John 11:6<br><br>About this cover<br>Has God trusted you with His silenceÂ— a silence that has great meaning? GodÂ’s silences are actually His answers. Just think of those days of absolute silence in the home at Bethany! Is there anything comparable to those days in your life? Can God trust you like that, or are you still asking Him for a visible answer? God will give you the very blessings you ask if you refuse to go any further without them, but His silence is the sign that He is bringing you into an even more wonderful understanding of Himself. Are you mourning before God because you have not had an audible response? When you cannot hear God, you will find that He has trusted you in the most intimate way possibleÂ— with absolute silence, not a silence of despair, but one of pleasure, because He saw that you could withstand an even bigger revelation. If God has given you a silence, then praise HimÂ— He is bringing you into the mainstream of His purposes. The actual evidence of the answer in time is simply a matter of GodÂ’s sovereignty. Time is nothing to God. For a while you may have said, "I asked God to give me bread, but He gave me a stone instead" (see Matthew 7:9 ). He did not give you a stone, and today you find that He gave you the "bread of life" ( John 6:35 ).<br><br>A wonderful thing about GodÂ’s silence is that His stillness is contagiousÂ— it gets into you, causing you to become perfectly confident so that you can honestly say, "I know that God has heard me." His silence is the very proof that He has. As long as you have the idea that God will always bless you in answer to prayer, He will do it, but He will never give you the grace of His silence. If Jesus Christ is bringing you into the understanding that prayer is for the glorifying of His Father, then He will give you the first sign of His intimacyÂ— silence.<br><br>-- Oswald Chambers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Spontaneous Love<br><br>Love suffers long and is kind . . . Â—1 Corinthians 13:4<br><br>About this cover<br>Love is not premeditatedÂ— it is spontaneous; that is, it bursts forth in extraordinary ways. There is nothing of precise certainty in PaulÂ’s description of love. We cannot predetermine our thoughts and actions by saying, "Now I will never think any evil thoughts, and I will believe everything that Jesus would have me to believe." No, the characteristic of love is spontaneity. We donÂ’t deliberately set the statements of Jesus before us as our standard, but when His Spirit is having His way with us, we live according to His standard without even realizing it. And when we look back, we are amazed at how unconcerned we have been over our emotions, which is the very evidence that real spontaneous love was there. The nature of everything involved in the life of God in us is only discerned when we have been through it and it is in our past.<br><br>The fountains from which love flows are in God, not in us. It is absurd to think that the love of God is naturally in our hearts, as a result of our own nature. His love is there only because it "has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit . . ." ( Romans 5:5 ).<br><br>If we try to prove to God how much we love Him, it is a sure sign that we really donÂ’t love Him. The evidence of our love for Him is the absolute spontaneity of our love, which flows naturally from His nature within us. And when we look back, we will not be able to determine why we did certain things, but we can know that we did them according to the spontaneous nature of His love in us. The life of God exhibits itself in this spontaneous way because the fountains of His love are in the Holy Spirit.<br><br>-- Oswald Chambers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do It Now!<br><br>Agree with your adversary quickly . . . Â—Matthew 5:25<br><br>About this cover<br>In this verse, Jesus Christ laid down a very important principle by saying, "Do what you know you must doÂ— now. Do it quickly. If you donÂ’t, an inevitable process will begin to work Â’till you have paid the last pennyÂ’ ( Matthew 5:26  ) in pain, agony, and distress." GodÂ’s laws are unchangeable and there is no escape from them. The teachings of Jesus always penetrate right to the heart of our being.<br><br>Wanting to make sure that my adversary gives me all my rights is a natural thing. But Jesus says that it is a matter of inescapable and eternal importance to me that I pay my adversary what I owe him. From our LordÂ’s standpoint it doesnÂ’t matter whether I am cheated or not, but what does matter is that I donÂ’t cheat someone else. Am I insisting on having my own rights, or am I paying what I owe from Jesus ChristÂ’s standpoint?<br><br>Do it quicklyÂ— bring yourself to judgment now. In moral and spiritual matters, you must act immediately. If you donÂ’t, the inevitable, relentless process will begin to work. God is determined to have His child as pure, clean, and white as driven snow, and as long as there is disobedience in any point of His teaching, He will allow His Spirit to use whatever process it may take to bring us to obedience. The fact that we insist on proving that we are right is almost always a clear indication that we have some point of disobedience. No wonder the Spirit of God so strongly urges us to stay steadfastly in the light! (see John 3:19-21  ).<br><br>"Agree with your adversary quickly . . . ." Have you suddenly reached a certain place in your relationship with someone, only to find that you have anger in your heart? Confess it quicklyÂ— make it right before God. Be reconciled to that personÂ— do it now!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>C. Peter Wagner: "Kingdom Philanthropy"<br>For most of us who have served in leadership positions in the church in recent times, the concept of philanthropy has been a rather distant and even abstract thought. We have been aware that philanthropists exist, but we do not ordinarily move in their circles. Many of us would not even be personally acquainted with one. Yes, at times we request grants from foundations operated by philanthropists, and that may be as close as we usually get.<br><br>Can We Become Philanthropists?<br><br>What would it be like if those of us who lead Christian ministries became philanthropists ourselves? I know that at first glance that would sound far-fetched. However, I would not be surprised if this fits into the direction that the stream of God seems to be moving in this season.<br><br>We live in extraordinary times. The 21st Century is already shaping up to be a quantum leap from the 20th Century around the globe. The biblical government of the church has come alive once again. The Holy Spirit has begun speaking to the churches about taking dominion of God's creation as God originally intended us to do. Our 20th Century goal of saving souls and multiplying churches has been expanded to aim for nothing less than transforming our society.<br><br>Along with all of these mega-changes is the impending fulfillment of God's promises through His prophets for the great transfer of wealth. My sense is that we are looking at unbelievable quantities of wealth moving from the control of the kingdom of darkness, to the control of the Kingdom of God. I know that it may be an exaggeration, but I have both faith and hope that it will be on the order of the wealth in Solomon's Kingdom.<br><br>It is one thing to receive and generate this wealth. Some will come through supernatural transfer from surprising sources. Some will come through supernatural revelation to Kingdom-minded individuals who have the personal tools to produce wealth, so that they will multiply their profits exponentially. This will be in tune with Deuteronomy 8:18, "You shall remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you power to get wealth that He may establish His covenant."<br><br>Responsible Distribution<br><br>It is another thing, however, to distribute this wealth responsibly. Here is where philanthropy comes in. Aristotle said that anyone can give money away, but only a few can give it to the right person at the right time, to the right extent, for the right reason, and in the right way.<br><br>"Philanthropy" comes from two Greek words meaning "loving people." It is a Godly pursuit because God loves people. Those who are born again by the Holy Spirit reflect God's love for people in their thoughts and in their actions. They are not self-centered because they feel that their destiny is not so much to help themselves, but to help others. It is important to recognize up front that philanthropy and selfishness are opposites.<br>If we are going to meet God's standards for philanthropy, we must first pass the test of selflessness. Loving others is more important than loving ourselves.<br><br>Having said this, we must at the same time cultivate healthy, biblical attitudes toward ourselves. The Book of Romans (see Romans 12:1-2), tells us that if we are to do the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God, two things are necessary. First, we must not think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think. That reflects what I just said about selflessness. But the second thing in doing God's will is to think soberly of ourselves. In other words, we must come to a positive, realistic, accurate self-evaluation. We must know who we are and who God desires us to be.<br><br>Unfortunately, there has been some misguided teaching in some of our churches; teaching that we should denigrate ourselves in order to please God. Supposedly pious phrases like, "We are nothing" are common. One of Charles Wesley's songs has us singing, "Such a worm as I." God did not create us to be nothing or to be worms. He created us to be the head, not the tail (see Deuteronomy 28:13).<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kingdom Philantrophy continued...<br><br>Thinking Soberly of Ourselves<br><br>How do we think soberly of ourselves? Romans 12:3 says, "As God has dealt to each one a measure of faith." The same passage then goes on to say that part of this is knowing our spiritual gifts (see Romans 12:6-8 ).<br>Another part is knowing the specific assignments that God has given each one us to advance His Kingdom. I'm directing these thoughts on philanthropy mostly to those whom God has given positions of leadership, primarily apostles (see 1 Corinthians 12:28 ). I think it is quite obvious that most new Kingdom philanthropists will be in the nuclear church and in the workplace. Fortunately, most  have been able to sort out the difference between unbiblical self-denigration and biblical selflessness.<br><br>Why have I dwelt so much on how we see ourselves? It is because of a very evident component of philanthropy that sometimes does not surface in our minds. Think of it. Think of any philanthropist you have heard of. Start with America's number one philanthropist, Bill Gates, if you want to. Before anyone becomes a philanthropist, they first must possess the resources needed to fulfill their personal destiny in life, whatever that might be. Once their own perceived needs are fully met, they can then begin to focus on providing similar resources for others. Philanthropists are rich. There might be an exception to the rule from time to time, but I am talking about the rule.<br><br>The Oxygen Mask Principle<br><br>In the networks, I have organized for what I call broad-band distribution, I apply the "oxygen-mask principle." When we are in an airplane, the flight attendant announces the oxygen-mask principle. If the cabin decompresses, oxygen masks are deployed for each passenger. If you have a child with you, you are instructed to put the oxygen mask on yourself first. Why? Only if you have your necessary supply of oxygen can you help those who don't.<br><br>As I said in the beginning, the body of Christ in general, has not been in a philanthropic mode on a worldwide scale in the past. Yes, we have loved people, and we have helped others both spiritually and materially.<br>We have fed poor people, we have been on the scene when disasters have hit, and we have established schools and hospitals and orphanages.<br><br>It is one thing to care for the poor, but it is quite another to remove the social causes of systemic poverty. Many tools are necessary to make this happen, and one of them is vast amounts of wealth, which previously has not been at our disposition.<br>Deliverance from the Spirit of Poverty<br>I think that one of the blockages to this in the past, has been the oppressive penetration of the spirit of poverty in our churches in general. If we are going to be philanthropists, we first need to be delivered from this pernicious demon. We need deliverance individually and in our families, and we need deliverance collectively in our churches and ministries.<br>The opposite of poverty is prosperity. Prosperity is God's will for His people and for His creation. Only prosperous people and ministries can be good philanthropists. That is why 2 Corinthians 9:8 says, "When you always have everything you need, you can do more and more good things." Later on, the same passage affirms that "God will make you rich enough so that you can always be generous" (2 Corinthians 9:11). Those who struggle and who are mired in debt, cannot be as generous as they would like to be.<br><br>Consider this scripture: "There is one who (gives generously), yet increases more; and there is one who withholds more than is right, but it leads to poverty. The generous soul will be made rich" (Proverbs 11:24-25).<br><br>Agents for Kingdom Philanthropy<br><br>Who would be the most likely agents and agencies for Kingdom philanthropy? It may surprise some when I say, these agents would probably be what we generally refer to as ministries or parachurch organizations, as over against most local churches. A much more satisfactory technical term for ministries or parachurch organizations, in my opinion, is "sodalities." Its counterpart for local churches would be "modalities." These terms have been used mostly in academic missiology, but I think they are useful because they do not carry the baggage that our more common terms often carry.<br><br>Our "senior pastor" regularly reminds the congregation that he does not have the gift of pastor, nor does he carry the pastoral work of the church. Our functional pastor is his associate.He has said, "I do not want to lead a local church. I want this house to be an "equipping center for Kingdom ministry."<br><br>All are potential agencies for Kingdom philanthropy, and those who lead them are prime candidates for Kingdom philanthropists.<br><br></div>

Who would want to look at a guy like that every Sunday?<br><br>No, John would never get hired today. His tactics lacked tact. His style wasnÂ’t smooth.

You donÂ’t have to be like the crowd to change the crowd. You donÂ’t have to lower yourself down to their level to lift them up to your level.<br><br>Nor do you have to be weird.

            <div class='col-md body'>Broken Things<br><br>"By reason of breakings they purify themselves" (Job 41:25).<br><br>God uses most for His glory those people and things which are most perfectly broken. The sacrifices He accepts are broken and contrite hearts. It was the breaking down of Jacob's natural strength at Peniel that got him where God could clothe him with spiritual power. It was breaking the surface of the rock at Horeb, by the stroke of Moses' rod that let out the cool waters to thirsty people.<br><br>It was when the 300 elect soldiers under Gideon broke their pitchers, a type of breaking themselves, that the hidden lights shone forth to the consternation of their adversaries. It was when the poor widow broke the seal of the little pot of oil, and poured it forth, that God multiplied it to pay her debts and supply means of support.<br><br>It was when Esther risked her life and broke through the rigid etiquette of a heathen court, that she obtained favor to rescue her people from death. It was when Jesus took the five loaves and broke them, that the bread was multiplied in the very act of breaking, sufficient to feed five thousand. It was when Mary broke her beautiful alabaster box, rendering it henceforth useless, that the pent-up perfume filled the house. It was when Jesus allowed His precious body to be broken to pieces by thorns and nails and spear, that His inner life was poured out, like a crystal ocean, for thirsty sinners to drink and live.<br><br>It is when a beautiful grain of corn is broken up in the earth by DEATH, that its inner heart sprouts forth and bears hundreds of other grains. And thus, on and on, through all history, and all biography, and all vegetation, and all spiritual<br>life, God must have BROKEN THINGS.<br><br>Those who are broken in wealth, and broken in self-will, and broken in their ambitions, and broken in their beautiful ideals, and broken in orldly reputation, and broken in their affections, and broken ofttimes in health; those who are despised and seem utterly forlorn and helpless, the Holy Ghost is seizing upon, and using for God's glory. "The lame take the prey,"<br>Isaiah tells us.<br><br>O break my heart; but break it as a field<br>Is by the plough up-broken for the corn;<br>O break it as the buds, by green leaf seated,<br>Are, to unloose the golden blossom, torn;<br>Love would I offer unto Love's great Master,<br>Set free the odor, break the alabaster.<br><br>O break my heart; break it victorious God,<br>That life's eternal well may flash abroad;<br>O let it break as when the captive trees,<br>Breaking cold bonds, regain their liberties;<br>And as thought's sacred grove to life is springing,<br>Be joys, like birds, their hope, Thy victory singing. --Thomas Toke Bunch<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Everything<br><br>"In nothing be anxious" (Phil. 4:6).<br><br>No anxiety ought to be found in a believer. Great, many and varied may be our trials, our afflictions, our difficulties, and yet there should be no anxiety under any circumstances, because we have a Father in Heaven who is almighty, who loves His children as He loves His only-begotten Son, and whose very joy and delight it is to succor and help them at all times and under all circumstances. We should attend to the Word, "In nothing be anxious, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God."<br><br>"In everything," that is not merely when the house is on fire, not merely when the beloved wife and children are on the brink of the grime, but in the smallest matters of life, bring everything before God, the little things, the very little things, what the world calls trifling things -- everything -- living in holy communion with our Heavenly Father, arid with our precious Lord Jesus all day long. And when we awake at night, by a kind of spiritual instinct again turning to Him, and speaking to Him, bringing our various little matters before Him in the sleepless night, the difficulties in connection with the family, our trade, our profession. Whatever tries us in any way, speak to the Lord about it.<br><br>"By prayer and supplication," taking the place of beggars, with earnestness, with perseverance, going on and waiting, waiting, waiting on God.<br><br>"With thanksgiving." We should at all times lay a good foundation with thanksgiving. If everything else were wanting, this is always present, that He has saved us from hell. Then, that He has given us His Holy Word -- His Son, His choicest gift -- and the Holy Spirit. Therefore we have abundant reason for thanksgiving. O let us aim at this!<br><br>"And the peace of God which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus." And this is so great a blessing, so real a blessing, so precious a blessing, that it must be known experimentally to be entered into, for it passeth understanding. O let us lay these things to heart, and the result will be, if we habitually walk in this spirit, we shall far more abundantly glorify God, than as yet we have done. --George Mueller, in Life of Trust.<br><br>Twice or thrice a day, look to see if your heart is not disquieted about something; and if you find that it is, take care forthwith to restore it to calm.--Francis De Sales<br><br></div>

Meyer<br><br>There's a simplicity about God in working out His plans, yet a resourcefulness equal to any difficulty, and an unswerving faithfulness to His trusting child, and an unforgetting steadiness in holding to His purpose. Through a fellow-prisoner, then a dream, He lifts Joseph from a prison to a premiership. And the length of stay in the prison prevents dizziness in the premier. It's safe to trust God's methods and to go by His clock. --S. D. Gordon<br><br>Providence hath a thousand keys to open a thousand sundry doors for the deliverance of His own, when it is even come to a desperate case. Let us be faithful; and care for our own part which is to suffer for Him, and lay Christ's part on Himself, and leave it there. --George MacDonald<br><br>Difficulty is the very atmosphere of miracle -- it is miracle in its first stage. If it is to be a great miracle, the condition is not difficulty but impossibility.<br><br>The clinging hand of His child makes a desperate situation a delight to Him<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Recognizing Our Source </strong><br>Deuteronomy 8:18<br>But remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you the ability to produce wealth.<br><br>Pride is the greatest temptation to a successful marketplace minister. When we begin accumulating wealth, managing people, and becoming known for our marketplace expertise, we are most susceptible to falling to the most devious sin in God's eyes-pride. The Bible tells us that God is the reason we are able to produce wealth. It is not of our own making. As soon as we move into the place where we begin to think more highly of ourselves than we ought, God says he will take action.<br><br>You may say to yourself, "My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me."....If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed. Like the nations the Lord destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed for not obeying the Lord your God (Deuteronomy 8:17,19-20).<br><br>These are strong words from God. It demonstrates His utter impatience for any people who think that what they have accomplished has anything to do with their own power. It is God who gives us the skill, the mind, the resources, the energy, the drive, and the opportunities in life to accomplish anything. When we become prideful in heart, He will begin a process of reproof in our life.<br><br>Today is a good day to examine whether we have fallen prey to pride. Are you sharing what God has entrusted to you with God's people, or the needy? Are you being the instrument of blessing that God desires for His people to be? What areas of pride have crept into your life? Ask the Lord to show you this today. And avoid being put on the shelf. Nothing is worse than being cast aside because of our own pride.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wrestling With God<br>Genesis 32:31<br>The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.<br><br>Jacob was a man who was a controller. He connived and manipulated his way to get what he wanted. It was a generational stronghold passed down through his mother, who encouraged her son to play a trick on his father, Isaac, by pretending to be Esau. This trick led Isaac to give the family blessing to Jacob, which meant Jacob would eventually inherit the land God had promised to Abraham's seed. Jacob also learned control from his uncle Laban who caused Jacob to work for 14 years to take Rachel as his lifelong mate. One must ask which was more ugly in God's sight, the self-centered nature and worldliness of Esau, or the control and manipulation of Jacob?<br><br>Control is a problem for men and women. Many women use sex to control their husbands. Many men use power and force to control their wives. Control is at the core of that which is opposite the cross-self-rule. What delivers us from this fleshly nature of control? A crisis. Jacob's crisis came when he was faced with the prospect of meeting a brother who said he would kill him the next time he saw him. Esau had built his own clan and was about to meet Jacob and his clan in the middle of the desert. Jacob was fearful, so he retreated. There he met a messenger from God who wrestled with him. Jacob clung to God and refused to let go of this angel. It is the place where Jacob was given a painful but necessary spiritual heart transplant. From that point on, Jacob would walk with a limp, because God had to dislocate his hip in order to overcome Jacob's strong will.<br><br>For businesspeople, God often has to "dislocate our hip" through failure and disappointment. Sometimes it is the only way He can get our attention. Our nature to control and manipulate is so strong that it takes a catastrophic event to wake us up. Yet God did not reject Jacob for these character traits. In fact, God blessed him greatly because He saw something in Jacob that pleased Him. He saw a humble and contrite heart beneath the cold and manipulative exterior of Jacob's life, and it was that trait that God needed to develop. He did this by bringing about the crisis in Jacob's life that led to total consecration. This event was marked by Jacob getting a new name, Israel. For the first time, Jacob had a nature change, not just a habit change. What will God have to do in our lives to gain our complete consecration to His will and purposes?<br><br>"Beware of the Christian leader who does not walk with a limp."<br><br>Bob Mumford<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finding the Will of God<br>Psalms 40:8<br>I desire to do Your will, O my God; Your law is within my heart.<br><br>How would you describe the process by which you find and do God's will in your life? For some, finding God's will is like playing bumper cars. We keep going in one direction until we bump into an obstacle, turn, and go in another direction. It is a constant process of elimination, failure, or success. Is this the way God would have us find His will? No. There is much more relationship between hearing God's voice and living within the mystery of His omnipotence in our lives. Perhaps this process is more like water in a streambed. The water is constantly flowing to a final destination. As it presses against the streambed, it gently points the water toward its final destination. There are no abrupt head-on collisions, simply slight modifications of direction. Occasionally, we come to a sharp turn in the contours of our life. For those times, God allows us to stretch our normal response to change. A popular Bible study says that we cannot go with God and stay where we are. Finding and doing God's will always require change. What changes are necessary in your life to join God in what He is already doing?<br><br>There is a direct connection between finding and doing God's will and having God's law in our heart. A friend once complained that he did not know what God wanted of him in his life. My immediate response was, "How much time do you spend with God in Bible study, prayer, and meditation on Scripture?" "Only a few minutes a day," he replied. How can we expect to hear and discern God's voice if we don't spend focused time with Him? If you have a spouse, how did you get to know him or her before you were married? You spent time together. You got to know everything about each other. Our walk with God is no different. It isn't enough to have a desire to follow God; we must put our energy into getting to know Him. His will for us flows out of our relationship, it is not an end in itself. Commit yourself to seeking Him more in your life by spending more time with Him. "Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know" (Jer. 33:3).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Move On!<br>Exodus 14:15<br>..."Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to move on."<br><br>Moses had brought the whole nation of Israel, approximately 600,000, to a dead end in the desert. The only thing between Israel and Pharaoh's pursuing army was the Red Sea. This was after nine plagues God had inflicted on Pharaoh to motivate him to free the Israelites. Finally, Pharaoh had freed Moses and the people, and they left Egypt. They thought they were home free. "Freedom at last," they said. But God did a strange thing. He directed Moses to take a route that led to the Red Sea, instead of the northern route around the Red Sea. God explained that He didn't want them fighting the enemies they would have encountered on this route. But still, there was the issue of the Red Sea.<br><br>They finally arrived at the Red Sea, and the people were wondering where they would go from there. News hit the camp: Pharaoh had changed his mind. He was coming after them with his army. Panic set in. The defenseless Israelites cried out, "Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die?...It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!" (Ex. 14:11b-12)<br><br>God sometimes brings each of us to a "Red Sea" in our life. It may be a business problem that can't be solved. It may be a marriage that seems to be failing. It may be a debilitating disease. Whatever your Red Sea, God tells us one thing: "Keep moving." The Red Sea was before them, yet God was angered at Moses and told him to "Keep moving."<br><br>"But Lord, the Red Sea is before me." "Keep moving." When we live by sight, we act on what we see. God sets this stage in dramatic fashion. God is into the dramatic. There is no way out without God here. That is just the way He wants it. No one will get glory except God.<br><br>A friend once admonished me when I was in the midst of a marriage separation that eventually led to a divorce, "You must not withdraw from being proactive in your faith just because of this trial that you are in. God's hand is on your life. There are too many who are depending on you to fulfill the purposes God has in your life. Keep moving! Keep investing yourself in others." I didn't feel like it. I was in too much pain. But I did it anyway. God met me at the point of my greatest need once I decided simply to be obedient. Getting past myself by investing myself in others helped heal the pain. There is great healing when we look past our own problems and seek to invest ourselves in others for the sake of Christ. This is when our own Red Seas become parted. We begin to walk to freedom. But we will never experience the miracle of the Red Sea in our lives if we don't first "Keep moving."<br></div>
