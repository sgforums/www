            <div class='col-md body'><strong>INTEGRITY Part4<br><br>These are not religious people that Â“do everything rightÂ”, but rather truly spiritual people that are constantly seeking Him.  They maintain their hearts clean from the WEEDS of self deception, inner lies, compromises with sin, evil, and EXCUSES for their condition.</strong><br><br>Â“That they may be called trees of righteousness the planting of Yahveh that He may be glorifiedÂ”  Isaiah 61:3b<br><br>The difference between Â“weedsÂ” and Â“Trees of RighteousnessÂ” is that one is planted by The Father and one is not. One will remain in His Presence and one will not, but rather be uprooted and burnt like all weeds should.  If not they will choke the trees and spoil the garden.<br><br>Maybe you have been functioning as a Â“weedÂ” though you are a Â“Tree of RighteousnessÂ”? Maybe you have allowed self deception, inner lies, excuses and denials to blind you to the truth of your condition. Maybe you get offended and self defensive when corrected? Maybe you are blind already and the weeds are affecting your vision. I have good news for you! Get into the Mikveh, wash away your sin, your self deception, inner lies, and CHOOSE TRUTH! Choose to be honest with yourself FIRST and then with others.  Remove the weeds from your soul and adopt INTEGRITY. INTEGRITY is the lifestyle of the True Trees of Righteousness.<br><br>INTEGRITY OF THE HEART is when you care about nothing more than pleasing the Almighty ALONE and giving Him Glory. Therefore your behavior towards others is in accordance to GodÂ’s moral ethics and in harmony with YÂ’shuaÂ’s righteous character!<br><br>The Word of God says that INTEGRITY shall guide us! In other words, we will not get lost on the way.  Integrity will be our EYES, and we will see clearly where we are going. Better than that, we will be going on the RIGHT WAY, the Highway of Holiness!<br><br>A highway shall be there, and a road, And it shall be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, But it shall be for others. Whoever walks the road, although a fool, shall not go astray. No lion shall be there, Nor shall any ravenous beast go up on it; It shall not be found there. But the redeemed shall walk there, And the ransomed of Yahveh shall return, and come to Zion with singing, With everlasting joy on their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, And sorrow and sighing shall flee away. Isaiah 35:8-10<br><br>When you walk in the integrity of your heart, you will walk in holiness, and you return to Zion, to YahÂ’s Covenant. When you return to His Covenant and Kingdom ways, to the Gospel Â“made in ZionÂ”, to His Commandments, and Torah instructions; then you will have great JOY. Integrity brings JOY!<br><br>continued...</div>

I have also trusted in the Yahveh; shall not slip. Examine me, O Yahveh, and prove me; Try my mind and my heart. For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes, And I have walked in Your truth. I have not sat with idolatrous mortals, Nor will I go in with hypocrites. I have hated the assembly of evildoers, And will not sit with the wicked. I will wash my hands in innocence; So I will go about Your altar, O Yahveh, that I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving, And tell of all Your wondrous works. Yahveh, I have loved the habitation of Your house, And the place where Your glory dwells.  Do not gather my soul with sinners, Nor my life with bloodthirsty men, In whose hands is a sinister scheme, And whose right hand is full of bribes.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sprout, Grow &amp; Yield<br><br>Â“But other [seed] fell to the good ground, and produced fruit, sprouting up and increasing, and it grewÂ—one thirty-fold, and one sixty, and one a hundred [times what was sown]. Mark 4:8<br><br>One of the reasons we as disciples of Messiah do not grow and mature in our walk with Him is because we expect the impossible. We expect God to do a radical transformation of our lives and make all of our problems go away in an instant. Adonai does indeed change us, and He can do so in the blink of an eyeÂ—yet He does not do this according to our design, but to His.<br><br>If we had our way, we would enter into a relationship with the Lord holding on to all of our previous experiences. We would emerge on the other side of a dramatic transformation with all those experiences still intactÂ—the only difference being that we would somehow be holier or less sinful from that point forward. In reality, however, God does not change us and then have us pick up our lives from the moment we left off. We are supposed to die, and then be born againÂ—we have to start over.<br><br>All of us want to be the seed that falls into rich soil and produces grainÂ—but we want it now, no waiting. We want to go from little seeds that have had no nurturing or sustenance, to suddenly and miraculously becoming mature and fully functioning believers. But in GodÂ’s economy, the seed needs to sit in the ground for a while, growing and maturing as it hides beneath the surface. Then, one day, it emergesÂ—not as a mature stalk, but as a tiny, fragile sprout. Over an extended period of time, that sprout grows; and only when it reaches full maturity does it yield a harvest.<br><br>It is not by coincidence or convenience that our maturing process can be likened to a crop on its agricultural schedule. Like the crops, we cannot rush things along by artificial meansÂ—we must yield ourselves completely and allow Adonai to mature us in His timing. When we grow to maturity, we will bring forth our fruit and yield a crop beyond our expectationsÂ—Â“thirty-foldÂ… sixtyÂ… a hundred [times what was sown]Â…Â”<br><br>P R A Y E R<br><br>Adonai, I yield myself fully to You. Remove from my heart any agendas or ideas that I can move You along in my maturing process. I joyfully resign myself to Your masterful ways, and I await the nurturing of Your GardenerÂ’s hand. I praise You, Father, for planting deep inside me the desire to live for You. I bless Your Name, for You have plans to grow in me thirty, sixty, even a hundred times what I could have ever sown aloneÂ….<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Simple Blessings<br><br>Â“And it will be, because you hear these judgments, and will keep and do them, that Adonai your God will keep to you the covenant and the kindness which He has sworn to your fathers. [He] will love you, and bless you, and multiply you, and will bless the fruit of your womb, and the fruit of your ground, your grain, and your new wine, and your oil, the increase of your oxen, and the wealth of your flock, in the land which He has sworn to your fathers to give to you.Â” DÂ’varim (Deuteronomy) 7:12-13<br><br>The stipulations for the covenant that Adonai cut with YisÂ’rael are simple: listen to, keep and obey the ways of Adonai, and He will love youÂ—that is, He will bless you and give you increase. As we grow and mature in our faith by hearing His judgments, keeping them and doing them, surely we can expect AdonaiÂ’s blessings to be poured out upon us. We need to realize, however, that those blessing may not be exactly what we expect.<br><br>When Adonai blesses us, it is not with adornments or other non-utilitarian embellishments. Being blessed does not mean that we have discretionary income, extravagant things, and everything we ever thought we wanted. For Adonai, blessing His people means giving them the essentials of lifeÂ—and giving those things in great abundance. If we are to truly appreciate AdonaiÂ’s blessings, we would do well to shed the shackles of worldly trappings and other things that we had once mistakenly labeled as Â“important.Â”<br><br>AdonaiÂ’s promises are simpleÂ—He will bless the fruit of our bodies, the fruit of our ground, and the fruit of our labor. Make no mistake: there is great truth here. We cannot look at our ancestors of old and think that God chose to bless them with such simple things because they were simple people with simple needs. On the contrary, AdonaiÂ’s design for His holy ones in all generations was that we would be simple people with simple needs. Complexity of life is not from HimÂ—it is a byproduct of our Â“civilizedÂ” living.<br><br>When we allow ourselves to get caught up in the self-made intricacies of life, our values and priorities become confused. Living according to the Scriptures enables us to be objectiveÂ—to not embrace the values and priorities of the world, but of the Lord. We may live in a Â“civilizedÂ” society, but that does not negate the truth that Adonai has made us and called us to live as simple people, who are not caught up in the ways of the world. Let us allow the Lord to distance us from the unimportant things of life. ItÂ’s time to get back to the basics, where being blessed simply means that we have plenty of only what we needÂ….<br><br>P R A Y E R<br><br>Adonai, purify me; separate me from the trappings of my life. Lord, show me the areas of my life that are truly unimportantÂ—help me to distance myself from them, replacing them with the essentials of living a holy life for You. I bless You, Abba, Father, for loving me and giving me increase according to Your definition alone. I praise Your Name, Adonai, my perfect providerÂ….<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He Worketh<br><br>"He worketh" (Ps. 37:5).<br><br>The translation that we find in Young of "Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass," reads: "Roll upon Jehovah thy way; trust upon him: and he worketh."<br><br>It calls our attention to the immediate action of God when we truly commit, or roll out of our hands into His, the burden of whatever kind it may be; a way of sorrow, of difficulty, of physical need, or of anxiety for the conversion of some dear one.<br><br>"He worketh." When? Now. We are so in danger of postponing our expectation of His acceptance of the trust, and His undertaking to accomplish what we ask Him to do, instead of saying as we commit, "He worketh." "He worketh" even now; and praise Him that it is so.<br><br>The very expectancy enables the Holy Spirit to do the very thing we have rolled upon Him. It is out of our reach. We are not trying to do it any more. "He worketh!"<br><br>Let us take the comfort out of it and not put our hands on it again. Oh, what a relief it brings! He is really working on the difficulty.<br><br>But someone may say, "I see no results." Never mind. "He worketh," if you have rolled it over and are looking to Jesus to do it. Faith may be tested, but "He worketh"; the Word is sure!  --V. H. F.<br><br>"I will cry unto Yahveh most high; unto Yahveh that performeth all things for me" (Ps. 57:2).<br><br>The beautiful old translation says, "He shall perform the cause which I have in hand." Does not that make it very real to us today? Just the very thing that "I have in hand"--my own particular bit of work today, this cause that I cannot manage, this thing that I undertook in miscalculation of my own powers--this is what I may ask Him to do "for me," and rest assured that He will perform it. "The wise and their works are in the hands of Yahveh."  --Havergal<br><br>The Lord will go through with His covenant engagements. Whatever He takes in hand He will accomplish; hence past mercies are guarantees for the future and admirable reasons for continuing to cry unto Him.  --C. H. Spurgeon<br><br></div>

He learns a snatch of this, a bar of that, but never an entire song of its own until the cage is covered and the morning beams shut out.<br><br>A good many people never learn to sing until the darkling shadows fall. The fabled nightingale carols with his breast against a thorn. It was in the night that the song of the angels was heard. It was at midnight that the cry came, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him."<br><br>Indeed it is extremely doubtful if a soul can really know the love of Yahveh in its richness and in its comforting, satisfying completeness until the skies are black and lowering.<br><br>Light comes out of darkness, morning out of the womb of the night.<br><br>James Creelman, in one of his letters, describes his trip through the Balkan States in search of Natalie, the exiled Queen of Serbia.<br><br>"In that memorable journey," he says, "I learned for the first time that the world's supply of attar of roses comes from the Balkan Mountains. And the thing that interested me most," he goes on, "is that the roses must be gathered in the darkest hours. The pickers start out at one o'clock and finish picking them at two.<br><br>"At first it seemed to me a relic of superstition; but I investigated the picturesque mystery, and learned that actual scientific tests had proven that fully forty per cent of the fragrance of roses disappeared in the light of day."<br><br>And in human life and human culture that is not a playful, fanciful conceit; it is a real veritable fact.  -Malcolm J.

(John 18:11, Weymouth).<br>Hashem takes a thousand times more pains with us than the artist with his picture, by many touches of sorrow, and by many colors of circumstance, to bring us into the form which is the highest and noblest in His sight, if only we receive His gifts of myrrh in the right spirit.<br>But when the cup is put away, and these feelings are stifled or unheeded, a greater injury is done to the soul that can ever be amended.

I can only say that I hear the sound of the Great End Time Army. Many of the trainees were filled with the Holy Spirit, many were healed in spirit, soul and body and most were radically transformed! When we were on Mount Carmel speaking about Elijah the Prophet and his confrontation with the prophets of Baal, Adonai confirmed His Word right there and people were healed instantly, including a lady that could not walk up and down the stairs without crutches. The Ruach HaKodesh put His people in an ICU training or rather on I SEE YOU training, where all attitudes contrary to the Kingdom were revealed, and according to the willingness of the Â“patientÂ”, they were also healed! We were people from different nations including USA. Philippines. Cyprus, France and Africa. The last meeting of this MAP Revolution Training was when we invited all the participants to join our 4 AM Team meeting.  That meeting went on until 9 AM and could have continued. The peopleÂ’s faces had totally changed and there was an awesome resolve in their eyesÂ…True Holy Revolutionaries had been born in only 10 days!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE HEALING OF GRACE Part 2</strong><br><br><strong>GRACE IS SICK</strong><br><br>One of the trainees was a lady by the name of Grace from the Philippines. Unbeknown to us she came to the training deathly sick with the auto immune disease of LUPUS. Both Rabbi and I laid hands on her when her condition became critical and tachicardic. She improved and her pulse became normal. Grace continued to travel with us and yet we all watched her become terribly yellow! It was a frightening sight, but we kept on believing for her miracle. Her sister being a Medical Doctor herself and also one of the trainees, told us that she had lost many family member to LUPUS! This was a family curse! Her mother, (also one of the trainees present), was extremely scared that she was going to lose another daughter. she had lost one to Lupus in the recent past. The whole family came expecting a miracle!<br><br>Meanwhile we arrived to the Jordan River Baptismal site to do the Mikveh of the Bride for purification. This was a time of rededication and Grace insisted of partaking of it. Her character was changing! She had been a Â“victimÂ” for a long time and YAH was teaching her to be a soldier and an overcomer. However we all watched her going from yellow to GREEN! Her face was a frightening green color.  Though I am a woman of faith and the doctors were cooperating with GraceÂ’s desire, I found myself wondering if this was the right thing! Grace kept going and we went up from the Galilee to The City of the King- Jerusalem!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE HEALING OF GRACE Part3</strong><br><br><strong>THE JERUSALEM MIRACLE</strong><br><br>On the first day in Jerusalem I took the group to walk on the walls of Jerusalem proclaiming GodÂ’s Promises over Israel. The climb is very steep and the walk is quite uncomfortable as we walk mainly on stones going up and down steep stairs. Grace insisted on coming! She wanted to fulfill the commandment written in Isaiah 62.<br><br>I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; They shall never hold their peace day or night. You who make mention of Yahveh, do not keep silent, And give Him no rest till He establishes And till He makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.  Isaiah 62:6-7<br><br>I must confess that I was quite skeptical that she would make it! However she was aided by Gabriela the dancer, our team member and by others.  Not only did she make it, but continued walking throughout the city of Jerusalem up and down countless of stairs and stones! She finally made it to the Temple Mount Excavations and to the Hulda Gate ancient entrance to the Holy Temple below Mount Moriah. She had been walking like this with us for nearly 6 hours! I was amazed! But I also was concerned.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE HEALING OF GRACE Part4</strong><br><br><strong>CRITICAL CONDITION</strong><br>Back in the hotel later that evening I heard a commotion, Grace was not doing well. Her hemoglobin had dropped to 5 (the normal count is between 12-14!) It looked like Lupus was trying to kill her quickly! I called The Almighty on His Covenant Promise in Genesis 12:3- That He will bless those that bless Abraham and His descendants the People of Israel.  Grace had come to His Land and had insisted on walking on JerusalemÂ’s Walls declaring ElohimÂ’s Promises for IsraelÂ…Surely He would keep His Word! I and probably many others had placed a request amidst the stones of the KOTEL (The Western Wall) and had asked The Father for a completed miracle. This family had lost too many victims to LUPUS!<br><br>Â“I will bless those who bless you, And I will curse him who curses you; And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.Â” Genesis 12:3<br><br>The Holy Spirit whispered in my ears Â“Grace is in CRITICAL CONDITIONÂ”, one of her doctors confirmed it. She must have oxygen immediately! Her hemoglobin was dangerously low. I called an ambulance to come with OXYGEN! Against GraceÂ’s most deep desires she was taken to the hospital with a delegation that included  doctor Hency from the tour, Pastors Tito and Jocelyn Sanchez and Rabbi Baruch. They spent the night in the ICU (!) of the Jerusalem Hospital called Â“Shaarei TsedekÂ” which means Â“THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESSÂ”. She was in Room # 3. The accompanying party spent the night in the hospital and I spent the night calling at regular intervals. Grace was receiving OXYGEN and she had to have a BLOOD TRANSFUSION!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE HEALING OF GRACE Part5</strong><br><br><strong>YAHÂ’S  PDT</strong><br><br>Now, I am not a big fan of blood transfusions as the Holy Scriptures say that the LIFE of the soul is in the blood.  So this is not only a physical issue but a spiritual issue. Do we know what kind of person was the donor? (Leviticus 17:11) Someone even mentioned that in the past Grace had received blood from an African person and her skin began to turn darker afterwards! While dark is beautiful, Grace is a Filipino! In spite of my concerns about THE BLOOD TRANSFUSION, I had peace from The Father. Somehow this was His plan and He was answering our prayers in a very prophetic and creative way! This was HIS SHOW!<br><br>Throughout the training all of us in the team were flowing in what we call PDT that is PROPHETIC DANCE THEATRE. PDT is the tool that YAHVEH has given us in order to communicate His Kingdom with prophetic preaching accompanied with dance, acting and singing. PDT is when God ACTS through us in real life situations in order to bring His Word! All prophets of old were real life actors! Isaiah walked naked in Jerusalem for three years (Isaiah 20:2,3). Ezekiel acted the exile to Babylon. Hosea married a prostitute to act the Word.  Jonah acted the wild prophet that had been Â“bleachedÂ” in the belly of the Big Fish during three nights and three days. YÂ’shua acted the jealousy of YAH when He used a cord of ropes to drive away the greedy Temple merchants. Yes all true prophets and apostles are actors and demonstrators of YAHÂ’s Word and Kingdom! In fact Rav Shaul, (Apostle Paul) said that He was a Â“Fool for MessiahÂ’s sakeÂ”.  King David danced in his ephod as he brought the Ark of The Covenant to Jerusalem. His wife Michal was so ashamed of his Â“utterly foolish behaviorÂ” that she despised him and became BARREN until the end of her life (WARNING!!!)<br><br>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, Â“How glorious was the king of Israel today, uncovering himself today in the eyes of the maids of his servants, as one of the base fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!Â” So David said to Michal, Â“It was before Yahveh, who chose me instead of your father and all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of Yahveh, over Israel. Therefore I will play music before Yahveh. And I will be even more undignified than this, and will be humble in my own sight. But as for the maidservants of whom you have spoken, by them I will be held in honor.Â” Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.<br><br>2 Samuel 6:20-23<br><br>WE REALIZED THAT YAHVEH WAS SPEAKING A MESSAGE TO US!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE HEALING OF GRACE Part6</strong><br><br>THE MESSAGE!<br><br>It dawned on me that:<br><br>Grace was SICK and in CRITICAL CONDITION and that she needed OXYGEN and BLOOD in order to LIVE. The only way to get this accomplished was through a BLOOD TRANSFUSION in a JEWISH HOSPITAL called THE GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS in Room # 3. She was to receive TWO BAGS (a double portion!) of JEWISH BLOOD!  Anything other than that SHE WOULD DIE!<br><br>In talking with the accompanying Dr. Hency I asked her about this BLOOD TRANSFUSION and the prognosis for recovery and she said: Â“If Grace ACCEPTS the (Jewish) BLOOD (life!); she will begin to RECOVER IMMEDITELY! If she REJECTS the (Jewish) BLOOD she can DIE!<br><br>So now we were all waiting for the NEWS from the hospitalÂ’s ICU: Â“Will Grace ACCEPT this ISRAELI BLOOD and LIVE? Or will she die? I was confident that Elohim had heard us! Then the GOOD NEWS came that she had TOTALLY ACCEPTED THE BLOOD and that she was rapidly improving, her skin color had improved dramatically and she could get up to the toilet by herself and even GOT HUNGRY! I knew that we had a SUCCESFUL TRANSFUSION. Grace would LIVE and not DIE, and declare the Works of Yahveh! Then I told our people that YAH had just ACTED before us the message of Romans 11:5,<br><br>For if their(the Jews) being cast away is the reconciling of the world, what will their (the Jews and Jewish Roots) acceptance be but life from the dead?  Romans 11:15<br><br>The only way for the Body of Messiah to recover from a Â“SICK GRACE GOSPELÂ” is by exercising Genesis 12:3 and by receiving Â“THE JEWISH BLOODÂ”, the JEWISH ROOTS OF THE FAITH. THE GOSPEL MADE IN ZION! Adonai is putting the ENTIRE BODY WORLDWIDE in His ICU, (I SEE YOU), in His Â“Gates of Righteousness HospitalÂ”. We need a BLOOD TRANSFUSION as the auto immune disease of Replacement Theology is killing us. The only hope is,<br><br>The acceptance of the Jews (and the Jewish Roots of the faith) which is LIFE FROM THE DEAD!!!<br><br>continued...</div>
