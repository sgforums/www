He had only learned to read the simplest words, and he could do little more than sign his name, but he was a happy man, and a hard worker. His niece brought him to live with her in the city when his wife died, and it was quickly discovered that Gus needed glasses. For the better part of his life, Gus had lived in nearsighted blindness. Suddenly, the whole world was opened up to him, and he viewed it with childlike awe.<br>Many of us live our lives in a kind of spiritual nearsightedness. We refuse to experience the fullness of our faith because it might cost too much, or it might make us uncomfortable. God offers to let us see this world through His eyes, and a more beautiful sight does not exist. Allow Him to give you second sight, and behold the wonders of the world.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Passion - It's a Spa, Spa World<br>by Ed Young<br><br>...Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant ... For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. Mark 10:43, 45<br><br>Selfishness vs. Servanthood... When the war is waged in our lives, we side with selfishness. We major in "me." We have this me, my, mine attitude in our lives and forget about others. We want someone else to serve us, to give us the massage, the pedicure, or the shoulder rub. We don't want to serve anyone else because we think of servants as weaker than, less than, or below us.<br><br>But Jesus Christ, God's only son, came to this earth to blow the doors off of our pre-determined ideas of servanthood. He taught us that serving is the way to freedom, the way to God's heart. And he modeled true servanthood by performing the ultimate act of service.<br><br>When we accept what he did for us, when we bow the knee to Christ, we become armed in the battle against selfishness. God instills in us the character quality that Jesus showed every day of his life - servanthood.<br><br>When Jesus walks into the doors of your life, he places the person of the Holy Spirit inside of your heart. And the Holy Spirit is the one who helps you battle against selfishness - he gives you the strategy, the way to win, the way to serve with an honest heart.<br><br>This week, when you feel the pull of selfish thinking in your life, remember the act of service that Christ performed on the cross. Remember that Jesus himself came, not to be served, but to serve. Then, reflect that teaching in what you do; reflect the servanthood that God has so passionately shown you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On Location - Take a Dive<br>by Ed Young<br><br>I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents (Luke 15:10).<br><br>How much do you matter to God?  Three parables in Luke 15 compare the value of a lost coin, a lost sheep and a lost son to the value God places on each human life.  In each case, these three things were highly valued and diligently sought after when lost.<br><br>And, in each case, there was much rejoicing when found. Jesus tells us that likewise, and in much greater measure, God and His angels rejoice over even one sinner who was lost and is found.  That's the reality of how much God loves you.<br><br>Hebrews 2:7 tells us, "God has crowned us with glory and honor."  We have the ability to live like royalty as sons and daughters of The King.  But first we must recognize that our crowns are broken because of sin, turn to Christ for forgiveness and trust Him to restore us to our royal position through the power of the cross.  Are you living up to the value God has placed on your life?<br><br>Take your flimsy and broken crown to the the feet of Jesus Christ, repent of your sins, and let him give you a new crown of eternal glory.  And start living like royalty!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How to Be a Refuge for Your Children<br>John Piper<br><br>If Daddy is afraid, where can a little child turn? Daddies are supposed to be safe. They are supposed to know what to do and how to solve problems and fix things and, most of all, protect the children from harm. But what happens if a child sees fear in Daddy's face? What if Daddy is as scared as the child, and doesn't know what to do? Then the child is utterly distraught and feels panic. He feels that the one strong and good and reliable place of safety is no longer safe.<br><br>But if Daddy is confident, then the children have a refuge. If Daddy is not panicking, but calm and steady, all the walls can come tumbling down, and all the waves can break, and all the snakes can hiss and the lions roar and the wind blow, and there will still be a safe place in Daddy's arms. Daddy is a refuge, as long as Daddy is confident.<br><br>That's why  Proverbs 14:26 says that "his children will have a refuge," if Daddy has a "strong confidence." Daddy's confidence is the refuge of his children. Dads, the battle to be confident is not just about us, it is about the security of our children. It is about their sense of security and happiness. It's about whether they grow up fretful or firm in faith. Until children can know God in a deep personal way, we are the image and the embodiment of God in their lives. If we are confident and reliable and safe for them, they will be much more likely to cleave to God as their refuge when the storms break over them later.<br><br>So how shall we have "strong confidence"? After all, we, too, are little children, clay pots, weak and broken and battling anxieties and doubts. Is the solution to put on the best show we can and hide our true selves? That will lead to ulcers at best, and God-dishonoring teenager-repelling duplicity at worst. That is not the answer.<br><br>Proverbs 14:26 gives another answer: "In the fear of the LORD there is strong confidence." This is very strange. It says that the solution to fear is fear. The solution to timidity is fear. The solution to uncertainty is fear. The solution to doubt is fear.<br><br>How can this be?<br><br>Part of the answer is that the "fear of the Lord" means fearing to dishonor the Lord. Which means fearing to distrust the Lord. Which means fearing to fear anything that the Lord has promised to help you overcome. In other words the fear of the Lord is the great fear destroyer.<br><br>If the Lord says, "Fear not, I am with you, be not dismayed, I will help you," (Isaiah 41:10), then it is a fearful thing to worry about the problem he says he will help you with. Fearing that problem when he says, "Fear not, I will help you, is a vote of no confidence against God's word, and that is a great dishonor to God. And the fear of the Lord trembles at such dishonoring God.<br><br>If the Lord says, "I will never fail you nor forsake you," so you can confidently say, "The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid; what can man do to me?" (Hebrews 13:5-6) - if the Lord says that to you, then not to be confident in the Lord's promised presence and help is a kind of pride. It puts our reckoning of the trouble above God's. That is why we read the amazing words of the Lord in Isaiah 51:12, "I, even I, am He who comforts you. Who are you that you are afraid of man who dies And of the son of man who is made like grass?" Who are you to fear man, when God has promised to help you? So it is pride to fear man. And pride is the exact opposite of the fear of God.<br><br>So, yes, the Proverb is true and a great help to us. Fear God, dads. Fear God. Fear dishonoring him. Fear distrusting him. Fear putting your assessment of the problem above his. He says he can help. He is smarter. He is stronger. He is more generous. Trust him. Fear not to trust him.<br><br>Why? He works for those who wait for him (Isaiah 64:4). He will solve the problem. He will rescue the family. He will take care of the little ones. He will meet your needs. Fear not believing that. Then your children will have a refuge. They will have a Daddy who "has strong confidence" - not in himself, but in the promises of God, which he trembles not to trust.<br><br>Learning to fear the Lord for the sake of my children,<br>Pastor John<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Song of Solomon 5:4<br>My Beloved put in His hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for Him.<br><br>Knocking was not enough, for my heart was too full of sleep, too cold and ungrateful to arise and open the door, but the touch of His effectual grace has made my soul bestir itself. Oh, the longsuffering of my Beloved, to tarry when He found Himself shut out, and me asleep upon the bed of sloth! Oh, the greatness of His patience, to knock and knock again, and to add His voice to His knockings, beseeching me to open to Him! How could I have refused Him! Base heart, blush and be confounded! But what greatest kindness of all is this, that He becomes His own porter and unbars the door Himself. Thrice blessed is the hand which condescends to lift the latch and turn the key. Now I see that nothing but my Lord's own power can save such a naughty mass of wickedness as I am; ordinances fail, even the gospel has no effect upon me, till His hand is stretched out. Now, also, I perceive that His hand is good where all else is unsuccessful, He can open when nothing else will. Blessed be His name, I feel His gracious presence even now. Well may my bowels move for Him, when I think of all that He has suffered for me, and of my ungenerous return. I have allowed my affections to wander. I have set up rivals. I have grieved Him. Sweetest and dearest of all beloveds, I have treated Thee as an unfaithful wife treats her husband. Oh, my cruel sins, my cruel self. What can I do? Tears are a poor show of my repentance, my whole heart boils with indignation at myself. Wretch that I am, to treat my Lord, my All in All, my exceeding great joy, as though He were a stranger. Jesus, thou forgivest freely, but this is not enough, prevent my unfaithfulness in the future. Kiss away these tears, and then purge my heart and bind it with sevenfold cords to Thyself, never to wander more</div>

A group of her friends dropped by to see her, and found her terribly distraught. Weeks before, Edna had been the victim of a purse snatcher, and ever since she was afraid to go out.

God will instill in us the power to conquer our fears and enjoy this life as the gift it was meant to be. He will also lead us in ways that we can work together to change this world for the better.<br></div>

Â—Colossians 1:24<br><br>We take our own spiritual consecration and try to make it into a call of God, but when we get right with Him He brushes all this aside. Then He gives us a tremendous, riveting pain to fasten our attention on something that we never even dreamed could be His call for us. And for one radiant, flashing moment we see His purpose, and we say, "Here am I! Send me" ( Isaiah 6:8 ).<br><br>This call has nothing to do with personal sanctification, but with being made broken bread and poured-out wine. Yet God can never make us into wine if we object to the fingers He chooses to use to crush us. We say, "If God would only use His own fingers, and make me broken bread and poured-out wine in a special way, then I wouldnÂ’t object!" But when He uses someone we dislike, or some set of circumstances to which we said we would never submit, to crush us, then we object. Yet we must never try to choose the place of our own martyrdom. If we are ever going to be made into wine, we will have to be crushedÂ— you cannot drink grapes. Grapes become wine only when they have been squeezed.<br><br>I wonder what finger and thumb God has been using to squeeze you? Have you been as hard as a marble and escaped? If you are not ripe yet, and if God had squeezed you anyway, the wine produced would have been remarkably bitter. To be a holy person means that the elements of our natural life experience the very presence of God as they are providentially broken in His service. We have to be placed into God and brought into agreement with Him before we can be broken bread in His hands. Stay right with God and let Him do as He likes, and you will find that He is producing the kind of bread and wine that will benefit His other children.<br><br>-- Oswald Chambers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Awareness of the Call<br><br>. . . for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not preach the gospel! Â—1 Corinthians 9:16<br><br>We are inclined to forget the deeply spiritual and supernatural touch of God. If you are able to tell exactly where you were when you received the call of God and can explain all about it, I question whether you have truly been called. The call of God does not come like that; it is much more supernatural. The realization of the call in a personÂ’s life may come like a clap of thunder or it may dawn gradually. But however quickly or slowly this awareness comes, it is always accompanied with an undercurrent of the supernaturalÂ— something that is inexpressible and produces a "glow." At any moment the sudden awareness of this incalculable, supernatural, surprising call that has taken hold of your life may break throughÂ— "I chose you . . ." ( John 15:16 ). The call of God has nothing to do with salvation and sanctification. You are not called to preach the gospel because you are sanctified; the call to preach the gospel is infinitely different. Paul describes it as a compulsion that was placed upon him.<br><br>If you have ignored, and thereby removed, the great supernatural call of God in your life, take a review of your circumstances. See where you have put your own ideas of service or your particular abilities ahead of the call of God. Paul said, ". . . woe is me if I do not preach the gospel!" He had become aware of the call of God, and his compulsion to "preach the gospel" was so strong that nothing else was any longer even a competitor for his strength.<br><br>If a man or woman is called of God, it doesnÂ’t matter how difficult the circumstances may be. God orchestrates every force at work for His purpose in the end. If you will agree with GodÂ’s purpose, He will bring not only your conscious level but also all the deeper levels of your life, which you yourself cannot reach, into perfect harmony.<br><br>Oswald Chambers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Watching With Jesus<br><br>Stay here and watch with Me Â—Matthew 26:38<br><br>Watch with Me." Jesus was saying, in effect, "Watch with no private point of view at all, but watch solely and entirely with Me." In the early stages of our Christian life, we do not watch with Jesus, we watch for Him. We do not watch with Him through the revealed truth of the Bible even in the circumstances of our own lives. Our Lord is trying to introduce us to identification with Himself through a particular "Gethsemane" experience of our own. But we refuse to go, saying, "No, Lord, I canÂ’t see the meaning of this, and besides, itÂ’s very painful." And how can we possibly watch with Someone who is so incomprehensible? How are we going to understand Jesus sufficiently to watch with Him in His Gethsemane, when we donÂ’t even know why He is suffering? We donÂ’t know how to watch with HimÂ— we are only used to the idea of Jesus watching with us.<br><br>The disciples loved Jesus Christ to the limit of their natural capacity, but they did not fully understand His purpose. In the Garden of Gethsemane they slept as a result of their own sorrow, and at the end of three years of the closest and most intimate relationship of their lives they "all . . . forsook Him and fled" ( Matthew 26:56 ).<br><br>"They were all filled with the Holy Spirit . . ." ( Acts 2:4 ). "They" refers to the same people, but something wonderful has happened between these two eventsÂ— our LordÂ’s death, resurrection, and ascensionÂ— and the disciples have now been invaded and "filled with the Holy Spirit." Our Lord had said, "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you . . ." ( Acts 1:8 ). This meant that they learned to watch with Him the rest of their lives.<br><br>Oswald Chambers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Say It with Grace<br>By Dr. James MacDonald<br><br>Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear. Ephesians 4:29<br><br>Ready to be convicted about something that could improve your relationships for the rest of your life? ItÂ’s all about the words that come out of your mouth.<br><br>Ephesians 4:29 says it straight up: Â“Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.Â”<br><br>Â“CorruptÂ” means to break down; cause decay. This verse says: donÂ’t say what tears people down. Just donÂ’t. The measurement of what words should be spoken is this question: will it build them up?<br><br>This is critical to understand: God is building something in the life of every follower of Jesus Christ. He has a personal construction plan for your life that targets where you need to grow and change. Most of the time those areas that need improvement are also noticeable to the people around you. When you insert your critical words into the middle of what God is working on in someone else, you are in essence tearing down what God is doing in their life. Ephesians 4:29 says, just donÂ’t do it.<br><br>Instead, say what is good. Speak words that are helpful to GodÂ’s construction program in their life.<br><br>Now generally speaking, youÂ’re either a verbal or a non-verbal person. If youÂ’re non-verbal, you may be thinking Â“This isnÂ’t so convicting for me, but I sure hope those verbal people hear it.Â” And if youÂ’re like me, a verbal person, youÂ’ve been thinking, Â“I am such a loser. I say things I shouldnÂ’t say all the time.Â” Good, take this word to heart.<br><br>But listen up, non-verbal personÂ—there are sins of not saying things as well as sins of saying things. May I encourage you to open your mouths with words of blessing? I praise God for such encouragersÂ—people who say to one another, Â“I appreciate what good work youÂ’re doing. God is really changing you, isnÂ’t He?Â” Step up, non-verbal people. God can use your word fitly spoken (Proverbs 25:11).<br><br>So why should we say what builds people up? Ephesians 4:29 ends with this thought: Because we all need grace. God gives it to us in amazing measure. He sets our feet in a wide place (Psalm 119:45). In His grace, He puts us where weÂ’re not in danger of tripping off the edge. If our mouth gets us in a spot where we shouldnÂ’t be, we wonÂ’t fall off with God; He just reaches out and pulls us back. ThatÂ’s grace.<br><br>LetÂ’s put each other in a wide place where thereÂ’s lots of room to grow.<br><br>DonÂ’t say what tears people down . . .<br>Say what builds them up . . .<br>. . . Because we all need grace.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Place of Exaltation<br><br>. . . Jesus took . . . them up on a high mountain apart by themselves . . . Â—Mark 9:2<br><br>We have all experienced times of exaltation on the mountain, when we have seen things from GodÂ’s perspective and have wanted to stay there. But God will never allow us to stay there. The true test of our spiritual life is in exhibiting the power to descend from the mountain. If we only have the power to go up, something is wrong. It is a wonderful thing to be on the mountain with God, but a person only gets there so that he may later go down and lift up the demon-possessed people in the valley (see Mark 9:14-18 ). We are not made for the mountains, for sunrises, or for the other beautiful attractions in lifeÂ— those are simply intended to be moments of inspiration. We are made for the valley and the ordinary things of life, and that is where we have to prove our stamina and strength. Yet our spiritual selfishness always wants repeated moments on the mountain. We feel that we could talk and live like perfect angels, if we could only stay on the mountaintop. Those times of exaltation are exceptional and they have their meaning in our life with God, but we must beware to prevent our spiritual selfishness from wanting to make them the only time.<br><br>We are inclined to think that everything that happens is to be turned into useful teaching. In actual fact, it is to be turned into something even better than teaching, namely, character. The mountaintop is not meant to teach us anything, it is meant to make us something. There is a terrible trap in always asking, "WhatÂ’s the use of this experience?" We can never measure spiritual matters in that way. The moments on the mountaintop are rare moments, and they are meant for something in GodÂ’s purpose.<br><br>Oswald Chambers</div>
