            <div class='col-md body'>Grow Up<br><br>Â“Â…we will in all [ways] grow up into Him, who is the headÂ—the Messiah.Â” Ephesians 4:15<br><br>When my oldest son was three years old, someone asked him what he wanted to be when he grows up. To spark his imagination, he was given an extensive list of possible vocations, ranging from doctor to cowboy. This sent the message to my son that the world is his oyster, and he can do and be whatever he wantsÂ—just as soon as he grows up. But does our freedom in Messiah give us the right to do and be whatever we want?<br><br>The Scriptures are not so haphazard in giving us direction for our lives. They certainly do not present us with the vague formula many of us as middle-class Americans teach our kids as they get older: go to school, get good grades, and stay out of troubleÂ… go to college, get good grades, and stay out of troubleÂ… get a good job, make some money, andÂ—when you think you can afford itÂ—get marriedÂ… make some more money so you can get a mortgage, andÂ—when you think you can afford itÂ—have some kidsÂ… keep making money, be a good person, and stay out of trouble.<br><br>On the contrary, the Scriptures give us a very clear directive: Â“in all [ways] grow up into Him, who is the headÂ—the Messiah.Â” Our faith and trust in Yeshua forms the basis for our value systemÂ—both the foundation and the goal is Messiah, and everything we do has Him as our aim. Yes, in Messiah we have freedom, but not the kind of freedom that lets us do whatever we want. Living according to what we want and desire is not freedomÂ—itÂ’s independence, and the Scriptures never teach us to be independent. Just the opposite, the Scriptures direct us to unite together under the headship of Messiah, dependant both on the Master and on each other.<br><br>Messiah alone is our standard. He models and exemplifies holiness and godliness as embodied in the Scriptures, and this gives us a practical plumb line from which to discern our own level of growth and maturity. We are to grow up into Him; that is, to mature into the fullness of the new creation we have already been made to be. We are Â“in MessiahÂ” by virtue of our regeneration. Now we are called to practically live out that reality.<br><br>What do you want to be when you grow up? I want to be like MessiahÂ….<br><br>P R A Y E R<br><br>Master, in every area of my life, make me like You. Teach me the ways of Your Word, that I may submit my life and conform to Your likeness. Lord, show me the freedom of abounding in You, the liberty of being set apart and holy for You. I bless Your Name, for You are my Master, the head of my life. Thank You, Master, for causing me to grow up into YouÂ….<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>REBELLING AGAINST THE SYSTEM<br>Isaiah 1:19, 20<br>If you consent and obey, you will eat the best of the land; but if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword<br><br>The third way people respond to rejection is to rebel against the system. They accurately sense the injustice of the world system.<br><br>Since the 1960s, this segment of society seems to be growing. These are the rebels and the dropouts who respond to rejection by saying, "I don't need you or your love." Deep inside they still crave acceptance, but they refuse to acknowledge their need. They will often underscore their defiance and rebellion by dressing and behaving in ways which are objectionable to the general population.<br><br>The rebel is marked by self-hatred and bitterness. He wishes he had never been born. He is irresponsible and undisciplined. He sees God as just another tyrant, someone else trying to squeeze him into a socially acceptable mold. He rebels against God just like he rebels against everyone else, because he sees God as a part of the establishment.<br><br>This person's rebellious attitude and behavior tend to alienate others and push them to defend the system he rejects. The establishment doesn't like to have the status quo questioned. So when the rebel criticizes the government or the schools, the establishment rises to defend them. But what is there to defend? When the rebel says the system is unfair, he's right. The world system is governed by the god of this world. It is hard, cold and rejecting.<br><br>We are to submit to and pray for the governing authorities so that it may be well with us (1 Peter 2:18-21); 1 Timothy 2:1-4). But the means by which we evaluate ourselves and the standards by which we live are not of this world.<br><br>Neil Anderson</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BEATING THE SYSTEM<br>Luke 14:11<br>Everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted<br><br>A small percentage of people defend against rejection by buying into the dog-eat-dog system of the world and learning to compete and scheme to get ahead of the pack. These are the movers and shakers, people who earn acceptance and strive for significance through their performance. They feel driven to get on top of every situation because winning is their passport to acceptance. They are characterized by perfectionism and emotional insulation and they struggle with anxiety and stress.<br><br>Spiritually, the beat-the-system individual refuses to come under God's authority and has little fellowship with God. This person is committed to controlling and manipulating people and circumstances for his own ends, so it is difficult for him to yield control in his life to God. In our churches this person jockeys to be chairman of the ruling board or the most influential member on a committee. His motivation is not to serve God in this position, however, but to control his world because his self-worth is dependent on it. Beat-the-system controllers are some of the most insecure people you will meet.<br><br>Sadly, the controlling individual's defensive strategy only delays inevitable rejection. Eventually his ability to control his family, his employees, and his church diminishes and he is replaced by a younger, stronger controller. Some survive this mid-life crisis, but many who make it to retirement don't enjoy much of it. Studies show that high-powered executives live an average of nine months after they retire. They base their lives in the world system they seek to conquer, but inevitably the world claims its own. "See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ" (Colossians 2:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>Neil Anderson</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE ACCEPTANCE OF GOD<br>John 15:20<br>If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you<br><br>Everyone knows what it feels like to be criticized and rejected, often by the very people in our lives we desperately want to please. We were born and raised in a worldly environment which chooses favorites and rejects seconds. And since nobody can be the best at everything, we all were ignored, overlooked or rejected at times by parents, teachers and friends.<br><br>Furthermore, since we were born in sin, even God had no relationship with us until we were accepted by Him in Christ at salvation. Since then we have been the target of Satan, the accuser of the brethren (Revelation 12:10), who never ceases to lie to us about how worthless we are to God and others. In this life we all have to live with the pain of rejection.<br><br>The acceptance of God is not based on our performance but on His kindness and mercy. "But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared, He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy" (Titus 3:4, 5). "Wherefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God" (Romans 15:7).<br><br>The thoughts and feelings of rejection which often plague us can be major deterrents to growth and maturity if we don't learn to handle them positively. Unfortunately, instead of taking a positive approach, we all learned early in life to respond to rejection by taking one of three defensive postures. Even Christians are influenced to react defensively to the rejection they experience in their family, their school, or society in general.<br><br>Over the next several days we will look at three ineffective and unnecessary ways to respond to rejection, and consider God's plan for helping us deal with rejection from others.<br><br>Neil ANderson</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When God Restores What the Locusts Eat<br>Joel 2:25<br>I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten-the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm-My great army that I sent among you.<br><br>There are seasons in our lives that involve times of famine and times of restoration. Solomon tells us that He has made everything beautiful in its time and that there is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under Heaven. (See Ecclesiastes 3:1,11.)<br><br>God brings about both the good and the bad. The seasons of famine have a divine purpose in our lives. They accomplish things that only these hard places can accomplish. But there is a time when those hard places have accomplished their purpose and He begins to restore. God did this with the nation of Israel after a season of famine and devastation.<br><br>Be glad, O people of Zion, rejoice in the Lord your God, for He has given you the autumn rains in righteousness. He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before. The threshing floors will be filled with grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. "I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten-the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm-My great army that I sent among you. You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the Lord your God, who has worked wonders for you; never again will My people be shamed. Then you will know that I am in Israel, that I am the Lord your God, and that there is no other; never again will My people be shamed" (Joel 2:23-27).<br><br>God wants each of us to know that there is a time when He will restore in order to demonstrate His gracious hand in our lives. He is a loving Father who tenderly guides His children through the difficult places. If God has taken you through a time of leanness, know that He is the restorer of that which the locusts have eaten. Wait patiently for Him to bring this about in your life. He will do it.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Confidence in Numbers<br>2 Samuel 24:10<br>David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the Lord, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, O Lord, I beg You, take away the guilt of Your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."<br><br>It just seems to be human nature. As we grow in wealth and ability, our confidence moves from complete trust in the Lord to trust in our resources. King David decided one day that he needed to know how many fighting men he had in his army. This was a grievous sin in the nation of Israel. God always made it clear to the nation that He, not their army, was their source. It was against the law of God to number the troops. David's general, Joab, knew the serious nature of such an action.<br><br>But Joab replied to the king, "May the Lord your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?" (2 Samuel 24:3)<br><br>Joab knew that David was treading in dangerous waters when he brought up the idea to him. But David had it in his mind that this is what he was going to do. And he did. The result: God judged David for this sin by smiting the nation with a plague that resulted in the loss of 70,000 lives.<br><br>Recently, I was having lunch with a former stockbroker who lost everything in the 1987 stock crash in the United States. He made an interesting comment. "You cannot know how to fully trust the Lord in the financial area until you really have to. When I lost everything, I was forced to trust Him when I knew I could not pay my next bill unless God provided. This was the time I learned to trust God. I never had to trust God before I lost my money because I had plenty. We don't willingly enter this level of trust with God."<br><br>Ask God today to keep you from trusting in your own resources. Ask Him how to balance trust and blessing from Him this day.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Faith vs. Presumption<br><br>Genesis 16:2<br>So she said to Abram, "The Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family through her." Abram agreed to what Sarai said.<br><br>Presumption is based on our own reasoning. Abraham and Sarah fell into presumption when they got too old to have children. God had promised a son to Abraham and Sarah-a son who would fulfill His promise to birth a nation. But Abraham and Sarah were past the normal age for childbearing. So, they concluded that God needed help to work out His plan.<br><br>Many businesspeople make the same mistake every day. We make assumptions about what we believe God is doing and wants us to do. However, before we really have full assurance that God has spoken to us on the matter and revealed His perfect action plan, we move forward with our steps to get it done. How do we protect ourselves from presumption? The Proverbs tell us that there is safety in a multitude of counselors (see Prov. 11:14 KJV). Submitting our decisions to others for confirmation protects each of us from the deceit of our own heart. This process will protect us from presumption and encourage us to move in faith. The next time you believe God is directing you toward a specific action, consult with your spouse first, then some close, spiritual friends who will take the time to prayerfully consider your request. If you don't have consensus, wait until you do before you move forward. God will move through this process to His desired will for the matter.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Living for a Cause Greater Than Yourself<br>Philippians 4:13<br>I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.<br><br>In the thirteenth century a man named William Wallace became the instrument of freedom from England's tyranny over Scotland. A very wicked king ruled England. A tragedy in the life of William Wallace launched him into living for this cause. Initially his cause was revenge, but soon his cause turned to something bigger than himself-freedom for a nation. When he challenged the commoners to fight for this freedom, they responded that the enemy was too great and that they might die on the battlefield. They also refused to fight for the nobles, the knights and leaders who had a vested interest in gaining more land for themselves versus a pure cause of freedom. Wallace's response: "Yes, we might die. We will all die sooner or later. But we will die for a cause worth dying for. So that our children and their children might live in freedom." This story was popularized in the movie Brave Heart (Sherman Oaks, California: Paramount Pictures, 1995).<br><br>Today we find many Christian businesspeople living a status quo relationship with God that is more characterized as "business as usual" than a life demonstrating God's power. Our focus is often more concerned with improving our standard of living than improving the Kingdom of God through our circle of influence. While this takes place, millions upon millions die without the saving grace of Christ. Many other Christians die never experiencing the freedom in Christ that His blood paid for. God has called each of us to live for a cause greater than ourselves-a life that is dependent on His grace and power to achieve things we never thought possible through our lives. This is His plan for your life. The apostle Paul prayed that He might experience the power of the resurrection in his life. This power is available to you and me to live for a cause greater than ourselves. Ask God what He wants to achieve through your life today. And consider yourself dead already to the consequences of what that might mean for you.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Depth and Width of Your Calling<br>2 Corinthians 1:6<br>If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.<br><br>"God must love you a lot! He doesn't allow someone to go through the kinds of adversity you have experienced unless He has a special calling on your life." Those were the words said to me by two different mentors at two different times within a three-year period. Later I would learn another related truth from a respected man of God-a man who lives in another country, a man whom God uses throughout the globe. "The depth and width of your faith experiences are directly proportional to your calling." What were these men of God saying?<br><br>They were describing a process of preparation that God takes each of His leaders through when He plans to use them in significant ways. A "faith experience" is an event or "spiritual marker" in your life about which you can say, "That is where I saw God personally move in my life." It is an unmistakable event in which God showed Himself personally to you. It was the burning bush for Moses; the crossing of the Red Sea or the Jordan River for the nation of Israel; Jacob's encounter with the angel. It was the feeding of the 5,000 for the disciples. It was the time when you saw God face to face in your life.<br><br>If God has plans of using you in the lives of many others, you can expect that He is going to allow certain faith experiences to come into your life in order to build a foundation that will be solid. That foundation is what you will be able to look back on to keep you faithful to Him in the times of testing. Each of us must have personal faith experiences in which we experience God personally so that we can move in faith to whatever He may call us. Do you need a personal faith experience right now in your life? Pray that God will reveal Himself to you. He delights in doing that.<br><br></div>

"Lord," he prayed, "it needs rain that its tender roots may drink and swell. Send gentle showers." And the Lord sent gentle showers. "Lord," prayed the monk, "my tree needs sun. Send sun, I pray Thee." And the sun shone, gilding the dripping clouds. "Now frost, my Lord, to brace its tissues," cried the monk. And behold, the little tree stood sparkling with frost, but at evening it died.<br><br>Then the monk sought the cell of a brother monk, and told his strange experience. "I, too, planted a little tree," he said, "and see! it thrives well. But I entrust my tree to its God. He who made it knows better what it needs than a man like me. I laid no condition. I fixed not ways or means. 'Lord, send what it needs,' I prayed, 'storm or sunshine, wind, rain, or frost.

            <div class='col-md body'>Obstinate Faith<br><br>"And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon a heap." (Joshua 3:13).<br><br>Brave Levites! Who can help admiring them, to carry the Ark right into the stream; for the waters were not divided till their feet dipped in the water (ver. 15). God had not promised aught else. God honors faith. "Obstinate faith," that the PROMISE sees and "looks to that alone." You can fancy how the people would watch these holy men march on, and some of the bystanders would be saying, "You would not catch me running that risk! Why, man, the ark will be carried away!" Not so; "the priests stood firm on dry ground." We must not overlook the fact that faith on our part helps God to carry out His plans. "Come up to the help of the Lord."<br><br>The Ark had staves for the shoulders. Even the Ark did not move of itself; it was carried. When God is the architect, men are the masons and laborers. Faith assists God. It can stop the mouth of lions and quench the violence of fire. It yet honors God, and God honors it. Oh, for this faith that will go on, leaving God to fulfill His promise when He sees fit! Fellow Levites, let us shoulder our load, and do not let us look as if we were carrying God's coffin. It is the Ark of the living God! Sing as you march towards the flood!  --Thomas Champness<br><br>One of the special marks of the Holy Ghost in the Apostolic Church was the spirit of boldness. One of the most essential qualities of the faith that is to attempt great things for God, and expect great things from God, is holy audacity. Where we<br>are dealing with a supernatural Being, and taking from Him things that are humanly impossible, it is easier to take much than little; it is easier to stand in a place of audacious trust than in a place of cautious, timid clinging to the shore.<br><br>Like wise seamen in the life of faith, let us launch out into the deep, and find that all things are possible with God, and all things are possible unto him that believeth.<br><br>Let us, today, attempt great things for God; take His faith and believe for them and His strength to accomplish them.  --Days of Heaven upon Earth<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Desperate Days<br><br>"But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." (Heb. 11:6).<br><br>The faith for desperate days.<br><br>The Bible is full of such days. Its record is made up of them, its songs are inspired by them, its prophecy is concerned with them, and its revelation has come through them.<br><br>The desperate days are the stepping-stones in the path of light. They seem to have been God's opportunity and man's school of wisdom.<br><br>There is a story of an Old Testament love feast in Psalm 107, and in every story of deliverance the point of desperation gave God His chance. The "wit's end" of desperation was the beginning of God's power. Recall the promise of seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sands of the sea, to a couple as good as dead. Read again the story of the Red Sea and its deliverance, and of Jordan with its ark standing mid-stream. Study once more the prayers of Asa, Jehoshaphat, and Hezekiah, when they were sore pressed and knew not what to do. Go over the history of Nehemiah, Daniel, Hosea, and Habakkuk. Stand with awe in the darkness of Gethsemane, and linger by the grave in Joseph's garden through those terrible days. Call the witnesses of the early Church, and ask the apostles the story of their desperate days.<br><br>Desperation is better than despair.<br><br>Faith did not make our desperate days. Its work is to sustain and solve them. The only alternative to a desperate faith is despair, and faith holds on and prevails.<br><br>There is no more heroic example of desperate faith than that of the three Hebrew children. The situation was desperate, but they answered bravely, "Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning, fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden<br>image which thou hast set up." I like that, "but if not !"<br><br>I have only space to mention Gethsemane. Ponder deeply its "Nevertheless." "If it is possibleÂ…nevertheless!" Deep darkness had settled upon the soul of our Lord. Trust meant anguish unto blood and darkness to the descent of hell--Nevertheless! Nevertheless!!<br><br>Now get your hymn book and sing your favorite hymn of desperate faith.  --Rev. S. Chadwick<br><br>"When obstacles and trials seem<br>Like prison walls to be,<br>I do the little I can do<br>And leave the rest to Thee.<br><br>"And when there seems no chance, no change,<br>From grief can set me free,<br>Hope finds its strength in helplessness,<br>And calmly waits for Thee."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Following Only the Father's Commands </strong><br>John 5:19<br>Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by Himself; He can do only what He sees His Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does."<br><br>Have you ever thought about a typical day in Jesus' life? Perhaps He might have had questions like these, "Who am I going to heal today? Who will I visit today? Which person will I deliver from demons this day?" etc. The demands on Jesus' time were great. Yet we see that Jesus allocated His time very deliberately. We don't get the idea that Jesus was flustered or stressed from the activity He was involved in. He often sought times of prayer and reflection away from the disciples. His life appeared to have a balance of quiet moments and active ministry into the lives He came in contact with.<br><br>How do we determine what we will be involved in each day of our lives? What keeps us in sync with the will of our heavenly Father for the daily tasks He calls us to? Jesus tells us that He was only involved in those things the Father was involved in. Nothing more, nothing less. So often we determine our participation in an activity based on whether we have the time to do it or whether we desire to participate. The real question we should ask is, "Does the Father want me to participate in this activity?"<br><br>"Lord, should I add this Bible study to my schedule? Should I spend an extra night out on this committee this week? Should I take on new business that will take me away from home more? Should my daughter be involved in music lessons?" These are the daily challenges for the world we now live in. We are an activity-based society that often encourages more and more activity, often in the name of Christian virtue.<br><br>Our lives will become less cluttered, less stressful, and more fulfilling when we follow the model Jesus provided. It may not always please everyone. Jesus never sought to please everyone. Ask the Lord each day this week how you and He are to spend your time. Yield your schedule to Him. Let Jesus direct your every activity. You may discover that He desires you to cut back some things in order to spend more time alone with Him. He will be faithful to show you. And you will become more fulfilled because you are centered in His will for you.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

When we understand what breaks God's heart, we are able to mourn on behalf of a grieving person, or a nation we are called to serve. What breaks God's heart? When we begin to answer this question, we begin the first step to becoming instruments of change for those things that are important to God. Perhaps it is an overemphasis in our own talent and abilities, or lack of complete trust in Jesus. Perhaps it is the lack of respect for human life that leads to the killing of innocent babies. Perhaps it is the deceit and pride that often rule the marketplace of commerce. Or perhaps it is the strife and divisions among His own Body that grieve Him most. When we begin to mourn over our own sins in these areas, God begins to use us as instruments of righteousness to affect these things. It was only when God let me see my own sins in the marketplace and how they broke His heart that I began to be an instrument for His purposes.<br><br>Today, ask God to show you what things in your world are breaking His heart.

When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said.

The result of his obedience was that Philip led the eunuch to faith in Christ and baptized him.

The demands that are often put on us can bring out things that we never knew were there. Sometimes we begin to think that the source of that pressure is to blame for our response to the pressure. It could be an event, a spouse, a boss, a client, a child, or even a driver who cuts us off in traffic.<br><br>I recall responding to a close friend one time, "If you had not done that, I would never have responded that way." Later I learned that this response had little truth to it. We all choose to get angry. No one else is to blame for our anger.<br><br>"The circumstances of life, the events of life, and the people around me in life, do not make me the way I am, but reveal the way I am" [Dr. Sam Peeples].<br><br>This simple quote has had a profound impact on how I view my anger now. Anger only reveals what is inside of me. I can't blame anyone but me for my response to a situation. I have learned that anger is only the symptom of something else that is going on inside of me. This quote now resides on my refrigerator door as a daily reminder of the truth about my response to life's situations.<br><br>It has been said that anger is like the warning panel on the dash of your car. It is the light that tells us something is going on under the hood and we need to find out what is the source of the problem. I discovered that the source of anger is often unmet expectations or personal rights. We believe we are entitled to a particular outcome to a situation. When this doesn't happen, it triggers something in us. At the core of this is fear, often a fear of failure or rejection, fear of what others think, fear of the unknown.<br><br>If you struggle with anger, ask God to reveal the source of that anger. Ask Him to heal you of any fears that may be the root of your anger. Ask God to help you take responsibility for your response to difficult situations.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

This man worked on a cargo ship. His boss was the captain. This friend was a committed Christian who shared his faith with others and was a good worker. One day the friend led the sea captain's girlfriend to Christ. The sea captain already hated and ridiculed the Christian worker because of his faith in Christ. When his girlfriend came to Christ, she stopped sleeping with the captain. The captain blamed the Christian man for the change in his girlfriend. One day he entered the restaurant where the Christian man was having lunch. He walked over to his table and began hurling obscenities and began beating him. The Christian man simply tried to defend himself but did not fight back. The captain kept beating him until eventually the man lay on the floor bleeding.<br><br>Two men entered the restaurant and saw what was taking place. They jumped the sea captain and took him outside and began beating him. The sea captain was beaten so badly that he needed immediate medical attention. The Christian worker saw the condition of the sea captain, came to his aid, and began helping him. The sea captain was so moved that this man could do this after he had literally beaten him bloody that he began to weep, not understanding what could move a man to have such love in the face of being beaten. The sea captain accepted Jesus at that moment.<br><br>The Bible tells us that while we were yet sinners Christ came and paid our penalty so that we might live eternally. Many in the marketplace have never known the love of Christ. You might be the only one they ever meet who can introduce them to this love.

            <div class='col-md body'>Seeking the Savior<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>Simeon said, Â“Can I stay alive until I see him?Â”<br><br>The Magi said, Â“Saddle up the camels. We arenÂ’t stopping until we find him.Â”<br><br>The shepherds said, Â“LetÂ’s goÂ…. LetÂ’s see.Â”<br><br>They wanted the Savior. They wanted to see Jesus.<br><br>They were earnest in their search. One translation renders Hebrews 11:6: Â“God Â… rewards those who earnestly seek himÂ” (NIV, italics mine).<br><br>Another reads: Â“God rewards those who search for himÂ” (PHILLIPS, italics mine).<br><br>And another: Â“God Â… rewards those who sincerely look for himÂ” (TLB, italics mine).<br><br>I like the King James translation: Â“He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek himÂ” (italics mine).<br><br>DiligentlyÂ—what a great word. Be diligent in your search. Be hungry in your quest, relentless in your pilgrimage. Let this book be but one of dozens you read about Jesus and this hour be but one of hundreds in which you seek him. Step away from the puny pursuits of possessions and positions, and seek your king.<br><br>DonÂ’t be satisfied with angels. DonÂ’t be content with stars in the sky. Seek him out as the shepherds did. Long for him as Simeon did. Worship him as the wise men did. Do as John and Andrew did: ask for his address. Do as Matthew: invite Jesus into your house. Imitate Zacchaeus. Risk whatever it takes to see Christ.<br><br>God rewards those who seek him. Not those who seek doctrine or religion or systems or creeds. Many settle for these lesser passions, but the reward goes to those who settle for nothing less than Jesus himself. And what is the reward? What awaits those who seek Jesus? Nothing short of the heart of Jesus. Â“And as the Spirit of the Lord works within us, we become more and more like himÂ” (2 Cor. 3:18 TLB).<br><br>Can you think of a greater gift than to be like Jesus? Christ felt no guilt; God wants to banish yours. Jesus had no bad habits; God wants to remove yours. Jesus had no fear of death; God wants you to be fearless. Jesus had kindness for the diseased and mercy for the rebellious and courage for the challenges. God wants you to have the same.<br><br>He loves you just the way you are, but he refuses to leave you that way. He wants you to be just like Jesus.<br><br>From Just Like Jesus<br>Copyright 1998, Max Lucado<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Until the Day</strong><br><br>Â“And the child (Yochanan [John] the Immerser) grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his [public] appearance to YisÂ’rael.Â” Luke 1:80<br><br>As we grow, both physically and spiritually, one of the main characteristics we need to nurture is patience. During times of development, all things must wait for natural processes to run their courseÂ—or risk stunting their own growth. A premature gathering of crops, for instance, will result in both an inadequate harvest and the endangerment of potential, future increase. As disciples of Messiah, we bear the fruit of patience by submitting ourselves to AdonaiÂ’s schedule, trusting that He is providing everything we need to ripen in due time.<br><br>Yochanan was not born immersing people in the Yarden River. Though destined to be the powerful forerunner of our Master, Yeshua, he first had to grow and be Â“strengthened in spirit.Â” Did Yochanan need this time of growth merely to gain specific knowledge or gather certain information? On the contrary, it was for the development of his characterÂ—to make him ready to enter into the fullness of his calling. In order to grow and be Â“strengthened in spirit,Â” Yochanan had to undergo a time of inner fortificationÂ—Yochanan had to wait in the wilderness.<br><br>Our Â“wilderness experiencesÂ” are for this very purposeÂ—to strengthen our spirits. All too often, we allow the busy-ness of life to distract us from being in AdonaiÂ’s presence. Because of this, He needs to get us alone so that He can have our full attentionÂ—and it is during these times that He builds our character, shaping us into vessels who may be entrusted with His message. When the day finally comes for us to emerge from the wilderness, we will find that we have indeed grown and been strengthened.<br><br>When we become strong in spirit, that is the time for our Â“[public] appearance.Â” If we donÂ’t allow ourselves to get ahead of the Lord, we will never attempt to Â“appearÂ” in public before we are ready. But when our days in the wilderness are over, we cannot waitÂ—we must boldly speak the message of Yeshua.<br><br>Adonai wants to make you famous! He has a plan for giving you an influential forum in which to proclaim the life-changing truth of the Kingdom of GodÂ—not just with your words, but with your life. Be patient, for you are being strengthened in spirit, and the time of your Â“[public] appearanceÂ” is at handÂ….<br><br></div>
