            <div class='col-md body'><strong>2. The Hidden Light</strong><br><br>The Rabbis 3 explain that the light made on the first day was Â“hidden for the righteous in the world to come.Â” But this is paradoxical. Since the whole purpose of light is to illuminate, why should it have been hidden immediately after it was created; the very denial of its raison dÂ’etre? And even though the Rabbis explained why the light should have been hidden, we still need to understand why, if G-d foresaw this, He still created it at the outset.<br><br>A further comment requiring explanation is that of the Zohar,4 which points out that the Hebrew words for Â“lightÂ” and Â“secretÂ” are numerically equivalent.5 Numerical equivalence is a sign that the two things are related to one another (for since things were created through the permutations of the letters of the Divine utterances, two things whose names are comprised of letters of the same value share a common essential form). But again we have a paradox: Light is, of its essence, a revealed thing, and a secret is necessarily hidden. How can two opposites share a common form?<br><br>continued....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>3. The Architecture of the Universe</strong><br><br>To resolve these difficulties we must consider a remark made by the Midrash:6 Â“Just as a king wishing to build a palace does not do so spontaneously but consults architectÂ’s plans, so G-d looked into the Torah and created the world.Â”<br><br>In other words, by examining the order in which a man sets about making something which requires planning and forethought, we can learn something of G-dÂ’s order in bringing the world into being.<br><br>First, he fixes in his mind the purpose which he desires his work to achieve. Only then does he begin the labor.<br><br>This, as it were, was G-dÂ’s procedure. And the purpose of the world that He was to create (a place where the Divine light would be hidden7 in the heavy shrouds of material existence) was that it should be purified and the pristine light of G-d restored. He sought, ultimately, a Â“dwelling place in the lower world,Â”8 meaning that His hiddenness (darkness) be transformed into a revealed presence (light).<br><br>Since light was thus the purpose of the creation, and the purpose is the first thing to be decided on in the order of a work, light was created on the first day. The intention of all the subsequent creations was captured in that opening phrase, Â“Let there be light.Â”<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>4. The Implicit Light</strong><br><br>There is, however, an allusion to light in each of the subsequent days of creation. For each dayÂ’s work concluded with the pronouncement Â“And G-d saw that it was good.Â” And the word Â“goodÂ” alludes to light, as it is written Â“And G-d saw the light9that it was good.Â” It follows that light was present on each day of creation, but how can this be, if light is the purpose of creation, and as such explicit only at the outset?<br><br>The answer is that purpose manifests itself in two ways:<br><br>(i)explicitly at the start of a labor; and<br><br>(ii)implicitly at every stage of the work, guiding each endeavor in a pre-arranged pattern, so that it conforms to the original design.<br><br>It follows that there were two aspects to the primeval light: Firstly as it was revealed, as the purpose of creation, on the first day, prior to any other existing thing; and secondly, as it was felt indirectly (and hence only alluded to) on the other days, shaping the remainder of creation towards its function.<br><br>continued...</div>

Revelation and Fulfillment</strong><br><br>Now we can understand why the Zohar points out the connection between Â“lightÂ” and Â“secret,Â” and why the Rabbis said that it was hidden for the righteous in the world to come.<br><br>While a building is under construction, its final shape is not apparent, except in the mind of the architect. Its ultimate form is disclosed only when the work is completed.<br><br>So with the world: Only when it has been brought to its perfection, by our service during the 6,000 years10 which precede the Messiah, will its purpose (Â“lightÂ”) be revealed.<br><br>The light now is hidden, but in the world to come (when our worldly service has been completed) it will once again shine as it did on the first day.<br><br>But anything which is hidden, is hidden somewhere. Where is the light hidden? The Rabbis say:11 in the Torah. For just as an architectÂ’s drawings guide the buildersÂ’ hands, so Torah guides usÂ—through learning and the performance of the commandmentsÂ—in shaping the world to its fulfillment.<br><br>continued...</div>

For darkness has a purpose, not merely that it should exist to be avoided (should present man with a choice between good and evil), but that it should be transformed into light.<br><br>And if a man should sometimes despair, in the oppressive darkness of a wayward world,14 of making light prevail, let alone of turning the bad itself into good, he is told at the very outset: Â“In (or, for the sake of) the beginning, G-d createdÂ….Â” And the Rabbis translate it as: Â“For the sake of Israel, who are called Â‘the beginning of (G-dÂ’s) produceÂ’, and for the sake of Torah, which is called Â‘the beginning of (G-dÂ’s) way.Â’Â”15<br><br>The world was made so that Israel through Torah should turn it into the everlasting light of G-dÂ’s revealed presence, in the Messianic fulfillment of IsaiahÂ’s words,16 Â“The sun shall no more be your light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give you light: But the L-rd shall be for you a light everlasting.Â”<br><br>(Source: Likkutei Sichot, Vol. X pp. 7-12)<br><br>Adapted by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks; From the teachings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe<br><br>FOOTNOTES<br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'>Angels Watching Over You<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>One of my friends recently took a heart-stopping mission trip to Vietnam. He and two companions set out to smuggle Bibles and money to Christians there. Upon landing, however, he was separated from the other two. He spoke no Vietnamese and had never traveled in Hanoi. Imagine his thoughts, then, as he stood in front of the airport, holding a bag of Bibles, wearing a belt of cash, and knowing nothing more than the name of his hotel.<br><br>Taxi driver after taxi driver offered his services, but he waited and prayed. Finally, knowing he needed to do something, he climbed into a taxi and spoke the name of the hotel. After an hour and a thousand turns, he found himself deposited at the designated place. He paid his drivers, and they went on their way.<br><br>ThatÂ’s right, Â“theyÂ” drove off. The front seat of his taxi had been occupied by two men. Only later did the uniqueness of this fact strike him. He saw hundreds of taxis during his days in Vietnam, but not another one of them had two drivers.<br><br>Angels minister to GodÂ’s people. Â“[God] has put his angels in charge of you to watch over you wherever you goÂ” (Ps. 91:11 NCV).<br><br>Billy Graham reminds us, Â“If you are a believer, expect powerful angels to accompany you in your life experience.Â” But what if you are not a believer? Do angels offer equal surveillance to GodÂ’s enemies? No, they donÂ’t. The promise of angelic protection is limited to those who trust God. Refuse God at the risk of an unguarded back. But receive his lordship, and be assured that many mighty angels will guard you in all your ways.<br><br>God sends his best troops to oversee your life. Imagine the president assigning his Secret Service to protect you, telling his agents to motorcade your car through traffic and safeguard you through crowds. How would you sleep if you knew D.C.Â’s finest guarded your door? How will you sleep knowing heavenÂ’s finest are doing just that? You are not alone. Receive GodÂ’s lordship over your life. HeavenÂ’s many, mighty angels watch over you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Call to Worship<br>Exodus 6:9<br>...but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and ccruel bondage.<br><br>It is very difficult to lead when those you are leading believe they have been mistreated and have lost all hope. Such was the case when God called Moses to bring the people of Israel out of Egypt. They had lived under many years of oppression and slavery. Yet God heard their cry. He sent someone to bring them out of slavery "so that they might worship God" (see Ex. 8:1). Interesting that God didn't say, "to serve Him." Above all else, God desires our worship. A person cannot enter into true worship of God while still in slavery and bondage.<br><br>In Proverbs, the writer tells us that "hope deferred makes the heart sick" (Prov. 13:12a). There is a place in life where life becomes so discouraging and hopeless that we lose all hope, and it can actually make us sick. I have been at this place; it is a scary condition. It brings you to the edge of despair.<br><br>The people would not listen to Moses. Yet God did not deliver immediately. In fact, it would be many plagues later before ultimate deliverance would take place. Why does God withhold deliverance at times? It is in order to bring greater glory from the situation. It isn't because He doesn't care. It is because His plan for mankind is resting in these events. It is a finely tuned plan that involves many people and situations-all operating at the same time. It can seem cruel at times. But God knows that His children cannot worship Him if they are in bondage and lose all hope. He won't allow us to be tempted beyond what we can bear. So He has a plan of deliverance for each of us. This plan is not always the kind of deliverance we might think is best. It sometimes has pain surrounding the deliverance. When a mother gives birth, that child is delivered into this world through much pain. But with that pain comes great joy on the other side. Every mother will say the pain was worth it because of the exceeding joy that child brought in the midst of the pain.<br><br>What are you in bondage to today? What keeps you from entering true worship? Work can keep us in bondage if we fail to enter into freedom in Christ during our workday. Today, ask God to show you the areas of bondage that you are living in so that you may worship Him.<br><br></div>

If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with Me.<br><br>A friend of mine tells the story of an encounter he had with a very important government official-the head of state for a country. In the course of some meetings with my friend, the official came up to him and said, "I perceive that there is a difference between you and me. Is it because I come from a different denomination?" My friend began to explain why there was a difference.<br><br>"If you were to come to my home, I would invite you in as an honored guest. As my guest, you would enjoy everything I had in my home. However, you would still be a guest. You would not have the keys to the home, and your authority in that home would be merely as a guest. However, if I said to you that I am turning over my home to you and you now have the keys to my home, I would be your servant with the responsibility to run the home through your counsel and direction." My friend continued, "This is the difference between you and me. I have given Jesus the keys to my home [heart]. You have merely invited Him in to yours as an honored guest."<br><br>"How can I do this too?" the man replied.<br><br>"All you have to do is invite Him in as the new owner."<br><br>The man did this and is now allowing Jesus to rule and reign in every detail of his life.<br><br>So often many of us enter a relationship with God that brings us salvation. This is the gospel of salvation. But what God really desires for us is to experience the gospel of the Kingdom. He wants us to experience His power and presence every day of our lives and to see His hand at work in us. This only happens when we give Him the key to our life; He must be more than an honored guest.<br><br>Where are you today? Has your life with God been more like an honored-guest relationship, or does He have the key to your life?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Talking Donkey<br>Numbers 22:30<br>The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day?...."<br><br>Most businesspeople I know tend to be task-oriented, motivated visionaries. And they will do just about anything to make their projects successful. This great strength can, if not properly bridled by the Holy Spirit, be a great weakness in their ability to fulfill God's will in their life.<br><br>Sometimes we want something to succeed so much that we fail to listen to that little voice inside trying to warn us by directing us on a different path. Such was the case of Balaam. He started out as a man of God, but then took the path of a "prophet-for-hire." God was not pleased with Balaam's decision to respond to a pagan king's request that he curse Israel. As Balaam rode his donkey to keep his appointment with the king, God sent the angel of the Lord to stand in the way and oppose Balaam. Although Balaam did not see the angel, his donkey did. Three times the donkey turned from the path and three times Balaam beat the animal in anger. Finally, the donkey turned around, and to Balaam's shock and amazement, began to speak to him, admonishing his master for beating him. Imagine a donkey talking to you! He warned Balaam of the angel of death who was standing in the road with a sword drawn, ready to kill Balaam if he continued.<br><br>There are times when pushing harder, trying to manipulate the circumstance, or pressing those around you is not the response to have to the roadblock. God may be trying to have you reconsider your ways. God may be doing one of four things when you are faced with an obstacle: 1) He's blocking it to protect you. 2) His timing to complete this stage is not the same as yours, and He may need you to go through a process of character refinement. 3) He may want other players to get in place, and the circumstances are not yet ready for them to enter. 4) He may be using the process to develop patience in you. Relying on the Holy Spirit to know which one applies to your situation is the key to moving in God's timing.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Triumphant Defeats<br>John 21:14<br>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.<br><br>William Wallace was a Scotsman who sought freedom from a tyrannical king of England in the 1200s. He initially took up this cause in retaliation for his own personal family losses. His cause grew among the people, and it became an insurrection against England. Wallace entreated Robert the Bruce, the future king of Scotland. However, Bruce betrayed Wallace in return for lands from the king of England. Wallace was turned over to the king of England to be tortured to death for crimes against England. Bruce realized his betrayal against Wallace and his own country. This remorse led to real repentance and a return to his commitment to the people of Scotland. He finally took ownership of the mission to free Scotland from England. He led the people of Scotland into subsequent battles against England and freed them. Wallace's defeat ultimately led to victory through Bruce. It took the lives of many, including Wallace, for victory to be accomplished. [James Mackay, William Wallace, Brave Heart (Edinburgh, Scotland: Mainstream Publishing, 1995).]<br><br>So often defeat is what is required before victory can be won. Jesus said that unless the seed dies and goes into the ground it cannot bring forth fruit (see Jn. 12:24). The death of a vision is often required before the fulfillment can really take place. Have you failed at something in your life? Have you not seen the vision fulfilled you thought you were given? The vision may yet happen.<br><br>The disciples thought they suffered their greatest defeat when Jesus died on the cross. However, this defeat became the greatest victory on earth. Christ's death gave liberty. Forgiveness came to all men. New life came forth-new strength for the disciples. Resurrection and new life came as a result of a "defeat."<br><br>"There are triumphant defeats that rival victories" (Montaigne, French philosopher).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Faithfulness to Convict<br>John 16:8<br>When He comes, He will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment.<br><br>I had recently come back from a mountaintop experience. As I attempted to get back into my routine, I found a great cloud of oppression come over me. Each day I attempted to press through it, but with no success. Fear, anxiety, doubt, and unbelief were setting in. I knew I was fretting over my future. I had been in a long period of transition in my business life and was tired of the place of waiting. Yet I didn't understand the oppression. It was definitely spiritual warfare.<br><br>That night I was reading a book regarding our calling from God. The author made mention that we can become envious of others when we get into a place where we are dissatisfied. Suddenly, I realized I was guilty of envying where other businesspeople were in their lives. I was "subconsciously" angry that the calling God had placed on my life had such adversity. I had to repent.<br><br>As if this were not enough, the next day the Holy Spirit confirmed my assessment in the most unusual way. That morning I turned on my computer to read my own Marketplace Meditation that is sent to my computer. The message was on "Envying Others" and included the same Scripture reference as the author's in the book. Imagine God using my own words to convict me of sin! The nerve of Him! To make matters worse, at lunchtime I tuned into the local Christian radio station to hear an interview with the same author as he cited the very passage I had read the day before. I was shocked to realize how the Holy Spirit could be so precise in His ability to convict and give proof of His activity in my life.<br><br>Do you question if the Holy Spirit is active in your life? The Lord has promised that the Holy Spirit will convict us of sin when we move away from Him. It is His responsibility as our guide.<br><br></div>
