            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Inconspicuous Assumption</strong><br>Volume 6 Issue 20<br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>In this week's portion Moshe is charged to prepare every detail of the priesthood for his brother Aharon and his descendants. In intricate detail, the sartorial traits of every one of the priestly vestments are explicated, down to the last intertwined threads.<br><br>And though Moshe is in charge of setting up the administration and establishing the entire order of service while training his brother and nephews, his name is conspicuously missing from this portion.<br><br>Our sages explain the reason for the omission. When Hashem threatened to destroy His nation, Moshe pleaded with Him: "And now if You would but forgive their sin! -- but if not, erase me now from Your book that You have written"(Exodus 32:32) As we all know, Moshe's plea were accepted. The nation was spared. But Moshe was not left unscathed. His request of written eradication was fulfilled in one aspect. He was left out of one portion of the Torah Tezaveh. Thus the words of the tzadik were fulfilled in one aspect. But why this portion?<br><br>Though this English-language publication is not wont to discuss Hebrew etymological derivations, it is noteworthy to mention a thought I once heard in the name of Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef. Moshe's plea "erase me now from Your book," bears an explanation. The word sifr'chah, "your book" can be broken down to two words sefer chaf -- which means the twentieth book. Thus Moshe was removed from this portion of Tezaveh, the twentieth portion of the Torah.<br><br>But why would Moshe intone such omission in this, of all the portions of the Torah? Why not omit his name in the portions that declare the tragic outcome of sin or the calamities of insurrection? Wouldn't that be a better choice for omission? Why did Moshe allude to having his name omitted in the week he charges Aharon with all the honor and glory that is afforded the High Priest?<br><br>Rav Yitzchak Blaser was once seated at a gathering of the most prominent sages of his generation that was held in his city of St. Petersburg.<br><br>Among the Talmudic sages present was Rabbi Yosef Dov HaLevi Soleveitchik of Brisk, world renown for his Talmudic genius. Rabbi Soloveitchik presented a Talmudic question that his young son, Reb Chaim, had asked. After posing the question, a flurry of discussion ensued, each of the rabbis offering his own answer to the riddle, while other rabbis refuted them with powerful rebuttals. During the entire repartee, Rabbi Blaser, who had a reputation as a Talmudic genius, sat silently. He did not offer an answer, nor did he voice approval to any of the answers given by the Rabbis.<br><br>When Rabbi Soleveitchik ultimately offered his son's own solution, Rabbi Blaser sat quietly, neither nodding in approval nor shaking his head in disagreement. It seemed as if he did not comprehend the depth of the insightful discourse. It was as if he was not even there! Bewildered, Reb Yosef Dov began having second thoughts about the renowned Rabbi Blaser. "Was he truly the remarkable scholar that the world had made him out to be?" he wondered.<br><br>Later that evening, Rabbi Soloveitchik was in the main synagogue where he got hold of the book "Pri Yitzchok," a volume filled with Talmudic exegesis authored by none other than Rabbi Blaser himself.<br><br>After leafing through the large volume he saw that the afternoon's entire discourse, his son's question, the offered and reputed responses, and the final resolution, were all part of a dissertation that Rabbi Blaser had himself published years earlier!<br><br>"Now I realize," thought Rabbi Soleveitchik, "Rabbi Blaser is as much a genius in humility as he is in Talmudic law!"<br><br>Our sages tell us that actually Moshe was to have been chosen as the Kohen Gadol in addition to the leader of the Jewish nation. It was his unwavering refusal to accept any of those positions that lost him the opportunity to serve as Kohen Gadol. Instead, Hashem took it from him and gave it to Aharon.<br><br>Many of us would have always harped on the fact. How often do I hear the claims "I got him that job!" "I could have been in his position!" "I started that company! Had I stayed, I would be the one with the stock options!" "That was really my idea!"<br><br>Moshe, too, could have injected himself as the one who propelled and engineered Aharon's thrust to glory -- especially after a seemingly tainting experience with the Golden Calf. In his great humility, Moshe did just the opposite.<br><br>Moshe did not want to diminish Aharon's glory in any way. He wanted the entire spotlight to shine on Aharon and his great service to Klal Yisrael. Therefore, in the portion in which Moshe charges, guides, and directs the entire process of the priesthood, his name is conspicuously omitted.<br><br>One of the greatest attributes of true humility is to let others shine in their own achievement without interfering or announcing your role in their success. The greatest educators, the wisest parents, and most understanding colleagues know when to share the spotlight and when to let another friend, colleague, sibling, or child shine in their success or accomplishment. They know exactly when to be conspicuously or inconspicuously "missing from the book." Good Shabbos Â© 2000 Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Heart before the Force</strong><br>Volume 4 Issue 22<br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>It takes a lot to build a Sanctuary in the desert. And it takes perhaps, even more to adorn the Kohanim (priests) who serve, in beautiful vestments that both symbolize deep spirituality while depicting splendor and glory. You need more than golden threads and fine tapestry. You need more than the ability to weave and design ornate garments. You need devotion, and you need heart. Not ordinary heart. Not the heart that pennant winners have or athletic coaches call for. You need a special type of heart. You need a heart filled with wisdom -- Divine wisdom. That is why Hashem commands Moshe to gather "all the wise-hearted people whom I have invested with a spirit of wisdom" to make the priestly garments (Exodus 28:1).<br><br>But the Torah is unclear. Were these select people Divinely ordained with a spirit of wisdom for this particular mission, or were intrinsic "wise-hearted" people imbued with an extra "spirit of wisdom"?<br><br>If the former is correct, then what did Hashem add? And if all their wisdom was divinely-gifted, then why didn't Hashem simply ask Moshe to "gather all the people in whom I have invested a spirit of wisdom"?<br><br>Rav Sholom Shwadron, the Magid of Jerusalem, of blessed memory, once told a story about the famed Dubno Magid, Rabbi Yaakov Kranz.<br><br>The Dubno Magid once spoke in a town and a few maskilim (members of the enlightenment movement) attended. After the talk one of the cynics, who was totally unaffected by the warm and inspiring message, approached the famed Magid. "The sages tell us," began the skeptic, "'that words from the heart, penetrate the heart.' Rabbi," he snickered, "I assume that you spoke from your heart. Your words, however, have had no impact on me whatsoever! How can that be? Why didn't your words penetrate my heart?"<br><br>Rabbi Kranz smiled. In his usual fashion, he began with a parable. "A simpleton once went by the workplace of a blacksmith, who was holding a large bellows. After a few squeezes, the flames of the smith's fire danced with a rage. The man, who always found it difficult to start a fire in his own fireplace, marveled at the contraption. He immediately went and purchased the amazing invention. Entering his home, he smugly announced, "I just discovered how to make a raging fire with the simple squeeze of a lever!"<br><br>He set a few logs in the cold fireplace and began to push the two ends of the bellows together. Nothing happened. The logs lay cold and lifeless. Embarrassed, the man returned to the blacksmith and explained his predicament. "I want a refund!" he shouted. This blower doesn't work!"<br><br>"You yokel," laughed the experienced blacksmith. "You were blowing on cold logs! You must start a small fire on your own! If you don't start with a spark, a fire will never erupt!"<br><br>The Magid turned toward the maskil and sadly shook his head sadly. "If there is no spark, the largest bellows will not make a fire."<br><br>In telling Moshe whom to choose for the sacred task of designing the Mishkan, the Torah tells us how G-d invests. He wants people that were imbued with a ruach chachmah - a sprirt of wisdom. But he prefaces the statement by telling us how one receives spiritual wisdom. The gift of spiritual wisdom does not go to just anyone. Hashem looks for those who have wisdom of heart. Those who understand what it means to be kind, compassionate, and loyal. Those who have the devotion to His will and the desire for more enlightenment get His ordination. The people who were imbued with Hashem's Divine spirit previously had a spark. And from that spark grew a force - a Divine force - that propelled wise hearts into a Divine spirit of wisdom.<br><br>Hashem tells us that we must begin the process on our own. If we supply the heart, He will supply the power to have deep, spiritual, even holy insight. He will supply the force. We must make sure, however, that we put the heart before the force.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CASE CLOTHED<br>Volume 3 Issue 20<br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>"Clothes," they say, "make the man." But did you ever wonder about the man who makes the clothes?<br><br>This week's portion discusses the priestly vestments worn by both the common kohen (priest) and the Kohen Gadol (High Priest). The common kohen wore four garments while the High Priest wore eight.<br><br>The garments of the High Priest were ornate and complex. They needed highly skilled artisans to embroider and fashion them. They included, among others, a jewel-studded breastplate, a honeycomb-woven tunic, an apron-like garment and a specially designed garment that was adorned with gold bells and woven pomegranates.<br><br>To weave these garments was quite a complex task, and Moshe had to direct the craftsmen with the particulars of the difficult sartorial laws. Yet when Hashem charges Moshe He described the function of the garments much differently then He did in telling Moshe to command the tailors.<br><br>Moshe himself was told by Hashem that the objective of the garments was for glory and splendor -- surely wonderful, but very physical attributes. Yet when he is told to command the artisans, the message he is told to impart was quite different. "You shall speak to the wise-hearted people whom I have invested with a spirit of wisdom, as they shall make holy vestments to sanctify and minister for me." (Exodus 28:1-3) "The clothes," Moshe tells the tailors, "were not meant for glory or splendor; they were to sanctify and to minister." Why the change in stated purpose?<br><br>A Long Island rabbi attended a taharah (ritual ceremony to prepare a deceased Jew for burial) for an individual whose background was rooted in a Chasidic community. Chevra Kadishas (burial societies) are often immune to the emotions, trauma and dread that would normally accompany a dead soul on a table.<br><br>The Chevra did their job almost perfunctorily, with hardly a word spoken, and that did not strike the rabbi as strange. Years of working with cadavers can numb the senses of even the toughest men. All of a sudden, a murmur bounced back and forth between Chasidic members of the Chevra. "Er hut a visa? (He has a visa?)" they queried. Then the conversation took a stranger turn. They began to mumble about a first class ticket.<br><br>The rabbi became concerned. Why was anyone talking about travel plans during this most sacred of rituals? That was not the time nor place. It just did not make sense.<br><br>Immediately the room became silent, it was now filled with awe and a sense of reverence. "Er hut a visa!" exclaimed the senior member of the group. The entire Chevra nodded and the atmosphere suddenly transformed.<br><br>They continued to prepare for the funeral as if the deceased had been a great sage or Chasidic Rebbe. The rabbi was unable to understand the sudden change in atmosphere until the eldest man beckoned him. "Come here," he said. "I'll show you something. The old man lifted the arm of the deceased to reveal seven numbers crudely tattooed on the dead man's forearm. "Do you know what they are?"<br><br>"Of course," replied the Rabbi. "They are the numbers that the Nazi's tattooed on every prisoner in the concentration camps."<br><br>"No," the old man said. "These numbers are the first-class ticket to Gan Eden. They are the visa and they are the tickets. Period."<br><br>The badges we wear have different meanings to every individual. Moshe, the man of G-d who saw the world with a profound vision of spirituality, was told about the more mundane aspect of the priestly garments. "They are for glory and honor." But he is told to charge the artisans, who often see only the splendor and glory of the corporeal world, with the true purpose of the garments -- "to sanctify and minister."<br><br>Often we see numbers, events, and even garments as the mere manifestation of natural events whose memories impart us with only of a sense of awe for the history or beauty within. Sometimes we mortals must be reminded of a sense even greater than glory and splendor -- ministration and sanctification of G-d's name.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bell Bottoms<br>Volume 2 Issue 20<br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>This week the Kohen Gadol (High Priest) is commanded in sartorial law. The Torah instructs the creation of eight intricate garments that must be worn at all times by Ahron. Each vestment functions on a specific spiritual level. One, however, seems to also have a mundane raison dÃªtre.<br><br>The Torah instructs the Kohen Gadol to wear a Me'il , a four cornered blue-wool garment worn like a sandwich-sign. The hem of this majestic robe was adorned with an alternating array of 72 functioning gold bells and small pomegranates. Unlike most of the vestments, where the Torah just commands what to sew, the Torah explains the purpose of the Me'il. Exodus 28:34 "Its sound (i.e., the bells) shall be heard upon entering the Sanctuary before Hashem." The Torah continues to tell us that if the Kohen Gadol dares enter the sanctuary without that bell adorned garment, he is subject to a decree of untimely death.<br><br>It is nearly impossible to fathom divine reasoning for each vestment. The written Torah does not give an explicit explanation as to why the Kohen must wear the belts, tunics, and turbans. Yet when it tells us about the bells at the bottom of the Me'il it justifies their existence with a very mundane reason. "Its sound shall be heard upon entering the Sanctuary before Hashem." Our sages explain that the Torah is teaching a moral lesson: one should announce himself before entering any room.<br><br>I am amazed. Does Hashem, who knows every mortal's move, have a "knock before entering" sign on the doorway of His sanctuary? Why, of all places, is this the place to teach etiquette? Couldn't the Torah have found more mundane whereabouts to direct the people about proper behavior upon entering a room?<br><br>The young widow who entered Reb Shlomo Zalman's* study was obviously distraught. In addition to the loneliness and pain she experienced, a sense of urgency was about her. She had recurring pangs of guilt. She wanted to do something spiritual to memorialize her dear husband. Perhaps she should establish a free loan fund or contribute books to the Yeshiva library. Or perhaps there was an act of spiritual self-improvement that she should perform.<br><br>Reb Shlomo Zalman waited till she finished and then instructed her to listen to his advice very carefully. "I understand your need to do something spiritual as a tikkun (uplift) for your husband's soul. This is my advice to you. Go out and buy some toys for your children, take them to the park and enjoy life with them. Forget the quest for the great spiritual tikkun and help your children rejoice in life. That will bring the greatest tikkun for your husband."<br><br>The Kohen's bells teach us all a great lesson. Upon entering the Holy of Holies, the Kohen's thoughts may become so focused on attaining the high level of spirituality that he may forget simple courtesy. He may forget to knock before entering.The Torah tells us that the search for spirituality can never supersede simple etiquette. We often have dreams and lofty spiritual goals. How many toes do we step upon to achieve them? How many doors do we burst through to prescribe our morals to inattentive ears?<br><br>This week the Torah tells us that even the High Priest -- the holiest of mortals -- as he converges on the Kodesh HaKodoshim -- the holiest of places -- in the quest to perform the most spiritual of Judaic rites -- must remember one simple thing. It is the same thing that the poor farmer must remember before trudging into his home: basic courtesy. Don't forget to knock. And the foremost place to teach us that lesson is the Holy of Holies. Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Await the Dawn<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>To Him Who grants victory, upon the strengthening of the power of dayÂ’s dawning. (Tehillim 22:1)<br><br>Why is Esther compared to the darkness before the dawn? It is meant to teach us that just as darkness is at the end of the night, so Esther is the end of all miracles. (Tractate Yoma 29A)<br><br>What does it mean that Â“Esther," the Megilllas Esther, is the last of all miracles?<br><br>Jewish National History begins with earth shattering sea splitting episodes. So Pesach and Shevuos walk us yearly through those very same larger than life footsteps. Those were awesome and overpowering demonstrations of power and presence. No one, except Amalek, could have denied the historicity or the significance of those events. Most of the world borrows its religious validation from those overwhelmingly miraculous times. ThatÂ’s how our history and the calendar year begin. ThatÂ’s not how it ends.<br><br>WeÂ’re getting directions now on how to get to a certain important destination. The first marking is a huge highway sign followed by, letÂ’s say, 49 lights and then another huge traffic sign -bigger and brighter than has ever been seen. Then the road twists and turns for a good while until another huge sign or two that prepare us for a U-turn near a small hut, not a Pizza Hut. And then thereÂ’s a straight dark road and eight little lights. Now the signs start to get a little more subtle: Look for odd clusters and unusual sequences of events that together signal the end of the journey is yet nearing.<br><br>Megillas Esther is not just a historical record. It is rather a window into the world, a pair of glasses, 3D glasses that allow us to see with extra depth the signs along that long and dark final stretch of our history. Nothing is overtly miraculous. Only the irreducibly complex patterns of events alert us to what seems like a cleverly imbedded signature or wink - we think.<br><br>A few months ago we went to my motherÂ’s house for Shabbos for a special occasion. After Shabbos and some cleaning up someone had an idea that we watch one of our oldie family movies. The one on the top of the stack that was ready to go was our wedding video from almost 22 years ago which we rarely get a chance to view. As we watched the parade of people comments flowed on how young or different this one looked and how many are not in this world.<br><br>By the Chupah one after another of our Rabbis could be seen with much darker beards making those seven blessings. One person my mother did not recognize. She asked. Â“Who is that?Â” I told her that that was Reb Getzel my Rebbe at that time. My wife asked, Â“Whatever happened to him? I havenÂ’t heard anything about him since then.Â” I told her that I think he went to Cleveland and I also have not heard from him or about him for almost 22 years.Â”<br><br>Later that night, back home in Monsey, my cell phone rings. I did not recognize the number on the called ID. I risked taking the call. Â“Hello Reb Label, Getzel Â….here!Â” I was in shock. It was that Rebbe. He told me in his usually excited tone that he was on his way back to Cleveland after an inspiring Shabbos in Philadelphia. After one of his lectures a young man approached him to ask a few pointed questions. He asked the fellow what his name was. He said, Â“Lam.Â” He asked where he came from. The young man told him, Â“MonseyÂ”. He said, Â“I taught a Lam in Monsey 22 years ago- a Label Lam!Â” Â“ThatÂ’s my father!Â” He answered. He told me that he was so impressed by and excited to meet my son that he asked him for my number and amazingly he made the call that very night.<br><br>Nothing miraculous happened here, just a something extremely improbable. Nothing overtly miraculous happened in the Megilla of Esther either. What does it all mean? I donÂ’t know! Perhaps itÂ’s just means that we are not alone, not so lost, and we should await the dawn.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of Mice Traps and Men<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>One who reads the Megillah out of sequence has not fulfilled his obligation. (Megillah 17A)<br><br>The Sefas Emes asks, Â“Why is Â“PurimÂ” not called Â“PurÂ”?Â” Why is it called plural - Purim for lots and not lot in the singular since Haman is described as having cast a Â“purÂ” to reckon the most favorable day to attack the Jews?<br><br>Michael Behe introduces in his book Â“DarwinÂ’s Black BoxÂ” the concept of Â“irreducible complexityÂ”. The explanation is as follows. Take for example a simple mouse trap. It has a number of functional parts that make it a mouse trap. Any component piece of the trap is useless and meaningless without the other small number parts. It could never have evolved gradually. Of what use would a spring be without cheese for bait or a board for it to slam its gait upon. The unadorned mouse trap needs all the parts present to be functional. The parts of it would have to have been created with the finished end in mind.<br><br>Similarly, a snake with poisonous venom would needs a hypodermic needle for a tooth to inject its pay load. Of what use would the tooth be without the poison and why would the creature need such a potent poison to kill a horse in seconds if it was lacking the sophisticated delivery system?<br><br>One of the keys to understanding the Megillah lies in appreciating how a sequence of seemingly simple events form an organized chain- with an eerily predetermined result. In the end, it can be observed how the aggregate is Â“irreducibly complexÂ”. Minus any small piece in the puzzle and history would have looked so much different. If the King would have taken a sleeping pill instead of reading from a book of remembrances, had Esther not found grace in the eyes of the king, had the king not sent out his first foolish decree, had the king not relocated his capital in Shushan where Mordachai was quietly minding his own business before destiny backed up to his doorstep, then things would have turned out much different and the world would be unrecognizably different.<br><br>There is a growing paradigm in science that may help explain what is so deficient about reading or hearing the Megillah out of order. Surprisingly it is called, Â“Chaos TheoryÂ”. It does not aim to demonstrate that things are random and meaningless. Quite the contrary, it postulates the notion that all matters of seeming wild randomness display surprisingly complex and beautiful order. Even the way cigarette smoke dissipates throughout a room leaves a delicate trail of artistry. One of the proponents of this theory, Joseph Ford, refuted EinsteinÂ’s statement, Â“G-d doesnÂ’t play dice with the universe!Â” He says, Â“Yes, G-d does play dice, but the dice are loaded.Â”<br><br>In the end HamanÂ’s toss of the Â“purÂ” happened within a grander context of a more profound Â“purÂ” Â–or lot for the Jews. Haman not only could not derail the Divine scheme of things but perversely he furthered and promoted it in the most profound way. Our sages tell us that more than all the words of all the prophets were effective in returning the Jews to G-d; Haman was the catalyst to accomplish this when he received the royal signet ring of the king. His ultimatum resulted in the opposite of what he intended with his Â“purÂ”. Why? Because another Â“purÂ” dominates incorporating and adjusting to all the smaller Machiavellian moves making rather a prefect sense of this nice game of dice - a grand Purim play of mice-traps and men.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Major Player<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br><br>Why did Esther invite Haman, of all people to dine with her and King Achashverosh at the party? Here she had one silver bullet to save the entire Jewish People. She had risked her life to approach the king. The entire Jewish Nation had been fasting on her behalf for three days. Then she invited Haman the wicked oppressor of the Jews as the chaperone to her party? Would you or I have done such a thing?<br><br>Amongst the many reasons the Talmud tells us she had in mind is so Â“the Jewish People should not say that we have a daughter in the house of the king and their minds will become diverted from seeking mercy!Â” What does this mean?<br><br>We learn about the original battle with Amalek that when MosheÂ’s hands were raised that they were effective in their war efforts. However, when MosheÂ’s hands were down, then the battle with Amalek began to fail. The Mishne in Rosh HaShana asks if we are to believe that the hands of Moshe were the determining factor in success or failure? No! When MosheÂ’s hands were raised, though, the eyes of the Jewish People were vaulted to the heavens and their swords became disproportionately more powerful. When his hands were down then each was left to the limited power their sword alone and they began to falter.<br><br>Esther was concerned lest the people who had fasted so long on her behalf rely upon her. When they would get word that she had successfully reached the King, they might become prematurely jubilant. She understood that she had only been able to pass that giant hurdle because she was representing the fervent hopes of an entire nation. As an individual and under normal circumstances she should have been rejected entirely if not executed. Now she appeared in a weakened state after having fasted for three days herself. For sure she must have been having a bad a hair day and still she outshone all the wannobees. Miraculously she found grace in the eyes of the King.<br><br>This could only have happened in the merit of all that prayer. The greatest danger now would be if she would be abandoned, to be alone without her peopleÂ’s prayer. She would be as ineffective as one of those swords with the hands of Moshe down. What would prop up the hands of Moshe now?<br><br>She therefore sought to portray herself as having betrayed them in the end. When they would perceive that she was consulting with Haman they would assume that sheÂ’s cutting a deal to save herself. Then the desperation of their outcry would grant the final burst of heavenly energy necessary to vanquish the beast.<br><br>The Chovos Levavos states in his introduction to the Gates of Trust a three part principle that may help crystallize the dynamic at play here. 1) It is impossible for a person to be free from worry unless he or she relies on HASHEM because 2) Someone who does not rely on HASHEM is by definition relying on something or someone else and 3) HASHEM leaves the person in the hands of that on which they are relying.<br><br>What does it mean to rely on something? DidnÂ’t the Jewish people use real swords versus Amalek? DidnÂ’t they send Esther to do their bidding? Perhaps we can draw a standard from the laws of prayer where we are told that one should not lean on anything when praying, not even a lectern. What is considered leaning on something? One should estimate if that thing would suddenly be removed, would he become destabilized?<br><br>Esther understood that if they would lean upon her too heavily then, since we are left in the hands of whatever we trust, she was fearful not to spare her reputation but rather her nation. A sword alone is just a sword, and even the most articulate lobbyist may be just another solo voice ignored. However, with the prayers of a nation blowing wind in her sails, a delicate agent may yet become a major player<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br>We DonÂ’t Know!<br><br>After these things King Achashveros promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and he set his seat above all the officers who were with him. All the KingÂ’s servants at the KingÂ’s gate would bow down and prostrate themselves before Haman, for this is what the King had commanded concerning him, but Mordechai would not bow down nor prostrate himself. So the KingÂ’s servants at the KingÂ’s gate said to Mordechai, Â“Why do you disobey the KingÂ’s command?Â” Finally, when they said this to him day after day and he did not heed them, they told Haman to see whether MordechaiÂ’s words would avail; because he told them that he was a Jew (Yehudi). When aman Haman<br><br>Haman himself saw that Mordechai did not bow down and prostrate himself before him then Haman was filled with rage. However it seemed contemptible to him to lay hands on Mordechai alone, for they had made known to him the people of Mordechai. So Haman sought to destroy all the Jews (Yehudim) who were throughout the kingdom of Achashveros the people of Mordechai. (Megillas Esther 3: 1-6)<br><br>Anyone who denies the validity of idolatry is called a (Jew) Yehudi. (Talmud Megilla)<br><br>Any matter which appears to man as a controlling factor independent of G- dÂ’s will and able to do good or evil is included in idolatry (Talmud Sanhedrin)<br><br>ItÂ’s amazing to consider that Mordechai is the hero and all-time protagonist of the Purim story. Just as Esther is the probably the most famous lady to be emulated by the little girls, so Mordechai is still the most popular costume for many a Jewish boy on Purim. Why is it amazing?<br><br>Picture this! A certain person is pictured on the front page of all the local newspapers receiving the key to the city by the mayor. He is being touted as a hero. The by-line tells of the heroism he displayed by jumping into icy waters to save a fellow citizen who found himself in one instant fallen off the deck of the Circle Line cruise. When we read the story inside on page 3 we find out that the alleged hero was the one who pushed the man off the boat in the first place. How can we be blind to the first part of the story and declare than man a hero?<br><br>It looks like Mordechai instigated Haman. On the surface he seems to have caused the problem he was later to solve. Why does he remain the hero? Perhaps he could have made himself absent or invisible when Haman passed by. Why did he have to confront him and inspire his rage?<br><br>Mordechai made a well calculated risk here. What was there to lose? Haman was from the seed of Amalek that carried on through King Agag that Shaul faltered in executing. The children of Israel have an old track record with Amalek. When one is up the other is down. Amalek attacked by Refidim when the question was asked, Â“Is HASHEM within our midst or not?Â” Then Amalek came, at the moment of weakness. When Jewish belief is high as the hands of Moses are raised Amalek is being vanquished. When we are spiritually weak the forces of Amalek feed on our doubts and gain increasing strength.<br><br>If Haman is nothing more than a lucky politician with a last name like Â“AgagÂ” then Mordechai would be risking not more than his own life by standing in open defiance. However, Haman was not satisfied to go against Mordechai alone. He saw not only that Mordechai did not bow down but that he would never bow down. As a Yehudi he stands forever ideologically opposed.<br><br>The Jew understands, Â“ThereÂ’s nothing other than HASHEMÂ”. The universe is densely packed with meaning. Haman believes that the world is a random place where the roll of dice might determine a nationÂ’s fate. In the end HamanÂ’s hatred unified the Jewish people at the core and perversely he was the catalyst of our dramatic change of heart.<br><br>Who then was the real hero of the story? With a few extra sips of wine on Purim we may be fit to submit that thereÂ’s so much more going on that we donÂ’t know!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Purim<br><br>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br>In addition to the four Mitzvos (commandments) which we practice on Purim *(see below), there is one other idea which was written in the Book of Esther to be followed for generations. That is the "words of the fasts and their outcries (Esther 9:31)." This refers to the three days of fasting and prayer which the Jews did before Esther entered the king's inner chambers without permission. Why is this something so important for all generations? It is meant to teach us the perspective we should have about troubles, and praying for relief from them.<br><br>When Haman decreed that all Jews in the kingdom should be killed, and the written decree went out, it states in the Book of Esther "and Mordechai knew all that had occurred (Esther 4:1)." This means he understood for what purpose the decree had occurred. In Tractate Megillah one of the reasons given for the decree that the Jews should be killed is that they took part in the feast which King Achashverosh made. This great feast celebrated the passing of the seventy years prophesied that would end the exile and mark the rebuilding of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. Many Jews had a desire to assimilate, and hence distance themselves from G-d. As a reaction to this G-d brought them a trouble meant to bring them closer. Mordechai understood this and acted accordingly.<br><br>"And he (Mordechai) donned sackcloth and ashes and he went out into the middle of the city and cried a great and bitter outcry (Esther:4:1)." This was Mordechai's initial reaction to the decree. Prayer. He understood that the decree was in order to bring the Jews closer, and so prayer was the first step in achieving that goal. Normally, the first step would be to work on the political level, and then to pray that their efforts would succeed. Here Mordechai knew that prayer was the first reaction since the whole trouble was to bring the Jews back to their closeness to G-d.<br><br>It's interesting to note that all of Mordechai's communications with Esther were through a messenger who went between them (Esther 4:4-16). One would think that at such a crucial time when the lives of so many people were threatened, that Mordechai would want to speak face to face with Esther. She even sent him clothing to replace his sackcloth so he would come and speak to her in person, but he refused. Why? Again, because being that the trouble was sent as a vehicle to bring the Jews closer to G-d through prayer, even one minute of prayer was not worth wasting, even to go speak to the wife of the King.<br><br>Even at the very end when it was obvious that Haman, the instigator of the evil decree, was on his way down, and that the decree would be averted, Mordechai did not behave any differently. Haman is ordered to lead a royal horse with Mordechai on it dressed in royal robes and a royal crown (Esther 6:10). Even Zeresh, Haman's wife, and his close friends subsequently see in this event that it marks his imminent downfall (Esther 6:13). Still, Mordechai doesn't stop for one minute. "He got off the horse, and immediately put on his sackcloth and returned to his place to pray."<br><br>Our lesson from this is that troubles are not just a good reason to pray, and prayer is not just a vehicle to bring about relief from troubles. Rather, prayer is a reason why G-d brings about the troubles which stir a person to come closer to Him. That is why Mordechai continued to pray after he saw Haman's downfall as imminent.<br><br>May we all be blessed with a truly happy Purim, and through the lessons of the Purim Story may we all experience what is stated in the passage in the Book of Esther, "And the the Jews had light and happiness, joy and honor (Esther 8:16)."<br><br>*The four Mitzvos (commandments) of Purim<br><br>Hearing the reading of the Book of Esther.<br>Giving monetary gifts to the poor.<br>Giving two prepared food gifts to at least one other person.<br>Eating a festive Purim meal.<br>Good Shabbos.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Purim<br><br>by Guest Contributer: Yosey Goldstein<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Rabbi Shimon Ben Lakish said: It was obvious and clearly known to the creator of the universe that Haman would weigh coins (To kill) the Jews. Therefore, he had their (The Jews) coins precede his coins, and that is what the Mishna, Tannaic Passage says: "On the First day of Adar we make the announcements about the giving of the yearly Shekolim/ coins to pay for the communal sacrifices in the Bais Hamikdosh (Holy Temple) (Talmud, Tractate Meggiloh 13b).<br><br>Tosefos (one of the early commentators) says that the 10,000 Kikar (A specific measure) of silver offered was the same amount of silver the Jews donated for the adanim, the sockets for below the planks making up the walls in the Mishkon/Tabernacle which the Jews erected in the desert. (Meggilah 16a)<br><br>It seems that Haman's action of offering 10,000 Kikar of silver to King Acashverosh had an spiritual effect that "demanded" an action by the Jews to counteract. It required a donation of the Jews, Hundreds of year earlier, in the desert. to merit not being annihilated. (As Tosefos points out) It also required the yearly donation to the Bais Hamikdosh to counteract that action. The question is: Why is G-d worried about Haman giving this money to Achashverosh? What difference does this make?<br><br>Reb Sholom Schvadron said the following answer, in the name of his Rebbi, his teacher. The Medrash in Parshas Terumah tells us that Haman's entire fortune consisted of 10,000 Kikar of silver. This means that he was so dedicated to the cause of Killing the Jewish nation that he was willing to give up everything he owned to succeed at his task. Such dedication, the desire to succeed at all costs even to the cost of one's entire being and life is called Mesiras Nefesh. Mesiras Nefesh must be answered. The Satan (the adversary, a spiritual entity) himself approaches G-d and says "Haman is willing to give up everything" to destroy the Jews. What are the Jews willing to give up for G-d?" G-d must answer the demand of the Satan and he says, "My Children are willing to give up for me. In fact they have given me back in the desert, the silver sockets for Mishkon, the Tabernacle. They give me one half Shekel every single Adar" That is what G-d answers the Satan.<br><br>There are several questions concerning this thought. First of all, what difference does it make that Haman was dedicated? Why does that have an effect in heaven? The second problem is Why did G-d choose the commandment of the Machatzis hashekel, the giving of one half a shekel per person, to counteract Haman? Why not point out the donations to build the *entire* Mishkon which was certainly a greater amount donated than one half a shekel per person? Let us just compare what Haman was willing to give up to what the Jews gave up and give up yearly. Haman was willing to give up everything to kill the Jews. That shows a dedication, a zeal and a passion for his cause. The Jews, on the other hand gave no more than one half a Shekel for this Mitzvah. Why is that the response to the zeal and Mesiras Nefesh shown by Haman? One more question. Obviously Haman was dedicated to his cause, but his cause was evil. Why should his dedication mean anything to G-d?<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PURIM part2<br><br>To understand the answer to the first question we should preface that the rules of nature apply in the spiritual realm. Just as what goes up must come down, every action has an equal reaction etc., so too there are rules in the spiritual realm. One of these rules is: When one is totally dedicated to a cause, he automatically receives Seyata Dishmaya or heavenly assistance to succeed. That is why once Haman showed his commitment and his zeal with the willingness to do anything to destroy Jews, G-d had to answer the Satan with a show of Mesiras Nefesh, a show of complete dedication on the part of the Jews. That was shown by the willingness of the Jews to give the Machatzis Hashekel. (As we will explain G-d Willing very soon).<br><br>Rabbi Chaim Shmuelevitz ZT"L used this same line of reasoning to explain a Posuk (passage) in Parshas Balak. The Posuk says, "Bilaam awoke early in the morning and he saddled his donkey." Rashi quotes the Medrash that says; "G-d says: "You got up early to destroy the Jews. You will not succeed because their Father Abraham has already done this before you." As the posuk states; "And Abraham got up early in the morning and he saddled his donkey" (This was the story of the Akeidah, when Abraham was going to offer his son Yitzchok up as a sacrifice). Reb Chaim asks the same question we asked earlier; Why does the action of Billaam waking up early to saddle his donkey require G-d to respond with "Abraham their father has done this already"? What is so special with Billaam saddling his donkey? The answer he gives is because Bilaam was very aware of his own importance. Everything he did was only to further his own honor and stature in the world. Still, he was willing to forgo his honor and personally saddle his donkey so as to be able to curse the Jews and cause their annihilation. Therefore that dedication would demand that he be the recipient of heavenly assistance and success. Therefore G-d said, Abraham has already shown his dedication to me. He was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, literally, and sacrifice his son. Therefore, his children are worthy of being saved because of his dedication.<br><br>It is interesting to note that Rabbi Shimon Schwab in his Sefer (book) usesa very similar explanation. In the same story about Billaam, Bilaam in a dream asks G-d permission to go with the second group of messengers of Balak. G-d tells him, if they are coming to hire you and you will receive a reward for this, then go with them (Bamidbar 22:20 see Rashi). Rabbi Scwab Z"L asks why did G-d give him permission only if he would get paid? The answer is, says Rabbi Schwab, Because then his dedication to the cause in not pure. His dedication comes from a desire to be compensated. If his dedication to the cause is anything less than pure, then he will not be deserving of heavenly assistance. He is doomed to failure. If he wants to go, no harm will befall the Jews, and G-d Himself is willing to allow him to go.<br><br>This answered why there was need to counteract the dedication of Haman, but the other questions still need answering. Why rely on the Half a shekel instead of the donations for the entire tabernacle, and how can the giving of one half a shekel show a dedication equivalent or better than the giving of 10,000 kikar of silver.<br><br>We can understand the answer using the following rule. The Talmud in Tractate Kiddushin tells us that one who is commanded to do a Mitzvah, a commandment from G-d is greater than one who is not commanded to do the Mitzvah but does it anyway. On the surface one would think the opposite is true. One who is not obligated to do a mitzvah and does it anyway, shows a greater love for G-d by doing the Mitzvah than one who is obligated to perform the Mitzvah. The Talmud is telling us that this is not so. Tosefos explains the reason for this. When a person is obligated to do something, the Yetzer Horah, the evil inclination, tries desperately to dissuade the person from doing the mitzvah. However, when a person does a mitzvah without being obligated to do so, he has very little standing in his way. After all, he wants to do this because he thinks it's right. He is doing what he desires. (Remember back to when you were a child and you were tired? As soon as your parents said "Time for bed" You suddenly had a burst of energy and had no desire at all to go to sleep.)<br><br>continued...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>PURIM part3<br><br>Knowing this, the answer is simple. Haman was dedicated to his cause. He was willing to give up everything to get what *he* wanted. To counteract this action G-d needed to show that the Jews could also perform an act that was equally meaningful and equally "powerful". That act was the giving of one half a shekel. The act of being told, "You must give one half a shekel. No more and no less" This action was one that showed dedication to G-d and his Mitzvos. The will power needed to overcome one's natural inclination not to want to give what one is obligated to give, is more difficult that giving up 10,000 Kikar of silver.<br><br>This concept is also apparent in the Talmud in Tractate Shabbos. The Mishna (Shabbos 9b) lists many activities that one may not do prior to MIncha time, the time for the afternoon prayers. One of the forbidden activities is to sit down to a meal. Nevertheless, the Talmud says that if one started a meal, then one does not have to stop the meal right away, for mincha. (He may continue until closer to the time for Mincha). The Talmud asks what act determines the beginning of the meal? The Talmud answers, when one removes his belt to begin eating. (They used to tie their robes around them with a belt. Prior to eating they used to remove the belt to be more comfortable when eating). The Talmud responds by asking, What is the big deal to put the belt back on? Besides, let him pray without a belt. The Talmud answers, He can not pray with out a belt since the Posuk says, "Prepare yourself to greet your G-d." Tosefos (10a) Says that the Talmud only answered the second question and did not bother with the first question. Reb Yisroel Salanter answers, that by answering the second question no answer was needed for the first question. Once the Talmud explained and proved that one was not allowed to pray without putting on the belt, then the question of, "What is the big deal to put on a belt?" is not a question. Once a person is required to put on his belt then it IS a big deal to put it back on.<br><br>Now everything makes perfect sense. In anticipation of Haman's dedication to the cause of annihilating the Jews, G-d in his mercy gave us the Mitzvah of Machatzis Hashekel, from the times of the Mishkon in the desert. This allowed us to demonstrate our dedication to him by giving the half a shekel to the Miskon. By serving G-d, we show our dedication. By overcoming our own natural instincts, and accepting G-d's will upon ourselves we show the greatest Mesirras nefesh, the greatest dedication to G-D and his will.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE VALUE OF SACRIFICE</strong><br><br>Shabbat shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>Â“Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of Elohim, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to Elohim, which is your spiritual service of worship.Â” Romans 12:1<br><br>One of the very important values that are being restored in this End Time Move of Restoration- is the value of SACRIFICE. In Hebrew the word sacrifice is the word KORBAN. Korban comes from the Hebrew word KAROV which means Â– TO COME NEAR. Indeed SACRIFICE causes us to come near to Elohim. In the ancient times, when the Holy Temple was still in Jerusalem on Temple Mount that is Mount Moriah, there were constant animal sacrifices that were prescribed by Yahveh in order to bring Â“nearnessÂ” between Israel and her God. 2000 years ago YÂ’shua HaMashiach, the Son of Elohim gave Himself as a SACRIFICE, a KORBAN, in order to bring us near to His Father and now our Father in Heaven. Until then the Gentiles had no access to this nearness! The KORBAN of YÂ’shua, His sinless blood spilt on Golgotha in Jerusalem, has purchased back for Him ALL AUTHORITY in Heaven and on EARTH! This astounding authority He has given FREELY to us who believe in Him and who have FULLY received the BENEFITS of His Korban! There is NOTHING to add to what He did, His sacrifice is a perfect one and it is for all generations. Nevertheless there is something to emulate, something to IMITATE!<br><br>Â“Let this mind be in you which was also in Messiah Yeshua, who, being in the form of Elohim, did not consider it robbery to be equal with Elohim, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men.  And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.  Therefore Elohim  also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of YESHUA every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,  and that every tongue should confess that Yeshua Messiah  is Lord, to the glory of Elohim the FatherÂ” Philippians 2:5-11<br><br>The above scriptures are calling us all to have the same Â“sacrificial mindÂ” that Messiah has. He was willing to sacrifice it ALL for the Call of Yahveh for His life. This mind won him FULL AUTHORITY and FULL RECOGNITION. We are called to walk in full authority because of what He did and because we ALSO follow in His footsteps. There is a direct co relation between a Â“sacrificial lifestyleÂ” and AUTHORITY, POWER and INFLUENCE.<br><br>Notice that there is a BIG difference between being a Â“Poor VictimÂ” and being a Â“Holy Living SacrificeÂ”. The Â“poor victimÂ” mentality is always sorry for himself/herself, and bitter against people and circumstances, while the sacrificial person is always FULL of faith and forgiveness. Â“VictimsÂ” are very selfish people, while Sacrificial people are selfless and they are motivated by someone Higher than themselves.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People that do not care to spend their lives for a lofty cause, never amount to anything, and for the most part, we never hear about them again. After they die, their name and life dies with them. That is called a Â“mediocreÂ” and Â“lukewarmÂ” lifestyle. A life that is concentrated only on one self and on making a living and getting by, a life that Â“ruffles no feathersÂ”. We, who belong to the Highest Sacrifice in the history of the world, are called to walk just like Him. We are called to inherit and walk in the Blessing of Abraham,<br><br>Â“And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great; and so you shall be a blessing;Â” Genesis 12:2<br><br>Abraham both sacrificed to Yahveh and became a Living Sacrifice himself! He had to sacrifice all that he had, all that he was and all of his family relationships and inheritance, never to see them again! He had to come to the Land of Canaan to live among hostile people that did not fear YAH, to live among strangers as a nomad. He even had to be willing to sacrifice Isaac on the altar to demonstrate his love for Yahveh! When we talk about the FAITH of Abraham, we cannot separate his faith from his actions and his sacrifice. True faith will cause you to SACRIFICE everything for The Cause! Eventually the sacrifice will PAY and will PAY WELL. Authority, Power and Influence is the payment for those that lay down their lives for the cause of Messiah; not only in this life but also in the life to come.<br><br>Â“And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to Elohim must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.Â”  Hebrews 11:6<br><br>The reason why we very seldom meet people that carry the true weight of SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY is because in the 21st Century it is not popular to live a life of sacrifice and dedication; at least not in most of the Western world. Unfortunately, the Â“Western Â“ValuesÂ”Â” of a selfish, individualistic lifestyle are being adopted by the rest of the world as well.  So the whole value of sacrifice is almost lost to most modern day believers. We call it Â“warfareÂ” when things donÂ’t go my way and we donÂ’t have enough money for all the Â“toysÂ” we want. But that is not true warfare, that is a selfish lifestyle that revolves around Â“MEÂ”, Â“MYSELFÂ”, Â“MY LIFEÂ”, Â“MY PROBLEMSÂ”. Not many are laying down their lives for a cause higher than themselves, thus not much true authority is to be found!  While most Messianic/Christian believers are wasting their lives around themselves, satan and his troops are advancing, and taking on more and more territory with sacrificial people that are willing to loose their lives believing that they will be greatly rewarded by satan!<br><br>The reason why the Moslems have been advancing so much is because of SACRIFICE! They are willing to suffer every kind of hardship for the Moslem cause of annihilating Israel and conquering the world. They invest all they have into it.   They project their vision.  They train their children from very early age to become martyrs and finally they explode themselves as living bombs.  This spilling of their blood is gaining authority. Every place where blood is spilt authority is gained, whether by the enemy or by the Body of Yeshua. That is why the Moslem Palestinians have been gaining control over Israel. The sacrifice of martyrdom for the right or for the wrong cause gains power and influence. It is a SPIRITUAL PRINCIPLE.<br><br>It even works in the work place.  Tthe one that spends more effort, dedication, and devotion in his job will be rewarded and eventually gain a position of authority in the work place. I remember that my husband used to say: Â“My little sister was the Â“dumbÂ” one of the family and she made so much effort to study when me and my brother did not need to study because we were so brilliant. However this Â“dumbÂ” sister is the only one that became a DOCTORÂ”. The difference was in the lifestyle: She sacrificed her social life, and her time and studied, while the other Â“brilliant onesÂ” sacrificed NOTHING. If you sacrifice NOTHING you obtain NOTHING!<br><br>continued...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When Israel was miraculously established as a Jewish State after 2000 painful and bloody years of Exile, every pioneer had to sacrifice his life for it. Every inch of this land was conquered with SWEAT and BLOOD. We have memorials to fallen soldiers strewn all over this land and it worked. Israel became an exemplary country against all odds! While the Blessing of Elohim was on our endeavors, we still had to sow our lives, blood and sweat in this Land. My generation and the previous generation had to pay a price! But the new and young generation wants to live an easy life of pleasure.  The Â“MEÂ” lifestyle is causing us to loose our Land to those that are willing to die for it- the Moslems! Except they are not the TRUE OWNERS and will never be! It is time for THIS GENERATION to return to the lifestyle of SACRIFICE both in the Church and in Israel!<br><br>Of course we are in the 21st Century and we have to USE all of technology to our advantage! Sacrifice is not about POVERTY, it is about SELFLESS OBEDIENCE. When you lead a sacrificial lifestyle, itÂ’s not about false humility or not living in the Blessing, but rather it is about SEEKING HIS KINGDOM FIRST in all of your endeavors!<br><br>YÂ’shua said 2000 years ago that LOVE is always related to SACRIFICE.<br><br>"Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.Â”   John 15:13<br><br>Together with my husband Baruch, we have spent 18 years of our lives, sacrificing everything we have and we are for this one TRIPLE cause:<br><br>Â“(1) The Restoration of the Ecclesia to the original Hebrew Foundations, (2) the Salvation of the Nations, and (3) the Restoration of IsraelÂ”.<br><br>This sacrifice is paying off now, 18 years later, as thousands and soon millions of people are catching up with the Message of Â“The MAP RevolutionÂ”. Every day we receive emails from people that want to join us in this End Time Move and who want to propagate it and represent it in the nations. It is soon to become a TSUNAMI of the Spirit! During these past 18 years we have seen much suffering.  We have been like the SALMON who swims upstream until the SOURCE of the river where he lays down his eggs and then he dies. The Salmon, the King of the fish, sacrifices its life in order to REPRODUCE and MULTIPLY. We have had to die to self countless of times in order to go on. There is no TRUE and meaningful AUTHORITY and INFLUENCE without SACRIFICE. We are blessed to see so many people SAVED, HEALED, DELIVERED, DISCIPLED and ON FIRE for YÂ’shua all over the world! Our disciples cover the MAP of the world and they keep on multiplying! Our books are all over the globe without any Â“professionalÂ” distribution. Our TV programs broadcasted from the Mountains of Jerusalem are viewed by all nations and even Moslem nations! Our Tours and MAP trainings in the Land of Israel are being well sought after by prominent Spiritual Leaders world wide. And the BEST is yet to come!<br><br>As we are RESTING, and catching our breath in the Mountains of Jerusalem this year, the sacrificial sowing of our lives in the past 18 years is continually bearing FRUIT. We invite you to JOIN our sacrificial efforts with yours so we can REST WELL and go on in 2008 with renewed strength. We will forever be immensely thankful to you for your sacrificial prayers and your sacrificial offerings on our behalf. As we join your sacrifice with ours, we will soon see the world turned RIGHT SIDE UP and the Glory of Yahveh covering the earth as the waters cover the sea! As you sow sacrificially into this our year of REST, may the Almighty bless you as He promised in Genesis 12:3.<br><br>Â“And I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed."<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Rabbi Baruch and Bishop Dominiquae Bierman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>YAHVEH IS MY SHEPHERD #9</strong><br><br>Goodness and<br><br>Mercy<br><br>Run<br><br>After Me<br><br>Â“Surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of Yahveh forever.Â”  Psalms 23:6<br><br>Shabbat shalom dearly beloved!<br><br>In the Hebrew this verse says that CHEN- Goodness or Grace; and Chesed-Loving- Kindness or Mercy actually WILL RUN AFTER US ALL THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES!<br><br>I just hope that you will delight in this verse as much as I do! Especially in these troublesome times when you may be feeling that what is running AFTER you is not goodness or loving-kindness! It may be that you are surrounded with financial problems, health problems, and family problems among others, and you feel trapped in the midst of trouble and distress; in that case I have very good news for you! You must CHANGE your mind altogether! Let me explain this:<br><br>In the Hebrew it says that Goodness and Mercy actually RUN AFTER YOU! ThatÂ’s right if Yahveh is your Shepherd, then you are being chased by His Goodness and unmerited Mercy. In other words He is On Purpose chasing you down with His blessings but the question is Â“where did you stop running?Â” We are supposed to keep on RUNNING the RACE seeking His Kingdom first, but when we STOP running due to various negative circumstances, then you fall prey to them and get trapped in the self centeredness  of your own problems. That is a true TRAP and that is the purpose that satan has been throwing Â“curb ballsÂ” your way! Most people STOP running the race, obeying YahÂ’s Calling and seeking Him when overwhelmed with adverse circumstances! Immediately the adverse circumstances form a CAGE around you and you are imprisoned into them. When you are inside of this CAGE of your own thinking and interpretation, Goodness and Loving-Kindness are left out Â“in the coldÂ” and cannot reach you. They will keep on Running and chasing someone else that has not allowed circumstances to STOP them!<br><br>Â“Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, fixing our eyes on YÂ’shua, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of Elohim.Â”  Hebrews 12:1-2<br><br>I have learned in my life that when negative circumstances rally around me to make me STOP, is when I keep running like NOTHING is happening! This is the KEY,- Do not allow problems to stop you from obeying Yah or doing your ministry, (all of us have an assignment from YÂ’shua on this earth!). If you KEEP RUNNING THE RACE THROUGH THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WILL NOT BE TRAPPED! Then Goodness and Mercy will catch up with you, (you donÂ’t have to slow down for them, they run faster than you!) and actually overtake you! They will be waiting for you AHEAD of you.   You will keep on running and will Â“catch upÂ” with Goodness and Loving Kindness on the way!<br><br>"Now it shall be, if you diligently obey Yahveh your Elohim, being careful to do all His commandments which I command you today, Yahveh your Elohim will set you high above all the nations of the earth. "All these blessings will come upon you and overtake you if you obey Yahveh your ElohimÂ” Deuteronomy 28:1,2<br><br>Problems and adverse circumstances will come and will go but you keep running, obeying, ministering and being busy about the FatherÂ’s Business. The worst thing you can do is actually CONCENTRATE on your problems. Do not live in your problems, that is a Â“waterless pitÂ” a prison, a cage and a trap that keeps you out of the range of Goodness and Mercy. Keep on putting YÂ’shua, His Kingdon Â“your problemsÂ”. In fact stop claiming ownership over Â“your problemsÂ’ and give them right back to the devil where they came from! Concentrate and meditate on YahÂ’s promises for you.  LIVE in them and keep on obeying His Call, and instructions for your life! Many times when I have been playing my guitar in a ministry meeting the string breaks all of a sudden. It can happen at the peak of the anointing. Do you know what I do? I just keep on playing with the strings that are left! I donÂ’t stop for a second! Soon enough someone brings me another guitar and in a split of a second I exchange guitars and keep on playing MY SONG without hardly missing a beat! Surely enough the Holy Spirit moves mightily in those meetings!<br><br>Believe me, I have suffered many hindrances in my life and ministry. This is not a Â“plasticÂ” message. This is reality.  I speak from much experience and want to bless you. The ONLY time that I actually lost sight of Goodness and Mercy was when I STOPPED running His race to take care of Â“my own problemsÂ”, and believe me they were HUGE! Anyone would have done the same. Almost four years later not understanding what really happened to me I went into prayer and YAH said: Â“You have been like JonahÂ”. I repented in dust and ashes and NEVER did it again! I have put my life in jeopardy, the life of my children, finances, health, everything, just to keep on running and some times walking to catch up my breath. I take a Shabbat Rest and here I go again. However, no problem should be able to stop you all the days of your life! Keep doing what you are called to do. Never Give Up, and enjoy Goodness, and Mercy as your Â“Running CompanionsÂ” all the days of your life<br><br>In YÂ’shuaÂ’s Goodness and Mercy<br><br>Your friend in Israel<br><br>Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Consumer Oriented</strong><br>Volume 6 Issue 21<br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>In one of the most difficult portions of the Torah, and chapters in our history, this week the Children of Israel make a Golden Calf and serve it. The act warrants their annihilation, and Hashem threatens Moshe with just that, adding that He is ready to build a nation from Moshe himself. "Hashem said to Moses, Â‘I have seen this people, and behold! it is a stiff-necked people: And now, desist from Me. Let My anger flare up against them, and I shall annihilate them, and I shall make you a great nation.Â’" (Exodus 32:9-10) But Moshe beseeches Hashem to forgive the nation for the calamitous sin of the Golden Calf, and Hashem acquiesces, offering an historic formula which is the precursor to every prayer of penitence. Hashem entails the supplication that is known as "the thirteen attributes of Hashem."<br><br>They include the words "Hashem, Hashem, G-d, Compassionate and Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and TruthÂ…" (Exodus 34:6-7).<br><br>Those powerful, deep, and concise statements that embody anthropomorphic qualities to an Omnipotent Creator contain significant meaning far beyond mortal comprehension.<br><br>What is astonishing is that almost immediately after Hashem forgives the people, Moshe beseeches Hashem to accompany them for the precise reason that Hashem was angered by them!<br><br>"If I have now found favor in Your eyes, my L-rd, let my L-rd go among us -- for it is a stiff-necked people, and You shall forgive our iniquity and error, and make us Your heritage." (Exodus 34:9) Was it not stiff-neckedness that caused Hashem to want to annihilate them?<br><br>It had become a nuisance for most of those who strolled in the Swiss forest in the early 1950s. Hikers would come home and spend time removing the sticky cockleburs that had fastened to their clothing. But it was something that their forebears had lived with for years and another hindrance that nature had put in their way.<br><br>But George de Mestral did not look at the cockleburs that had snagged his sweater as a nuisance. In fact, he realized that Divine genius played a vital role in their physiology.<br><br>Returning home after a walk one afternoon, he took out a microscope to get a better look at Hashem's prodigy. When he realized that the burs were actually comprised of thousands of natural hooks that would engage countless loops he realized that this was no nuisance of nature. Their sticky nature was actually the way that these seed pods were transported to find new breeding grounds. They would latch themselves to the fur of animals and be transported.<br><br>De Mestral realized that he could carry this wisdom to the more mundane world. And so with a system of a fuzzy felt and crocheted hooks, he combined more than just two divergent materials. He also combined two words, velvet and crochet, now employed in the lexicon and inventory of both schoolchildren and rocket-scientists. He invented, or perhaps introduced us to, VelcroÂ®.<br><br>The Dubno Maggid explains that after Moshe heard the wondrous quality of Unrestricted Compassion, he realized that Hashem was actually offering a product that was well-tailored to our mortal needs. It was in fact Moshe's biggest argument for Hashem to accompany His nation.<br><br>"Angels don't need those attributes! It is the fallible human who needs that ever-lasting, unceasing mercy! It is only because we are stiff-necked that we need Your unending kindness!"<br><br>That is why after Moshe heard Hashem's argument, followed by His attributes, he presented his plea for Divine accompaniment. Often, we do not take advantage of the great goodness of Hashem. We leave His attributes in heaven, distancing our mundane needs from His all-powerful abilities. Moshe teaches us that it is distinctly our capriciousness and mortality that needs His omnipotence. We must realize that the attributes of Hashem are specifically assigned to sustain His nation. And all we have to do is utilize that unceasing, unyielding, and everlasting product to our advantage. Good Shabbos<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Higher than Sinai</strong><br>Volume 5 Issue 22<br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>In the aftermath of the sin of the Golden Calf, MosheÂ’s mortality is transformed to immortality as -- anthropomorphic as it may sound -- he gets G-d to change his mind.<br><br>Hashem, who had threatened to destroy Klall Yisrael after the sin of the Golden Calf, finally assures Moshe that His presence will accompany them on their sojourn. But Moshe, it seems, is still not satisfied. In what appears as a daring move, he asks Hashem for more. Not only does he want assurance of the accompaniment of the Divine presence, Moshe now asks Hashem to "show me Your face" (Exodus 33:18 ). It is not enough that Hashem forgives the Jews for the most audacious sin of their young history. It is not enough that he assures them that he will guide them in the desert. Moshe wants more! He asks for a mortal existence despite an immortal act. He wants to connect to the corporeal with the Omnipotent in a way never done before. He wants to feast his soul on the most spiritual meal ingested through human vision. He wants to see G-d.<br><br>Hashem explains that it is impossible to see Him and live. The human soul cannot be confined to a spatiotemporal existence after it has experienced the endless world of infinite spirituality. And thus the answer is, "No. You may however, see my back" (cf. Exodus 33:20-23). Of course the world of G-d's face as opposed to his back fill tomes of commentators from those who analyze textual reference to the great kabbalists, and it certainly has no place in a fax of internet sheet. What does interest me is Moshe's persistence. Why was he dissatisfied with G-d's first acquiescence? What propelled him, after almost losing Klall yisrael to ask for the greatest show of G-d's bond to His creation's?<br><br>Lou Maidenbaum, former President of Met Foods, help establish the Gedaliah Maidenbaum Preparatory School Division of Yeshiva of South Shore. Before passing away last month, he was confined to a hospital in Miami Beach.<br><br>But in his sick bed he never lost his spunk, charm or the will to live life to its fullest.<br><br>A week before he passed away, he was in his hospital room and was experiencing some discomfort. He pressed the button for a nurse, but no one came. Five minutes later he rang again. Still no response. He tried two more times and then decided a new tactic.<br><br>He picked up the telephone and dialed 3 digits. 9-1-1. "Emergency services, came the womanÂ’s voice, "what is the problem?" "IÂ’m having difficulty breathing" gasped Lou. "Where are you calling from?" "Mount Sinai Hospital, Room 321," came the response. "Mount Sinai Hospital?" Repeated the incredulous dispatcher, "what are you calling us for? You are in the Hospital already!" Lady," he shouted to the operator. "This is my life we are talking about. And If this is the way IÂ’ll get the best response, then IÂ’m calling 911!<br><br>Moshe knew that he was -- on Sinai -- with G-d -- receiving the Torah. However, that was not enough. He was not complacent about his accomplishment. He was not content with being the transmitter of eternity. He wanted more! He wanted to attain the highest possible level of mortal achievement. He wanted to see G-d. He wanted to spiritually feast on the face of the Omnipotent. Moshe was only concerned, to attain the greatest degree of spirituality that he possibly could reach. There was nothing else on his mind or in his soul. Hashem responded that if that level is attained, the soul will flee from its mortal constraints and refuse to re-enter a corporal being. "No man shall see Me and live" (Exodus 22:20). So Moshe had to concede with the highest level the physical body could endure. But in Moshe's quest to go higher than Sinai he taught us a great lesson. No matter what level you think you are on, if you are standing on earth, you must reach for the mountain and when you are standing on the mountain you must reach for the clouds. And even if you are standing on a cloud you must reach for the stars.<br><br>Good Shabbos<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Masked Emotions</strong><br>Volume 2 Issue 22<br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>In what is probably the most anti-climactic event in Jewish history, the nation that was about to receive the Torah from Moshe turns away from the will of Hashem. After 40 days they begin to worry that Moshe will never return and they panic. They create a new leader for themselves -- The Golden Calf..<br><br>The Torah describes the scene in Exodus 32:6: "The people offered (the calf) peace offerings and they sat down to eat and drink and they got up to revel."<br><br>Hashem immediately commands Moshe to descend Mount Sinai in order to admonish his corrupt nation. As Moshe comes down the mountain he hears tumultuous shouts emanating from the people who were celebrating their new found deity. His student, Yehoshua, also hears the sounds and declares (Exodus 32:17) "the sound of battle is in the camp." Moshe listens and amends the theory. He tells Yehoshua, "It is not the sound of victory, nor the sound of defeat: I hear the sound of distress." When Moshe sees the Golden Calf he breaks the Tablets and restores order, sanity, and the belief in Hashem.<br><br>What is strange about the episode is the contrast of the sounds made and the sounds heard. If the Jewish People reveled and celebrated then why did Yehoshua hear sounds of war and how did Moshe hear sounds of distress? They should both have heard the sound of celebration and festivity.<br><br>Rav Chaim of Sanz had a custom: he would test the local children on a monthly basis. The children would recite orally from the Mishnah or Talmud and Rav Chaim would reward them generously with sweets and money. Once a group of secular Jews decided to dupe Rav Chaim. They taught a Talmudic selection to a gentile child and reviewed it with him until he knew it perfectly. They dressed him like a Chasidic child and had him stand in line with all the other children to be tested.<br><br>The rabbi listened to the young boy intently. The other children were puzzled: they did not remember this boy from their cheder, yet they were amazed at the remarkable fluency he displayed in reciting his piece. Rav Chaim was not impressed at all. He turned to the young man and said, "please tell your father that there are better ways to earn a few coins!" With that he dismissed the child.<br><br>The secularists were shocked. "How did the Rabbi know?" Their curiosity forced them to approached Rav Chaim. Rav Chaim smiled as he answered them. "There are two ways to say the Gemorah. One is filled with spirituality. The child's body is swaying and filled with the emotion of Torah. The other is just repetitive rote. This young man lacked the fire and the true joy that the Jewish children have when learning Torah. I knew he was not one of ours."<br><br>The Jews got up to revel around the golden calf. Moshe and Yehoshua however knew the difference between true joy -- simcha -- and confusion. The Jews revel were in essence distressed but it was masked with drinks and noise makers. True joy is coupled with a certainty and a sense of direction; something lacking for those Jews celebrating the idol. The Jews may have gotten up to celebrate, but it was no celebration. It may have looked like a party to the untrained eye, but Moshe knew the true sound of joy. It did not exist with the Golden Calf. True joy is the harmony of spirituality and contentment. Superficial sounds of euphoria and celebration are heard by those with true insight as sounds of battle and distress.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>All Things Considered </strong><br>Volume 3 Issue 21<br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>One of the episodes in the Torah that is most difficult to understand is the story of the Golden Calf. Not only is it almost incomprehensible that a nation which saw the hand of Hashem redeem them had become so perfidious. After such majestic revelation, the words that they used to declare the Golden Calf as their new god are inconceivable.<br><br>The Torah tells us that Moshe, according to the Jews' calculations, tarried in returning from Sinai's mountaintop. The Jews panicked. Egyptian converts who joined the Jews at the exodus stirred the crowd. So Ahron stalled for time. He asked them to donate prized possessions -- the gold and silver that were taken from the Egyptians and now were worn by the women and children. The men didn't wait for their spouses. In the most enthusiastic response to an appeal to date, they gave their own gold. This gold meant a lot to them. It was their first taste of freedom in 210 years. But they gave impulsively and passionately. Ahron took the gold and heaved it into a large fire, and with uncalled-for input from a few sorcerers, a Golden Calf emerged. That was bad enough. What is more striking is the declaration of the nation that followed. The people danced around their newly created deity and shouted, "These are your gods which brought you up from the land of Egypt!" (Exodus:32:8 )<br><br>What could they have meant? Could they truly have thought that the molten image of the Golden Calf led them from Egypt? It's an absurdity! Surely they did not believe that a Golden Calf was their leader.<br><br>Rabbi Emanuel Feldman of Atlanta, in his recent work Tales Out of Shul, related that he once made a hospital visit to a gentlemen from south Georgia. He promptly received the following letter.<br><br>"Dear Rabbi: Thank you for visiting my husband in the hospital. I thought that orthodox Rabbis just sit and study and pray all day. I am pleased that you do not."<br><br>Another time, Rabbi Feldman writes, he was on a plane, and due to overbooking he was bumped up from economy class to a seat in the first class section of the aircraft. During the entire flight, a major Jewish philanthropist, who was seated in first class as a matter of monetary right, kept staring at Rabbi Feldman with a look of curious displeasure. As they were departing the aircraft, the wealthy man could control himself no longer. "Excuse me, Rabbi," he imposed. "Do you always fly first class?"<br><br>At first Rabbi Feldman was taken aback but he composed himself and without apologies he comfortably replied, "Doesn't everybody?"<br><br>People have impressions of defining actions, moments, and behavior. "Orthodox Rabbis pray all day and don't tend to the sick." "A Rabbi is paid to fly in economy class -- not first class." The same holds true of mitzvos. Often we designate certain mitzvos as the raison d'Ãªtre of Judaism. Certain mitzvos or ideals become a cause celebrÃ© as others fall to the wayside. We ignore some as we point our fingers to our favorites and shout, "This is our god!"<br><br>The Jews thought that Moshe would never return. They were left in the dessert with nothing -- except one mitzvah. Their beloved leader Moshe had asked them to ask the Egyptians for gold and silver. And they did. That gold and silver represented their emergence into freedom. It was the remnant of the glory of their redemption and the now-missing man who importuned them to ask for gold. It was all that reminded them of the man that gave them a sense of pride and justice. That gold now stood in front of them in the form of a calf. That gold was now their god! They had chosen a mitzvah, cherished it, danced about it, and unfortunately, now they worshipped it.<br><br>There is no one aspect to Judaism. There are 613 mitzvos, and not one of them can stand alone. When one mitzvah is chosen and placed as the defining moment of Judaism, it is nothing more than a Golden Calf. For Judaism cannot depend on one good deed alone. All things must be considered.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Golden Thread of Our Existence</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>The Children of Israel shall observe the Shabbos, to make the Shabbos an eternal covenant for their generations. (Shemos 31:16)<br><br>What is meant by Â“for their generationsÂ”? Rebbi says, Â“All who keep the Shabbos according to its specifications, the verse speaks about them as if they had kept every Shabbos from the time that HASHEM created His world until the time of the revival of the dead!Â” (Mechilta)<br><br>ItÂ’s a gross understatement to say that Shabbos is an Â“importantÂ” day. What makes some days more important than others? There are certain days for which many other days are sacrificed. A short list would include, a Bar Mitzvah, a wedding, Rosh HaShana.<br><br>When we examine a few of the examples mentioned above we discover that those single days for which so much has been invested are not single days at all. They hold much more that meets the casual eye. A Bar Mitzvah boy- man is suiting himself up for manhood. He is effectively accepting upon himself a lifetime of responsibility at those magic moments. The foundation for the building of his life is being poured. The steadiness his entire structure rests upon the firmness of his commitment that day. So we dress it up and highlight its importance so it should not go by underutilized. The same holds true of a wedding in a more obvious way. Similarly, the entire year and its events are scripted on Rosh HaShana much as DNA hold the code for all living organisms. These are not ordinary single days.<br><br>At a Bris in Jerusalem a guest Rabbi stood up to speak and wish well to the grandfather of the new born on the occasion of his first grand- child, Â“Mazel Tov today you are a human being!Â” Everyone was stunned.<br><br>Maybe there is some hidden insult implied here. Until now he wasnÂ’t human? Then he went on to explain that in the animal kingdom it is common to find creatures that have an instinct to protect its young cub, kitten, fledgling you name it. However, only by humans does a grandparent demonstrate love and care for his or her grandchild. This is symptomatic of real soulfulness to see oneÂ’s self in a grander historical or familial context and to care for the opinion of grandparents or grandchildren.<br><br>A great Rabbi, a well-known personality remarked almost sardonically that his main goal at this later stage of his life was to impress his grandchildren. Then he added a caveat when the chuckle of laughter quieted, Â“IÂ’m not kidding!Â” One grandmother commented with an uncommon frankness about her feelings of extra love and adoration for her Shomer Shabbos grandchildren over and above her other biological grandchildren, Â“When I see these children I see the whole past and the whole future! When I see those, I donÂ’t see the past and I donÂ’t see the future!Â”<br><br>To be Shomer Shabbos explains the Ohr HaChaim is to wait and anticipate when it will arrive, like one awaits an important guest. He learns this from Yaakov who rebuked Yosef outwardly for revealing the dreams to his brothers but the verse records that he privately kept the matter, and Rashi explains that he waited with great anticipation when it will be realized. From there we learn the definition of keeping the Shabbos! We live for and work for, investing in Shabbos a whole week.<br><br>Shabbos, though, is not just a single day in the weekly cycle. Everything is contained in that day, the entire past and the entire future. It can be said that Shabbos is not less than the golden thread of our existence.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shabbos: A Time to BeÂ…<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>You shall observe the Shabbos, for it is holy to you; its desecrators shall be put to death, for whoever does work on it, that soul shall be cut off from amongst its people. For six days work may be done and the seventh is a day of complete rest, it is sacred to HASHEM; whoever does work on Shabbos shall be put to death. (Shemos 31:12-15)<br><br>Wow! Shabbos is sure serious business. There are not less than thirty-nine categories that fall under the heading of Â“creative workÂ” that are forbidden on Shabbos. One might think it is a paralyzing proposition to have to keep the countless details of the day but it is actually time of sublime pleasure. Why so many prohibitions? WhatÂ’s the big pleasure?<br><br>I remember being impressed by two cartoon video shorts I showed to my Hebrew Day School class years ago. The first depicted a man with a calculator for a head on his way to work. As the cool jazz music played and he passed through the city streets everyone he met had for a head whatever they did for a living. A shoe-maker had a hammer for a head. A bus passed by and a bunch of camera heads popped out. They were tourists. The fellow selling flowers in the lobby of the building had a bouquet for a head and his secretary a pencil rack. At work he is seen giving dictation to his secretary while the numbers on his calculator-face flash and then something indicating the passage of time signals his declaration, Â“ItÂ’s time to go home for Â“ShabbosÂ”. Magically, his face is transformed into a human face and she gains human features as well. Each person he greets, wishing Â“Have a nice weekendÂ” or Â“Good ShabbosÂ” is restored with a human face.<br><br>The second clip shows a man squelching the obnoxious ring of his alarm clock. He toasts bread, percolates coffee and heads out to his car only to find that it wonÂ’t start. Entering the house he is confronted by a surrealistic nightmare while the avant-garde jazz keeps beat in the background. The instruments, objects, and utensils in his house begin to loom larger and larger reciting, Â“clean meÂ”, Â“polish meÂ”, Â“fix meÂ” in an ever more deafening chorus of demands. As they grow he is shrinking into utter insignificance. Suddenly he shouts with authority, Â“Quiet! IÂ’m in charge here!Â” They then revert to normal proportion and he is seen reading peacefully as Shabbos candles shine brightly in the background.<br><br>What are these cartoon shorts so cleverly portraying? When we meet someone new and ask, Â“Who are you?Â” Chances are we will hear a reading back of a resume of career choices. Â“IÂ’m a lawyer or a doctor etc.Â” The question is, Â“Who are you?Â” Sometimes we are flooded with a list of recent purchases large and small as if an identity can be picked up at the mall. I have a dog or a new car etc. This only what we have, not who we are.<br><br>I once heard Rabbi Dr. Abraham Twerski, a prominent psychiatrist, state a psychological principle I think we can agree makes loads of sense. Â“Nobody likes to be locked into a Â“no exitÂ” situation with someone they donÂ’t like!Â” This may help explain in part the anxiety we feel while taking seats on a plane. Rabbi Twerski continues, Â“That syndrome is amplified and intensified when the one we fear to be with is our self!Â”<br><br>The Torah takes the hammer out of our hands, removing the temptation to escape even into productive labor that might serve to distract us from our bigger mission in life. On Shabbos we are meant to gage how Â“what we doÂ” and Â“what we haveÂ” impacts Â“who we areÂ” and to learn to relate to others similarly. As we get better at preparing for that meeting the sudden silence is not so jolting and is in fact extraordinarily delightful. If prepared for correctly and observed with due diligence, we begin to long for Shabbos: a time to beÂ…<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Keeping the Holy Holy!</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>The Children of Israel shall keep the Shabbos, to make the Shabbos an eternal covenant for their generations. Between Me and the Children of Israel it is a sign forever that in a six-day period HASHEM made heaven and earth and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed. (Shemos 31:16-17)<br><br>To make the Shabbos: Isnt the Mitzvah of Shabbos accomplished by sitting and not doing and refraining from creative activity? If so what is the meaning of the expression to make the Shabbos? Rabbi Elazar Ben Parta says; All who properly keep the Shabbos are considered as if they made the Shabbos. (Mechilta)<br><br>I make more money when I am asleep than when I am awake. (Warren Buffet)<br><br>If it aint broke, dont fix it! (Conventional Wisdom)<br><br>How is it that one is considered to have made something by merely refraining from destroying it? Why is the subject of Shabbos an immediate prelude to the Sin of the Golden Calf?<br><br>It is troublesome to consider how any part of the Jewish People was involved with an idolatrous act only 40 days after the presentation of The 10 Commandments. They had just heard the declaration, "You shall have no other gods before me." Just 43 days prior to that the sea had split and even the smallest nursing child, we are told, was able to lift his head, point, and say, This is my G-d and I will glorify Him. How could the impact of such grandiose events have evaporated from the psyche of a people so quickly?<br><br>Reb Chaim Shmuelevitz ztl. explains that the prophetic encounters that the entire Nation of Israel experienced at that time was akin to a gift. There is a difference of valuation when something is earned with years of hard work and self-sacrifice and when something is granted to a person with minimal effort. Things that come to us with ease are more likely to be lost with ease.<br><br>It is not uncommon for winners of the lottery to squander their wealth and those who inherit family businesses are more at risk to fumble all that was gained through the agony of their parents. Unfortunately, as earth shattering as those events were they didnt make a deep and a long enough lasting impression to forestall the possibility of even immediate failure.<br><br>Our sages tell us that the creation of the cure always predates the introduction of the disease. In that spirit we can understand, perhaps, why the flag of Shabbos is waved before the account of the Golden Calf. The effort that allows one to maintain a gift is gained by the hard work of appreciation just as the sweat equity invested prior to earning something helps secure its value in the mind of the recipient.<br><br>The job for all time then, to remedy that error, is to practice receiving a great and holy gift. As with a priceless work of art, we are well advised to protect its integrity. Dont disturb it! Dont fix it! Let it be! Appreciate it! We are asked to stand back and behold the awe and majesty of the day of Shabbos! It comes already assembled.<br><br>Sure we can enhance Shabbos with some fine foods and fresh garments but the biggest benefit is to be gained by not disturbing its already pristine state of purity! In that way Shabbos may be seen as a cure for the root problem of the Golden Calf. In weekly installments, for all time, through the discipline of guarding Shabbos, we are meant to gradually master the fine art of keeping the holy holy!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br><br><strong>Shabbos Has Kept the Children of Israel Holy </strong><br><br>Â“The Children of Israel shall observe the Shabbos, to make the Shabbos an eternal covenant for their generations. Between Me and the Children of Israel, it is a sign forever that in a six-day period Hashem made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed. (Shemos 32:16-17)<br><br>He promised them that this sign will remain forever and Israel will make great personal sacrifices for its sake and through this the sign will remain with them forever. He also promised them that no other peoples will accept this day as their day of rest, rather they will seek to rest on another day. (Malbim)<br><br>WhatÂ’s so special about Shabbos? Why is it the central day in the Jewish week? LetÂ’s see if we can appreciate one small sliver of an approach.<br><br>A Rabbi was speaking to an elder group of Jews in Florida some time back. He wanted to impress upon them the greatness of the sainted Chofetz Chaim. He told them that in a town near to Radin where the Chofetz Chaim resided there was a butcher whose son had become a flagrant desecrater of the Shabbos. This presented a tremendous problem for the whole town. The sonÂ’s ill behavior reflected on the butcher and cast a shadow of over the credibility of his Kashrus.<br><br>It was the source of great controversy for the whole community and deep personal pain for the butcher. After many discussions and after having exhausted every other option it was decided that they would bring the young man to meet the Chofetz Chaim. They did. After a brief encounter in a closed room the boy came out transformed and from then on was dutifully observant of the Shabbos.<br><br>After the Rabbi concluded his lecture an older man approached him and told him that he was from a certain small town adjacent to Radin. His father was a butcher. In his youth he had gone on a streak of rebelliousness and had desecrated the Shabbos. His father had taken him to the Chofetz Chaim and from then on he ceased from violating the Shabbos. Â“I was that young man in the story!Â” he confessed. The Rabbi pressed him, Â“What happened in that room?Â”<br><br>He related, Â“I entered the room and saw this sweet elderly Rabbi. He took my hand with his two soft and gentle hands and he began to say, Â“Shabbos, oy ShabbosÂ…Â” He repeated over and over again and he began to cry. A tear ran off his cheek and landed on the back of my hand. When I felt that hot tear I gave a shriek and ran out of the room, vowing at that moment I would never violate Shabbos again.Â”<br><br>Rabbi Yehuda Halevi, the Kuzari, relates a remarkable fact. For all the various measurements of time there is some corresponding celestial cue. During the course of a month the moon does its dance across the sky. A year can be measured by the angle of the sunÂ’s rays. These are openly observable phenomena.<br><br>However, a week is a peculiar creature. Why is the entire world obedient to a seven-day week. What heavenly signal keeps all of humanity in concert with this schedule? The Kuzari posits that it is a remnant of the persistent memory of all humanity. That from the very beginning the world had an original and continuing cycle of Shabbos.<br><br>A second point of interest is that the other faiths have chosen days in the week other than Shabbos as days of relaxation. They do not contest which day is Shabbos. On that all are in agreement. These have parked Â¼ of humanity on Friday the 6th day and these have placed Â¼ of mankind on Sunday, the 1st day of the week.<br><br>With ink as hot as that holy tear itÂ’s in the verse above for 3315 years now, the 7th day has been Â“an exclusiveÂ” for the Children of Israel who have always kept the Shabbos Holy, and so Shabbos has kept the Children of Israel Holy.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Chaim Dovid Green<br><strong>Freedom of Religion </strong><br>Toward the end of World War II, the German armies were retreating. Still, even to the end they managed to hold on to their Jewish prisoners. One such battalion of prisoners was used to dismantle anything that the advancing allied army might be able to make use of. When the fast day of Yom Kippur came that year, the Jewish prisoners decided that come what may, they were not going to eat on that holy day. When the Germans got word of this the men were warned that if they knew what was good for them, they would not consider this "folly." Nevertheless, they did manage to fast for the entire day of Yom Kippur, and they quietly ate their meager rations after the day had come to an end.<br><br>Unfortunately, after the fact they were exposed, and all of the men were summoned to a roll call. "We know that you ignored our strict orders and you are deserving of punishment, but we are willing to be benevolent. Anyone who will step forward and express regret will be pardoned." No one moved. We will give you another chance to step forward and express regret for what you have done." Still no one moved. "Then you are forcing us to punish you." They were taken to the top of a muddy hill, and forced to slide down the hill on their bare stomachs. Over and over they were given the chance to express their regret, and over and over they refused. Repeatedly, they were forced to slide down the muddy hill on their stomachs. Still, the prisoners did not step forward to express their regret.<br><br>So I ask you, according to our concept of freedom, what category would we place these Jewish prisoners in? Is it feasible to call men in their shoes free men?<br><br>In todayÂ’s world, we are rightfully very preoccupied with procuring our rights and freedoms. We want to be free to pursue our priorities, live according to our convictions, and pursue what makes us happy. We don't want anyone limiting us or imposing on us his concept of how we should live. These are our entitlements as human beings, and no one should have the right to take them from us.<br><br>Nevertheless, even though we would not have it any other way, we must be cognizant that freedom is a double-edged sword. It is possible to live with total freedom, and still be very far from free, and vice versa.<br><br>In this week's parsha the tablets containing the Ten Commandments are described. "And the tablets were made by G-d, and the writing was G-d's writing, engraved (Heb. Chorus) on the tablets.Â” (Exodus 32:16). Our sages (Chapters of the fathers 6:2) comment on this "do not read 'chorus' 'engraved,' but rather 'chairus,' 'freedom,' for no one else is free but he who occupies himself in Torah learning." The words 'Chorus' and 'Chairus' are spelled the same way with different vocalization. (Note that a Torah scroll does not contain the actual vowels that go under the words, and it actually lends itself to this kind of interpretation. Nevertheless, this is not a random form of interpretation, and in order to be employed there needs to be an actual connection between the simple and the homiletic explanation.)<br><br>Rabbi Sampson Raphael Hirsch explains the words of the sages as follows. "Even as the Torah ennobles us, so a truly devoted study of it also makes us free, free from error, free from the temptations of physical lusts and desires, and free from the crushing and degrading power of the multitude of worries and troubles of daily living."<br><br>In other words, it is very easy to be a slave to our desires, and emotions. How many people in the free world are drowning in debt because they are literally slaves to their desires for material things? How many people are slaves to anger and other emotions, which cause them to act in destructive and regrettable ways? It is even possible to be a slave to an ideal that leads a person to ruination. Nazism is a perfect example of just such an ideal. To the uninitiated, it appears that many people are fortunate, and living a life afforded them by their freedom. It is true, but obviously not the whole story.<br><br>Just as a three-piece suit would feel to Tarzan the first time he would wear one, we might tend to think that the commandments of the Torah are constricting and repressive. This, however, is a superficial view. On further examination of the mitzvos, and the veracity of the Torah, we may come to conclude that the Jewish "prisoners" in our story are truly free, and their German oppressors are the real prisoners.<br><br>Freedom alone is an opportunity to exercise free choice. However, the Torah teaches us that paradoxically, a commitment to its ideals and commandments are the source of true freedom. That is the connection between the Hebrew words 'engraved,' and 'freedom;' that one who sincerely engraves the words of Torah on his heart, and reflects them in his actions has achieved true freedom.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>
