            <div class='col-md body'>Chukas Pocus<br>Volume 3 Issue 41<br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>The laws of the parah adumah, the red heifer, have enraptured mortals since the day it was commanded. There was no reason or rationale given for it. The nations of the world, baffled by it, mocked our observance of it. Even King Solomon, the wisest of men, claimed to be stupefied by its reasoning. And Moshe was the only mortal that understood the essence of its every nuance.<br><br>Its laws are complex, its symbolism mysterious, and the logic of its repercussions quite enigmatic. The red heifer's ashes purify those who have become tamei (impure), yet the administrating Kohen who was tahor (pure) becomes tamei! There is no logic behind that occurrence; yet that is the law. So sacred was the red heifer that Moshe and Aaron sacrificed, that it ashes were saved from generation to generation. Each additional red-heifer offering was added to the remnants of the previous, so that the new ashes would mix with the vestigial ashes of Moshe's original heifer. Hundreds of generations and thousands of Kohanim and Israelites who performed the mitzvah of parah adumah believed with unquestioning faith in the law's ritual divinity and power.<br><br>I have one simple question. Why were these complex, hidden, and very spiritual laws placed smack in the middle of the Book of Bamidbar? The enigmatical laws of purity and impurity are almost entirely relegated to Sefer VaYikra (Leviticus). That sefer discusses sacrificial offerings. It also details a host of physio-spiritual maladies, among them, the laws of tzora'as, zav, zavah, nidah, and so forth. Shouldn't the mystical requirements of the Parah Adumah join its counterparts together with the laws of the Kohanim? Why is it placed in the Book that recounts the stories of human folly -the malicious uprising of Korach, the miscalculations of the spies, the unfaithfulness of the sotah, the complaints against the heavenly fare of manna? What significance does the juxtaposition of these seemingly unexplainable rituals, obviously not congruent with mortal logic doing with the tales of error and miscalculation?<br><br>One evening during World War II, Senator Kenneth McKellar of Tennessee could not sleep. As chairman of the Senate appropriations committee, he could not understand why he should the administration was requesting some $2,000,000,000 towards certain unusual scientific research.<br><br>He called Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and began to shout. "Do you expect me to sanction this tremendous appropriation without any idea as to where it is going!"<br><br>Stimson kept quiet. He pondered and hesitated, then he asked, "Can you keep a secret?" After McKellar assured him that he could, Stimson whispered, "We are about to split the atom."<br><br>McKellar exploded. "Are you crazy? This is a war! We have men out there! We need guns! We need planes! We need ammunition! And you guys are fooling around with some hocus pocus -- splitting atoms!"<br><br>It was only months later that McKellar, along with the entire world learned the power of this seemingly incomprehensible and esoteric exercise. Perhaps there is no better place to expound the laws of parah adumah than in the middle of Sefer Bamidbar. For it is this Torah section that discusses a generation that thinks they are able to calculate and define everything. It tells of spies who return from Canaan and exclaim that according to their calculations there is no logical way that Israel will conquer the land. It tells of Korach, who complained that according to his calculations he should be the prince of the tribe of Levi. Its Midrash tells of Korach gathering 250 men and ranting that according to his logic a mezuzah is unnecessary in a room filled with sacred books. It talks about false leaders who would be satisfied if only the spirit of the law is fulfilled, even if the letter of the law is not. Bamidbar even contains the story of Miriam, who, according to her reasoning, spoke ill of her brother Moshe. It discusses Jews who wanted meat rather than manna.<br><br>When humans make mortal calculations to redefine Torah law, there is no better time and place to talk about red heifers and the complex and esoteric laws thereof. The red cow and its laws represent the total omnipotence of Hashem, be it spirit, in logic, or in mechanics. It exclaims that that though we may search for rhyme and reason of Torah, we still must observe the mitzvos He commanded, regardless if we understand them. For there will always be some aspect that may only appear to us as mysterious as hocus pocus. Yet with uncalculating faith we must realize that there is great method to the many aspects we cannot deem mortal. In that manner we shall merit to be totally committed to Hashem's Torah, and not our mortal vision of it.<br><br>Mordechai Kamenetzky - Yeshiva of South Shore<br><br></div>

Those were the words spoken to me years ago by someone God sent into my life. I had been in the midst of trying to understand some catastrophic events that shook my world. Years later, I was able to see that God gave this person supernatural insight that revealed God's calling on my life.<br><br>God still uses His prophets today to reveal His plans in the lives of His people. I have seen this Scripture proved over and over in the lives of people. It is as though God sends out His "scouts" to inform His servants what is ahead for them. Sometimes He does this because He knows the event will require such changes in that person's life and so He wants to assure them of His love. I have experienced the Lord using me in this way in the life of other individuals. God did this in the life of Moses. He came to Moses at the burning bush to reveal His purposes for the people of Israel and His call on Moses to free them. The apostle Paul had Cornelius come to him to let him know God had called him to preach to the Gentiles.<br><br>Has God placed individuals in your life to speak His plans for you? Are your eyes and ears spiritually sensitive so that you will know who are messengers of God? Elisha had a servant who could not see or hear with spiritual eyes and ears until Elisha prayed they would be opened. Then the servant could see the great army of God protecting them (see 2 Kings 6:17). Pray that you might see and hear with the Spirit. He may desire to reveal His purposes and plans through another individual.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Your Irrevocable Calling </strong><br>Romans 11:29<br>For God's gifts and His call are irrevocable.<br><br>It is dangerous to align your calling and your vocation as dependent on each other. God calls us into relationship with Him. That is our foremost calling. It is from this relationship that our "physical" calling results. Whether that is to be a teacher, a stockbroker, a nurse, a pastor, or any number of vocations, we must realize that when He calls us, the change in vocation never changes His call on our lives. It is a mere change in the landscape of our calling. This is why it is dangerous to associate our purpose and calling too closely with our work. When we define our work life exclusively as our calling, we fall into the trap of locking up our identity into our vocation. This promotes aspiration because of a need to gain greater self-worth through what we do.<br><br>Os Guinness, author of The Call, describes the great artist Picasso, who fell into this trap.<br><br>"When a man knows how to do something," Pablo Picasso told a friend, "he ceases being a man when he stops doing it." The result was a driven man. Picasso's gift, once idolized, held him in thrall. Every empty canvass was an affront to his creativity. Like an addict, he made work his source of satisfaction only to find himself dissatisfied. "I have only one thought: work," Picasso said toward the end of his life, when neither his family nor his friends could help him relax. [Os Guiness, The Call (Nashville, Tennessee: Word Publishing, 1998 ), 242.]<br><br>What happens when you lose your job? Do you lose your calling? Do you lose your identity? Do you lose your sense of well-being? No. Calling involves different stages and experiences in life. Disruptions in your work are an important training ground for God to fulfill all aspects of His calling on your life. Trust in your God who says your calling is irrevocable and that all things come from Him.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

Jacob was a man who learned to manipulate and control outcomes. He even stole the birthright of his brother, Esau, through trickery. The Bible speaks of Jacob as a man who strived with God. He knew how to force situations to his advantage. It took years for God to break down all the rough edges of Jacob so that he could be worthy of becoming the patriarch of the 12 tribes of Israel. God saw something in Jacob that He could use.<br><br>Robert Hicks, in his book Masculine Journey, describes five biblical stages of manhood that must be passed through before a man becomes a mature man of God. One of those early stages is known as the "warrior stage." In this stage of manhood, the man is known by what he does, what he accomplishes, and he is totally defined by his performance. It can be a tumultuous time for the man and those close to him. It is often signified by broken relationships because the goal is often more important than the way the goal is accomplished. When I meet with a man, I can easily determine what stage of life he is in by hearing him talk.<br><br>Jacob had successfully passed through these five stages based on the verse above. It takes someone mature to be able to "move along slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of the children." Leaders who never come to understand this may be successful materially but fail at the most important aspect of leadership-leading at a pace that his followers can maintain. The roads are full of wives, children, and workers who cannot keep up with the pace of leaders and are left behind with broken dreams, broken hearts, and unfulfilled promises.<br><br>Are you a person who is more concerned with outcome than how you achieve the outcome? Can the people around you describe you as someone who leads at a pace that ensures respect and admiration? Ask the Lord for the ability to be a godly leader who understands the condition of his flock and the pace in which you can lead without alienating.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>When a Problem Turns Into a Calling </strong><br>1 Samuel 9:20<br>As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and all your father's family?<br><br>Saul and his servant were out seeking his father's lost donkeys. This was symbolic of the waywardness of the nation of Israel. The people of Israel had just asked the prophet Samuel to have a king rule over them. This saddened God greatly, yet God granted their request.<br><br>Saul and his servant heard of a man of God named Samuel. "Perhaps this man of God can tell us where to find our donkeys," said the servant. Isn't that just like us? We seek God to solve the issues related to material life. Saul was about to receive the greatest opportunity of his lifetime. He was about to be crowned as king of Israel. His life would never be the same. What was he concerned about? His donkeys. We don't have to be worried about the material things of life if we are about the things He's called us to do.<br><br>God called Saul to be the next king in order to free the people from the Philistines. God sent a messenger, the prophet Samuel, to inform him of his new career. The messenger also had to ease his mind about his donkeys. Donkeys often represent commerce in the Bible. They were the primary means of transporting goods; therefore, in essence, what was Samuel saying to Saul? He was saying, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"You don't need to worry about your business if you respond to the call of God on your life.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Never Ending Story</strong><br><br>With Divine intervention ensuring that Balak the King of Moav would be governed by MurphyÂ’s Law, everything that could go wrong for him went wrong.<br><br>Balak, the King of Moav saw that the Jewish nation was camped near his land and he became frightened. He employed the greatest sorcerer of the generation, Bilaam, to curse the Children of Israel, but alas, Hashem ensured that all potential curses were turned into blessings. In one of the early attempts to curse the Jews, Bilaam erected seven altars with sacrifices. He set out to accomplish his mission but he failed. Instead of cursing the Jews, Bilaam blessed them and longed for their eternal fortune.<br><br>Â“He declaimed his parable and said Â­ Â‘From Aram, Balak, king of Moab, led me, from the mountains of the east, 'Come curse Jacob for me, come bring anger upon Israel.' How can I curse? Â­ G-d has not cursed. How can I anger? G-d is not angry. For from its origins, I see it rock-like, and from hills do I see it. Behold! It is a nation that will dwell in solitude and not be reckoned among the nations. Who has counted the dust of Jacob or numbered a quarter of Israel? May my soul die the death of the upright, and may my end be like his!Â’" (Numbers 23:6-10)<br><br>Though I am no expert in sorcererÂ’s spells or Bilaamic blessings, the juxtaposition is difficult to comprehend. Why did Bilaam suddenly ask to die the death of the upright after extolling the uniqueness of his adversaries, the Israelites? If he gave them blessings, why didnÂ’t he ask to live in the bounty of their goodness?<br><br>Last year my son was in fourth grade and had to do a report on President Abraham Lincoln. He did a fine job recounting his log-cabin childhood, his early career as an attorney, and his tumultuous presidency. He detailed the difficult period of the Civil War and LincolnÂ’s bold stance in signing the Emancipation Proclamation.<br><br>I looked over his report and frankly, I was quite impressed Â— until I reached the last sentence. It read: Â“Abraham Lincoln died on Friday morning, April 15, 1865, and was buried in Oak Ridge Cemetery, outside Springfield, Illinois.Â”<br><br>Â“Zvi,Â” I exclaimed, Â“Abraham Lincoln died on Friday morning?Â” I rhetorically reiterated, stressing the passivity of the underreported, yet most traumatic event. Â“Died?Â” I repeated. Â“He was shot to death! In fact, Lincoln was assassinated! In fact,Â” I added, Â“he was the first President to be assassinated! How can you ignore that significant part of his life in your report?Â”<br><br>Zvi looked at me quizzically. Â“My report was on Â‘the Life of Abraham Lincoln. Who cares how he died? He died!Â” Bilaam understood that death, too, is an integral part of life. Our attitude toward death is part of our larger attitude toward life. And the way we leave this world is part of a greater outlook of how we aspire to live our lives.<br><br>A neighbor of mine was a former Yeshiva boy back in the early 1920Â’s in one of AmericaÂ’s first yeshivas. Time and circumstances eroded both his practice and belief. He had joined the army and rose to the rank of a General. He and his wife often ate in our sukkah and we became quite friendly. When he was diagnosed with a fatal illness, he asked me to perform his funeral service in the right time. I agreed only if he would be buried in accordance with the halacha. And though in his life he disregarded the daily practices of an observant Jew, in death, he forewent burial in his his army uniform and instead chose traditional tachrichim (shrouds) and a talis.<br><br>When one sees the ultimate spiritual eternity of the Jew, he realizes that death is just a portal to a greater world, Olam HaBah. Bilaam declared that we are a nation that dwells in solitude, and that our ways in life are not compatible with those nations who outnumber us. It is after he comprehended our eternity that he beseeched the Almighty with the haunting bequest, Â“May my soul die the death of the upright, and may my end be like his!" The Chofetz Chaim, however, added a very cogent caveat: In asking for the death of the righteous, Bilaam understood that there is more to the legacy of life than life itself. And so, Bilaam wanted to live his perverted life as a hedonistic heretic, yet he wanted to die the death of the righteous. Â“Truth be told,Â” says the Chofetz Chaim, Â“our mission is not only to die the death of the upright, but to live the life of the upright as well.Â” Because if you want to sleep the sleep, you first have to walk the walk<br><br>Good Shabbos<br><br>Dedicated in memory of Joseph Heller by Beth and Ben Heller and Family L'iluy Nishmas Reb Yoel Nosson ben Reb Chaim HaLevi Heller -- 9 Tamuz<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Copyright Â© 2002 by Rabbi M.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Partial View</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>You have to approach something from the right view. At least that's what Balak, the king of Moab, tried to convince his prime sorcerer who futilely tried to curse the Jewish nation. Though Bilaam had a notorious reputation, with for curses that never failed and the ability to cast spells upon whomever he desired, this time it didn't work. He tried, for a large fee, to curse the Jewish nation, who were camped opposite of Moab; but each time he opened his mouth blessings and not curses were emitted. "How can I curse when G-d is not angry," he exclaimed (Numbers 23:8 ).<br><br>Each time the mission failed, Balak flew into a rage. Bilaam attempted to subvert G-d's intentions and appease Him with sacrifices -- all to no avail.<br><br>Balak tried another strategy. "Come with me to a different place from there you will see them; however, you will see its edge and not all of it -- and you will curse it for me from there" (Numbers 23:13). It didn't work either.<br><br>I had a difficult time understanding the new strategy. What's the difference if Bilaam were to see all of Israel or he would stand in a place that only offers a partial view? Is the G-d of Israel not ever-present, protecting them in part as well as in whole? Why would a curse work when Bilaam only viewed Israel from a partial perspective?<br><br>A pious and very talented Jewish scholar was placed on trial in a small Polish town outside of Lvov. The charges, brought by a local miscreant, were based on some trumped-up complaint. The young scholar was beloved to his townsfolk as he served in the capacity of the town's shochet (ritual slaughterer), chazzan (cantor), and cheder rebbe. Thus , many people in town were worried as he appeared before a notoriously anti-Semitic judge.<br><br>As he presented the charges, the judge mockingly referred to him as Mr. Butcher. In fact all through the preliminary portion of the kangaroo court, the judge kept referring to the beloved teacher and cantor as a butcher, meat vendor or slaughterer. Finally, the young scholar asked permission to speak. "Your honor," he began, "before I begin my defense, I'd like to clarify one point. I serve in many capacities in this shtetl. The people at the synagogue know me as the cantor. The children at the school and all of their parents know me as the teacher. It is only the animals that know me as the butcher!"<br><br>The commentaries explain that Bilaam knew that the power of his curses would only take effect by finding a small breach in the beauty of Israel -- a breach that he could expand with the power of his evil eye. He looked at all of Israel and could not find any flaw to amplify and use as a curse.<br><br>Balak advised him to use another ploy. He made a suggestion that would be followed for generations by all the detractors of Jews. "Only look at them," he said, "from a partial perspective. Go up to the edge of the mountain; you shall see their edge and not all of them -- and you will curse them for me from there" (Numbers 23:13).<br><br>Balak told Bilaam to concentrate on some poor aspects of the people. It is always possible to find a few exceptions to a most ethical and moral nation. There are those who stand on the edge of the mountain and take a partial view. They talk about Jews who may be accused of crimes or improprieties. They dissect individuals and embellish what they perceive as character flaws or personal faults. They point to those flaws as if they represent the entire person, as others point to harmful Jews as if they were the entire nation. And then they shout their curses. But Bilaam could not find the breach that he was looking for. Because Israel as a nation, as well as each individual Jew, cannot be judged by anything less than a total picture - for we are all one.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Shoe Salesman </strong><br><br>Matthew 19:26<br>Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."<br><br>Dwight L. Moody was a poorly educated, unordained, shoe salesman who felt God's call to preach the gospel. Early one morning he and some friends gathered in a hay field for a season of prayer, confession, and consecration. His friend Henry Varley said, "The world has yet to see what God can do with and for and through and in a man who is fully and wholly consecrated to Him." Moody was deeply moved by these words. He later went to a meeting where Charles Spurgeon was speaking. In that meeting Moody recalled the words spoken by his friend, "The world had yet to see!...with and for and through and in!...A man!" Varley meant any man! Varley didn't say he had to be educated, or brilliant, or anything else. Just a man! Well, by the Holy Spirit in him, he'd be one of those men. Then suddenly, in that high gallery, he saw something he'd never realized before. It was not Mr. Spurgeon, after all, who was doing that work; it was God. And if God could use Mr. Spurgeon, why should He not use the rest of us, and why should we not all just lay ourselves at the Master's feet and say to Him, "Send me! Use me!"<br><br>D.L. Moody was an ordinary man who sought to be fully and wholly committed to Christ. God did extraordinary things through this ordinary man. Moody became one of the great evangelists of modern times. He founded a Bible college, Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, that sends out men and women trained in service for God.<br><br>Are you an ordinary man or woman in whom God wants to do extraordinary things? God desires that for every child of His. Ask God to do extraordinary things in your life. Begin today to trust Him to accomplish great things for His Kingdom through you.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Situational Ethics </strong><br><br>Psalms 15:1-2<br>Lord, who may dwell in Your sanctuary? Who may live on Your holy hill? He whose walk is blameless and who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from his heart.<br><br>"I cannot believe they are not going to honor my bonus agreement," said the executive who was about to take another position in a new city. Her understanding of her present work agreement called for a bonus at the end of the year. Management saw the situation differently. "It's not right. I am entitled to that bonus," she complained.<br><br>It was time to leave. The company had given her a laptop to use. However, when she left, she decided that because the company was not going to pay her the bonus she was entitled to, she would simply keep the laptop as compensation due her. "And they would never miss it," she reasoned. She was now in the employment of the new company. As each day passed, she grew more uneasy about her decision. She could not get it off her mind. Finally, she concluded that the Holy Spirit was telling her this decision was wrong and that she needed to call her former boss to confess her action. She called him and confessed what she had done and why she had done it. Her boss accepted her confession and forgave her. Strangely enough, he allowed her to keep the laptop computer.<br><br>Truth never changes. It is absolute. When we make decisions based on other actions that are taken, we move into making decisions based on the situation, not truth and righteousness. The executive may indeed have been wronged, but she had to address the wrong in the appropriate way. Trying to compensate for the wrong by doing something that violates another scriptural principle is called situational ethics. If the executive had never been wronged by the employer, do you think she would have felt justified in taking the computer? Probably not. When you isolate the two situations, you see that one action was taken in response to the other action.<br><br>Have you had any experiences in which you have used situational ethics? The Lord desires His people to have a higher standard, even at the cost of being wronged. Ask the Lord to reveal any business practices that may indicate situational ethics. You might be surprised what will happen when you do the right thing.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Habit Forming</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Raymond Beyda<br>May my soul die the death of the upright, and my end be like his. Bemidbar 23:10<br><br>The onslaught of the Jews was imminent. Balak the King of Moab and his people trembled at the thought of battle with the people of Hashem. He knew that their strength was not with conventional weapons but instead with the power of their mouths. It was prayer and Torah study that made the Jews victorious and so he planned to fight fire with fire. He hired Bilaam the Gentile prophet to come to the scene of battle and curse the sons of Yaakob.<br><br>He knew he could not win in hand to hand combat but perhaps he would be victorious in mouth to mouth warfare.<br><br>Fortunately, Hashem intervened and the intended curses left the lips of the wicked prophet as blessings. Amongst the praises with which he glorified the Jews was the statement quoted above. Bilaam expressed a desire to die like the pious Jewish people. Our commentators explain that Bilaam was not willing to give up his bestial desires but would have liked to die by being righteous for the minimum amount of time before death. He did not want to live like a Jew but he did want to die like one.<br><br>The Talmud in Gittin tells of the conversion of Onkeleos, the nephew of a Roman Emperor. At a loss as to whether or not to proceed with the process of becoming a Jew or remaining a Gentile, he summoned the soul of Bilaam and asked him, Â“Who are the ones that are important and prestigious in the next world?Â”<br><br>Â“YisraelÂ” was the quick reply.<br><br>Â“Should I join them?Â”<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t seek their peace or their good ever!Â” replied the spirit.<br><br>It is quite shocking. A man living in the next world, the world of truth, sees the greatness of our people, and yet advises Onkeleos to hate them. How could he give such poor advice? Rav Hayim Zichik ztÂ’l proposes that the answer lies in the fact that when one passes on to the Olam HaBah, one takes with them self the values and traits one developed here in this world. Bilaam who groomed a real hate for the Jews here could not abandon those negative feelings even when residing in the world of truth.<br><br>In his sefer (book) "Kol Dodi", R Shalom Shwardron ztÂ’l points out that many people work on repentance throughout the month of Elul and through the ten days of teshubah and yet return to their sinful habits soon after the High Holy Days pass. He reveals that the nature of a beaver is to walk in a straight line. The beaver is not able to circle past a trap even though the creatureÂ’s life depends on avoiding a hole in its path. The beaver stands at the edge of the trap Â– whines a bit - and then moves forward right into the clutches of the hunterÂ’s lair.<br><br>This may explain the saying of Resh Lakish (Eruvin 19a): Â“The wicked, even at the doorway of Gehinom (Hell) do not repent!Â” Stubborn in their ways and restricted by their bad habits they do not improve or repent even when faced with the punishments that await them.<br><br>Breaking a habit is one of the most difficult endeavors a man can attempt. We learn from Bilaam that if one does not accomplish self-improvement here on Earth then one takes his or her flaws with oneself to Eternity. Therefore, each of us should resolve to begin a lifelong self-reclamation project. One should commit to small improvements day by day. Everyone should work on the flaws so that one truly dies the death of the righteous and goes to the next world (after a full good life here) ready to enjoy the World of Truth. To die like a Jew, one must live like a Jew.<br><br>Shabbat Shalom<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Money Order - Getting Our Priorities Straight</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Eliyahu Hoffmann<br><br>While Bila'am seems at first reluctant to heed Balak's request to come to Moav and curse Bnei Yisrael, he ultimately acquiesces. All the same, he warns them that he can not control the outcome:<br><br>Bila'am said to the servants of Balak, "If Balak were to give me his houseful of silver and gold, I am still unable to disobey the word of Hashem, my G-d, to do anything small or large." (22:18 )<br><br>Chazal are critical of him for these words.<br><br>Whoever has these three traits are among the disciples of the wicked Bila'am: An evil eye; an arrogant spirit; and a greedy soul. (Avos 5:22)<br><br>Rashi (here) explains that we see Bila'am had a greedy soul because he said, "Even were Balak to give me his houseful of silver and gold..." - "he was obviously greedy, and coveted the property of others."<br><br>What is intriguing and somewhat problematic is that a very similar statement was made by one of our great sages:<br><br>Rabbi Yosi ben Kisma said: I was once walking on the road when a man met me... He said to me, "Rebbi, would you be willing to live with us in our place? I would give you thousands upon thousands of golden dinars, precious stones, and pearls." I replied, "Even if you were to give me all the silver and gold, precious stones and pearls in the world, I would dwell nowhere but in a place of Torah." (Avos 6:9)<br><br>Rabbi Yosi is obviously not to be counted among the disciples of Bila'am, yet his response - that he could not transgress Hashem's word no matter what the price - seems startlingly similar to that of Bila'am. (M'rafsin Igrei vol. 6)<br><br>Let us raise another difficulty: How did R' Yosi know that this gentleman's city was not a place of Torah? It would not be surprising that even a Torah'dig city would want the honour of having one of the generation's great sages among its midst. What was it about his offer that led R' Yosi to assume that the city in question was devoid of serious Torah study and appreciation?<br><br>Mr. Isaac Friedman was one of the thousands of holocaust survivors that arrived in the United States as refugees in the early 1950's. In order to keep Shabbos, Mr. Friedman scraped together just enough money to open a small drapery store on the lower level of his apartment building in Philadelphia. Business was slow. Nonetheless, every Friday before sunset he would close up his store and go upstairs to get ready for Shabbos.<br><br>One Friday, just before closing, three people entered. "My name is Henry Ballod," said the leader. "We've come from Wildwood, New Jersey, and we need drapes for our motel. It's got eighty windows - can you handle it?"<br><br>Realizing that such a large job would require many hours of material selection, Mr. Friedman knew there was no way it could be completed before Shabbos. Politely but firmly, he said, "I'm a religious Jew and I don't work past sunset on Friday. Please come back after the weekend and I'll be glad to help you."<br><br>"Are you mad?!" shouted Mr. Ballod. "We came from over a hundred miles away. We don't have time to wait for you. We'll go elsewhere." And they stormed out.<br><br>"I'll do a cheaper and better job," Mr. Friedman called after them. "Just come back after Shabbos."<br><br>Monday morning, to Mr. Friedman's great surprise, the men returned. Without mentioning a word about Friday's incident, they chose their drapes and gave him a deposit. Mr. Friedman completed the job, and they were satisfied.<br><br>After that, business really picked up. Mr. Friedman was ordering supplies by the truckload. Just weeks ago, he was an unknown penniless immigrant; now he had a booming business.<br><br>Months later Mr. Friedman was in Wildwood, New Jersey, when he heard a voice from across the street. "Friedman - I sent them all."<br><br>Mr. Friedman looked up and saw Mr. Ballod beaming at him. He told Mr. Friedman that at a recent hotel and motel owner's convention, he took the podium and told the whole audience about his experience. "How you insisted on closing the store before sunset on Friday, despite the fear of losing such a big job. I told them how impressed I was by the way you respected G-d more than money. Your morals are more important to you than the bottom line. And in the end, you did a good job for a good price. Someone like you, I told them, can be trusted!" (Adapted from Visions of Greatness, R' Yosef Weiss, 1993)<br><br>How did R' Yosi ben Kisma know that the man came from a place devoid of serious Torah study and values? He tried to sway R' Yosi with money - as if to equate the monetary gain of living among them with whatever losses he would suffer as a result of the move. He tried to "buy off" his Torah with gold and silver. In a place where the true value of Torah was understood, R' Yosi told himself, they would understand that the value of money in comparison to keeping G-d's word was so unimportant that it would be juvenile to use monetary wealth as the initial "bait" with which to lure a renowned Talmid Chacham to their city. Sure, dollars and cents would at some point have to be discussed, but that it should be first and foremost - this man could only be from a city barren of true importance for Torah.<br><br>In response to his proposal, R' Yosi replied, "You presume to equate Torah with jewels and precious metals. All the money and wealth in the world could never sway my resolve and cause me to compromise my adherence to Torah study and its principles!" (see D'muyos Hod 3:20 quoting R' Meir Don Plotzki z"l, author of K'li Chemdah)<br><br>Bila'am's response differed greatly. In Balak's offer, no specific mention was made of wealth. It was Bila'am that brought "his houseful of silver and gold" into the conversation. Also, Bila'am did not say, "Even were Balak to give me... I would not transgress Hashem's word," but rather, "I am unable to transgress the word of Hashem" - i.e. gold and jewels could sway my resolve, but things are beyond my control.<br><br>Those who fear the word of G-d don't even give wealth and riches a second thought; those who don't covet them and are easily swayed from their "principles."<br></div>

The consultant was delighted to have the opportunity. It was the first new business opportunity he'd had in some time. He had just come out of some very difficult business and personal circumstances in the last few years. A few months into the relationship, the CEO asked the consultant to manage the entire marketing department, placing him over the current marketing staff. It appeared that God was blessing his efforts with several successful initiatives. The consultant began to build a relationship with a few of the executives. One day, the sales manager came into his office and asked for help on a personal crisis. One thing led to another, and two months later, the consultant found himself leading the sales manager in the sinner's prayer in the sales manager's office.<br><br>God prepares His servants in many ways to accomplish His purpose. The story of Joseph is repeated every business day in the lives of His people. The circumstances may be different, but the results are the same. God trains His servant through sometimes difficult "boot camps." When that training is complete, He places them in strategic places to be a provider-both physically and spiritually.<br><br>Is God preparing you to be a provider in the marketplace? Do not fret at the difficult training ground you may be required to endure. He has a plan. If you'll allow Him to carry out His plan, you'll be privileged to be used by the Master's hand.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Going into Business </strong><br><br>Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?<br><br>Â—Amos 3:3<br><br>There are a number of things included in the concept of walking with God. The Bible says that we need to walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:16). We should walk rooted in Him (Colossians 2:6Â–7). We should walk humbly with Him (Micah 6:8 ). It means moving in harmony with God, staying close to Him. The prophet Amos wrote, Â“Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?Â” (Amos 3:3). This phrase Â“walking with GodÂ” speaks of a joint effort.<br><br>If you go into business with someone, it means pooling your resources. Maybe you both have small businesses, even competing businesses, and one day you go to that person and agree to work together. You draw up the contracts and pool your resources. He has his clients, you have your clients, and suddenly you broaden your base.<br><br>Walking with God is like going into business with God. This means that I take all of my resources, which obviously are quite limited, and  say, Â“Lord, here is what I have to bring. I give myself to You.Â”<br><br>Then God says, Â“Here is what I bring to the table. I bring My omniscience. I bring My unlimited power. I bring My grace. I bring all that I have.Â”<br><br>Essentially it would be like a millionaire going into business with a homeless person. ThatÂ’s a pretty good deal. The homeless person will benefit because all the millionaireÂ’s resources are now at his or her disposal. But it also means that all of his or her resources are at the millionaireÂ’s disposal.<br><br>When we walk with God, it is true that everything God has, He is using to work out His will for our lives. But it is also true that all we have is dedicated to Him.<br><br>Greg Laurie</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Filling of the Spirit</strong><br><br>Ephesians 5:18 says, "And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit." Paul is purposefully setting up a comparison here between drunkenness and the filling of the Spirit. Drunkenness, of course, is wrong, whereas the filling of the Spirit is desirable, even as stated here, commanded. Drunkenness and the filling of the Spirit do have some things in common, which is why Paul would attempt to compare them. In both instances, the person acted upon either by the alcohol or the Spirit of God is controlled by that which is influencing them. The person is totally yielded, submitted, and surrendered to the whims and ways of that which acts upon them and in them. Alcohol brings out the bad desires of the heart without immediately feeling bad about the resultant wrong actions, while the Spirit of God brings about life, godliness, and fruitfulness. Both have great influence upon people, and we can conclude that the filling of the Spirit is a state of being in which the believer lets God have His way in his heart. Self seeking is abandoned and exchanged for seeking the pleasure and purposes of God. This is not a bitter obedience or an obedience which looks to exalt self, but this is an obedience that is consumed totally and exclusively with the glory of God. The filling of the Spirit moves a person to obey with joy as he is consumed with the awe, majesty, and perfection of God. This is a state of utmost freedom and usefulness to God, and it is a state where believers are commanded to be regularly, continually, and on an ongoing basis.<br><br>I think it is possible to miss the simplicity of the filling of the Spirit and to get off course chasing some mystical experience which we can call our own filling of the Spirit. We could worry ourselves into a frenzy by trying to pray every day for the filling of the Spirit and wonder if we ever were indeed filled. The filling of the Spirit is available to all believers from day one as a follower of Christ. If we walk in humility and abide with Christ, we can expect to be filled. If we quench the Spirit or grieve Him with sin or pride, we can expect not to be filled. All believers have the Spirit within their hearts; the issue is whether or not they are letting the Spirit have all of their hearts. Filling is thus a yielding to the SpiritÂ’s leading and guiding as we depend upon Him for strength rather than upon ourselves and tremble before the Word of God in humility. It is not some advanced state of being, but it is a yielding. The best way to think of filling is just like going to the gas station. We go to the gas station because our gas tank is empty. We need fuel in order for our vehicle to run and take us where we need to go. Spiritually, we need energy. The Word of God is our food, but it is the Spirit which "metabolizes" the food into useable energy as He gives us insight, understanding, and the will and ability to apply the truth of the Scripture. We need to be refueled on the Spirit which we do by continuing to acknowledge our emptiness apart from God and as we place our faith in Him for strength. We must believe that without His empowerment, we have an empty tank. That is, apart from Him, we can do nothing of spiritual value (John 15:5). Once we understand this, we can be filled to let Him do through us what we could never do on our own. The resultant faithfulness and fruitfulness as God accomplishes great things through us by His Spirit is evidence that we have indeed been filled with the Spirit. We cannot be filled unless we first recognize and admit by faith that we are empty save for the grace and power of God.<br><br>How the command to "be filled" is stated is also important. It implies a yielding to the work of God because it commands us to let God do something to us and in us. We do have a choice in the matter, but it is a choice to let God do what God wants to do. Thus, filling requires yielding. The command also implies that we continue to be filled; that is, we are to live as those who are filled with the Spirit. We are not to live sometimes filled, yielding upon the Spirit for grace, while other times depending upon our own strength as we exalt in our own emptiness. Going from filled to empty and back and forth over and over again speaks of a spiritual instability and a pride problem. GodÂ’s call is to be continually filled as we continually walk in humility and obedience to Him so that He fills us and empowers us to do His will. Thus, the command says that we are to "be filled." The burden of work is on the Holy Spirit. Our responsibility is to come to Him empty, humble, and in faith. As we surrender and submit to God, we can rest assured that God will fill us to have the power to obey and do His will.<br><br>In Acts 4:31 we read, "And when they had prayed, the place where they had gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness." In verse 28, prior to GodÂ’s answer of their prayer, we see their heart in the matter when they say, "Do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur." This is the key in being filled with the Spirit. There was no question about the humility of the disciples or of their desire to obey. Yet they knew that they needed the power of God to work through them, or they were in a situation too difficult for them to handle. They came to God recognizing their emptiness and their need for His strength and empowerment. They came fully yielded, willing to do whatever God wanted them to do. They submitted fully to the will of God and surrendered to His leading completely. This posture of emptiness is when God delights in filling us with His strength, boldness, courage, and wisdom.<br><br>May we humble ourselves to recognize our emptiness and glory in His fullness (Colossians 1:19) so that we can be filled with His Spirit to do His will.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Copyright:<br>'Dose of Truth' Copyright 2007 Â© Brent Barnett.

And that is what we are!<br><br>"I have an important business meeting in the morning. Would you please set the alarm for 5:30 a.m.?" I said to my wife.<br><br>"Oh, that won't be necessary. Just tell the Lord what time you want to wake up. He does it for me all the time," my wife said.<br><br>I rolled my eyes in disbelief. "Well, I'd feel more comfortable if we set the alarm."<br><br>"Okay, ye of little faith. But just to prove my point I am going to ask the Lord to wake us up just before 5:30."<br><br>The next morning I awoke before the alarm went off. I looked at the clock. It read 5:15. I looked at my wife, who had just awakened at the same time with an I-told-you-so smile.<br><br>Sometimes we wrongfully view God as someone we go to for only the "big things." The idea of "bothering God" for such a trivial matter seems foolish and presumptuous. However, when you were a child and had to get up in the morning for school, didn't your mom or dad come wake you up? They were your parents, and you could come to them with the most trivial concerns or requests. Why would our heavenly Father be any less approachable? Perhaps our problem is that we simply have not developed a level of intimacy with God so that we feel the freedom to approach Him at these daily, routine levels. We often operate with an unwritten code that says our needs must have a certain degree of importance or crisis before we come to God with them. This is not God's character towards us.<br><br>Does the Lord desire this level of intimacy with you and me? The apostle Paul exhorted us to "pray without ceasing" (1 Thess. 5:17 KJV). There is never a caution to pray only about matters of greater importance.<br><br>Today, go to God with matters that you might view as trivial and would normally avoid bringing to God. Ask God to increase your level of intimacy with Him. You may even be able to get rid of your alarm clock.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Is Sincerity at Steak?</strong><br><br>This week, we find the gentile world's greatest prophet, Bila'am, challenged by bot his conscience, Hashem's will and of course, a formidable foe. Balak, the King of Moav asked him to cast a curse upon the Jewish nation. He sent a delegation of servants to implore him, but Bila'am refused. His hands were tied, or more accurately, his lips were sealed. After besseching the Almighty for permission to curse the Jewis nation, "Hashem said to Balaam, 'You shall not go with them! You shall not curse the people, for it is blessed!'" (Numbers 22:12)<br><br>Despite Bila'am's initial refusal, Balak was determined. He sent another delegation, this time, distinguished officers, "higher ranking than the previous" (ibid v.15) "They came to Balaam and said to him, "So said Balak son of Zippor, 'Do not refrain from going to me. for I shall honor you greatly, and everything that you say to me I shall do; so go now and curse this people for me.' Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, "If Balak will give me his houseful of silver and gold, I cannot transgress the word of Hashem, my G-d, to do anything small or great:But Bila'am does not leave it at that. He really wants to be a part of the plot. That night he resubmits his request to Hashem, and this time G-d acquiesces. Hashem came to Balaam at night and said to him, "If the men came to summon you, arise and go with them, but only the thing that I shall speak to you -- that shall you do" (ibid v. 20). And so, the Torah tells us, the next day, "Bila'am arose in the morning and personally saddled his she-donkey and went with the officers of Moab." " (ibid v. 21).<br><br>The next verse seems strange. Even though just a few p'sukim prior, Bila'am had attained permission, the Torah tells us, "Hashem's wrath flared because he was going, and an angel of Hashem stood on the road to impede him."<br><br>The question is straightforward. If Bila'am attained permission to accompany them, why was " Hashem's wrath flared"? After all if G-d said yes, what did he expect?<br><br>There is an old Jewish story about the shnorrer who goes collecting one Sunday in the prestigious community synagogue, pleading for funds. Though the prestigious synagogue had a "no solicitor" policy, the President of the congregation was somehow convinced of the beggars sincerity.<br><br>After the three morning minyanim, the man walks out of the synagogue with a smile.<br><br>A few hours later he parks himself in the town's most elegant restaurant and orders a rib-eye steak. The President of the synagogue walks in and notices the schnorrer, cloth napkin tucked conspicuously under his chin, with a succulent steak resting on his plate nestled comfortably between a portion of fried potatoes and asparagus.<br><br>"Hands on his hips the flabbergasted president accosted the man.<br><br>"Is that what you do with the money you collected in our synagogue?"<br><br>The pauper shrugged his shoulders and shrugged. "I don't understand. When I don't have money I can't eat steak. When I do have money I shouldn't eat steak. So when, may I ask, can I eat steak?"<br><br>Billam, at first is refused permission to go with Balak's advisors. He seems to be reluctant to even consider the offer, claiming that even if he is offered a houseful of the gold and silver he can't go. Yet Balak perseveres, Bila'am re-requests and Hashem finally agrees, caveats attached.<br><br>But instead of Billam using his new-found permission to reluctantly trudge along, he develops a whole new attitude. He is up at the crack of dawn, he passionately saddles his own donkey, a chore normally delegated to his servants, Hashem sees that Billam is not being coerced, nor schlepped, rather, "He is going." Then His ire flares. Hashem's reluctant approval turned into Bila'ams enthusiastic accompaniment.<br><br>Life often presents us the opportunities, in which our ingrained convictions are challenged. Sometimes we must bend the rules. Attend a meeting, in an unfamiliar atmosphere; sharing a drink with an unsavory client; spending an evening with a haughty politician. The question is simple; once we have the opportunity to drift, do we attach ourselves to the flotsam and ride the waves with zest. Or is every step of the way met with the original emotions of reluctance and apprehension. Billam's originally refused to go along. He told Balak he just couldn't go. But when he received permission from Hashem, his attitude changed quickly. From a pronounced subservience to G-d's the reluctant prophet became the enthusiastic co-conspirator saddling his own donkey and excitingly joining the evil plotters. How quickly do his loyalties adjust! When given the opportunity, it is easy for a despondent pauper to turn into an indulging guzzler. Sometimes, it doesn't matter if our conscience is at stake, when a steak intrudes upon our conscience.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br>Dedicated to a continued refuah shlaimah for Yehuda Boruch ben Sora Menucha<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Copyright Â© 2001 by Rabbi M.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Reflecting on G-d</strong><br><br>Rabbi Rabbi Moshe Peretz Gilden<br><br>With the Jewish people complaining of thirst, Moshe and Aaron retreated to the Tabernacle for Divine guidance. They were instructed to speak to a specific rock and it would provide the needed water. Moshe inadvertently spoke to the wrong rock, and, lacking an alternative approach, chose to employ a tactic G-d instructed him to use in an earlier circumstance: hitting the rock (see Rashi, Bamidbar/Numbers 20:11). G-d, in his infinite compassion, allowed the water to flow forth from the rock, but Moshe and Aaron were chastised and punished. "Because you did not believe in Me to sanctify Me in the eyes of the Children of Israel, therefore you will not bring this congregation to the Land I have given them." (20:12) Bringing forth water from a rock in the middle of a desert is quite a miracle. In what way did Moshe diminish the honor of G-d?<br><br>Rabbi Yosef Albo (1380-1444; Rabbi of Saragossa, Spain and later Castille; proficient in medicine, mathematics and philosophy and famous for his religio-philisophical work Sefer HaIkkarim/Book of Principles) explains that one branch of the belief in Divine Providence is the understanding that G-d bends nature to the will of righteous believers. As the need arises, they have the ability to pray for a miracle and G-d grants their wish. Tanach (the Bible) is replete with incidents of prophets and great individuals in Jewish history who performed miracles. Here, too, Moshe should have prayed for a miracle from the outset and not withdrawn to the Tabernacle.<br><br>Meshech Chochmah (Rabbi Meir Simcha HaKohen of Dvinsk; 1843-1926; foremost Torah scholar of his time) elucidates that throughout Moshe's leadership of the Jewish people G-d determined when it was appropriate to utilize a miracle - in contrast to later prophets who announced that a miracle would occur and G-d responded by fulfilling their call. Moshe chose a different modus operandi because of his humility. Whereas other prophets would physically tremble when they were receiving their prophesy, making it readily evident that the forthcoming miracle was coming from a higher power, G-d communicated with Moshe as a person speaks to his friend. Without the visible tremoring, Moshe feared the masses would believe the miracles actually came from him, as if he possessed some Divine power, so he always requested Divine assistance and let G-d formulate the method to address the quandary.<br><br>The exception to Moshe's rule was the events involving Korach in last week's parsha. When Korach rebelled and publicly questioned the legitimacy of his leadership, Moshe proclaimed that a miracle would happen and G-d opened the earth, which swallowed Korach and his co-conspirators, just as Moshe had stated. Moshe broke his own rule because the situation mandated a display of his spiritual greatness and the intimacy of his relationship with G-d - to demonstrate G-d's endorsement of his leadership.<br><br>Now, Moshe reverted to his original practice. But the nation now knew that he had the ability to call for miracles, and, not appreciating the unique nature of the Korach situation, they questioned why he was only willing to do so for the sake of his leadership but not for the Jewish people at a time of distress. Moshe's decision to not openly call upon the rock to give water at a time that the needs of the masses mandated such a miracle desecrated the Divine name, a great dishonor to G-d.<br><br>We are all leaders - as teachers, as parents and even as peers. We must appreciate that our actions are watched and interpreted - even misinterpreted - reflecting on us and, more significantly, as Jews, reflecting on the Jewish people and on G-d.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Symbolism over Substance</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>In one of the most difficult episodes in the Torah, this week we read how Moshe loses his entitlement to enter the Land he so desired to inherit. What happened is as follows: during the desert journey, a miraculous well traveled with the Jews. This well existed in the merit of Miriam. When she died, it ceased to flow. The Jews complained bitterly that they were thirsty. Hashem commanded Moshe to "take his staff and speak to the rock," thereupon the rock would disgorge water to nourish a parched people. Moshe did not end up speaking to the rock. The nation was upset and impatient. When Moshe chose the wrong rock they chided him. "He in turn turned to them and said, "Listen you rebellious folk. Do you expect me to draw water from this rock?" (Numbers 20:10) Immediately Moshe hit the rock instead of speaking to it and water flowed from it.<br><br>Hashem is angered by Moshe's actions. "Because you have not sanctified me in the eyes of the nation, you will not enter the the land of Israel. (Numbers 20:12) Rashi, the classic medieval commentator, departs from his standard text-based explanation and bases his explanation of this verse upon the Midrash. "Imagine," said Hashem, "if the Jewish nation would have seen that scenario. A rock, that does not talk nor hear and does not need sustenance, produces water by the request of the Almighty. Surely, they would have taken heart when Hashem speaks to them! The impact would have been far more reaching!<br><br>Moshe's prelude to his action is noteworthy: "Listen, you rebellious folk. Do you expect me to draw water from this rock?"<br><br>The nation just wanted water, they did not ask for miracles or rock-wells. It was Hashem who told Moshe to approach the rock. Moshe knew that the water would come. Then why was his admonition given in the inquisitive mode, rather it should have been decreed in the declarative mode! Listen you rebellious folk! I am going to extract water from a rock? It seems that Moshe, himself, (Heaven-forbid) doubted his own authority. (Though many commentaries explain the question as rhetorical.)<br><br>Surely, the rock-water connection cannot be taken at face value. All who have merely dappled in the writing of our sages are familiar with the water as Torah and the rock dry and parched. Obviously, Hashem meant to send a message that even the driest stone can produce water. Why then did Moshe not play on that lesson to the rebellious folk and tell them that even the driest amongst them could become a wellspring of Torah?<br><br>Reb Shraga Faivel Mendelovitz was the founder of Yeshiva Torah Voda'ath. Once he stayed in Miami for Shabbos at the home of a former student. The man escorted the Rebbe home from synagogue, but when he opened the door the young man was shocked and embarrassed. His wife, exhausted from a week's worth of child rearing, and the responsibility of keeping a home was sprawled on the couch. The Shabbos table was half-set, the dishes placed in a pile next to the kiddush cup and wine. In front of the head seat were two large challos sitting uncovered.<br><br>The custom is to cover the challos when making kiddush. As the blessing over bread normally precedes that of wine it is a somewhat an metaphorical embarrassment to the bread thus it is covered during the kiddush.<br><br>The student, who was embarrassed at the state of affairs, called out to his wife in a somewhat demeaning manner. "Please let us prepare the table in its entirety." Turning to his mentor, he exclaimed, "I'm sure that leaving the bread uncovered was an oversight! Everyone knows," he exclaimed shifting his self-inflicted embarrassment upon his wife, "that we must cover the challah before the kiddush.<br><br>Reb Mendelovitz was annoyed at the man's self-righteous behavior and turned to him. "Over the years, I have heard many problems that people faced. Students, couples, and adults from all walks of life have entered my office to discuss their personal situations with me. Not once did a challah ever enter my office, suffering an inferiority complex because it was left uncovered during kiddush! Do you know why?<br><br>Because we are not concerned with the challah! We are concerned with making ourselves cognizant of feelings. We worry about challahs because the goal is to worry about people. How than can you embarrass your wife over not covering the challah when the act of covering is supposed to train you in sensitivity?"<br><br>Moshe understood the valuable lesson that Hashem wanted to teach His nation. But if all that was on their minds was water to drink and not the great lessons for eternity, he questioned his mission. Listen you rebellious folk," he questioned. "Do you expect me to draw water from this rock?" Do you expect that the lessons of the great parable can be taught to those whose minds are only set on the parable itself? Perhaps that is why Moshe cast the great lessons aside and hit the rock, thus disobeying Hashem's initial command. Perhaps he felt that a nation that focuses solely on the flow of drinking water couldn't understand the wellsprings of its spirituality.<br><br>In the corporeal world that our sages call a "foyer to the World To Come," we must realize that everything is a preparation for eternity. All of life's experiences can teach us how to grow and how to strive. But like extracting water from a well, we must all dig a little deeper.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Forever a Donkey</strong><br><br>How is it possible for a pompous fool to have the gift of prophecy, to communicate directly with Hashem? This question immediately springs to mind as we read the amazing story of Bilaam in this weekÂ’s parshah. Bilaam had immense powers. He could marshal awesome cosmic forces to serve his designs. He could foresee the future all the way to Messianic times. And yet he seems to have been an evil, moneygrubbing buffoon ridiculed by his own donkey. How could this be?<br><br>Our Sages tell us that Bilaam did not earn his gift of prophecy through any merit of his own. Rather, it was because Hashem did not want the gentiles to have any excuses for their rejection of the Torah. He did not want them to say, Â“We are not to blame. The Jewish people had Moses as their prophet, but we had no one.Â” Therefore, Hashem gave them a prophet of comparable power in the corrupt person of Bilaam.<br><br>But the question still remains: True, Bilaam did not attain prophecy because of his fine character and spiritual qualities. Nonetheless, shouldnÂ’t the very experience of communicating with Hashem have wrought fundamental changes in his character? How could he remain such a silly fool after perceiving the grandest prophetic visions?<br><br>Furthermore, when Hashem sent the angel to dissuade him from his sinister plans, why was it necessary for the angel to address him through the mouth of his donkey? Why didnÂ’t the angel speak to him directly?<br><br>The commentators point out that the word used to describe the initiation of contact between Hashem and Bilaam is almost identical to the word describing the initiation of contact between Hashem and Moses, and yet they are worlds apart. Â“Vayekar Elokim el Bilaam,Â” the Torah (23:3) states. Â“And the Lord chanced upon Bilaam.Â” It was like a chance encounter, brusque, businesslike, distasteful. Not so with Moses. Â“Vayikra el Moshe,Â” the Torah (Leviticus 1:1) declares. Â“And He called to Moses.Â” Hashem calls out to him with excitement and awaits him with anticipation, so to speak.<br><br>The difference in spelling between the words vayekar and vayikra is one aleph, and in the Torah that aleph appears in reduced size. Here lies the key to the difference between Moses and Bilaam.<br><br>It is possible for two people to have the same experience, and yet, one will be deeply affected while the other remains indifferent. Everything depends on the mindset. Moses was the quintessential humble man. The tiny aleph symbolizes the insignificance of his ani, his ego, and this humility and submission to the Creator gave him the receptiveness and clarity of vision to attain true greatness.<br><br>Bilaam, on the other hand, was a pompous, arrogant and selfish fool, and this overwhelming self-absorption clouded his vision and stunted his spiritual growth. For all his wondrous prophetic powers, he remained forever a fool. This was the message of the talking donkey. Â“Do not think your prophetic ability makes you exalted,Â” Hashem was saying to him. Â“Behold, your donkey is also speaking, yet he remains forever a donkey.Â”<br><br>A country bumpkin once asked a great sage how to go about meeting Eliyahu Hanavi.<br><br>Â“According to a Kabbalistic teaching,Â” said the sage, Â“if you remain silent for forty days you merit meeting the prophet.Â”<br><br>The man clamped his mouth shut, and for the next forty days, to the immense frustration of his family, he went about his everyday business without uttering a word. The forty days passed, however, without any supernatural visitations., and the man complained to the sage.<br><br>Â“And what did you do during these forty days besides being silent?Â” asked the sage. Â“Did you study Torah? Did you devote time to prayer and introspection?Â”<br><br>The man squinted at the sage and shook his head. Â“I did what I always do,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“Look out there,Â” said the sage, pointing to the window. Â“Do you see that donkey? He hasnÂ’t spoken a word for forty days either.Â”<br><br>In our own lives, we all experience moments of unusual transcendence from time to time, moments of intense inspiration that have the power to uplift our souls and effect in us lasting spiritual changes. But it does not happen by itself. If we can find within ourselves the spiritual strength to be receptive, if we can rise above the distractions of our mundane existence and connect with the vast eternal truths of the universe, we can discover a joy and serenity we never thought existed.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Text Copyright Â© 2007 by Rabbi Naftali Reich<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Absolute Greatness </strong><br><br>By Rabbi Moshe Peretz Gilden<br>The Jewish nation, camped in the desert near the border of Moav, posed a tremendous threat to the Moavites. The king of Moav chose to fight the Jews by hiring Ba'alam, a great magician and a prophet equal to Moshe, to curse them. G-d thwarted this plan by placing in his mouth words of blessing instead. "G-d reversed the curse to a blessing." (Devarim/Deuteronomy 23:6) As the blessings were reversals of the curses, looking into the blessings reveals how he wanted to curse us and opens our eyes to the core of our Nation's essence.<br><br>Ba'alam's first blessing declared, "Behold! It is a nation that will dwell in solitude and not be reckoned among the nations." (Bamidbar/Numbers 23:9) Is this, indeed, a blessing? Dwelling in solitude does not sound like a good plight. Further, if this is the reversal of the curse, then the curse would have been that we dwell with other peoples and be reckoned among other nations. This does not sound like a terrible curse.<br><br>Rabbi Michel Twerski (1) expounds that the Hebrew for "reckoned" - yis'chashav - can also be translated as "calculate". Thus, the verse is concluding that the Jewish Nation "will not calculate based on other nations." The Children of Israel were blessed that they will not determine their success with a relative standard comparing them to the contemporary ideals of other nations. Rather, their accomplishments will be held to an objective standard set for them by G-d as enumerated in the Torah. G-d created in man the ability to achieve immeasurable levels of spirituality. However, this can only be pursued if his goals are rooted in the Divine. If he allows himself comfort by merely surpassing the achievements of another human being, he squanders the potential greatness that would have taken him inestimably closer to G-d. This is the curse that Ba'alam attempted to send the Jewish people: relative greatness.<br><br>Thus, solitude is a blessing. Not unlike the athlete who trains in a secluded location that facilitates a focus on his preparation and growth, so, too, the nation that actively fosters and builds its G-d consciousness desires an environment that assists that development.<br><br>Regarding the Jewish nation, the prophet says, "The number of the children of Israel shall . neither be measured nor counted." (Hosea 2:1) How can this be? Contemporary technology today allows the counting of billions of people with virtually no margin of error. The Commentaries explain the prophet refers to the people's endless potential that cannot be quantified. But the only way to even begin to reach that height is to follow G-d's own absolute standard rather than settling for relative greatness. The standard of the Torah is the greatest catalyst for our achievement; consequently, it was to be the subject of the first curse, which G-d reversed to be our first blessing.<br><br></div>

It is a life based on pleasurable experiences. Many a human being has toiled their whole life to gain a pleasurable lifestyle only to find a life that is empty and meaningless. You only have to watch television for one evening to discover that advertisers want us to believe this is the goal of life. The work-to-play theme is consistent with most advertising messages.<br><br>Solomon was a man who had nothing withheld from his appetite. He was a great builder, a great businessman, and a great lover of women. Every imaginable pleasure was his. Nevertheless, he was to discover that these things alone could not satisfy the human soul.<br><br>A recent trip to a beautiful island left me grateful that God had allowed me to understand the futile trap of the work-to-play lifestyle. It is great to experience times of refreshing and visit beautiful places as long as we don't fall into the trap of thinking that these experiences equal a meaningful life. God's beautiful creation can so easily become a prison of emptiness if Jesus is not in the center of it. The apostle Paul said there is only one way to find meaning and purpose in life:<br><br>I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know Him better. I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints, and His incomparably great power for us who believe... (Ephesians 1:17-19).<br><br>Knowing Christ brings the only real meaning and purpose to the human soul. Spend time today getting to know the Lord in a more intimate way. Then you will discover real meaning and purpose in life.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Changing Our Paradigm of Experience</strong><br>Exodus 3:3<br>So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight-why the bush does not burn up."<br><br>Have you ever heard someone say, "God doesn't work that way? He would never do that." Well, there are times when God chooses to confound the foolish in order to change our paradigm of experience. Moses had never seen a bush that burned but did not burn up. It got his attention and it drew him to God.<br><br>When Jesus appeared on the water in the middle of the night during a storm, the disciples exclaimed, "It's a ghost!" They had never seen a man walk on water. This led to a great miracle-Peter walked on the water, too. When Jesus asked Peter to catch a fish and get the coin from its mouth to pay their taxes, you can imagine what Peter must have thought about those instructions. When Moses got to the Red Sea, he ran out of options. God had an unexpected solution to the Israelites' problem-He parted the Red Sea to demonstrate His power and allow the people of Israel to cross over to flee the Egyptian army.<br><br>Each of these new paradigms was a stepping-stone of an encounter with God so that the individual would experience God in a new way. God used these times to enforce the principle that His ways are not our ways. Whenever we try to predict that God will act in a certain way, He changes the paradigm to keep us from becoming our own little gods.<br><br>Have you ever been guilty of judging someone for an experience they've had that you've never had? Did you dismiss it as extreme or something not of God? God is in the business of changing our paradigm from no personal experiences to God-experiences. However, if you operate on a level of rigid logic, you may never have the privilege of having the God-experiences. Keep your heart free to experience new paradigms with God today<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Our Achilles' Heel</strong><br><br>Bilaam's advice to Balak that the way to defeat Israel was through weakening its moral fiber and not necessarily by war and public curses was shrewd and telling and effective. The enemies of Israel in the desert - the Canaanites, Amalek, Sichon and the Emorites, and Og the king of Bashan - all tried war against the Jewish nation and were ultimately defeated. Balak tries to destroy Israel through Bilaam's mouth - a public relations, media blitz to demonize the Jews. God foils this plan and Bilaam's mouth spouts blessings and compliments upon Israel. There seems no way to really overcome the members of the Jewish people. They are great warriors and the Lord is on their side. But they have an achilles heel that God will not come to protect. They are capable of self-destruction in a major way. And that weakness lies in the temptations of foreign cultures, of a sophisticated idolatry, in a way of sexually immoral lifestyle and illicit behavior. The women of Moav and Midian seduce many of the Jews - especially the tribe of Shimon - into accepting their culture and their mores as a quid pro quo for their bodies. The tribe of Shimon is decimated by a plague that befalls them shortly thereafter. The tribe of Shimon is permanently crippled in Jewish history by this failure of moral will. And, at least temporarily, Bilaam and Balak smirk over their consequences of Jewish self-destruction.<br><br>In our time the Jewish people have survived, Holocaust, war, terror, persecution and unending hatred and bigotry. We have been subjected to a withering and unrepentant badly biased and skewed media portrayal of ourselves and of the State of Israel particularly. Everyone loves to curse us - the EU, the UN, CNN, BBC and the rest of the world's sanctimoniously hypocritical "good guys." But the Lord apparently does not read the editorial page of the New York Times and therefore even this unending bombardment of negativity has in reality had little effect upon us and our situation. However, the seduction of Western culture, of the modern licentiousness of body and spirit, of assimilation and marrying the daughters of Midian and Moav, has weakened us. It has made us smaller in number and weaker in resolve and spirit. Adopting universalistic values that change constantly over basic Jewish values and traditions has crippled us in our struggle to survive and prosper. This behavior and attitude, fostered by secular Jewry, and to a great extent, non-Orthodox Jewish leaders as well, has destroyed our self-identity and self-worth. We are no longer unique and special, with a Godly mission to fulfill but we are like everyone else. And that is our weakness that if not recognized and corrected can lead to disaster and sadness.<br><br>Shabat Shalom.<br>Rabbi Berel Wein<br><br></div>
