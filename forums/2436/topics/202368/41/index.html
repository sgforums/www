            <div class='col-md body'>Grace for the Humble<br>"He giveth grace unto the humble"   (James 4:6).<br><br>Humble hearts seek grace, and therefore they get it. Humble hearts yield to the sweet influences of grace, and so it is bestowed on them more and more largely. Humble hearts lie in the valleys where streams of grace are flowing, and hence they drink of them, Humble hearts are grateful for grace and give the LORD the glory of it, and hence it is consistent with His honor to give it to them.<br><br>Come, dear reader, take a lowly place. Be little in thine own esteem, that the LORD may make much of thee. Perhaps the sigh breaks out, "I fear I am not humble." It may be that this is the language of true humility. Some are proud of being humble, and this is one of the very worst sorts of pride. We are needy, helpless, undeserving, hell-deserving creatures, and if we are not humble we ought to be. Let us humble ourselves because of our sins against humility, and then the LORD will give us to taste of His favor. It is grace which makes us humble, and grace which finds in this humility an opportunity for pouring in more grace. Let us go down that we may rise. Let us be poor in spirit that God may make us rich. Let us be humble that we may not need to be humbled but may be exalted by the grace of God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Avoid That Slip<br>"Then shalt thou walk in thy way of safety, and thy foot shall not stumble"   (Proverbs 3:23).<br><br>That is to say, if we follow the ways of wisdom and holiness we shall be preserved in them. He who travels by daylight along the highway is under some protection. There is a way for every man, namely, his own proper calling in life, and if we devoutly walk therein in the fear of God He will preserve us from evil. We may not travel luxuriously, but we shall walk safely. We may not be able to run like young men, but we shall be able to walk like good men.<br><br>Our greatest danger lies in ourselves: our feeble foot is so sadly apt to stumble. Let us ask for more moral strength that our tendency to slip may be overcome. Some stumble because they do not see the stone in the way: divine grace enables us to perceive sin and so to avoid it. Let us plead this promise and trust in Him who upholds His chosen.<br><br>Alas! Our worst peril is our own carelessness, but against this the LORD Jesus has put us on our guard, saying, "Watch and pray."<br><br>Oh, for grace to walk this day without a single stumble! It is not enough that we do not actually fall; our cry should be that we may not make the smallest slip with out feet but may at the last adore Him "who is able to keep us from stumbling."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Divine Provision<br>"Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall He not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?"   (Matthew 6:30)<br><br>Clothes are expensive, and poor believers may be led into anxiety as to where their next suit will come from. The soles are thin; how shall we get new shoes? See how our thoughtful LORD has provided against this care. Our heavenly Father clothes the grass of the field with a splendor such as Solomon could not equal: will He not clothe His own children? We are sure He will. There may be many a patch and a darn, but raiment we shall have.<br><br>A poor minister found his clothes nearly threadbare, and so far gone that they would hardly hold together; but as a servant of the LORD he expected his Master to find him his livery. It so happened that the writer on a visit to a friend had the loan of the good man's pulpit, and it came into his mind to make a collection for him, and there was his suit. Many other cases we have seen in which those who had served the LORD have found Him considerate of their wardrobe. He who made man so that when he had sinned he needed garments, also in mercy supplied him with them; and those which the LORD gave to our first parents were far better than those they made for themselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Becoming Fit for Glory<br>"The LORD will give grace and glory"   (Psalm 84:11).<br><br>Grace is what we need just now, and it is to be had freely. What can be freer than a gift? Today we shall receive sustaining, strengthening, sanctifying, satisfying grace. He has given daily grace until now, and as for the future, that grace is still sufficient. If we have but little grace the fault most lie in ourselves; for the LORD is not straitened, neither is He slow to bestow it in abundance. We may ask for as much as we will and never fear a refusal. He giveth liberally and upbraideth not.<br><br>The LORD may not give gold, but He will give grace: He may not give gain, but He will give grace. He will certainly send us trial, but He will give grace in proportion thereto. We may be called to labor and to suffer, but with the call there will come all the grace required;<br><br>What an "end" is that in the text -- "and glory!" We do not need glory yet, and we are not yet fit for it; but we shall have it in due order. After we have eaten the bread of grace, we shall drink the wine of glory. We must go through the holy, which is grace, to the holiest of all, which is glory. These words and glory are enough to make a man dance for joy. A little while -- a little while, and then glory forever!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Continue Upright<br>"The prayer of the upright is His delight"   (Proverbs 15:8 ).<br><br>This is as good as a promise, for it declares a present fact, which will be the same throughout all ages. God takes great pleasure in the prayers of upright men; He even calls them His delight. Our first concern is to be upright. Neither bending this way nor that, continue upright; not crooked with policy, nor prostrate by yielding to evil, be you upright in strict integrity and straightforwardness. If we begin to shuffle and shift, we shall be left to shift for ourselves. If we try crooked ways, we shall find that we cannot pray, and if we pretend to do so, we shall find our prayers shut out of heaven.<br><br>Are we acting in a straight line and thus following out the LORD's revealed will? Then let us pray much and pray in faith. If our prayer is God's delight, let us not stint Him in that which gives Him pleasure. He does not consider the grammar of it, nor the metaphysics of it, nor the rhetoric of it; in all these men might despise it. He, as a Father, takes pleasure in the lispings of His own babes, the stammerings of His newborn sons and daughters. Should we not delight in prayer since the LORD delights in it? Let us make errands to the throne. The LORD finds us enough reasons for prayer, and we ought to thank Him that it is so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fear to Fear<br>"Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD"   (Jeremiah 1:8 ).<br><br>Whenever fear comes in and makes us falter, we are in danger of falling into sin. Conceit is to be dreaded, but so is cowardice. "Dare to be a Daniel." Our great Captain should be served by brave soldiers.<br><br>What a reason for bravery is here! God is with those who are with Him. God will never be away when the hour of struggle comes. Do they threaten you? Who are you that you should be afraid of a man that shall die? Will you lose your situation? Your God whom you serve will find bread and water for His servants. Can you not trust Him? Do they pour ridicule upon you? Will this break your bones or your heart? Bear it for Christ's sake, and even rejoice because of it.<br><br>God is with the true, the just, the holy, to deliver them; and He will deliver you. Remember how Daniel came out of the lions' den and the three holy children out of the furnace. Yours is not so desperate a case as theirs; but if it were, the LORD would bear you through and make you more than a conqueror. Fear to fear. Be afraid to be afraid. Your worst enemy is within your own bosom. Get to your knees and cry for help, and then rise up saying, "I will trust, and not be afraid."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Making the Lord our Banner<br>Exodus 17:15<br>Moses built an altar and called it The Lord is my Banner.<br><br>The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. God instructed Moses to stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in his hand. Moses' staff represented something that God said He would use to bring glory to Himself. The staff represented what Moses had done for most of his life-shepherding. It was his vocation. When God first called Moses at the burning bush, He told him to pick up the staff; He would perform miracles through it.<br><br>God wants to perform miracles through each of our vocations. At Rephidim, God defeated the Amalekites only when Moses held his staff to Heaven. It was a symbol of dependence and acknowledgment that Heaven was the source of the Israelites' power. When he dropped his hand, the power was removed and they began to lose the battle.<br><br>Each day we are challenged to reach toward Heaven and allow God to be the source of victory in the marketplace or be defeated. God calls us to let His banner reign over the marketplace so that others may know the source of our victory. "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven' " (Ex. 17:14). The Lord wants those behind us and around us to know that He is the source of our power and success. With each victory is a testimony that is to be shared with our children and our associates.<br><br>Is the Lord your banner today? Reach toward Heaven today and let His banner wave over your work so that He might receive glory from your life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God's Selection Process<br>Judges 7:5<br>So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the Lord told him, "Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink."<br><br>Would you ever take on an army of 100,000 with only 300 men? Sound preposterous? I agree. However, this is exactly what happened with Gideon. It was bad enough that he began with 10,000 against 100,000, but this was too many men according to God. He would not allow Gideon to fight with this many soldiers, because the temptation would still remain to believe that it was the strength of his army that won the victory. God told Gideon to pare down his army to a mere 300. This would ensure that God would receive total credit for the victory. This is a law in the Kingdom of God. All glory must go to Him. "Announce now to the people, 'Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.' So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained" (Judg. 7:3).<br><br>Now there are 10,000 men left but that was still too many. God gave Gideon an interesting selection method for the 300 as he took the men down to the water. There the Lord told him, "Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink" (Judg. 7:5b). What was the significance of this? Those soldiers who lapped water like a dog were soldiers who were more aware of the enemy around them compared to those who kneeled to drink. The lappers were men who were on constant guard to the danger around them, keeping their eyes up and looking about them. The others could be easily picked off.<br><br>If you and I are going to be one of God's elite, we must be battle ready. We must be sensitive to the spiritual dangers around us. We must be trained to go about our business while, at the same time, discern when the enemy of our souls is prowling about seeking to destroy us. "Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour" (1 Pet. 5:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Beware of the spiritual dangers around you.<br></div>

The Lord already had seen Gideon as a leader of others, not just a laborer who threshed wheat.<br><br>Gideon was an Israelite who lived during a time of oppression from the Midianites. God had allowed Israel to be oppressed because of its rebellion. However, the Israelites cried out to God, and He heard their cry for help. He decided to free them from the oppression of their enemies. God chose a man with little experience in such matters to lead an army against Midian.<br><br>When God came to Gideon through a visit by an angel, the angel's first words to him were, "The Lord is with you, mighty warrior." God always looks at His children for what they will be, not what they are now. The Lord had already seen this man as a leader of others, not just a laborer who threshed wheat.<br><br>The apostle Paul said, "I can do everything through Him who gives me strength" (Phil. 4:13). God has reserved an inheritance for you and me. He has foreordained that we should accomplish great things in His name-not so that we will be accepted or become more valued, but to experience the reality of a living relationship with a God who wants to demonstrate His power through each of us.<br><br>What does God want to accomplish through you today? He used Gideon, with only 300 men, to deliver Israel from an army of more than 100,000. He demonstrated His power through one man who was willing to let God use what little faith he had to free a nation from oppression and bring glory to the God of Israel.

What are they saying in this statement? Are they saying that this individual achieved success by his hard work and sweat? Many a person has achieved success through honest hard work. There is a danger for any of us who may have achieved significance through our work. That danger is the belief that we achieved it through our own efforts apart from God's grace and mercy. When we live in this belief, we assert that we are entitled to certain rights and privileges because of the position we have earned and feel we deserve.<br><br>The prodigal son's brother who refused to celebrate the wayward son's return was a man who felt he was entitled to certain rights. He saw himself as one who had been faithful to his responsibilities and deserving of more attention. He could not appreciate his brother's failure and the pain of falling into a sinful life because, in his mind, he had never failed. This pride kept him from experiencing God's real grace. This is how legalism develops in believers. It grows into a cold heart and an insensitive attitude toward others who may have stumbled in their lives. This same brother did not truly understand the love of his father apart from works; for he felt he gained acceptance only by doing his job.<br><br>Do you feel accepted by God, regardless of what you do? Have you wrongfully viewed your works as something you alone have achieved? These are the minefields of which each of us in business must be aware.

            <div class='col-md body'>Overlooking Offenses<br>Proverbs 19:11<br>A man's wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offense.<br><br>I have a friend who tells a story of a lesson the Lord taught him through his wife. It seems that every time he and his wife would get in the car to travel somewhere, his wife had a strong need to direct his driving. She would tell him where to turn and when to turn, even in their own subdivision. It was such a horrible habit that it drove my friend crazy and became the source of many an argument. Finally, one day my friend concluded that the Lord was trying to teach him something through this experience. He decided he would let go of his need to be free from this correction. He began to affirm his wife and even thank her for her input. It was excruciatingly painful to do this from where he sat.<br><br>A few months passed. He let go of the entire situation and actually got to a place where it just didn't matter to him anymore. An interesting thing happened a few months later. One day his wife looked at him and said, "John, I just realized that I have been directing your driving all these years and now realize why I do that. It goes back to my childhood when I had to direct my younger brothers and sisters. I am so sorry I have been doing that." My friend nearly fell out of his seat!<br><br>Whenever we work close to another person, whether in an office or home, small offenses can become the source of great conflict. Resentment and irritability soon follow. God brings these "offenses" into our lives to develop character qualities in us. He uses individuals in our lives to accomplish his goal of making us more Christlike. So the next time you complain or resist a habit or action from someone close to you, ask God if it has been placed there to develop some quality in you.<br><br>Pride is the root source of the need to change another person. A man's wisdom gives him patience-to let go of little offenses. This is where spiritual maturity is seen in the day-to-day activity of life. Is there someone close to you who has some habit you really want to change? Give up that desire to the Lord. Who knows, He may even change it after you let go of the need to change it.<br><br></div>

The joy was immeasurable, somewhat akin to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of a cherished king's new palace -- in this case, a shrine to the glory of the King of kings and to the splendor of His reign. But in a tragic anticlimactic sequence, the celebration went terribly wrong. The children of Aharon, Nadav and Avihu, entered into the realm of the outer limits, the Holy of Holies, the Kodesh HaKedoshim. They offered incense, something they assumed would surely bring joy to their Creator. But it was their own recipe.<br><br>Uncommanded, and uncalled for, something went terribly wrong. " A fire came forth from before Hashem and consumed them, and they died before Hashem" (Leviticus 10:1-2). It's hard for us, here, to fathom the pain. Remember that picture of a smiling schoolteacher and her fellow astronauts, waving in anticipation of another successful mission on America's galactic pride and joy, only to be vaporized into a mist of memories plunging toward the ocean in a disastrous fate? The beloved children of a beloved leader on a beloved day in a beloved service were gone in an instant, from glory to death. Yet their own father did not react in open agony, rather only through silence and acceptance. "And Aaron was silent" (ibid v. 3). That silence was not only commended, but extolled. As a reward for that stoic reaction of acceptance, the next command in the Torah is offered directly to Aharon without Moshe, who normally was the principal in receiving Heavenly directives.<br><br>Yet despite the praise meted to Aharon for his silence, the nation is commanded to react in a diametrically opposed manner. Moshe commands the nation, "the entire House of Israel shall bewail the conflagration that Hashem ignited" (Leviticus 10:6). Aharon is praised for his silence, yet the nation is told to openly bewail the tragedy. What is the difference?<br><br>Back in the 1800's, the Magid of Trisk and Reb Mendel of Vorke were dear friends living next to each other. But, unfortunately Rav Mendel had to move to the other side of the forest, a distance of a half-a-day's walk. Seeing his agony, Reb Mendel's sexton, Moishele, anxiously offered to make the three-hour trip each Friday to deliver correspondence.<br><br>And so it went. Every Friday morning, Moishele would set out across the forest and deliver Reb Mendele's letter to the Trisker Magid. He would wait for the Magid to read the letter and reply. Often it would take a while until the Magid returned from his study, eyes red from tears, his quivering hand holding the magnificently crafted response in a special envelope. Moshele would deliver the response to the Vorke Rebbe, and that letter, too, evoked the same emotional response: tears of joy and meaning filled the Rebbe's eyes.<br><br>After a year as a faithful envoy, Moishele's curiosity overtook him. "What possibly can those letters contain? Would it be so bad if I took a peek?" Therefore, one Friday he carefully opened the envelope -- without disturbing the seal. He saw absolutely nothing. Just a blank paper rested between the walls of the envelope.<br><br>Shocked, Moshe carefully, placed the so-called letter back into the envelope and delivered it to the Trisker Maggid. Like clockwork, the Rebbe went into the study, and a half-hour later, bleary-eyed and shaken, he returned a letter to be delivered to his friend Reb Mendel of Vorke.<br><br>At this point, Moishele could not wait to leave the house and race back into the forest, where he would secretly bare the contents of the envelope, hoping to solve the mysterious exchange.<br><br>Again, blank paper. Moishele was mortified. "Have I been schlepping six hours each week with blank papers? What is this a game?" he wondered.<br><br>The entire Shabbos he could not contain his displeasure. Motzoai Shabbos, Reb Mendel called him in to his study. "You seem agitated, my dear shammas," he asked. "What seems to be the problem?<br><br>"Problem?" he responded. "You know those letters I've been carrying. I admit it. I looked, this Friday. There was nothing in them! They were blank! What kind of game is this?"<br><br>Reb Mendel, did not flinch. "The Torah," he said, "has black letters on white parchment. The black contain the words we express. The white contains a message that is deeper than letters. Our feelings are often expressed through black letters. This week, we wrote with the white parchment. We expressed an emotion that transcends letters."<br><br>It is very important to realize one cannot equate the reaction required by a mourner to that of the responsive community. Not everyone is on the level to keep quiet. For those who can make their statement of faith and strength through silence, that is an amazing expression. For the rest of us, who are not on that level, we must express our sorrow and exclaim it in a human way as afforded by the dictates of Moshe.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Passover Never Passes Over<br><br>Passover never really passes over. The truth is that we are really meant to pack it up and take it with us. Passover is the Holiday of Faith. It is the time that we made our first national connection with G-d. He let us know that He didn't just create the world and leave it up to random events of history. He is involved. He even took the time out of His busy schedule to make that known to Pharaoh, Egypt, and of course, to us. G-d's intervention into history is the exception which proves the rule. That is that He is always involved behind the scenes, and He is very interested in us.<br><br>Those who participated in a Pesach seder may remember that the Hagada (the Passover night liturgy), states in it that even if we were seasoned veteran Torah scholars, we would still have a commandmant to relate the events of leaving Egypt. Rabbi Sholom Noach Bresovsky, of blessed memory, explains the reason for this. Recounting the events of the Exodus from Egypt is the basis of our faith in G-d. Just as G-d is unlimited, faith in G-d too has no limits - it can always rise to new levels. The knowledge of the events one may have, but the growth in our faith that we draw from this knowledge continues indefinetely. So even a well versed Torah scholar has much faith to gain from participating in a seder (a reading of the Passover liturgy) and all of its observances.<br><br>Passover teaches us that there is a G-d who is interested in us and involved in our lives. The natural conclusion then, is that we should show interest in Him.<br><br>The classical work "Chovos HaLevavos" dedicates a chapter of his work to the topic of serving G-d. His basic premise is that since we can discern so many favors which G-d constantly bestows to us in so many ways, it is only natural that we try to show our appreciation in some measure. Even though we would never be able to repay a minute fraction of the favors we receive, one would certainly be ingratious not to try. Consequently, any little bit we can do is a pleasure, as it is an opportunity for us to show our gratitude. If G-d would give me something specific to do, here's my opportunity - let me jump at the chance. That is the basis of all Torah and Mitzvah (commandment) performance. It is also notable that the Hebrew word "mitzvah" meaning "commandment" is related to the Aramaic derivation "tzavsa," meaning "togetherness." Performing commandments brings us close to G-d.<br><br>This brings us to this week's parsha. When the Tabernacle was completed, the only thing left was for G-d to bring His presence to dwell in it. On the first day of the Hebrew month of Nissan, G-d did just that. With the entire Hebrew nation witnessing, G-d's heavenly fire consumed the offerings which had been placed on the altar.<br><br>Upon witnessing this, two very great sons of Aharon the High Priest, Nadav, and Avihu, longed for closeness with G-d. As the event is recounted by the Torah, they took some of the sacrificial spices and burned them in the Holy of Holies, the most restricted and sanctified area in the Tabernacle. There G-d took their souls, and they died. Their actions are criticized by the Torah, and they died doing a sinful deed. However, the commentaries note that it was their unbridled desire to come close to G-d that got them in trouble. Their souls were drawn like magnets to G-d's presence, and they were not protected, since their deed was not the performance of any commandment given to them. As a result, they perished. Still, their desire to be close to G-d was correct and worthy of emulation.<br><br>Now we are living in times when it is hard to take one's mind off of Jews and Jewishness. Bombs are exploding almost daily in Israel killing innocents, and making widows, widowers, orphans, and bereft parents. Synogagues are being torched in European communities. The whole world is preoccupied with Jews! We really need to take stock of where we come in to this seemingly chaotic situation. Let us start by internalizing the message of Passover. G-d runs the world. No one can hurt another person without His permission. That means that He is giving permission. Why? He's trying to tell us something. My feeling is that He wants us to develop our awareness of Him. Some One Who does so much for us should not go on being ignored. He's calling us, and the time to answer is now. Let us strenghthen our awareness and desire to get close to G-d. All good things can only come from that. My personal feeling is that alot depends on us now. Let's rise to the challenge. Prayer, performance of mitzvos, and keeping G-d in our thoughts has the potential to go a long way now. Let's do our best.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Up and Out<br><br>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"For I am the Lord your G-d, who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your G-d, and you shall be Holy, for I am Holy." [11:45]<br><br>Rashi points out that the Torah usually says that G-d "brought you _out_ from the land of Egypt." Here, however, it says "brought you _up_." What is the difference?<br><br>There is a Medrash from the House of Rebbe Yishmael: if I had brought you out from Egypt only to give you the laws of what may be eaten and what may not be eaten, for this alone it would have been worthwhile. Even without all 613 commandments, just teaching that you should not eat crawling insects, dead carcasses, crab, and lobster -- this alone would have carried tremendous benefits. This alone would bring you not merely out, but up.<br><br>The laws of Kosher food are often misunderstood, even maligned. Some claim that Kosher food laws came in reaction to such things as, for example, the fact that undercooked pork can lead to a trichinosis infestation. This is perplexing at best -- trichinosis manifests itself after a one to two week incubation period. Tracing it back to pork requires a level of medical knowledge which we have not seen among ancient cultures.<br><br>No, these are spiritual matters, whether or not there are healthy side-effects. "You are what you eat" -- and what you eat can either bring you closer to G-d, or move you further away.<br><br>Rabbi Yissocher Frand repeated a story told by Rabbi Berel Wein, who said that the president of the United Jewish Appeal once told him that 80% of the charity raised by the UJA comes from a small portion of the Jewish population. The rest, said the president, "just don't care" (although, obviously, there are many who omit the UJA but donate directly to worthy organizations). Rabbi Wein reacted, "that is what eating crabs for 30 years will do to Jews." Non-Kosher food injures us spiritually -- so much so that when Rabbi Wein heard about Jews "not caring" enough to give charity, he immediately attributed it to the abandonment of keeping kosher.<br><br>An interesting support for eating kosher came from, of all places, the Washington Post. On April 10, 2001, they ran a page one expose on the treatment of cattle in modern processing plants.<br><br>Two notes before I continue. First, I have heard some say that the entire opposition to kosher slaughter is led by anti-Semites. I do not believe this. However, as the Washington Post article makes clear, those not motivated by bias are simply extremely ignorant of what actually goes on. As a case in point, there was a rabbi (!!), obviously not a traditional one, who wrote the following: "chapter 48 of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 'Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter Act' exempts kosher slaughter from the normal definition of humane slaughter, which requires that 'animals are rendered insensible to pain' before slaughter. Advocates of kosher slaughter have always claimed that shechitah is the least painful method of slaughter. That seems no longer to be the case, now that the government requires 'humane' slaughter. One might have expected that Orthodox authorities would re-examine and even amend the ancient and medieval requirements of shechitah in order to adhere to the principle of causing the least possible pain to animals..."<br><br>Which leads me to my second note, before we discuss how the "Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter Act" translates into reality: this is not for the squeamish. Those reading this at the Shabbos table might justifiably skip over the next few paragraphs.<br><br>The Washington Post, April 10: "It takes 25 minutes to turn a live steer into steak at the modern slaughterhouse where Ramon Moreno works. For 20 years, his post was 'second-legger'...<br><br>"The cattle were supposed to be dead before they got to Moreno. But too often they weren't...<br><br>"On bad days, he says, dozens of animals reached his station clearly alive and conscious. Some would survive as far as the tail cutter, the belly ripper, the hide puller. 'They die,' said Moreno, 'piece by piece.'"<br><br>The Post then went on to detail the definition of "humane slaughter" which certain misinformed congressmen (and rabbis) deemed superior to Kosher shechitah, so much so that the latter was "exempted." "Under a 23-year-old federal law, slaughter cattle and hogs first must be 'stunned' -- rendered insensible to pain -- with a blow to the head or an electric shock." Yes, according to the U.S. government, clubbing an animal over the head is superior to cutting the carotid artery (which causes a near-instantaneous cessation of all brain activity).<br><br>And even that clubbing does not happen. "Enforcement records, interviews, videos and worker affidavits describe repeated violations of the Humane Slaughter Act at dozens of slaughterhouses, ranging from the smallest, custom butcheries to modern, automated establishments..."<br><br>It is very simple. Only in kosher facilities do you have specially trained experts whose sole function -- and religious obligation -- is to ensure that the animal dies immediately, and a supervisor to ensure that they not only fulfill this role, but do so using a knife so sharp and so perfect that the animal never feels it.<br><br>On April 15, the last day of Pesach, the Post printed the following letter. It comes from Jonathan Javitt of Chevy Chase, MD -- and it delivers its message so well that I will merely quote it in its entirety.<br><br>"The rigid laws of kosher slaughter, in which an animal is killed instantly and painlessly by a single knife stroke across the carotid arteries by a highly trained specialist, originated at a time when pagan practice frequently involved hacking off one limb at a time or bludgeoning an animal to death.<br><br>"The kosher slaughter laws were intended to remind humans of the need to respect all forms of life, even when taking life in order to achieve sustenance. Those laws frequently have been viewed as an anachronism and occasionally been attacked as 'inhumane' in the face of 'modern and scientific' approaches to meat processing.<br><br>"The Post suggests that we may not have evolved as far from those pagan practices as we thought and that the Talmudic reasoning of 2000 years ago may be as relevant today as it was then. Those wishing to disassociate themselves from the horror described in the article need only venture as far as their nearest kosher butcher."<br><br>Need I say more?<br><br>A Good Shabbos,<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are with me<br><br>In the face of overwhelming tragedy, the death of his two sons, Aharon is nevertheless reprimanded by Moshe for a seeming infraction of the halacha regarding the eating from a sacrifice while one is yet grief-stricken over the personal loss of near relatives. Aharon responds by defending his position as being halachically correct and proving the point to Moshe. Thereafter, Moshe, upon reflection, admits that Aharon is correct and that he fulfilled the Torah's law in this matter completely. The question that begs answering in this situation is the obvious one. At a black moment such as this one, where is there room for discussion of an arcane halachic rule? Is this not a moment for emotion, for compassion, for sympathy, not for law and legalisms? Is it not almost cruel of Moshe to raise any sort of halachic issue whatsoever with his brother at a time of such sadness and tragedy?<br><br>As usual, the Torah uses this all too human situation to grant us an insight into God's view, so to speak, of life and human behavior. For any sort of mental stability to be present in one's life, one must live by a set of values and rules. Without such norms and standards, one is constantly blind-sided and buffeted by the never-ending problems of life. And one is a prisoner of one's emotions and personal conflicts. There are so many times in life that one asks one's self, "Now what am I supposed to do? How am I to react to this event?" It is because of this recurring and never-ending human question that halacha takes on such a central role in the life of a Jew. It is precisely for this reason that halacha is so all-pervasive, covering every act and situation of a Jew's existence. It is the halacha that rules our lives and sets our standards of behavior under all circumstances of life and all human conditions.<br><br>In today's society, God and religion have to somehow conform to the human being's comfort and pleasure zone. Religion cannot be too demanding. Three days of mourning is sufficient, not seven. Restrictions on behavior and entertainment on the part of the mourner are to be discarded. Religion cannot make one feel uncomfortable or make too many demands on time or life-style. God should have no say in the way human beings should express their emotions. In a society as self-centered as is ours, religion is defined by and for me alone. There is no room for communal or generational considerations. It is only me - here and now - that counts. Thus the positive psychological benefits of an halachically endorsed grieving period and process is ignored and eventually forgotten. The Torah and Jewish tradition have carefully and minutely described the laws, attitudes and customs that should govern one who is in the process of confronting tragedy and loss. The Torah in this instance, as in all other affairs of life, is on the side of humans. It attempts to give us perspective and balance, strength and inner fortitude in order that we be better equipped to deal with the inevitable blows of life. Therefore, Moshe correctly calls Aharon to task for apparently not following the Torah's law when tragedy overwhelmed him and his family. But it is the very steadfastness of Aharon in observing the Torah's laws, as expressed in his response to Moshe's criticism, that allows him to revive himself and rise from his grief and pain and become the great High Priest of Israel, beloved by God and all of the Jewish people.<br><br>Death is always an unwelcome visitor. Nevertheless, our mortality makes its appearance at our doorstep unavoidable. Yet there lies within our souls and us deep resources that enable human beings to deal with this final act of the life cycle. The Torah, and its accompanying halachic rules and norms, lights the way through the darkness of sad events and moments of grief. "Yea, though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me," says King David. In Jewish tradition and history "You are with me" is reflected in the laws and customs that the halacha has created for those trying and searing moments. And in so doing, "You are with me" becomes the cry of our ultimate triumph over death and darkness.<br><br>Shabat Shalom.<br>Rabbi Berel Wein<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Self Destruction<br>There is an underlying theme to the message of the Metzora. This spiritual disease that causes discoloration of the skin or of hairs upon the skin, in unpredictable patches is caused by sins of speech Â­ gossip, slander and the like. When a person notices the discoloration, he is to immediately approach a kohen and show him the abnormality. It is up to the kohen to not only to determine the status of the affliction, but to actually invoke the status of impurity on the man through his rendition of his adjudication on the matter.<br><br>The physical affliction of tzoraÂ’as is definitely not a contagious one. In fact, the Torah teaches us that there are times that the kohen can hold off on his declaration; e.g. a groom during the week of wedding festivities is spared the humiliation of isolation. If tzoraÂ’as were a communicable disease it would surely warrant immediate isolation despite the circumstances. Yet when a man is declared as tamei (impure) he is kept in isolation. The Torah explicitly explains: Â“All the days that the affliction is upon him he shall remain contaminated; he is contaminated. He shall dwell in isolation; his dwelling shall be outside the campÂ” (Leviticus 13:46).<br><br>The question is simple. If the sins of anti-social behavior cause the malady, why is the man isolated? Would it not be better if he is embarrassed within the community and learns to better himself through communal interaction? How will solitude help him cure his societal ills?<br><br>There is a classic tale of the gentleman who purchased a plane ticket from New York to Los Angeles. The man was quite finicky about traveling, and asked the agent for a window seat. Somehow, he was not placed by the window, rather in the aisle.<br><br>During the entire trip, he fidgeted and squirmed. Immediately after the long journey the man went straight to complain.<br><br>Â“I specifically asked for a window seat,Â” he exclaimed. Â“Your agent in New York assured me that I would be getting a window seat. Look at this stub. It placed me right in the aisle!Â”<br><br>The customer relations agent in Los Angeles was not fazed. Unfazed she asked the man, Â“Did you ask the person in the window seat to trade places?Â”<br><br>This time the man was irate. Â“I was not able to!Â”<br><br>Â“And why not?Â”<br><br>Â“There was no one in the seat.Â”<br><br>My grandfather, Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetzky, of blessed memory, in his classic work Emes LÂ’Yaakov explains. People often blame the ramifications of their doings on everyone else but themselves. Truth be told, a person who is afflicted can circumvent confinement by not reporting the negah to the Kohen, or even by pulling out the hairs that are discolored. It is akin to a man who is sentenced to house imprisonment. His hands are tied together with the rope attached to his teeth. He is told to watch himself and not escape.<br><br>In essence, a negah is merely a Divine wake-up-call. It is heavenÂ’s way of letting an individual know that there is something wrong. It is a personal message and must be taken personally. And so in solitude the man sits and ponders what exactly needs correction.<br><br>If a person wants to correct himself, he need not cavort with others to do so. If one can remove the barriers of false flattery and social mendacity, he can do a lot better for himself: because self-improvement is dependent upon self-motivation. Without the truth meeting the self, any attempt toward self-improvement may lead to nothing more than self-destruction.<br><br>Good Shabbos<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pinchas<br><br>Rabbi Label Lam<br>Born Of Clarity<br><br>"I shall give him My covenant, Peace." (Bamidbar 25:12)<br><br>If I hadn't lived through recent history I would think it strange to award a "peace prize" to someone who had just carried out such a punishing act as Pinchas did. His approach to achieving peace was not a passive one. What new angle or definition of peace can we extract from the seemingly cruel way in which Pinchas was able to distinguish himself?<br><br>Commenting on the statement "Talmud scholars bring peace to the world!"(Tractate Brochos), the Maharsha offers a fascinating description of the dynamics of that process. How is it that those, whose hot pursuit of small points and obsession with detail brings them into constant conflict are titled as the princes of peace in the world? Sometimes it may seem just the opposite is more true.<br><br>He explains, that just as the sum of a person's livelihood for an entire year is determined on Rosh HaShana, so are the number of wars to be fought in the world set at that time. Let's say that it was decreed that one hundred thousand battles have to be played out in this world in a given year. That sounds terrible and it is in fact a potentially perilous state of affairs.<br><br>One fine morning two old Talmudic lions arise from their sleep and arrive in the study hall armed with their holy books and alert minds.<br><br>(If you've ever had the honor to witness the process of learning that goes on in a conventional Yeshiva- study hall, the first thing that you notice is the noise. It is nothing like the ubiquitous public library, whose librarian is prepared to revoke your card if your hush puppies squeak too loudly on the newly polished floors.)<br><br>Here, disagreements are constantly erupting. It's hard to hear one's thoughts and yet the thought process is in high gear in that unlikely place.<br><br>Now these two scholars who happen to be facing off roar, snap, and bite away at each other's point of view until some complete conclusion is arrived at, besides lunch. Because of this fearsome fight for the truth, because they were motivated to discover "what" is right and not distracted by the ego concern of "who" is right, one less war on the horrific battlefields of the world needs to be fought. That deduction in the totality of human destruction is a magnificent contribution to the peace of the world.<br><br>Rabbi Samson Rafael Hirsch writes, "Only falsehood is in need of many supporters to win the day; falsehood must have the authority of numbers what it lacks in justification. Truth, by contrast will always prevail, even if it takes time. Noble, courageous, and pure, expressed with all the fiery zeal of conviction and with all the clarity of sure awareness, stated again and again at every opportunity, truth will ultimately gain respect and admiration even of those who do not accept it. The only truth that can be lost beyond recall is that truth whose adherents no longer have the courage to speak up candidly on its behalf. Truth has never gone down to defeat as a result of opposition, it has done so only when its friends are too weak to defend it."<br><br>Commenting on the words of the prophet, "You shall love truth and peace! (Zachariah 8:19) Rabbi Hirsch wrote, "For peace is not a father of truth; peace is a child of truth. Win the people for truth, inalienable truth that can never be sold, not for the price of peace, when sacred causes are involved, and then true everlasting peace will follow by itself."<br><br>Pinchas was not out hunting for a popular prize. He took a lonely path. He acted with uncompromising, even brutal honesty. In the face of confusion and opposition he carried out the hard line of the law. That moment of truth, as cruel as it might seem, because it set the value unmistakably straight, saved more than it destroyed, and is forever to be regarded as a supreme act of peace...born of clarity.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Parshas Vayechi - Plan To Be Spontaneous!<br><br>Our patriarch Yaakov passes away in this week's parsha. Before he dies, Yaakov gathers his children, the twelve tribes, and blesses each one with a unique blessing which suits each one.<br><br>It is notable, however, that realizing the blessing one receives requires personal input from the receiver. A blessing is no guarantee. It is a prayer to G-d that everything contained in the blessing should fall into place if the receiver does his part in being a fitting receiver. What is the input required to live up to one's potential? Perhaps Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch can help us understand.<br><br>In Rabbi Hirsch's 19th century Germany, one of the raging issues facing Jews was as follows. Many Jews began to espouse the popular view of life based on the philosophical views of Immanuel Kant, which was that of moral self-legislation, the paradigm for much of modern society today. It is the approach that one develops personal and social convictions from within oneself and within society, as opposed to those extrinsically imposed, such as those borne out of Torah.<br><br>Rabbi Hirsch, who occupied a position in Frankfurt at that time, rigorously made his argument for the submitting one's will and morality to the dictates of Torah. Many of Rabbi Hirsch's contemporaries wished to cast off the Torah approach which distinguished them from the society which opened its arms to them after the Napoleonic era. The theory of self-legislation was a perfect moral stepping stone to satisfy their ends, and open the doors to full acceptance in secular society.<br><br>It is reasonable to argue that the theory of self-legislation, as noble as it was, has the pitfall of only being as exalted as the society in which it is applied. Consequently, in a free society, almost everything can have its justification as long as everyone agrees. Nothing is absolute.<br><br>Rabbi Hirsch taught that a consistent and noble morality is borne out of a steady diet of Torah ideals through diligent study until a student of Torah manifests the Torah ideals spontaneously and naturally.<br><br>If it strikes you as unnatural to "program" oneself through study, and that it limits spontaneity, I will show you by analogy with sports that it actually enhances our spontaneity, and our effectiveness.<br><br>An athlete, in order to be good, must train. Through practice, exercise, and constant repetition, he develops and refines his performance in all possible circumstances that may arise in a game. He must be prepared to perform at his best under pressure. Training involves "walking through" all kinds of offensive and defensive moves, and rehearsing repeatedly, until the required behaviors are natural. Effective training will even enhance the athletes ability to react properly in an unforeseen circumstance. Through training it becomes natural.<br><br>The same is true in life, only more so. Life is where it really counts. In order to realize our greatness, we must also train, and cultivate desirable traits in ourselves. These are the tools which we use when interacting with the world. The traits of generosity, compassion, sharing each other's happiness and pain, being charitable, and countless more, all have their source in Torah. The people who study and practice Torah come to embody these ideals.<br><br>Consequently, Torah study and observance is a discipline, in some ways like other disciplines. Every person is unique, and has great potential to bring out. However, it must be coaxed out. It takes training, refining the raw materials, and only after that can we hope that the end product will be worthy of great favor and blessing.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br>Waking Up in Time<br><br>I am asleep but my heart is awake... (Song of Songs)<br><br>I consider it a gift from heaven. I don't know where it came from or why I was fortunate enough to be able to retrieve it. That year, I had an ambitious study partner that had me up early in the morning at a time bordering on late night. I'm still a little tired from that epoch, though I don't regret the learning a bit. We agreed to allow ourselves to sleep a little later on the Eve of Rosh Hashana so we can be rested and calm to deal with our families in the important days ahead. The inner alarm clock, however, woke me at the usual holy hour, and I immediately pressed the inner snooze alarm, thankful I still had plenty of time.<br><br>While I lay there in a state of half sleep, I became aware of a thought that was percolating there in the back of my brain. Had I fallen back asleep it would have gone as geese and flown away. At that moment, amazingly a thunderstorm whipped up outside and with a brief crackle there followed an explosive boom that rocked the whole house. Everyone was shaken awake. The children started to cry and I was sitting up in bed consciously aware, now, of a new idea, not knowing, yet, what it really meant: "Rosh HaShana is the Krias Shema Al HaMita (The bedtime reading of Shema Yisrael) for the entire year!" Later that morning I shared what I thought it meant with one of my teachers who patted me on the back a said earnestly, "It's the real truth, Label!" I didn't dare argue with him.<br><br>The Code of Jewish Law begins with the requirement to "wake up like a lion" hungry for life's important tasks. The only problem is that the law is directed at a sleeping man. How does one wake up in the morning like a lion? Simple! Go to bed like a lion! If one goes to sleep like a lion, he stands a fighting chance to wake up like a lion. If one goes to bed like a slug, he'll probably wake up like a slug. Therefore, before we go to bed at night, we have a custom to say a "bedtime shema". This helps set our mind on what we are getting up for. If we go to sleep with a sense of purpose we wake up on purpose.<br><br>If you were in a hotel in some far off city and the next day there was an important early morning business meeting, before retiring for the night you might do two necessary things: 1) Set that alarm clock there on the night table, and 2) Set off the alarm. Why set off the alarm clock at night? Two reasons: 1) To see if it actually works; 2) To tune your ear to the sound you will need to respond to in the morning when you are deep asleep.<br><br>That's what the evening "bedtime shema" is meant to accomplish, and it could be what the blast of the Shofar on Rosh Hashana is doing as well. On Rosh Hashana we are arousing our consciousness, if even temporarily, to be clear and intensely aware of our sublime mission here on earth collectively and individually. In accepting The Almighty as our sovereign authority, we are simultaneously crowning ourselves with a supreme sense of purpose. The Shofar, playing the conscience, hauntingly articulates the urgency implied by its potential.<br><br>Then (no cynicism intended) we are apt to fall asleep for the rest of the year, losing consciousness of the original who, what why, where, when, and how did we get into this, anyway? The Shofar installs that signal that will stir us from slumber, no matter how deep the exile of sleep. Just as Rosh Hashana impacts the whole year so too the Shofar. It has something strong to say almost all and every day.<br><br>Just where do we hear that call and cadence in the course of our daily lives? It's no mistake that emergency vehicles know just how to get our attention. The tender infant has a song that opens a mother's heart. Buzzers and birds nudge with a similar subtle urge. Even as I write, workmen saw and hammer. Elsewhere the traffic jams and a chorus of cars clamor. What one person can do to stall or advance the flow of history! Ask not for whom the phone rings...<br><br>When the ear and heart are properly sensitized on Rosh Hashana we may merit to hear the ubiquitous and poetic message of the Shofar speaking directly to us at any time, and hope to wake up just in time.<br><br>Have a good Shabbos<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Overcomer's Reward<br>"To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a New Name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it"   (Revelation 2:17).<br><br>My heart, be thou stirred up to persevere in the holy war, for the reward of victory is great. Today we eat of heavenly food which falls about our camps; the food of the wilderness, the food which comes from heaven, the food which never fails the pilgrims to Canaan. But there is reserved for us in Christ Jesus a still higher degree of spiritual life and a food for it which, as yet, is hidden from our experience. In the golden pot which was laid up in the ark there was a portion of manna hidden away, which though kept for ages never grew stale. No one ever saw it; it was hid with the Ark of the Covenant, in the Holy of Holies. Even so, the highest life of the believer is hid with Christ, in God. We shall come to it soon, Being made victorious through the grace of our LORD Jesus, we shall eat of the King's meat and feed upon royal dainties. We shall feed upon Jesus. He is our "hidden manna," as well as the manna of the wilderness. He is all in all to us in our highest, as well as in our lowest, estate. He helps us to fight, gives us the victory, and then is Himself our reward. LORD, help me to overcome.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forget and Forgive<br>"Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and He shall save thee"   (Proverbs 20:22).<br><br>Be not in haste. Let anger cool down. Say nothing and do nothing to avenge yourself. You will be sure to act unwisely if you take up the cudgels and fight your own battles; and, certainly, you will not show the spirit of the LORD Jesus, It is nobler to forgive and let the offense pass. To let an injury rankle in your bosom and to meditate revenge is to keep old wounds open and to make new ones. Better forget and forgive.<br><br>Peradventure, you say that you must do something or be a great loser; then do what this morning's promise advises: "Wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee." This advice will not cost you money but is worth far more, Be calm and quiet. Wait upon the LORD; tell Him your grievance; spread Rabshakeh's letter before the LORD, and this of itself will be an ease to your burdened mind. Besides, there is the promise "He shall save thee." God will find a way of deliverance for you. How He will do it neither you nor I can guess, but do it He will, If the LORD saves you, this will be a deal better than getting into petty quarrels and covering yourself with filth by wrestling with the unclean, Be no more angry. Leave your suit with the Judge of all.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It Becomes Mutual<br>"I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people"   (2 Corinthians 6:16).<br><br>Here is a mutual interest. Each belongs to each. God is the portion of His people, and the chosen people are the portion of their God. The saints find in God their chief possession, and He reckons them to be His peculiar treasure. What a mine of comfort lies in this fact for each believer!<br><br>This happy condition of mutual interest leads to mutual consideration. God will always think of His own people, and they will always think of Him. This day my God will perform all things for me; what can I do for Him? My thoughts ought to run toward Him, for He thinketh upon me. Let me make sure that it is so and not be content with merely admitting that so it ought to be.<br><br>This, again, leads to mutual fellowship. God dwells in us, and we dwell in Him; He walks with us, and we walk with God....<br><br>Oh, for grace to treat the LORD as my God: to trust Him and to serve Him, as His Godhead deserves! Oh, that I could love, worship, adore, and obey Jehovah in spirit and in truth! This is my heart's desire. When I shall attain to it, I shall have found my heaven. LORD, help me! Be my God in helping me to know Thee as my God, for Jesus' sake.<br></div>

The LORD is concerned about everything that concerns me. All that is now good, but not perfect, the LORD will watch over, preserve, and carry out to completion. This is a great comfort. I could not perfect the work of grace myself. Of that I am quite sure, for I fail every day and have only held on so long as I have because the LORD has helped me. If the LORD were to leave me, all my past experience would go for nothing, and I should perish from the way. But the LORD will continue to bless me. He will perfect my faith, my love, my character, my lifework. He will do this because He has begun a work in me. He gave me the concern I feel, and, in a measure, He has fulfilled my gracious aspirations, He never leaves a work unfinished; this would not be for His glory, nor would it be like Him. He knows how to accomplish His gracious design, and though my own evil nature and the world and the devil all conspire to hinder Him, I do not doubt His promise. He will perfect that which concerneth me, and I will praise Him forever. LORD, let Thy gracious work make some advance this day!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gracious Dealing<br>"And the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest"   (Deuteronomy 15:18 ).<br><br>An Israelitish master was to give his bondservant liberty in due time, and when he left his service he was to start him in life with a liberal portion, This was to be done heartily and cheerfully, and then the LORD promised to bless the generous act. The spirit of this precept, and, indeed, the whole law of Christ, binds us to treat people well. We ought to remember how the LORD has dealt with us, and that this renders it absolutely needful that we should deal graciously with others, It becomes those to be generous who are the children of a gracious God. How can we expect our great Master to bless us in our business if we oppress those who serve us?<br><br>What a benediction is here set before the liberal mind! To be blessed in all that we do is to be blessed indeed. The LORD will send us this partly in prosperity, partly in content of mind, and partly in a sense of His favor, which is the best of all blessings. He can make us feel that we are under His special care and are surrounded by His peculiar love. This makes this earthly life a joyous prelude to the life to come. God's blessing is more than a fortune. It maketh rich and addeth no sorrow therewith.<br></div>
