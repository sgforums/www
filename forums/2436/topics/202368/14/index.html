            <div class='col-md body'>Moving With the Cloud<br>Numbers 9:21<br>Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out.<br><br>God brought the Israelites out of Egypt, and they had to pass through the desert on their way to the Promised Land. God was their guide by means of a cloud that appeared overhead. When it moved, they moved. When it stopped, they stopped-sometimes a day, a week, even a year.<br><br>Imagine living with the uncertainty of this situation. One day you work at getting your "house" in order, only to have to pick up the stakes and move. Your ability to plan is totally gone. But even greater is the temptation to move when the cloud did not move because you felt it was time to move. For the Israelites, perhaps the grass was no longer green. Perhaps the water was not easily accessible. Perhaps the bugs were a problem. Whatever the case, they were strictly prohibited from moving if the cloud did not move.<br><br>It is still the same today. We are not to move unless the Holy Spirit instructs us to do so. We are not to make that business deal on the basis of whether or not it makes sense, but on the leading of the Holy Spirit's "cloud" in our life. It is a difficult process to move only when we are directed, and to remain if we are not. The pressure is always upon us to move, to plan, to act. But if we act, we may move into a place where the presence of God may not be. Hence, the rub. The Christian businessperson must learn to move when God says move; it is a sign of complete surrender and dependence on God's Spirit to direct our steps.<br><br>Ask God today if you are sitting under His cloud. Or, have you moved when He said stand still? He will show you.<br><br></div>

The caterpillar that lies inside the cocoon will never become the beautiful butterfly if someone cuts open the cocoon prematurely. It is the struggle itself that allows the butterfly to emerge as a strong, new creature of nature.<br><br>God understands how necessary this process is. That is why we are allowed to experience difficult, often life-changing events. He even orchestrates them-all for our benefit. What the Israelites thought was a cruel joke when Pharaoh sent troops to pursue them after they had been freed and penned against the shore of the Red Sea became the stage for the most publicized miracle of all time-the parting of the Red Sea. Generation after generation has heard this incredible story of deliverance. God puts us against the "Red Seas" in order to show His power in and through us. If we do not know God can deliver, then we can never learn to trust Him. Circumstances that go beyond our capabilities of solving them place us at God's complete mercy. This is how He likes it.<br><br>Do not fear the calamity that comes your way. If you are faithful to Him in the test, you will see God's power manifested like never before. Just as the Israelites were able to sing a song of deliverance, you too will have your own testimony of the Lord's faithfulness; and you will be able to recall it for others to build your faith and theirs.<br><br></div>

The early Church turned the world upside down in that first century. What made them so effective? Was it their theology? Was it great preaching? Was it due to one man's influence apart from Jesus?<br><br>The Scriptures are clear as to what made the early Church effective. It is at the core of God's heart, and it is quite simple. God desires to reflect His nature and power through every individual. When this happens, the world is automatically changed because the world is affected by those who reflect His glory.<br><br>We serve a jealous God. He is a God who will not share His glory with anyone. God sets up situations in order to demonstrate His power through them. He has done this since the day He created man. His desire is to reflect His glory through you and me, so that all men may know of His mighty acts and the glorious splendor of His Kingdom.<br><br>The apostle Paul understood this principle: "My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power, so that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom, but on God's power" (1 Cor. 2:4-5).<br><br>If you do not see His glory being reflected through your life, then you need to ask why.

They wait until the last minute, then send out the distress signal. Many people work their relationship with God that way. They call on Him infrequently while things are going well, but when trouble rears its ugly head, they are pounding on His door for help. It is a wise person who learns to include God in everything he does. When God is a full part of your life, you never feel panic when things go wrong.

            <div class='col-md body'>THE MIKVEH OF THE BRIDE<br><br>By Bishop Dr. Dominiquae Bierman<br><br>So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.  2 Kings 5:14<br><br>Shabbat Shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>It was my wedding day, the 23rd of January 1990; the day that we would be married by the Rabbis, which is the only legal way for two Jews to be married in Israel. My Messianic wedding was scheduled for April; however our relationship was going to become legal under the Â“ChuppaÂ” (wedding canopy) that day! It had been a very hectic day to say the least! The papers from the USA proving that Baruch was a bachelor and a Jew had not been given to us yet. We had to literally fight with the clerks in the Chief Rabbinate of Jerusalem to release them to us on time. We had been refused marriage in BaruchÂ’s home town in Maaleh Adumin in the desert of Judea because they had discovered that we were Messianic believers. Posters warning the public about us were posted in the synagogues. Finally Adonai opened the door in the city where my family lived, but we needed the documents from the Chief Rabbinate. YAH had spoken to me that the wedding would be on the 23rd, yet it did not seem possible. We were being beaurocratically harassed and I have had no time for Â“Bridal PreparationsÂ”. As we had to wait for our papers, I escaped to the hair dresser to at least comb my hair in an attractive manner and yet after this day of sweat I had not time for shower, let alone for THE MIKVEH which is the ritual bath all Jewish brides have to undergo before marriage.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finally we got the papers and the time was near 5 PM. We needed to travel to Raanana that is more than one hour away from Jerusalem and arrive there before 6 PM. The local Rabbi would be leaving at 6 PM and there would be no wedding afterwards. We had no one with us. In fact nobody knew that this was going to be our wedding day. The celebration would only happen in April. With the wind in our backs we Â“flewÂ” to Raanana in BaruchÂ’s double cab Volkswagen truck. We made it at 6 PM sharp however the Rabbi had just left! We were devastated and said to the secretary to please call him back! This was not our fault, it was the Chief Rabbinate. A very reluctant Rabbi made his way back to us, but he made it! That was a miracle already. I was stressed and exhausted and had stretched my faith to the limit. We sat across the RabbiÂ’s desk and he asked me the dreaded question: Â“Do you have your Mikveh certificate, the proof that you have taken the ritual purification bath according to Jewish Law?Â” I was pale and began to say:<br><br>Â“No, becauseÂ…..Â” He did not let me explain ANYTHING! My NO was enough. The Rabbi slammed his fist with full force on the table and he said- THE WEDDING IS CANCELLED. I could answer nothing, I was speechless and I prayed silently: Â“Father this is your turn now, I have done all I could doÂ….Â”  Then the face of the Rabbi changed from hard to soft and compassionate and he asked me. Â“If I let you get married, will you go immediately to the Mikveh and will NOT TOUCH with your husband until the full purification bath requirements would be met? Â“ I solemnly promised him that with all of my heart and so did my husband to be. We will not touch, no, not even hands until the bride would be pure and holy according to the Law. We sighed with relief. Our Father and Matchmaker had intervened once again!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Right after the Chuppa Wedding took place we took the Rabbi home and I was dropped at the local MIKVEH HOUSE. There the women received me like a QUEEN. Â“A bride, a bride has arrived, they shouted! They began to assist me with gusto for the purification waters. I felt like I Was in Heaven, I have had such a hard day and welcomed the assistance, the treatment and the preparations to be pure in the eyes of God and man. I welcomed this Cleansing Bath! The ladies helped me remove my clothes and I was naked. They helped me with instructions on how to prepare: I had to remove all make up, all nail polish; all Jewels and yes even cut my nails so that no dirt could hide underneath! Hair in my most intimate places had to be trimmed so that no dirt could Â“hideÂ”. My hair had to be thoroughly shampooed, my ears absolutely clean! I could have no traces of menstrual blood or any impurities. Nothing could separate between my body and the Waters of Purification. These waters can only be true rain water, not any man made Â“treated waterÂ”.<br><br>Now the ladies in charge oversaw my immersion. I had to immerse 7 times with the fingers in my hands completely OPEN to allow the water to reach EVERY CORNER of my body. The immersion needed to be thorough and full. Not a trace of my body could be seen as I immersed. No, no flesh! Not even a hair! Echad, shtayim, shaloshÂ… One, two, three, four, five, six, seven- SHEVA! I had done it! As I rose from the water after the seventh immersion, I was greeted with the traditional greeting of MAZL TOV! I was officially certified PURE and ready to become ONE with my husband. I cannot begin to describe the feeling of exhilaration and release that I felt. I felt as pure as a little, innocent child that had never sinned and yet more feminine than ever. I was glowing!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After the shower I got dressed up and these wonderful ladies took care of combing my hair and of giggling a lot because they knew that an eager husband was waiting for me outside. I needed no make up and my hair was wet. I looked radiant, fully renewed! The ladies took my right and left arm and as a bridal delegation they accompanied me to the truck where my newly wedded husband was waiting. I was glowing, he was enthralled to see meÂ…Our married life was about to begin.<br><br>My dearly beloved friends: It is the passing through the MIKVEH that defines if the wedding will take place or not. It is only the ones that are willing to be totally purified that will marry The Jewish Bridegroom. YÂ’shua is and forever will be a Jewish Bridegroom! And the only way to become a BRIDE to be truly MARRIED is to be purified thoroughly! Not only by removing our external clothing (such as pagan feasts and all kinds of wrong Â“habitsÂ”) but by not allowing ANY DIRT to hide anywhere in our souls. All Jewish brides need to Â“pass the inspectionÂ” of the ladies in charge of the Mikveh. Just like they checked me to see if my nails were short enough, if there was no menstrual flow, if my ears were clean, so the Holy Spirit is in charge of inspecting the Bride of Messiah prior to the wedding, the Ruach in Hebrew as you well know by now is in female gender. Actually the Spirit is using many women in these End Times to help inspect, cleanse and prepare the Bride for the Wedding. In fact only women can prepare the Bride. A TRUE BRIDE will allow herself to be inspected and will not resent it or feel humiliated. I felt privileged and I believe that those that truly belong to The Bride of Messiah will also feel privileged rather than Â“threatenedÂ” by the invasion of their Â“privacyÂ”! There will be no wedding without A MIKVEH. The whole Ecclesia has to be immersed in the True Waters of Torah of His Word and wash away all impurities in a thorough way and then She will be ready!<br><br>Â“That He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.Â” Ephesians 5:26-27<br><br>This is an invitation to the TRUE BRIDE to enter into The End Time MIKVEH and Wedding Preparations. This is THE MAP REVOLUTION.<br><br>In The Mikveh<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Rabbi Baruch and Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tzav Â“CommandÂ”<br><br>Vayikra / Leviticus 6:1-8:36<br>Yermiyahu / Jer. 7:21-8:3, 9:22-23<br>Mal'achi / Malachi 3:4-24<br><br>By Rabbi Yaakov benYosef<br><br>When the Cohen HaGadol sinned, he could not officiate at the altar. As a result, the Children of Yisrael would not have an intermediary to place their sacrifices on the altar.  Vayikra 4:3 makes it clear that when this happened, the entire nation shared in the guilt.  Since an unclean Cohen HaGadol brought guilt on the entire nation, consecration of the Cohen HaGadol was essential to the welfare of Yisrael. Unfortunately, since an unclean Cohen HaGadol could not officiate at the altar, he could not atone for his own sin. Therefore, an intermediary was needed who could officiate at the altar. An intermediary worthy of atoning for the High Priest required a greater anointing than a priest. The one individual in Yisrael that had a greater anointing was Moshe. In fact, his anointing was so exulted that he spoke to HaShem face to face as Shemot 33:11 states Â“the LORD spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.Â” MosheÂ’s face-to-face contact with HaShem gave him a state holiness that kept him constantly in the Lords presence. MosheÂ’s level of holiness was so great that he was even considered to be like god to the High Priest. In fact, the translation of Shemot 4:16 from The Complete Jewish Bible, states, Â“for you he will be a mouth; and for him, you will be like GodÂ”. Through Moshe, it was possible for the High Priest to become clean, and return to his duties in the Tabernacle. In Tzav, we can see how Moshe anointed and sacrificed for Aharon and his sons so that they could begin their duties in the Tabernacle.<br><br>As part of HaShemÂ’s requirements of sanctification, He commanded Moshe to wash, clothe, and anoint the cohenim. The first part of the cohenimÂ’s sanctification required an outward change. The first step required the cohen to bathe. Vayikra 8:6 states Â“Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with waterÂ”. Washing the High Priest prepared him to wear the holy garments. The second step in an outward change was for the High Priest to clothe himself with the Holy garments. Vayikra 8:7-9 states Â“he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith. And he put the b r e a s tplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim. And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.Â”   Wearing the holy garments represented that the High Priest was to remain holy. The holy garments of the High Priest symbolized HaShemÂ’s Holiness in the midst of uncleanness. The High Priest was required to separate himself from all uncleanness. If the High Priest became unclean, all of Yisrael bore the guilt. The final step in an outward change required Aharon to be anointed. The anointing of the High Priest allowed him to receive anointing with the same fragrant oil that anointed the Tabernacle. As a result, the High Priest became a vessel of the Tabernacle. The High Priest was to exude the same pleasing aroma that the Tabernacle did. The outward change of the High Priest was required so everyone in Yisrael could witness HaShem in their midst. As a result, the outward appearance and fragrance of the High Priest became a testimony to HaShem.<br><br>HaShem also wanted the High PriestÂ’s inner holiness to match his outward appearance. Therefore, the High Priest was also required to be spiritually clean. For the spiritual cleansing HaShem commanded sacrificial offerings. The first sacrifice required for the sanctification of the High Priest was the sin offering. Vayikra 8:14 states Â“He brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.Â” Unlike the sin offering mentioned in Vayikra 4, this sin offering was not slain by the person bringing the offering. In this instance, the intermediary killed the offering.  Because Moshe was the only individual in Yisrael that was holier than the High Priest, Moshe was the only individual able to sanctify the High Priest. HaShemÂ’s presence in the Tabernacle sanctified every individual that brought an offering. Therefore, after the tabernacle was functional, anyone that brought an offering was required to slay the sacrifice. Another symbol representing the spiritual cleansing of the High Priest was the blood commitment. Vayikra 8:23-24 Â“Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of AaronÂ’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. And he brought AaronÂ’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.Â” When the blood was placed on the right ear, right hand, and right toe of Aharon and his sons they entered into a covenant with HaShem that required them to dedicate their lives hearing, doing, and walking in HaShemÂ’s will. Therefore, placing the blood on Aharon and his sons symbolized their commitment to serve HaShem with their heart, soul, and strength. Aharon and his sons then presented a wave offering from the ram of sanctification. This was done to symbolize the gratefulness of Aharon and his sons because HaShem had sanctified them in flesh and in spirit. Finally, to show Yisrael their lives were totally dedicated to HaShem. Aharon and his sons were required to sit in the presence of HaShem, and not leave the tabernacle for seven days. At the end of seven days, they were sanctified and were allowed to leave the Tabernacle. When they left the tabernacle on the eighth day Aharon and his sons had been transformed in flesh and in spirit and were now acceptable priests.<br><br>Because an unclean High Priest brought guilt into the whole congregation the sanctification of the High Priest was a crucial part of worship at the tabernacle. However, to sanctify the High Priest required an individual with a greater anointing than the High Priest. Therefore, HaShem chose Moshe as His vessel of sanctification. For the sanctification of Aharon and his sons, they were required to commit their spirits and their flesh to HaShem. To sanctify the priests flesh, required them to bathe, wear the holy garments, and be anointed. To sanctify the priests spirits required them to bring sacrifices and commit to serving HaShem with their heart, soul, and strength. As a result, when Aharon and his sons finished the sanctification process they represented<br><br>worship that was founded on spirit and in truth.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sandie Freed: "Get The Anointing Out Of The Box!"<br>Get the Anointing Out of the Box!</strong><br>I heard these words LOUD and CLEAR! The question was...Who said that? Since I had not heard God speak that way before, I immediately challenged the SPIRIT behind the words. Surely that is the voice of the devil, he wants me to believe that I am not anointed! Just about the time I began to rebuke the perceived evil spirit, the same voice trumpeted again, only louder and more distinctly.<br><br>"Get the anointing out of the box!" Yes, it was the Lord's voice.<br>"What do you mean...the anointing is in a box? Are you speaking to me individually...are you speaking to the church...are you speaking concerning another ministry?" I asked the Lord these questions in my mind.<br><br>Suddenly, revelation came and it became clear that it was the move of HIS SPIRIT that was boxed in. The Holy Spirit was unable to move freely among His Body because a stronghold of religion, traditions and mindsets limited His power.<br><br>Then I had a vision of an alabaster jar. I knew that the alabaster jar was full of anointing oil and the anointing was contained--it was "boxed" within this vessel. I immediately remembered the Scripture where the jar had to be BROKEN in order to release the oil. (Mark 14:3)<br><br>The Spirit of God spoke to me once more, and said that just as the oil was contained, it had to be released by the broken vessel to become tangible. The Lord gave me an understanding that the oil often represents the anointing of God.<br>In order for God's anointing to truly flow and become present in our lives, brokenness would be required. The flow of His Spirit would demand that walls come down. These walls were religious mindsets and traditions of man, which became huge barriers blocking the flow of the oil.<br><br><strong>The Oil Needs to Flow!</strong><br><br>By reading in Psalm 133, we notice that the oil is not to be contained, but it is to flow! Just as the dew on Mount Herman manifests on a daily basis, so is the anointing to be fresh every day in our lives. The anointing is to flow from the head down, covering the entire body. According to the Scripture, the anointing flows freely when unity is present.<br><br>Obviously disunity affects the flow. When the Body is under headship, the anointing touches the entire Body of Christ. Therefore, we, as believers, need to find our place within the Body of Christ, and remain in our position so that when the anointing flows, we get touched! As a result, we become empowered with more anointing to fulfill our destiny! To insure a fresh flow of anointing, we must daily position ourselves under the direction and headship of Christ and submit to His plan. This is when we know we are allowing ourselves to become broken...it is now "thy will be done" rather than "my will be done."<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Get the anointing out of the box...part2<br><br><strong>Broken Vessels</strong><br><br>The word "broken" is past tense of "break." So often I have ministered on the "breaker anointing," and how the Breaker goes before us and breaks open a move of the Spirit. Therefore mindsets and traditions become broken because of His "breaking through" on our behalf. However, I now understand that unless we are also "broke," the breaker cannot bring us into fulfillment (into a past tense, where it is already fulfilled).<br>We are often like wild horses that need to be "broke" into a place of submission. I recently watched a movie in which a wild mustang was "broke." The actual speaking lines in the movie were, "that mustang needs to be broke!"  and, "is that wild horse broke yet?" That horse definitely needed to be tamed. He bucked, snarled and kicked while the owner was attempting to tame his spirit. Finally, after great exhaustion, the mustang would surrender his will to the master.<br>Isn't this like us? We kick and scream and ask "why?!"... which only delays the plans of the Father. However, once we surrender to His perfect will, there is a breakthrough. We are now "BROKE!" For the anointing to flow, we will have to experience brokenness.<br><br><strong>The Vision of the Chariot</strong><br><br>While in worship one morning, the Lord gave me a vision of God in His chariot. His golden chariot hurled from the Heavenlies towards the earth. It was clear He had a pathway planned, and His chariot was directed toward that destiny upon the earth. Suddenly a pathway appeared upon the earth, yet it was unpaved. (It was similar to an airplane pilot spotting the runway...suddenly the runway appears and the plane can be landed.) As the chariot approached the determined pathway, a long line of apostles appeared along each side of the path. It became even clearer that they lined the edges of the path providing the chariot's "runway." As the chariot approached its pathway, the apostles and prophets began to fall down upon the path. THEY became the path for the chariot of glory to follow. In other words, they became the ROAD on which the chariot would ride.<br><br>It became more evident that glory would come because these apostles and prophets laid down their lives and they were truly the FOUNDATION (like foundation stones) upon which the Lord would reveal His glory!<br>The apostles and prophets truly became the road--the highway of holiness upon which God's glory would travel upon the earth. As they fell prostrate before the Lord, their bodies filled in all the chug holes, crevices and rough spots, so that the chariot could move smoothly and freely without any obstacles hindering its destiny.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Get the anointing out of the box part 3</strong><br><br><strong>Laying Down Our Lives</strong><br><br>Many prophets and apostles have been pioneers of a present-day move of His Spirit. They have determined to focus on fulfilling destiny, and have been laying down their own lives and desires for the gospel. In the vision, the glory would not manifest unless many laid down their own vision, their own desires, and even their own "kingdoms." In order to experience His glory, there will be a death to self and selfish ambitions. But also, to flow in the anointing of God, we will experience needed purification. Just as Esther had to lay down her life, submit to an unknown life with strangers and endure purification, so must we as end-time believers. We must know that we have truly come to the Kingdom for such a time as this!<br><br><strong>Full Circle</strong><br><br>Esther endured a 12-month process of purification. Twelve is the number for "new government." It is time for the "new government" within us to arise. It is our season to take Godly authority over our flesh, over infirmity, and over generational strongholds. Many of us have come full circle once again...this is because we are facing old enemies that need to be put totally under our feet. As our belief systems are transformed, new government will operate within us and through us.<br><br>We must believe only what the Lord says about us, and we must decree what God has said about us, our families, our businesses and our ministries.<br>Find your written decree in the Scripture and begin to proclaim what God hath said. In Esther's time, written decrees were laws which could not be reversed unless another decree was written. A new written decree would negate the power of the previous decree.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Get the anointing out of the box part 4<br><br>Decrees</strong><br><br>Saints, hear me! God has already written a decree which will negate whatever the enemy has decreed over you! Your written decree is found in the Word of God. Maybe it is written in a personal prophecy or a documented dream. The important thing at this time is to find your written decree and WRITE it down so it can become written. By writing it, you can use it against the enemy...and therefore declare "devil, it is written!" At this time, it will become a proceeding word, just like the proceeding word that Jesus used during His temptation. If you have prophecies that are not "written," it is time to write them so that you can "decree a thing and it shall be established..." (Job 22:28 )<br><br>The purification process you endure will secure your authority in the Spirit, and the anointing will become more intensified.<br>You might be wondering, "Is it worth it?" I have even asked myself this, especially when the fire of God is scorching every fiber of my flesh. But, I have always concluded that YES, it is worth all the sacrifice when I experience someone being ministered to by the Holy Spirit through a teaching,  or when I witness a saint receive hope through a prophetic word, or see someone get their miracle or breakthrough. Yes, it is worth the process to be a vessel of His glory!<br><br><strong>Transition</strong><br><br>The Lord began to reveal more to me concerning the appearing of His chariot. I was reminded that in one incidence, His chariot appeared at a time of transition. Transition means to move from one place to another, or from one POSITION (in the spirit) to another. The Lord's chariot appeared when Elijah was taken up into Heaven, and also when Elisha was transitioning into his new double portion anointing.<br><br>By studying the passage of the transition of Elijah-Elisha, let's observe what this means today. When God's chariot of GLORY came to earth, it was symbolic of "thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven."<br><br>1. The mantle of the "old" prophet was given to the "new" prophet. The passing of a mantle is a releasing of authority, but also it is symbolic of a garment change in the Body of Christ; taking off old clothing and putting on the new. Also, we are putting off the old man and putting on the new. A new wine skin is being developed in this season because we must transition into God's New Thing.<br><br>The changing of the mantles also speaks to us today concerning an old order. Prophetically, the order of Saul is dead and the new order of David is coming forth. Old ways of having "church" will change because a fresh anointing is needed.<br><br>2. We are in a season of great transition. Transitioning out of old doctrine, old structure, religious mindsets and religion--into a relationship with Christ, into a church without walls, and turning into empowered ministers in the marketplace.<br><br>3. We are transitioning away from a religious movement into the saints movement, where every saint is a minister. In the saints movement, we will witness double portion anointing, and a release of increase and multiplication, as well as financial breakthrough.<br><br>4. God wants to release a Greater Glory. This is derived because we are continuing to move from faith to faith, strength to strength and glory to glory.<br><br>5. There will be a "breaking open." Heaven had to break open for the chariot of glory to come, which means we must pray for breakthrough.<br><br>6. We will become broken as we embrace Elisha's anointing. Remember the process that he endured as he followed his mentor, and he endured with him until the very end.<br><br>7. We will experience a parting of our own "river Jordan" as we transition. Elisha transitioned with his new mantle, and the parting of the Jordan was symbolic of the parting from the old into the new.<br><br>8. There will be a crossing over. We are leaving the past behind and pressing forward into the new. As we cross over, there will be a reversal that occurs. This reversal will reverse decrees that the enemy has made against us, and will result in a return of what the thief has stolen. There will be a reversal in the curses that have plagued us, as well as a reversal of poverty, which had a stronghold over so many of God's givers.<br><br><strong>Being Open-Minded</strong><br><br>In order for us to break into this new place, we must be open-minded.<br>This can become extremely difficult because we are creatures of habit and most of us dislike change. God desires for His children to openly embrace whatever He has planned. This new move will shake traditional mindsets, it will cause each of us to feel uncomfortable. But we must not hold back, we must leap forward into the freedom He is offering.<br><br><strong>He Will Oversee Our Building Up and Planting!</strong><br><br>Just as God oversaw every area in which we were being uprooted or torn down, or feeling destroyed, He promises to oversee you totally rebuilt and planted firmly. (Jeremiah 31:28.) He has had each of us in a process of purification. We have been torn down, He has judged our sins and laid the axe to the root of many hidden desires. Now, precious ones, He will oversee every area as He rebuilds us. He will make the crooked paths straight and cause our ground to be fruitful. This is promised to us as we get the anointing out of the box.<br><br>Let's be determined to let go and let God. Let go of tradition, let go so that you can grow. Release and let go of your own control over your situations so that God can release increase.<br><br>In Him,<br><br>Sandie Freed<br>Zion Ministries</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Decision-making<br>Proverbs 3:5<br>Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.<br><br>This is one of the most quoted verses in the Bible related to gaining wisdom and direction from God. Yet I have never heard one teaching on this passage that teaches what I believe the psalmist is really saying. The first part is pretty easy; we are to trust with all our heart. But the next part is not so clear. We are not to lean on our own understanding. If we are not to lean on our own understanding, on whose understanding are we to lean? God's!<br><br>Throughout the Old Testament we find that God set up structures by which those in authority made decisions. God has always set a principle whereby we are to seek Him in all our decisions, that He might truly make our decisions. In the Old Testament, the priest made decisions based on which way the Urim and Thummim fell inside his breastplate. The casting of lots was another means of allowing a decision to be left with God. Proverbs says, "The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord" (Prov. 16:33). Another means of making a decision was through the agreement of two or three. No one could be guilty of any crime without the witness of two or three. This was a biblical way of confirming a matter. Still another means of making a decision is through a multitude of counselors.<br><br>Given all these scenarios, what are we to gain from these examples? We are told in Jeremiah 17:9a, "The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure." So what really protects each of us from the deceit of our own heart? I believe it is the combination of all the above. When we get to a place with God that our decisions are accountable to others, whether that be a wife, a board, or a few close friends who are committed to the same godly ideals, this is when we are protected from the deceit of our own heart. This is one of the hardest things to yield to God-the right to make our own decisions. Yet, it is the most elementary principle God requires of us to receive His blessing in our lives.<br><br>This principle took a long time for me to appropriate. However, today I can tell you I would never make a major decision without the counsel of others who are close to me. Relational accountability has become lost in our culture due to our hunger for independence. I have experienced too often the hardship that results from making decisions that God isn't behind. Walking in obedience is the only real freedom in Christ.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Black Hole<br>2 Corinthians 12:9<br>..."My grace is sufficient for you...."<br><br>If you are older than 35, you may recall the early days of the space program. I remember the early spacecraft launch with John Glenn. One of the most exciting and tense moments of his return to earth was his reentry to the earth's atmosphere. I recall the diagram on television of the heat shield on the capsule that had to withstand incredible temperatures to avoid complete destruction. There was a blackout period for several minutes in which mission control had no radio contact. He was in the "black hole." It was a tense time. Either he would make it through, or the spacecraft would burn up in the atmosphere. There were several minutes of silence that seemed like an eternity. Then, mission control shouted with joy when they reestablished contact with the spacecraft. It was a time of rejoicing.<br><br>Have you ever had a time when you were in a spiritual black hole in your life? I have. The pressure was unbearable. No sense of God's presence. No sense of anything going on around me. God was about as far away as the man in the moon-at least from my perspective. I think every Christian who is called to make a significant difference in his world experiences times like these. These are the times when we question the reality of God, the love of God, the personal care of God. And He demonstrates to us that He was there all the time. These are "faith experiences" that God does in every person who is called to a higher level of relationship with Him. These times are needful in order to know that we have the "heat shield" that can withstand the incredible heat that comes when we follow Him with a whole heart-a heart that is radical in a commitment to fully follow His ways. Elisha had that spirit. He slaughtered his 12 oxen and burned his plowing equipment so that he would not have the opportunity to return to anything if God didn't come through (see 1 Kings 19:21).<br><br>The apostle Paul asked God to remove the heat from his own life one time. God's answer was not what he wanted to hear.<br><br>But He said to me, My grace (My favor and loving-kindness and mercy) is enough for you [sufficient against any danger and enables you to bear the trouble manfully]; for My strength and power are made perfect (fulfilled and completed) and show themselves most effective in [your] weakness. Therefore, I will all the more gladly glory in my weaknesses and infirmities, that the strength and power of Christ (the Messiah) may rest (yes, may pitch a tent over and dwell) upon me! (2 Corinthians 12:9 AMP)<br><br>How's your heat shield today? Can it withstand the heat that would want to burn up everything in your life not based in Him? Christ said, "My grace is sufficient." Is that really true in your life? Let His grace be your shield today<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Understanding Your Gift<br>1 Corinthians 12:1<br>Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.<br><br>In First Corinthians 12 and Romans 12, the apostle Paul is teaching us about the role of spiritual gifts in the Church. He correlates these gifts to a human body, telling us that each person's gift helps the whole Body of the Church. This is such an important principle for us to learn. I must say I learned this principle regarding my own spiritual gift the hard way.<br><br>"God will never speak as strongly to you as to someone else," said my mentor to me one day. The statement shocked me. "What in the world do you mean by that?" I argued with him.<br><br>"Your spiritual gift of administration/leading is one of the most dangerous gifts in the whole Body of Christ. The reason is that you can see the big picture better than anyone else, and you're so task-oriented that you will run people into the ground getting your project completed because you think you see it so clearly. That is why the best friend you could ever have is someone with a prophetic gift to discern whether the big picture you see is actually the picture God is directing. It is the one gift that can almost stand alone better than any other-at least that is the opinion of the one with that gift."<br><br>Oh, how I have learned this lesson the hard way! He was so right. There have been many a church staff destroyed by a person with the gift of administration. During my years as an ad agency owner, I saw how I stressed out my staff because of the tremendous load I put on them with multiple projects. It was so easy for me because the more balls I had juggling, the better I felt. I was oblivious to how my multi-task personality impacted those around me.<br><br>Today, I have some special relationships with intercessors and prophetic people whom I depend on for confirmation of direction. I have learned their spiritual gifts of discernment are of great value in determining strategic direction. I have learned that God has placed within each person a spiritual gift that is designed to make the Body of Christ function better for His purposes. When we discover the spiritual gifts God has placed in those around us, we are better able to see the Body function as a real body-totally dependent on one another. Some of us are more sensitive to God's voice because God has gifted us in that way. Others of us are less sensitive because God wants us to depend on others in the Body for their gifts. Find out whom God has placed around you today and discover a new dimension of spiritual productivity.<br><br></div>

Why do I run to this neighbor and that when God is so near and will hear my faintest call? Why do I sit down and devise schemes and invent plans?

            <div class='col-md body'>The Key to the Wind<br><br>"The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all" (Ps. 103:19).<br><br>Some time since, in the early spring, I was going out at my door when round the corner came a blast of east wind--defiant and  pitiless, fierce and withering--sending a cloud of dust before it.<br><br>I was just taking the latchkey from the door as I said, half impatiently, "I wish the wind would"--I was going to say change;  but the word was checked, and the sentence was never finished.<br><br>As I went on my way, the incident became a parable to me. There came an angel holding out a key; and he said:<br><br>"My Master sends thee His love, and bids me give you this."<br><br>"What is it?" I asked, wondering. "The key of the winds," said the angel, and disappeared.<br><br>Now indeed should I be happy. I hurried away up into the heights whence the winds came, and stood amongst the caves. "I will have done with the east wind at any rate--and that shall plague us no more," I cried; and calling in that friendless wind, I closed the door, and heard the echoes ringing in the hollow places. I turned the key triumphantly. "There," I said, now we have done with that."<br><br>"What shall I choose in its place?" I asked myself, looking about me. "The south wind is pleasant"; and I thought of the lambs, and the young life on every hand, and the flowers that had begun to deck the hedgerows. But as I set the key within the door, it began to burn my hand.<br><br>"What am I doing?" I cried; "who knows what mischief I may bring about? How do I know what the fields want! Ten thousand things of ill may come of this foolish wish of mine."<br><br>Bewildered and ashamed, I looked up and prayed that the Lord would send His angel yet again to take the key; and for my part I promised that I would never want to have it any more.<br><br>But lo, the Lord Himself stood by me. He reached His hand to take the key; and as I laid it down, I saw that it rested  against the sacred wound-print.<br><br>It hurt me indeed that I could ever have murmured against anything wrought by Him who bare such sacred tokens of His love. Then He took the key and hung it on His girdle.<br><br>"Dost THOU keep the key of the winds?" I asked.<br><br>"I do, my child," He answered graciously.<br><br>And lo, I looked again and there hung all the keys of all my life. He saw my look of amazement, and asked, "Didst thou not know, my child, that my kingdom ruleth over all?"<br><br>"Over all, my Lord!" I answered; "then it is not safe for me to murmur at anything?" Then did He lay His hand upon me tenderly. "My child," He said, "thy only safety is, in everything, to love and trust and praise." --Mark Guy Pearse<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Prayer of Faith<br><br>"God that cannot lie promised" (Titus 1:2).<br><br>Faith is not working up by will power a sort of certainty that something is coming to pass, but it is seeing as an actual fact that God has said that this thing shall come to pass, and that it is true, and then rejoicing to know that it is true, and just resting because God has said it.<br><br>Faith turns the promise into a prophecy. While it is merely a promise it is contingent upon our cooperation. But when faith claims it, it becomes a prophecy, and we go forth feeling that it is something that must be done because God cannot lie. --Days of Heaven upon Earth<br><br>I hear men praying everywhere for more faith, but when I listen to them carefully, and get at the real heart of their prayer, very often it is not more faith at all that they are wanting, but a change from faith to sight.<br><br>Faith says not, "I see that it is good for me, so God must have sent it," but, "God sent it, and so it must be good for me."<br><br>Faith, walking in the dark with God, only prays Him to clasp its hand more closely.  --Phillips Brooks<br><br>"The Shepherd does not ask of thee<br>Faith in thy faith, but only faith in Him;<br>And this He meant in saying, 'Come to me.'<br>In light or darkness seek to do His will,<br>And leave the. work of faith to Jesus still."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fresh Touch with God<br><br>"And the ill favored and lean-fleshed kine did Eat up the seven well favored and fat kinÂ…and the thin, ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears" (Gen. 41:4, 7).<br><br>There is a warning for us in that dream, just as it stands: It is possible for the best years of our life, the best experiences, the best victories won, the best service rendered, to be swallowed up by times of failure, defeat, dishonor, uselessness in the kingdom. Some men's lives of rare promise and rare achievement have ended so. It is awful to think of, but it is true. Yet it is never necessary.<br><br>S. D. Gordon has said that the only assurance of safety against this tragedy is "fresh touch with God," daily, hourly. The blessed, fruitful, victorious experiences of yesterday are not only of no value to me today, but they will actually be eaten up or reversed by today's failures, unless they serve as incentives to still better, richer experiences today.<br><br>"Fresh touch with God," by abiding in Christ, alone will keep the lean kine and the ill favored grain out of my life.  --Messages for the Morning Watch<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Believing Before Seeing<br><br>"The land which I do give them, even the children of Israel" (Joshua 1:2).<br><br>God here speaks in the immediate present. It is not something He is going to do, but something He does do, this moment. So faith ever speaks. So God ever gives. So He is meeting you today, in the present moment. This is the test of faith. So long as you are waiting for a thing, hoping for it, looking for it, you are not believing. It may be hope, it may be earnest desire, but it is not faith; for "faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." The command in regard to believing prayer is the present tense. "When ye pray, believe that ye receive the things that ye desire, and ye shall have them." Have we come to that moment? Have we met God in His everlasting NOW?  --Joshua, by Simpson<br><br>True faith counts on God, and believes before it sees. Naturally, we want some evidence that our petition is granted before we believe; but when we walk by faith we need no other evidence than God's Word. He has spoken, and according to our faith it shall be done unto us. We shall see because we have believed, and this faith sustains us in the most trying places, when everything around us seems to contradict God's Word.<br><br>The Psalmist says, "I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of living" (Ps. 27:13). He did not see as yet the Lord's answer to his prayers, but he believed to see; and this kept him from fainting.<br><br>If we have the faith that believes to see, it will keep us from growing discouraged. We shall "laugh at impossibilities," we shall watch with delight to see how God is going to open up a path through the Red Sea when there is no human way out of our difficulty. It is just in such places of severe testing that our faith grows and strengthens.<br><br>Have you been waiting upon God, dear troubled one, during long nights and weary days, and have feared that you were forgotten? Nay, lift up your head, and begin to praise Him even now for the deliverance which is on its way to you.  --Life of Praise<br><br>Faith Becomes Sight<br><br>"Have faith that whatever you ask for in prayer is already granted you, and you will find that it will be" (Mark 11:24).<br><br>When my little son was about ten years of age, his grandmother promised him a stamp album for Christmas. Christmas came, but no stamp album, and no word from grandmother. The matter, however, was not mentioned; but when his playmates came to see his Christmas presents, I was astonished, after he had named over this and that as gifts received, to hear him add,<br><br>"And a stamp album from grandmother."<br><br>I had heard it several times, when I called him to me, and said, "But, Georgie, you did not get an album from your grandmother. Why do you say so?"<br><br>There was a wondering look on his face, as if he thought it strange that I should ask such a question, and he replied, "Well,  mamma, grandma said, so it is the same as." I could not say a word to check his faith.<br><br>A month went by, and nothing was heard from the album. Finally, one day, I said, to test his faith, and really wondering in my heart why the album had not been sent,<br><br>"Well, Georgie, I think grandma has forgotten her promise."<br><br>"Oh, no, mamma," he quickly and firmly said, "she hasn't."<br><br>I watched the dear, trusting face, which, for a while, looked very sober, as if debating the possibilities I had suggested. Finally a bright light passed over it, and he said,<br><br>"Mamma, do you think it would do any good if I should write to her thanking her for the album?"<br><br>"I do not know," I said, "but you might try it."<br><br>A rich spiritual truth began to dawn upon me. In a few minutes a letter was prepared and committed to the mail, and he went off whistling his confidence in his grandma. In just a short time a letter came, saying:<br><br>"My dear Georgie: I have not forgotten my promise to you, of an album. I tried to get such a book as you desired, but could not get the sort you wanted; so I sent on to New York. It did not get here till after Christmas, and it was still not right, so I sent for another, and as it has not come as yet, I send you three dollars to get one in Chicago. Your loving grandma."<br><br>"As he read the letter, his face was the face of a victor. "Now, mamma, didn't I tell you?" came from the depths of a heart that never doubted, that, "against hope, believed in hope" that the stamp album would come. While he was trusting, grandma was working, and in due season faith became sight.<br><br>It is so human to want sight when we step out on the promises of God, but our Savior said to Thomas, and to the long roll of doubters who have ever since followed him: "Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed."--Mrs. Rounds.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Impressions<br><br>"The ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them" (Num. 10:33).<br><br>God does give us impressions, but not that we should act on them as impressions. If the impression be from God, He will Himself give sufficient evidence to establish it beyond the possibility of a doubt.<br><br>How beautiful is the story of Jeremiah, of the impression that came to him respecting the purchase of the field of Anathoth. But Jeremiah did not act upon this impression until after the following day, when his uncle's son came to him and brought him external evidence by making a proposal for the purchase. Then Jeremiah said: "I knew this was the word of the Lord."<br><br>He waited until God seconded the impression by a providence, and then he acted in full view of the open facts, which could bring conviction unto others as well as to himself. God wants us to act according to His mind. We are not to ignore the Shepherd's personal voice but, like Paul and his companions at Troas, we are to listen to all the voices that speak and "gather" from all the circumstances, as they did, the full mind of the Lord. --Dr. Simpson<br><br>"Where God's finger points, there God's hand will make the way."<br><br>Do not say in thine heart what thou wilt or wilt not do, but wait upon God until He makes known His way. So long as that way is hidden it is clear that there is no need of action, and that He accounts Himself responsible for all the results of keeping thee where thou art. --Selected<br><br>"For God through ways we have not known, Will lead His own."<br><br></div>

There are thousands of things that we wear as shackles which we might use as instruments with music in them, if we only knew how.<br><br>Those men that ponder, and meditate, and weigh the affairs of life, and study the mysterious developments of God's providence, and wonder why they should be burdened and thwarted and hampered--how different and how much more joyful would be their lives, if, instead of forever indulging in self-revolving and inward thinking, they would take their experiences, day by day, and lift them up, and praise God for them.<br><br>We can sing our cares away easier than we can reason them away.
