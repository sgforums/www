No man is morally worthy of success in religious activities until he is willing that the honor of succeeding should go to another if God so wills.<br><br><strong>Failure and Success: Paralysis From Past Mistakes </strong><br><br>For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward those who fear Him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us. --Psalm 103:11-12<br><br>Do not let any of the things of the world or past mistakes paralyze your hearts. I believe there are Christians who have allowed some of their past mistakes to paralyze them. You were so bright and cheerful in your spiritual life once, and then you made some tragic mistake or had something happen to you. You got out of it somehow, and prayed and wept your way out of it. But it did something to you, and now you cannot lick it. Past wrongs that have been done to you, past failures, times you thought you were going to win and did not, or present sins or discouragement-these things are not mental at all. They are deeper than that; they are subconscious, and they prevent us from believing.<br><br>I most urgently exhort you, and I trust God Almighty to deliver you; to sponge that out of your spirit; to sponge that out of your heart so you are not hindered by unbelief. Rut, Rot or Revival: The Condition of the Church, pp. 162-163<br><br>"Lord, I'm surely not the only one who desparately needs this reminder this morning.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ha'azinu (Deuteronomy 32) </strong><br>Tell Your Children<br><br>Every Passover, in keeping with the theme of Divine intervention and redemption, my family has a custom at our seder table for each person to tell of instances where his or her own life was saved from danger.<br><br>One year, among our guests was a mother and her teenage daughter. The mother told a fascinating, dramatic story that had taken place during her youth. As impressed as we all were by the story, her daughter was even more impressed - because this was the first time she had heard this bit of family history! Noting the daughter's reaction, many of us at the table began to marvel about all the great stories that frequently go unshared between parents and their children.<br><br>The subject of sharing experiences with one's children is a prominent theme in this week's Torah portion, Ha'azinu. Much of the parsha is written as a "song" that describes the future recalcitrance toward God. Prophesizing that the Jewish people will forget God and His commandments, Moses describes the various afflictions that may come about. In the future, the Jewish people will push God's protective shelter away from them - and then wonder where God has gone! Finally in the midst of their suffering, the people will return to their connection with God.<br><br>The purpose of these verses, though, is not simply to prophesize about the future. Rather it is to serve "as a witness" to prevent the Jewish people from future misdeeds. Paradoxically, it is meant to prevent the very events that it is predicting will happen! The hope is that if we take to heart the warnings in the Torah, the dreaded consequences it predicts will not occur. It is primary to Jewish belief that prophecies of punishment can be nullified if people change their ways.<br><br>To help facilitate its transmission, this section - in addition to being read annually as one of the weekly Torah portions - was sung each week in the Temple by the Levites.<br><br>But the efficacy of this message obviously depends upon it being passed down accurately through the generations. In the view of certain commentators, it is a special mitzvah for parents to share experiences with their children. This is how we strengthen our connection to them and give them the best opportunities to learn about life. The Torah itself says: "Ask your father and he will relate it to you and your elders and they will tell you" (Deut. 32:7). Ultimately it is through the experiences of one's parents that one can come to better know oneself ... and the ways of God.<br><br><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>V'Zot HaBracha (Deuteronomy 33-34)<br>Education is Life<br><br>Education is not simply a room lined with desks.<br><br>Education takes place every instant of every day. Education is the experiences of life.<br><br>Our entire value system stems from our experiences. The influences of a classroom or a book are minor compared to the plethora of impressions that bombard us constantly.<br><br>Every teacher knows that by the time a child can sit at a school desk, that child has already received a majority of his education. The child has already developed the attitudes, drives, tendencies and emotions that will shape almost everything else he will do the rest of his life. That education did not come from a book; it came from experiential interaction. All the teacher can do at this point is offer some direction and a suggestion here and there.<br><br>In fact, teachers take a back seat to the true teachers of life: parents.<br><br>When a human being is most receptive to influences, then those influences have their greatest impact. A child is an open book which has engraved onto it's impressionable pages the most basic messages - transmitted by the parent.<br><br>***<br><br>TRANSMITTING THE MESSAGE<br><br>A textbook on character traits would include instructions for how to be fair, good, kind, considerate, etc. Though these words only contribute a small part of the child's understanding of what "fair" and "good" mean.<br><br>We learn from how people talk even more than from what they have to say. We learn from how they act and react. We learn kindness - not from a book on kindness - but from people who are kind.<br><br>If the child sees that in dealing with his friends the father often loses his temper, or when misfortune occurs the mother gets angry, then the child learns that being fair to your friends has limits, and having a positive outlook is only required when nothing goes wrong.<br><br>"It is important to be considerate of others" is a concept that the teacher can repeat in a classroom. But what does "important" mean? Does it mean more important than missing a game of golf, or losing 100 dollars? These questions will be answered only by parental example.<br><br>Today, we adults are the product of the consciousness, values, outlook and goals of ... our parents.<br><br>It is a heroic feat to re-influence yourself to be the way you would like to be, and not the way someone else made you. It is difficult to even objectively ask the question: "Who do I want to be?" But it is a noble undertaking, one that will bear many pleasant fruits.<br><br>***<br><br>FIRST WORDS OF TORAH<br><br>All this imparts a formidable goal for our own lives - and especially with our role as parents. The key question is: If you could say something that would be of great influence (to either yourself or your children), what would you say?<br><br>In this week's parsha, the Torah (Deut. 33:4) tells us: "Moses commanded us to keep the Torah, it is an inheritance of the community of Jacob."<br><br>Judaism tells us that these are the first words that we should teach our children. Though the child cannot possibly comprehend these words, neither is he expected to.<br><br>Would we really make the child's first lesson something he cannot possibly understand?! This contradicts the western idea of education, of building the child's knowledge from the simplest to the more sophisticated ideas.<br><br>But the Torah is teaching us something extremely profound. That the child's earliest memories are going to have tremendous impact on the child's development - beyond what is possible to comprehend.<br><br>Judaism says: Don't waste the child's earliest development on "goo-gah's" and Curious George. Rather let us engrain one of the most profound concepts we know!<br><br>But how can words - which have no meaning to this new infant - have such a deep affect?<br><br>The key is the feelings the parent expresses as the words are spoken, the tenderness the parent shows as he or she speaks. These express the importance and dearness of how much the parent wants the child to appreciate these values. They transmit a crucial message to the child: "This is what we want you to grasp, more than your first step." These words leave an indelible mark on the child's soft and malleable personality about what the parent deems as important and valuable in life.<br><br>Words alone cannot affect the child as deeply as when those words are spoken when the child is in the parents arms, and the words are spoken with deep and meaningful conviction.But that of course depends on whether the parent does feel the truth of the Torah's words! For empty words are empty words in anybody's ears - but in the ears of a baby they are the same as goo's and gah's.<br><br>***<br><br>INSTRUCTIONS FOR LIVING<br><br>Why are these words so significant that we need to teach them to a child so early in it's development and so use those critical first influences?<br><br>Everything in life has instructions: microwaves, computers, even toothbrushes!Life as well has an instruction book: our Torah is called the "instructions for living."<br><br>You wouldn't give your child a driver's license without instructions, so don't send him through life without some set of instructions for solving the many problems he is likely to encounter.<br><br>Tell your children right from the very beginning that there is the instruction book whose answers are good and will always help.<br><br>The best of all worlds is that your child will learn properly, the first time around, without having the need of solving problems. But like all well-planned campaigns, preparing for all contingencies is vital if success is your goal.<br><br>A parent who is trying to get his or her child to attend a particular university, for example, will leave brochures and information lying on the kitchen table - so when the child is ready and willing he knows where to go.<br><br>Therefore leave the name of life's instruction book lying around in the child's mind, so by the time the child is old enough, he will notice it lying on the table!<br><br>***<br><br>BRAINSTORMING QUESTIONS TO PONDER<br><br>Question 1: What is the most important lesson you know about life?<br><br>Question 2: Have you successfully transmitted this to those you care about?&gt;<br><br>Question 3: Do you exemplify this ideal yourself in everyday life?<br><br>Again, not promoting Judiasm but something that is important for all of us to consider...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Free Through Suffering<br>"Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress" Ps. 4:1).<br><br>This is one of the grandest testimonies ever given by man to the<br><br>moral government of God.<br><br>It is not a man's thanksgiving that he has been set free from<br>suffering. It is a thanksgiving that he has been set free through<br>suffering: "Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress."<br>He declares the sorrows of life to have been themselves the source<br>of life's enlargement. And have not you and I a thousand times felt<br>this to be true? It is written of Joseph in the dungeon that "the<br>iron entered into his soul." We all feel that what Joseph needed<br>for his soul was just the iron. He had seen only the glitter of<br>the gold. He had been rejoicing in youthful dreams; and dreaming<br>hardens the heart. He who sheds tears over a romance will not be<br>most apt to help reality; real sorrow will be too unpoetic for<br>him. We need the iron to enlarge our nature. The gold is but a<br>vision; the iron is an experience. The chain which unites me to<br>humanity must be an iron chain. That touch of nature which makes<br>the world akin is not joy, but sorrow; gold is partial, but iron<br>is universal.<br><br>My soul, if thou wouldst be enlarged into human sympathy, thou must<br>be narrowed into limits of human suffering. Joseph's dungeon is<br>the road to Joseph's throne. Thou canst not lift the iron load of<br>thy brother if the iron hath not entered into thee. It is thy limit<br><br>that is thine enlargement. It is the shadows of thy life that are<br>the real fulfillment of thy dreams of glory. Murmur not at the<br>shadows; they are better revelations than thy dreams. Say not that<br>the shades of the prison-house have fettered thee; thy fetters are<br>wings -- wings of flight into the bosom of humanity. The door of<br>thy prison-house is a door into the heart of the universe. God has<br>enlarged thee by the binding of sorrow's chain. --George Matheson<br><br>If Joseph had not been Egypt's prisoner, he had never been Egypt's<br>governor.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The 48 Ways: 20-21</strong><br>(20-21) <strong>Patience with Others</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Dovid Rosenfeld<br>"Torah is greater than priesthood and kingship, for kingship is acquired with 30 qualities, priesthood is acquired with 24, whereas the Torah is acquired with 48 ways. These are: ... (20) slowness to anger, (21) a good heart..."<br><br>Slowness to anger is perhaps the first quality we have come across that seems to have virtually nothing to do with scholarship per se. Practically all the qualities thus far were closely related to study -- listening, articulating, discussion with colleagues, limited worldly activity, etc. Directly or indirectly, they all contributed to our scholastic focus and achievement. An even disposition, on the other hand, though certainly a wonderful trait, would seem to have little relevance to study. It seems a more universal trait. It is in fact one of the qualities attributed to G-d (Exodus 34:6) -- one we would assume all Jews should emulate. What is the particular relevance to scholars?<br><br>The commentators offer a number of excellent answers. The first and possibly most important is that people just don't think straight when they are angry (Machzor Vitri). The Midrash tells us that every time Moses angered at the people, he made some kind of mistake (see Rashi to Numbers 31:21). He rebuked them for brazenly demanding water, and he then produced water by hitting a rock rather than speaking to it (see Numbers 20:1-13). He criticized Israel for preserving the wicked daughters of Midyan alive after their victorious battle against Midyan, and he then neglected to teach a relevant law (Numbers 31:1-24).<br><br>This is because anger is simply not conducive to rational thought or behavior. We all regret the things we said or did in fits of anger. (When I was in the computer profession, I really owed a lot to my dear friend one cubicle over -- who saved me from myself more than once by stopping me from sending off that e-mail in which I gave someone a piece of my mind. I've always agreed with him after the fact, (although it actually feels quite good to write that e-mail up even without sending it .) Torah study likewise, for all the exhilaration and excitement it entails, requires constant and levelheaded study and review. It will never be acquired by a seething and unsettled mind, besot with anger and pettiness.<br><br>The Midrash Shmuel (authored by Rav Shmuel de Uzeda, of 16th Century Safed, Israel) proposes a different answer. Anger is one of the biggest inhibiters of interpersonal relationships. Someone who is irascible or otherwise difficult to get along with will only with difficulty build good and healthy relationships. People who are forced to deal with him (employees, family members) will be cautious or defensive in his presence -- or will turn into scared and resentful "people-pleasers" -- letting out their true feelings about the person behind his back (if not to his face). Such a hothead will lack sincere and meaningful relationships, and though others may jump to attention in his presence, essentially he will be a lonely person indeed.<br><br>Good relationships are in truth important for everything in life -- for our emotional as well as spiritual development. For Torah study, however, it is critical. Many of the qualities we have studied thus far cannot be acquired in isolation. One must be a good listener (Way 2), he must humbly serve the scholars (Way 9), and he must discuss with colleagues and explain to students (Ways 10-11). Torah study requires almost constant positive interaction with others, both teachers, colleagues and students. As we've explained many times in the past, the Torah was never intended to be studied in a vacuum, reviewing texts in a chilly public-library setting. It is a living document, only attainable through animated and lively discussion. Only through real and meaningful human involvement does one truly acquire the Torah -- not as a book of facts and information, but as a living and pertinent guide for life. We must learn how to live Torah, not how to study it.<br><br>The angry person, however, will be ill-equipped to achieve in any of these areas. He will be unable to humble himself in front of his teacher and engage in open and sincere discussion with friends. And worst of all, he will not have the patience to teach others. We learned earlier in Pirkei Avos (way back when), "An impatient person cannot teach" (Chapter 2, Mishna 6).<br><br>As we all know, a very small part of teaching any true wisdom is knowing the material for oneself. A more important but still relatively insignificant aspect is being able to explain the material. The truly significant factor is building a rapport with one's students -- in the classroom and on an individual level. A teacher must give himself over to his students. He must be actively involved in and concerned with their development, willing to give over at the level each student is ready to receive. His goal is to foster and supervise their growth -- not to explain (or brag) his own Torah thoughts to others. Only the most giving and selfless of people can assume such a position. And without it, not only will the students suffer, but the teacher will never master this stage so critical and necessary for his own personal growth.<br><br>This issue relates to Way 21 as well -- a good heart. R. Samson Raphael Hirsch explains that a good heart -- also a wonderful trait but again, hardly scholarship-related -- is a critical prerequisite for interpersonal growth. If one is happy with the accomplishments of others, he will learn and grow from his friends as they grow from him. He will not find himself in constant debate with others, always out to prove he is right. He will see the wisdom others have to offer and gain from it. His understanding of Torah will be objective and selfless, not tainted by his own ego and stubbornness.<br><br>This is perhaps the greatest inhibiter of our own personal growth. People naturally have quite healthy (and inflated) egos. We are loath to admit our mistakes -- certainly not in front of whomever we're arguing with and usually not afterwards either. If I don't want to be shown wrong -- or if I am afraid or unable to admit any part of my life might be based on fallacy, I will convince myself of my preconceived notions -- even if they were never really thought out or were developed during some hazy, forgotten stage of one's youth. Are we willing to change when we hear truth? Are we open to what others have to say, or are we too full of and sure of ourselves (and scared of others) to budge? It all depends on if we are big enough to own up to mistakes and do something about them. And it actually all stems from the heart. If we feel good about others -- and if we're not threatened by the thought that we might that be wrong -- we will feel good about what they have to say. And if we feel good about what they say, we may just be open to new ideas. It sounds almost teasingly simple, yet this is perhaps the greatest challenge man faces in life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by Neil Anderson<br><br>BEYOND THE BOUNDARY OF YHVH'S DESIGN<br>1 Corinthians 6:18<br>Every other sin that a man commits is outside his body, but the immoral man [fornicator] sins against his own body<br><br>Sex glands are a YHVH-given part of our autonomic nervous system. Normal sexual functioning is a regular, rhythmic cycle of life. But when Yeshua said, "Everyone who looks on a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matthew 5:28 ), He was describing something beyond the boundary of YHVH's design for sex. The word for lust is epithumos . The prefix epi means "to add to," signifying that something is being added to a normal drive. Yeshua challenged us not to add onto the YHVH-given sexual drive by polluting our minds with lustful thoughts. The only way to control your sexual drive is to control your thought life.<br><br>Sexual lust demands physical expression, and that's where Romans 6 comes into play. We are not to let sin reign in our mortal bodies (verse 12) by using our bodies as instruments of unrighteousness (verse 13). Whenever you use your body wrongly through a sexual offense, you give Satan a foothold and your sexual problem becomes a spiritual problem. A missionary shared with me at the end of a conference that he was finally free after 20 years of bondage to lust. He sought counseling for his problem during his preparation for missionary service and on every furlough, but he never gained lasting victory until he realized that it was a spiritual problem which needed a spiritual solution.<br><br>Scripture indicates that sexual sins are in a class by themselves because they require the use of the body. Virtually every person I have counseled regarding a spiritual conflict has confessed some kind of sexual aberration.<br><br>Prayer:<br>Lord, I yield my sexual life to You as an expression of loving worship. I choose today to assume responsibility for my thoughts.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by Neil Anderson<br><br>WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR CONVICTION<br>Romans 14:13<br><br>Let us not judge one another anymore, but rather determine this--not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother's way<br><br>I grew up with a good, moral background, and I even went to church, but I wasn't a believer. In those days I really enjoyed beer, especially on a hot day after mowing the lawn. When I received Yeshua as a young man, I joined a church which preached total abstinence from alcoholic beverages. I wasn't a drunk, so I decided to scratch that rule and keep my beer.<br><br>My beer-drinking wasn't excessive, but two years later the Lord convicted me about it. With the conviction came the power to obey. So I gave it up. I'm so glad that no one laid a guilt trip on me or made an issue over my drinking an occasional beer.<br><br>Sometimes we are tempted to play the role of the Holy Spirit or the conscience in someone else's life on issues where the Scriptures are not crystal clear: "Believers don't drink or smoke"; "You should spend at least 30 minutes a day in prayer and Bible study"; "Buying lottery tickets is not good stewardship." I'm convinced that the Holy Spirit knows exactly when to bring conviction on issues of conscience. It's part of the process of sanctification which He superintends. When we attempt to play His role, we often do little more than convey criticism and rejection. Our job is to accept people and let the Holy Spirit bring conviction in His time.<br><br>Yahweh has given us the ministry of reconciliation, not condemnation. Paul wrote, "Yahweh was in Yeshua reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation" (2 Corinthians 5:19). There is a time and place to confront believers about immoral behavior. But when we do so, it is only because we care about their relationship with Yahweh and desire to protect others.<br><br>Prayer:<br>Lord, teach me to confront others in love when I must and to accept others in love as You have accepted me.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Failure That Leads to being Like Yahweh<br>1 Samuel 22:2<br>All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader....<br><br>Yahweh uses broken things to accomplish His greatest work. When David was anointed to be the next king, he was just a boy, the youngest among all his brothers. Little did he know that the next several years would be years of fleeing from Saul whose successes turned into obsessions as a leader who had fallen from Yahweh's anointing. Perhaps David thought, Why am I living a life as a fugitive? I am the next king of Israel. Yet, his life was filled with adversity after adversity before he ever fulfilled the ultimate calling Yahweh had for him. Others began to hear of David's successes and identify with his plight. But, it wasn't the successful and polished who came to join him. It was "those who were in distress or in debt or discontented" who would be part of his army-and an army it was! His army would become known throughout the world as the greatest ever assembled, not because of their skill, but because of the Yahweh behind the army. Yahweh turned David's men into "mighty men of valor" (see 1 Chron. 11:10).<br><br>Yahweh often uses failure to make us useful. When Yeshua called the disciples, He did not go out and find the most qualified and successful people. He found the most willing, and He found them in the marketplace. He found a fisherman, a tax collector, a farmer, and a doctor.<br><br>The Hebrews knew that failure was a part of maturing in Yahweh. The Greeks used failure as a reason for disqualification. Sadly, in the Church, we often treat one another in this way. This is not Yahweh's way. We need to understand that failing does not make us failures. It makes us experienced. It makes us more prepared to be useful in Yahweh's Kingdom-if we have learned from it. And that is the most important ingredient for what Yahweh wants in His children.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Gift Basket From Heaven<br>Hosea 2:19-20<br>I will betroth you to Me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion. I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the Lord.<br><br>My wife came to know Yeshua in the workplace when her boss led her in the sinner's prayer to receive Yeshua. She was 29 and had no idea who Yahweh was. She was a professional single woman who had always had a boyfriend. When Yeshua came into her life, He gradually began to change her life in very significant ways-especially in the area of relationships. As she began her first Bible study, she read in Matthew 7 that if she asked, she would receive (see Mt. 7:7). She prayed for a husband and the Lord spoke to her through His Word. The next verse in her study was "Be still, and know that I am Yahweh" (Ps. 46:10a).<br><br>Over time, the Lord began to show her that He wanted to become her Husband. After two and one-half years without a boyfriend, she asked the Lord to show her how to fall in love with Him. Days later, she received a phone call from someone asking her if she could go on a three-day retreat. She instantly knew Yahweh was answering her prayer. He showed her that she could have the same kind of intimacy with Him that she could have with a human husband. She thought this to be strange for the obvious reasons most would think it strange. However, Yahweh began to demonstrate to her a level of intimacy that she never thought possible.<br><br>It was Valentine's Day, and she would normally leave such occasions to the married couples to celebrate. However, on this occasion, her church was having a Valentine's Day dinner. She felt impressed to go as a single. Actually, she knew the Lord was her escort. Because she had made a decision not to date in order to develop her intimacy with the Lord, she no longer received perfume as gifts. Lord, I know You would not take me to a Valentine's Day banquet without giving me a gift, she thought to herself. That evening, there was a drawing, and Angie won a beautiful gift basket full of fragrances.<br>On another occasion, she went to a company banquet alone. She was considered by this time rather weird for her commitment not to date. She often joked, "If it weren't for back rubs, I would never have need of a man." (You have to know Angie to appreciate that statement.) That evening, she won a gift certificate for a massage. Her friends looked at her and said, "How do you do that?"<br><br>Intimacy with Yahweh is not a fairy tale Yahweh teases us with in the Bible. He really desires to have intimacy with you and me. Ask Yahweh to reveal Himself to you in personal and intimate ways. He desires to do this.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Coming Out of the Stronghold<br>1 Samuel 22:5<br>..."Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah"...<br><br>David and his fighting men had been hiding in the cave of Adullam. He was fleeing Saul. Many of life's down-and-out had come and joined David's army. David was content to stay in the stronghold of safety. Then, Yahweh's prophet came to David and told him that he must leave the stronghold and go into the land of Judah.<br><br>When life beats down on us and we get to the place where we want to hide in a cave, YAH often places people around us who prod us into moving in the right direction. He does not want us to remain in the place of discouragement. He wants us to move into the land of "praise." Judah means "praise."<br><br>I recall when I went through a very difficult time. It seemed to drag on and on with no change until finally I wanted to retreat to a cave and forget pressing on. It was a great time of discouragement. A godly man came to me and said, "You must keep moving! There are too many who are depending on you in the Kingdom." I didn't totally understand what he meant at the time. Now I know he was saying that Yahweh is preparing each of us to be the vessel He wants to use in the life of another person, but we will never be that vessel if we give up and hide in our cave of discouragement. Not only must we keep moving, we must move into a new realm. Our attitude must move from discouragement to praise. It is when we move past discouragement to praise that we begin living above our problems. Make a decision today to go into the land of Judah.<br><br></div>
