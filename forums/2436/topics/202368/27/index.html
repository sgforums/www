            <div class='col-md body'><br>Reclaiming our Relationship with G-d<br>by Rabbi Aaron Gross<br><br>With the closing of the book of Beraishis/Genesis, one might assume we bade a final farewell to the patriarchs and matriarchs. The setting changes with the beginning of the book of Shemos/ Exodus, which forms this week's Torah portion. We enter a new era with an entirely new cast. "And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation." (Exodus 1:6) The face of the nation begins to change, and the people eventually will bear little resemblance to their pious, G-d fearing forbearers. The trials and tribulations of the Egyptian bondage leave their mark as the saga of our enslavement and persecution unfolds in the coming chapters. The telling signs of our spiritual deterioration become painfully clear. Even as Moses carries the Divine assurance of ultimate redemption, the Children of Israel display disinterest in his message. "And they did not hearken unto Moses out of impatience and out of cruel bondage." (Exodus 6:9) Surely by the time the exodus becomes a reality, our illustrious past will be a distant memory.<br><br>However, Nachmanides (R' Moshe ben Nachman, 1194-1270, of Gerona, Spain, one of the leading Torah scholars of the Middle Ages; successfully defended Judaism at the dramatic debate in Barcelona in 1263) found a connection between the two books. The lives of the patriarchs and matriarchs act as the blueprints for what befalls their descendents. Genesis is the microcosmic form of what will transpire in macrocosmic proportions for the entire Jewish nation in Exodus. Each patriarch endured his own exile; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob met challenges presented by a variety of deterrents to their service to G-d.<br><br>The climax of Exodus, Nachmanides wrote, is the construction of the Mishkan (tabernacle). Even after the physical deliverance from Egypt, we were a nomadic slave people with no tangible vehicle for connecting with our Creator. Only after receiving the Torah at Sinai and assembling a sanctuary in which to capture the Sinaitic experience - a profound closeness with G-d - could we be considered a truly free people able to serve Him. At that time, the children of Israel returned to the spiritual stature of their ancestors in their relationship with the Almighty. Just as the patriarchs' and matriarchs' tents experienced the on going effects of being graced with His presence, so did the Jews achieve it on the national level upon building of the tabernacle.<br><br>The book of Exodus, then, is the story of our struggle to reclaim our relationship with our heavenly Father that we almost lost for eternity during our years in Egypt. Nachmanides' description of the events should inspire us in our attempts toward creating an environment within every Jewish home that enables the Divine Presence to dwell in our midst. However, in order to do this we must understand: if the Jewish people in Egypt were on the brink of spiritual disaster, by what virtue were we deserving of Divine intervention on our behalf? What initiatives had we taken in the context of our relationship with the Almighty?<br><br>The Medrashic texts Exodus Rabbah (1:33), Leviticus Rabbah (32:5) and Song of Songs Rabbah (4:24) say that the Children of Israel were redeemed in the merit of four observances: they did not change their Jewish names; they did not adopt the language of the land, but continued speaking Hebrew; they did not betray a fellow Jew to the Egyptians; and they were not immoral. At first glance, this Medrash merely lists the merits for which G-d saw fit to reward us with redemption. A deeper look yields a more meaningful insight.<br><br>These four merits are designed to preserve national identity. By not changing names or language, we distinguish ourselves from the host nation. The last two merits attempted to maintain our national unity. Through these devices, our people prevented widespread assimilation, thereby paving the way for liberation. As long as we remained separate, deliverance could occur. The lesson for today is clear. With intermarriage and assimilation rates spiraling upwards, our battle must be fought on two fronts.<br><br>Jewish education from the early years on must emphasize the ways in which we can tangibly distinguish ourselves as Jews. Only by transmitting an appreciation of our religion, embodied in the Torah, will we retain our young people. This must be complemented by maintaining lifestyles that are inherently Jewish. Finally, we must reconfirm Jewish unity if we are to remain worthy of the calling, "So says the Lord: My son, My first born is Israel. Let my son go that he may serve Me." (Exodus 4:22-23)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What's New?<br><br>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This week's parsha begins recounting the enslavement and exploitation of the Children of Yisrael. The political atmosphere changes from Egypt welcoming Yaakov and his family as dignitaries, to hatred and suspicion. The great commentaries remark that the Egyptian exile is a paradigm for our own exile from Israel which began with the destruction of the second Holy Temple in approximately 70 A.C.E. This means that the ideas in the parsha deserve careful study as they are pertinent to our own situations.<br><br>In Exodus (1:8 ) the Torah writes "And a new king arose over Egypt who did not know Yosef." It is automatically clear that there is more to the story than meets the eye. Who wouldn't have known Yosef? Without Yosef interpreting the dreams for Pharaoh and preparing for the 7 years of famine, there would be no Egypt left. In our times someone like Yosef would have sports arenas, libraries, avenues, and shopping centers named after him. Children in elementary schools would make plays about him, and we would all have a long weekend commemorating his birthday. That is to say the least. Rashi explains that "he (Pharaoh) made himself as if he didn't know Yosef." Incidentally, this illustrates the point which is brought out in Pirkei Avos (Chapters of the Fathers). The mishna (Chapter 2, mishna 3) states "Be careful with ruling authorities, for they only befriend people for their own needs. They appear as friends while they are benefiting, but they don't stand up for a person in his time of difficulty." Of course Pharaoh knew Yosef, but it was no longer in his best political interest to embrace Yosef or his family whose population had grown out of proportion with his own nation.<br><br>The wise king Solomon said (Ecclesiastes 1:9) "There is nothing new under the sun." The meaning is that in the category of things "under the sun," in the physical world, nothing is truly new. Everything is just a new configuration of something which has already been done. However, our sages say "under the sun nothing is new, but above the sun, beyond the limitations of the physical world, everything is new." In the morning liturgy (in the blessings preceding the Sh'ma) we refer to G-d as "The One Who renews the creation every day constantly." Behind the scenes is constant renewal. What's new? Everything! This is reality. Unfortunately, it is difficult to be in touch with that reality. It takes great faith to be aware of it, and courage to internalize and live by it. On the other hand, what is the alternative?<br><br>Madison Ave. tells us it has the answer. Commercials tell us this is new, and that. Everyone is running after what's new like big kids in a toy store. People put so much time and effort into acquiring and maintaining their toys. Never was a society so in debt for non-essential things. Are we any happier?<br><br>The Talmud tells us that the soul is a part of G-d which is placed into a physical existence. The analogy is of a princess who elopes with a common villager. Anything he brings her can never satisfy her, because she is used to living as a princess. When he offers her all the boiled potatoes she can eat, she begins to cry. So too, the soul is accustomed to closeness to G-d. When it comes to this world it craves things which it had been accustomed to before. We hear the voice, and we attempt to fulfill its wishes. We give it fun. Bun gee jumping! Amusement parks, concerts, movies, and chocolate! All the soul does is sigh. She's always left wanting. How can we satisfy her lofty desires?<br><br>In the words of the Sh'ma (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) which we recite twice a day, we find the answer. "And these words which I command you today should be on your heart." Rashi comments that we should view the commandments as something new which everyone runs to greet. The commandments of the Torah are spiritual lights clothed in physical clothing. They are the "food" of the soul. They are our way of maintaining our closeness to a spiritual G-d in this physical world.<br><br>People get excited about new kings and new things. The student of the Torah understands that there is really nothing new under the sun. However, the commandments are not from "under the sun." They are performed under the sun, but their source is from "the One Who renews the work of creation constantly, each day." They are the only source of satisfaction for the soul. They are the only things which calm the voice inside. May we all merit to taste the newness and fulfillment of the commandments of the Torah.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Growth Investment<br>Volume 6 Issue 14<br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>It was a test for the ages. The mighty Pharaoh commanded the midwives Shifra and Puah, known to us as Yocheved and her daughter Miriam, to kill all the boys born to Hebrew mothers. Not only did they ignore the edict, they countered it by nourishing the newborns with pacifying words and comforting amenities food and drink.. The Midrash tells us that they cared for the sick and unhealthy babies as well, nourishing them with prayers, and Hashem in heaven did not ignore their actions. But the verses need some explanation. First the Torah tells us, "And G-d rewarded the midwives, and the nation flourished and prospered." Only then does it add, "And it was as the midwives feared Hashem, and He made for them houses." Rashi explains that both midwives were rewarded for their efforts with more than physical houses. They were rewarded with houses of Kohanim and kings. Hashem rewarded them well with generations of kings and priests, Divine attributes that are perpetuated through the species of humans that the midwives actually saved male Jewish children! A kohain can only be the son of a Kohain, and a King can only be a male!<br><br>But there seems to be an interruption in the order of the verses. The words "and the nation flourishedÂ” seem out of context. In fact, Rashi is bothered by the obvious question and explains the verses as follows. "And G-d rewarded the midwives," and what was the reward? "He made for them houses." The words "and the nation flourished" are part of the narrative, an historical footnote inserted into the middle of the episode of heroism and reward. But the simple, juxtaposed text needs clarification. Perhaps there is a way to explain the historical insert<br><br>More than 10 years ago, my brother, Reb Zvi and his wife had a beautiful little baby boy. He was truly beautiful. And he was truly little. Five weeks premature and only two-and-a-half pounds.<br><br>For a while it was touch and go. The prayers of a community and thousands of friends and relatives pulsed the support systems that sustained the child's short breaths and the parents' deep hopes. For nearly two months the baby endured in the neo-natal unit under the care of the most prestigious doctors and devoted nurses that the city of Chicago had to offer. After two grueling months of prayers, incubators, and devoted healthcare, the baby arrived home healthy. The joy and gratitude to Hashem was overwhelming, but the young father did not forget his gratitude and appreciation to the mortal messengers, the entire medical and nursing staff, who worked arduously, day and night, to help insure the newborn's health.<br><br>He wanted to express his appreciation in a very special way. He searched gift shops and bookstores for a proper memento to show his appreciation, but he could not come up with an appropriate gift. A few days after the baby was brought home, the young father mentioned his dilemma to his Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Eliyahu Svei, Dean of the Philadelphia Yeshiva.<br><br>"The nurses don't want perfume, and the doctors don't need pens," said Rabbi Svei. Â“What they want to see is the continued growth and health of your child. Every year, on his birthday, bring the child to the hospital and let the staff share in the joy of his growth and success! That will be the most meaningful gift you can offer!"<br><br>The Rosh Yeshiva explained: Before the Torah mentions an additional reward bestowed upon the midwives, it alludes to the greater reward that they truly appreciated. Their efforts towards Jewish perpetuity were not in vain. The nation prospered. The young babies, whom they worked so diligently to sustain, grew up. And they married, and they flourished. All the midwives wanted was the propagation of their nation. And that was their first reward. The gift of Houses of the Priesthood and the Houses of Royalty were an added bonus which was Hashem was pleased to deliver. But as far as the midwives were concerned, the greatest reward was the joy in seeing that the children they delivered flourished, and that the nation prospered and grew. All the risks were worth it for that knowledge alone. And so the Torah tells us, "and Hashem made good for the midwives, and the nation grew and flourished." For them, that was the greatest reward. The rest was just icing on the just desserts.<br><br></div>

It is the by-product of what we desire from our work. Without productivity, we do not make sales, we do not deliver goods, we do not achieve our goals. There are things in our business lives that can creep in making us unproductive. The same is true in our walk with God.<br><br>The apostle Peter tells us that we can become knowledgeable of Jesus but fail to be effective and productive in our relationship with Him. We are a society that has great knowledge, but our comparable scale of productivity from that knowledge is extremely weighted to the knowledge side.

If our lives are not reflecting the same things as Jesus' did, we must ask why?<br><br>I have noticed three distinct types of businesspeople throughout my 24 years of walking with Christ. First, many of us come to Christ out of a need for salvation. Our hearts have been touched by His call on our lives. We reason and analyze the claims of Christ and make a decision for Him. It is the convenient time to accept Him in our lives. This first stage is often characterized by a "Bless me, Lord" attitude toward God. It is the first stage that primarily brings salvation into our lives. Some never really go past this first stage.<br><br>The second stage is the crisis stage. A crisis takes place in our lives, and we are motivated to seek Christ with a whole heart. However, this motivation is not out of pure love for Christ; rather, it is motivated by the desire to get out of the pain of living. The motivation is to solve the what versus the why in my life at the time. This stage is best characterized as "Help me, Lord."<br><br>In the third stage we begin to experience the gospel of the Kingdom. It is the place where Jesus resided in His walk with His heavenly Father. It is the place of conviction. The number of people who live at this level are quite few, but these people are experiencing the reality of a walk with God that is foreign to all others. They are seeing daily occurrences of His involvement in their lives. They are motivated by a deep love for Him. They know Him. These people have an attitude characterized by these thoughts, "Have me, Lord; though He slay me, still will I trust Him."<br><br>Where are you today? Have you merely accepted His salvation to simply float along? Or do you seek Him with a whole heart only when a crisis occurs? His desire is for you and me to live a life of conviction, motivated by our love for Him and His love for us. This is where we will experience the gospel of the Kingdom.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Frand<br><br><strong>When You Are Raised As A Prince, You Act Like A Prince </strong><br><br>Pharaoh's daughter rescued baby Moshe from the Nile River. She brought him home to the palace and raised him as an adopted son. On a superficial level, it is a great story. Pharaoh wants to get rid of all the Jewish baby boys, in order to preclude the possibility of a savior being born to them. He orders all Jewish baby boys thrown into the Nile. In the irony of ironies, Pharaoh's own daughter saves the future savior of Israel from the Nile and brings him into Pharaoh's own palace to raise and nurture him.<br><br>Of course, there is more to the sequence of events than just the fact that it "makes a great story." There is a fascinating Ibn Ezra that explains the motivation of hashgacha [Divine Providence] in causing events to turn out this way. The Ibn Ezra speculates that the reason the hashgacha brought Moshe to the palace was to create a future leader of Israel who would be raised in an atmosphere of royalty and power, rather than in an environment of slavery and submission.<br><br>In the great controversy of nature versus nurture, the Ibn Ezra lends weight to the point of view that gives great import to nurture in determining what a person eventually becomes. If Moshe Rabbeinu had been raised as a slave, thinking like a slave and acting submissively like a slave, it would have been much more difficult for him to become the leader of two million people.<br><br>The Ibn Ezra cites the fact that Moshe killed the Egyptian for an act of injustice that the latter perpetrated. A slave, who is always downtrodden and spat upon, would not have the forcefulness and the gumption to protest injustice and to personally punish the perpetrator. There is no way we could imagine someone with a slave's mentality doing such a thing. On the other hand, someone brought up in the house of the king, believing he is a prince, automatically possesses a certain aura and confidence that allows him to intervene in situations that people with less self-esteem would certainly avoid.<br><br>The Ibn Ezra similarly notes Moshe's intervention on behalf of Yisro's daughters during the incident with the Shepherds at the well of Midyan. Moshe was a stranger who had just arrived in town. Who asked him to intervene? Who asked him to get involved? The answer is that someone who grew up in a house of authority and leadership has the courage and the assertiveness to take charge and administer justice wherever justice needs to be administered. These leadership abilities were much more easily nurtured in the palace of the king than in a house of slaves.<br><br>The Mir Masgiach, Rav Yeruchem Levovitz, comments on this Ibn Ezra that we learn from here the power of nurture. Two genetically identical twins will grow up to be very different individuals if they are exposed to different educations and different atmospheres in their formative years. This underlies the power of chinuch [education], the power of environment, and the power of a nurturing home.<br><br>We look around today and unfortunately see the many ills that plague our society. What is happening to society? Why is this happening? Part of the answer is that there is no real home life for a large number of children growing up in our society. It is not the least bit surprising and it does not require a great social scientist to see the cause and effect relationship between how one is raised and how one turns out.<br><br>The reverse is true as well. When one takes an individual and showers him with love and with confidence, giving him a sense of self and a sense of presence, chances are high that the individual will grow up to demonstrate far greater leadership capabilities than an equally talented individual who was not given the benefit of such an enlightened upbringing.<br><br>The ironic sequence of events at the beginning of Sefer Shmos provided the leadership training necessary for the savior who would eventually take Israel out of Egypt.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Frand<br><br><strong>And Yet, One Need Not Be a Prince to Rise to Greatness </strong><br><br>The marriage of Amram and Yocheved is described with the enigmatic words "And a man from the House of Levi went and he married the daughter of Levi" [Shmos 2:1]. It would seem appropriate as the Torah introduces this very important milestone in the Biblical narrative -- the birth of Moshe Rabbeinu -- that the Torah would at least mention the names of Moshe's parents. Shouldn't we be told explicitly of Moshe's proud "yichus" [ancestry]?<br><br>Rav Bergman comments in the Shaarei Orah that this is precisely the point. A person does not need yichus to become Moshe Rabbeinu. Anyone is capable of reaching spiritual heights based on his own merits and his own capabilities. A person does not need to have a distinguished father to lead a distinguished life. It is true that Moshe's father happened to be the Gadol HaDor [greatest man of his generation], but the Torah de-emphasizes that point. Moshe's parents are left anonymous to stress that lineage is not what made Moshe who he was.<br><br>The idea is that every child and every human being is capable of reaching great heights despite a humble lineage. The Rambam writes this in Hilchos Teshuvah [5:2]: "Any individual can grow up to be as righteous as Moshe Rabbeinu."<br><br>In this week's parsha, Rav Yaakov Kamenetzky comments that the Ramo"h rules in Shulchan Aruch that it is preferable, if a mother is incapable of nursing her baby, to have another Jewish woman nurse the child. A non-Jewish woman may only serve in this capacity if there is no alternative. The reason for this is because the non-Jewish nurse eats foods that are not kosher, and the milk then is a byproduct of such foods. This law is derived from the fact that Moshe refused to nurse from the non-Jewish women in Pharaoh's palace. The reason, our Sages tell us, that he refused to nurse from foreign women is that "the mouth that would eventually directly speak to the Almighty should not begin life by sucking non-Kosher matter."<br><br>The Ramo"h rules in Shulchan Aruch, based on this incident in Chumash and the reasoning of "the mouth that is destined to speak with the Divine Presence," that if at all possible a Jewish baby should not be given to a non-Jewish wet nurse. We might ask when the last time was that a Jewish baby was born who grew up to engage in personal conversation with the Divine Presence. It is certainly not an everyday occurrence. It has not happened since the days of the Malachi, the last of the prophets.<br><br>Rav Yaakov Kamenetzky says that we learn from here that every Jewish child has to be looked at as a child that may potentially speak with the Divine Presence. Great lineage is not necessary to achieve great potential. "An anonymous man from the Tribe of Levi went and married an anonymous daughter of Levi." As the Rambam writes, anyone is capable of reaching such a level.<br><br>Some might think that the two thoughts presented herein are contradictory. Upon reflection, one should realize that this is not necessarily the case. "These and these are the words of the Living G-d." [Eruvin 13b]<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Deep Conversations<br>By Rabbi Aron Tendler<br><br>After 80 years of preparation Moshe was ready to become the Redeemer. Twenty years in the palace of Pharaoh, forty years wandering the kingdoms of Northern Africa as stranger and king, and twenty years being challenged and schooled by Yisro's intellect and courage.<br><br>Finally, the fateful day of the Burning Bush arrived. Moshe was summoned by the voice of G-d to remove his sandals and accept his appointment with destiny. Had Moshe simply said "Yes", history would have been different; then again, as the Kutzka said on next week's Parsha, Moshe was Moshe because he struggled with G-d's expectations. He became Moshe Rabbeinu because he asked the questions; however, we see from the verses that Moshe's seven-day conversation with G-d was far from simple.<br><br>Moshe challenged G-d four times before accepting the job of going to Pharaoh and demanding the release of the Jews from bondage.<br><br>G-d first introduced Himself to Moshe as the G-d of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yakov and then launched into His sales pitch. "I have seen the affliction? I have heard the cries? I know their suffering? Therefore, I am sending you to Pharaoh? Take My nation out of Egypt."<br><br>Moshe's first response was two-fold (See Rashi 3:11) 1. Why me? I am the worst person for the job. There has to be someone else. 2. Why do You wish to take the Jews out of Egypt? Why are they deserving of being redeemed?<br><br>continued...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Whether or not Moshe had the right to ask the questions is secondary. The fact is that they were intelligent questions. First of all, Moshe truly believed that he was the wrong man for the job. Secondly, he wanted to understand what merits they had toward redemption. After being away for sixty years Moshe concluded that there had been a purpose for the slavery and that the redemption would not occur until that purpose had been accomplished.<br><br>During Moshe's first twenty years in Pharaoh's palace the assumed plan was that Moshe would inherit the throne of Egypt and free the Jews to return to the Promised Land. It would represent the full circle of time and events starting with Yoseph's enslavement, rise to power, bringing the family down to Egypt, and ending with a Jew becoming king, freeing the slaves, and escorting them back to the land of Canaan. In the intervening years the Jews would have grown to national proportions as well as developing a shared history with the Egyptians.<br><br>The relationship with Egypt would have been practical as well as symbolic. Practically speaking it would constitute the relationship between the spiritual leaders of the world and the material leaders of the world. With Moshe at the helm, Egypt would be the powerful right hand of the Jewish People as they assumed their rightful place among the other nations. Who would dare stand in the way of Egypt who had dominated the world for centuries with their military might and culture? The battle with Eisav was yet to happen and Egypt was our best bet for confronting and besting Uncle Eisav.<br><br>This same scenario played itself out centuries later after the story of Purim. Persia and Media were the dominant cultures of the time and under the kingship of Cyrus, reputed son of Achashveirosh and Esther, the Jews were granted permission to return to their land and build the second Bais Hamikdash.<br><br>Symbolically speaking, the partnership of Egypt with the Jewish people would be the fulfillment of Noach's curse to Cham, "A slave's slaves he will be to his brothers." How much more exact could the prophecy be? Mitzrayim (Egypt) the second son of Cham would become a slave to Moshe and the Jews who had been their former slaves. The slavery would not be one of persecution and affliction. It would be a slavery of service. They would serve the Jewish nation and help them serve G-d.<br><br>Had the plan worked, Moshe would not have had any questions. The Jews, who appeared to be blameless for their enslavement, had been sent to Egypt to grow into a nation. So long as the situation appeared livable the plan made good sense. However, as soon as it took a turn from enslavement to affliction, G-d acted to save the day.<br><br>We are told that Miriam's name was derived from the root of the word "Marror ? bitter." It was at the time of her birth that Pharaoh channged his approach from enslavement to affliction. Six years later Moshe was born and the plan for redemption was put into effect.<br><br>However, at the age of twenty, when Moshe emerged from the cocoon of Pharaoh's palace in search of "his brothers", (2:11) his expectations were to see the blameless innocence of his people. He could then begin to reassure them and himself that redemption was at hand. His hope was to slowly make changes that would still protect his identity while lessening the burdens of the afflictions.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Medresh relates that Moshe had risen in Pharaoh's esteem and within the administration of Egypt to become head of the slave force. In that capacity he was able to institute two important measures. 1. Under the penalty of death no Egyptian was allowed to consort with a Jewish slave. 2. In order to maintain the strength of the work force Shabbos became a day off. Moshe knew that with patience and time the plan could work and the Jews would soon see a change of fortune.<br><br>Instead, the incident with the Egyptian hitting the Jew occurred. That was followed the next day by the two fighting Jews (Dattan and Avirum), one of whom was the very slave he had saved, turning him into the authorities for killing the Egyptian overseer.<br><br>Moshe was stunned and disillusioned. Rashi (2:14) quotes the Medresh that states, "I fear that the Jews will not be redeemed because there are informers among them? Now I understand why they are being punished and enslaved."<br><br>Moshe's analysis of the judiciousness of the Jewish condition led him to the ever-present reason for destruction and exile. It was good old fashion Sinas Chinum ? unwarranted hatred. Just as Sinas Chimum would destroy the second Bais Hamikdash and exile the Jews from the land so too the first exile into Egypt was because of Sinas Chinum. It was Yoseph who first went out to "seek his brothers" (Ber. 37:16) and was sold into slavery because of Sinas Chinum? Clearly the Jews had not yet worked through their issues and they were not yet worthy of redemption!<br><br>continued..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moshe fled for his life and began the sixty-year odyssey that would bring him barefoot to the edge of a non-burning bush. It is interesting to note that after marrying into the family of Yisro, the Torah related the death of Pharaoh. Can you imagine Moshe's disappointment? Had the first plan only worked out as imagined he would have then been assuming the throne of Egypt. Redemption would have been only moments away! Instead the nation was buried beneath the awesome affliction of their slavery and Moshe was tending sheep in Midian!<br><br>Standing before G-d at the Burning Bush, Moshe had questions. He was still among the Top Ten Most Wanted in Egypt, and he did not know why the Jews deserved to be Redeemed.<br><br>G-d answered both of Moshe's questions. "First of all, the fact that you are the least likely candidate for the job is exactly why you are the best man for the job. If you had been a well liked, beloved and trusted member of the Jewish People who had suffered with them and been there to comfort their pain and strengthen their resolve, some might say that the redemption happened through normal and natural means. However, as the very worse person for the job everyone will have to acknowledge that the redemption was an overt act of G-d.<br><br>Secondly, regardless of why you think they are undeserving of redemption, the fact remains that you do not know the bigger picture. Justice is Mine not yours. Know your place and accept that they deserve to be redeemed. They are the children of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yakov and I promised them that I would take their children out of bondage, bring them to the foot of this very mountain, give them My Torah, and return them to the Promised Land!"<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moshe's second argument presented a totally different approach. Moshe accepted the fact that he did not know the ways of G-d's justice or why they were deserving of redemption. However, he knew that redemption assumed a nation desiring to be redeemed for the right reasons. It was not enough to not want to be enslaved and afflicted. The Jews were living in the greatest society and culture of the time. They still remembered the glory of Yoseph and the early years of their migration into Egypt. Most of them saw themselves as potential citizens of Egypt with all the rights of citizenship. As soon as they would be free they would melt into the cauldron of Egypt and be lost in the *darkness* forever. Redemption demanded a nation that beseeched freedom from Pharaoh while at the same time craving servitude to G-d. "They are My slaves. They are not to be slaves to slaves!"<br><br>Therefore, Moshe asked G-d, "But the Jews will not even know Who You are, let alone be prepared to commit their lives to Your service!?"<br><br>G-d answered Moshe, You are 100% right. Therefore tell them Who I am. First of all tell them that I already have a long-standing relationship with them, regardless of whether or not they have been aware of it. Let them know that I have been caring for them and I have never forgotten them. I realize that there has to be something tangible for them to build their trust in me. Let them know that I am the G-d of their forefathers. Use the secret password "Pakod Pakaditi ? I have surely remembered you." Recreate for them the vision of their Promised Land flowing with milk and honey. They will listen to you and they will believe that the time of redemption is at hand. You will see that they will desire to be My People as much as they desire an end to their slavery and affliction. More so than that, let them know that besides leaving slavery behind and going to a much better place, they will also take the great wealth of Egypt with them. It will be the very wealth that was a by product of Yoseph's brilliant administration and the years of slave labor they had to endure. Let then know that there will be reparations and restitution!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moshe's next argument took a third approach. I believe You that they are capable of listening and believing; however, they will not listen to me. I am the wrong person to engender in them a sense of trust. They might believe someone else who they think deserving of divine revelation. But not me! They will tell me that I am making it all up. They will accuse me of fanciful tales in the hope of regaining a place for myself after fleeing form Egypt in disgrace.<br><br>G-d answered Moshe, you are right, therefore I will give you a "bag of tricks" to prove your divine appointment to the office of Redeemer.

            <div class='col-md body'>Moshe's fourth argument refocused his concerns on himself and not the nation. "G-d, I accept that they will believe that You sent me on this mission. I also believe You that I seem to be the best person specifically because I am the wrong person. However, I have to also believe in myself, and I do not. I have a speech impediment and I avoid public speaking. Besides, it would not be appropriate for someone with my disability to represent You, the Creator of Heaven and Earth!"<br><br>G-d answered Moshe using Moshe's own argument. "Moshe you are again 100% right. However, if you believe that I am the Creator of Heaven and earth, don't you think that I can correct your speech impediment! Enough discussion, go and do your job and know that I am with you!"<br><br>Moshe's final argument evoked G-d's anger and brought the discussion full circle back to the beginning. "G-d, I of course believe that you can make me not have a speech impediment; however, the truth is that I am still the wrong person for the job. There is a better person. That person is my brother Aharon. Besides his unfailingly love and trust in You, he has been with the people throughout their suffering. Whatever he says they will believe. Not only that, but I fear that my selection over my brother Aaron will evoke jealousy in Aharon and anger among the people. The very anger and jealousy which brought us into slavery and kept us in slavery will refocus itself on me. Of what value can that be? Send the redemption through whomever else You will send!"<br><br>G-d answered Moshe in anger and said, Stop trying to second-guess Me. Who said that I was going to ignore Aharon. Of course he will be involved. He will be your spokesperson and you will benefit from his popularity and acceptance by the people. More so than that, not only won't there be jealousy, just the opposite! Aharon is already on his way and his heart is filled with joy and wonder! The redemption is happening and his younger brother is the Redeemer! You fear that Sinas Chinum is the root cause of the exile. You are absolutely right; however, wittiness the greatness of the man who will one day represent My children at the gravest of times. Jealousy has no place in the heart of your brother; it is too filled with joy!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thin Air-ogance<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>You can climb too high for your own good. The story of David and Bathsheba is less a story of lust and more a story of power. A story of a man who rose too high for his won good. A man who needed to hear these words: Â“Come down before you fall.Â”<br><br>Â“First pride, then the crash- the bigger the ego, the harder the fall.Â” (Proverbs 16:18 MSG)<br><br>This must be why God hates arrogance. He hates to see his children fall. He hates to see his Davids suduce and his Bathshebas be victimized. God hates what pride does to his children. He doesnÂ’t dislike arrogance. He hates it. Could he state it any clearer than Proverbs 8:13: Â“I hate pride and arrogance.Â” (NIV)? And then a few chapters later: Â“God canÂ’t stomach arrogance or pretense; believe me, heÂ’ll put those upstarts in their placeÂ” (16:5 MSG).<br><br>You donÂ’t want God to do that. Just ask David. He never quite recovered from his bout with this giant. DonÂ’t make his mistake. Â‘Tis far wiser to descend the mountain than fall from it.<br><br>Pursue humility. Humility doesnÂ’t mean you think less of yourself but that you think of yourself less. Â“DonÂ’t cherish exaggerated ideas of yourself or your importance, but try to have a sane estimate of your capabilities by the light of the faith that God has given to youÂ” (Romans 12:3 Phillips).<br><br>Embrace your poverty. WeÂ’re all equally broke and blessed. Â“People come into this world with nothing, and when they die they leave with nothingÂ” (Eccles. 5:15 NCV)<br><br>Resist the place of celebrity. Â“Go sit in a seat that is not important. When the host comes to you, he may say, Â‘Friend, move up here to a more important place.Â’ Then all the othere guests will respect youÂ” (Luke 14:10 NCV).<br><br>WouldnÂ’t you rather be invited up than put down?<br><br>God has a cure for the high and mighty: come down from the mountain.

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Eliyahu Hoffmann<br>Who Are You Fooling<br><br>This week's sidrah, Shemos, begins with a review of the end of sefer Bereishis (Genesis).<br><br>"And these are the names of the Children of Israel who were coming to Egypt with Yaakov, each man and his household came: Reuven, Shimon, Levi and Yehudah... [In total] seventy souls, and Yosef was in Egypt. (1:1-5)"<br><br>Rashi is bothered by the obvious redundancy: Was Yosef in Egypt more so than any of the other brothers? And didn't we already know that Yosef was in Mitzrayim (Egypt) - he was, after all, a major focus of the last part of sefer Bereishis?<br><br>Rashi explains that the intention of the verse is not simply to make us aware of Yosef's whereabouts. That we knew. Rather, it comes to teach us about Yosef's attitude: Yosef did not change despite his position.<br><br>"He was the same Yosef who shepherded his father's sheep in Canaan - and he was the same Yosef who was viceroy in Mitzrayim; he remained righteous."<br><br>What may at times to the casual eye appear to be simple, is in fact not simple at all. Was Yosef in Mitzrayim; or was Mitzrayim in Yosef?<br><br>Yosef lead a dual life. To the Egyptians he was a viceroy, second only to Pharaoh. He was dressed in royal garments of fine linen, and had a gold chain placed upon his neck. He rode in the second royal chariot, and undoubtedly played the part of one vested with the power of monarchy. To his brothers, Yosef seemed to be an older but largely unchanged version of the same brother they had always known. Where did Yosef's heart - his priorities - truly lie? Was he "Tzafnas Pa'aneach" (his Egyptian name), Egyptian viceroy, playing the role of Yosef, son of Yaakov? Or was he one of the Twelve Tribes of Yaakov, who had inadvertently been raised to the position of viceroy.<br><br>Rashi explains that the latter was true. Yosef remained Yosef. The riches, the monarchy, the power, did not change him at all. He remained true to his heritage and his upbringing.<br><br>The story is told of a successful young shopkeeper in pre-war Europe who used to daven (pray) in a chassidishe shtiebel (shul), and who owned two sets of clothing. Every morning, when he got dressed to go to his pre-davening shiur, he would don his chassidishe garb. After praying, he would return home and change into his "work attire," clothing which in his mind made him seem more acceptable to those with whom he did business. In the evening, when he returned home from work, he would again change back into his "davening clothes," and make his way to the shtiebel for Mincha and Ma'ariv (afternoon and evening prayers).<br><br>One day, as he stood in his store absent-mindedly making sure his beard was rolled up neatly, it hit him that he was living a sham: To the street, he was a successful and worldly businessman. Yet before setting foot in shtiebel, he meticulously made sure that he was no different than his friends. Occasionally, in his rush to catch prayers on time, we would momentarily set out to shul in his street clothing, only to catch himself and quickly go back home to change into his shtiebel-attire, sometimes missing Mincha in the process. When this would happen, he would thank Hashem for saving him from embarrassment.<br><br>"What a fraud I am!" he thought to himself. "It's about time I stop fooling all of my friends, and let them see 'the real me.'" He made up his mind that he would show up that day to Mincha without changing his clothing.<br><br>As expected, the moment he entered the shtiebel with his short jacket and beard rolled up neatly, heads turned. One of the elderly members even approached him and asked him what was wrong.<br><br>"Nothing," he said. "It's just that I've been fooling you all these years. I have always dressed this way in my store. I decided that the time has come for you all to see 'the real me.'"<br><br>"But you don't understand," said the elderly chassid. "We always knew that you dressed differently 'out there.' Yet all along, we thought it was 'them' you were fooling. Now we know that the whole time, you were really fooling us!"<br><br>At some level, all of us lead "dual-lives." We are one way in shul; and another way at home. At work, we portray a certain image; among friends, a different us becomes apparent. The question we must ask ourselves is: Who are we fooling?<br><br>There are times we may feel we are suffering from a case of "multiple personality syndrome." We are so many things to so many people, that it is all too easy to lose sight of the "real us." When asked where our true priorities lie, the answer at first appears to be simple. Sometimes, however, when we gaze within ourselves a little deeper, we are shocked to find that the real us proves to be more elusive to find than we had at first expected.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WhatÂ’s Possible- In a Name!<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>And these are the names of the Children of Israel who came to Egypt; Yaakov and his household, Reuven, Shimon, Levi, and Yehudaa, Yisachar, Zevulen, Binyamin, Dan, Noftali, Gad, and AsherÂ…(Shemos 1:1-4)<br><br>The name of the weekÂ’s portion and the name of the entire book- Â“ShemosÂ” means- Â“NamesÂ” and not Â“ExodusÂ”. Why are the people listed as names? WhatÂ’s in a name?<br><br>We find that whatever name Adam gave to the various creatures of the world Â“that was its nameÂ”. (Breishis 2:19) It sounds like whatever name he gave it stuck, like a little kid that names his doggy woofy. Rashi points out that when Adam called his wife Isha (woman) because she was taken from and Ish (man), based on the play of words that we see from here that the world was created with the Holy Language of Hebrew. (Breishis 2:23) What does that mean?<br><br>The three sons of Noah from whom the world was reestablished each had a name indicative of their character that played out dramatically in their lives.1) Cham- means-Heat and with the heat and passion of the moment he abused his own father. 2) Yafes Â– is Beauty and so for appearance sake he joined forces to cover his fatherÂ’s indignity but still his concern was more for manners than morals. 3) ShemÂ’s name means name. He did what was essential. He covered his father in the most appropriate way. How is that implied in the name Â“NameÂ”?<br><br>When we buy a new car or computer or whatever of moderate sophistication then there is usually a userÂ’s guide that accompanies it. The thicker the booklet the more complex the machinery is. In that manual you find optimal usages for each of the buttons and levers in the gadget. Rarely would you find a vestigial organ- a part that does not serve some function. The designer gives each piece a name that tells us something about its function. The implication of a name is that it points to the designerÂ’s intent.<br><br>In any other language, names are arbitrary. CAT tells us how to pronounce the word and does little else than remind us of the creature that has whiskers and loves to chase mice. Nothing in the letters is intrinsically connected to the idea it spells. The eastern languages are pictographic. We see in a word a picture of a flower or a friend, and only the pronunciation is absent from the image. In the Holy Language we have both. A Lamed looks like the silhouette of a person sitting. Its name implies learning. Its grammatical use connotes Â“toÂ” Â“directionÂ”. It is composed of a Â“cofÂ” + Â“vuvÂ” (=26)-with learning we grasp higher connections.<br><br>The letters of the Holy Language function conceptually like elements in the periodic table. In Sefer Yetzirah, reputed to have been written by Avraham, it is written, Â“Twenty two Foundation letters: He engraved them, he carved them, He permuted them, He weighed them, and with them He depicted all that was formed and all that would be formed.Â”<br><br>Why is the 2nd book not called Exodus? If the real subject was exodus then it should have ended by the splitting of the sea. Yet it continues past the giving of the Torah and on to the construction of the Tabernacle. The Ramban answers The Book of Breishis tells of the formation of the seed, the possibility of what would later be the Nation of Israel. The Book of Shemos focuses on the plantation and development of that potential into a nation worthy of constant Divine Presence, just like the individual Patriarchs and Matriarchs. When is a seed considered to have fulfilled its mission? When it produces an entire tree filled with seed bearing fruits. Who was it that came down to enter the soil of Egypt? It was the essence, the purpose, and the potential of whatÂ’s possible- In a name!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Special thanks to Rabbi Moshe Katz and Rabbi Doni Deutsch of the Chicago Torah Network for their contribution of this week's dvartorah.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>TORAH PORTION: SH'MOS (EXODUS 1:1 - 6:1)<br><br>1. AND MOSHE WENT OUT TO THE DESERT Â… AND G-D APPEARED TO HIM. G-D SAID: " - THE PLACE UPON WHICH YOU ARE STANDING IS HOLY - NOW, GO TO PHARAOH, AND TAKE THE JEWS OUT OF EGYPT." (3:1-10)<br><br>The place where Moses stood was holy.<br><br>Why?<br><br>What happened there that was special?<br><br>The answer is - nothing.<br><br>Except that it was there that he is presented with his mission.<br><br>And his challenge<br><br>... And that makes it holy.<br><br>It's a very Jewish lesson - one that's important for all of us.<br><br>Because life puts us in many different situations.<br><br>At work. At home. With family. Friends.<br><br>Or just by ourselves.<br><br>And in a way, they all have a holiness.<br><br>Because each situation, no matter how small, presents us with a challenge.<br><br>How can I make the most of this moment?<br><br>As a human being.<br><br>And as a Jew.<br><br>Rise to the challenge Â– and we've captured the holiness of the moment.<br><br>2. RABBI MOSHE FEINSTEIN.<br><br>Recognized as the world's greatest authority on Halacha. Torah Law.<br><br>He was an unbelievably busy man. Who never wasted a minute.<br><br>He was almost always studying or teaching Torah. He would interrupt, only to respond to the thousands of questions on Jewish Law, from around the world. And to people who needed his advice. Or his help.<br><br>And as soon as he put down the phone he went right back to his Torah study.<br><br>... Rabbi Feinstein was once out of town. And was staying in the home of a local Jewish family.<br><br>His days were spent in meetings with members of the community.<br><br>And with more Torah study.<br><br>His hosts had a cute five year-old daughter. She came over to the elderly Rabbi as he sat over his books.<br><br>"Hi. My name is Sara. What's yours?"<br><br>"Moshe", he said with a smile.<br><br>"I'm five years old. How old are you?"<br><br>At this point, the girl's mother came running over.<br><br>"Sara. Rabbi Feinstein is really very busy. Maybe we should let him get back to his work?"<br><br>Rabbi Feinstein turned to the mother.<br><br>"Mrs. Levy. Right now, the most important thing in the world for me to do, is to answer your daughter's questions."<br><br>Good Shabbos.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No Old Friends<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>And a new king arose on Egypt that did not know Joseph. (Shemos 1:8 )<br><br>And a new king arose: Rav and Shmuel argue. One says he was actually a new king while the other says he created new decrees. (Rashi)<br><br>Â…that did not know Joseph: He made himself as if he didnÂ’t know! (Rashi)<br><br>Â“The person that denies the kindliness of his friend will tomorrow deny the kindliness of his Maker. So it says by Pharaoh, Â“that did not know JosephÂ”Â…in the end he denied the beneficence of the Holy One Blessed be He, as it says, Â“And Pharaoh said, Â‘Who is HASHEM that I should listen to His voice?Â’Â” (Mishnas Rebbe Eliezer)<br><br>Why and how does it work that way?<br><br>In the Siddur HaGra, the Siach Yitzchok asks, why after declaring HASHEM Echod, G-dÂ’s Absolute Unity, in the daily Shema, does the verse then demand, Â“And you should love HASHEM your G-d with all your heart and with all of your soul and with all of your mightÂ…Â” How can the Torah legislate about love? From where does all this fountain of love suddenly spring by simply stating - Â“HASHEM is OneÂ”?<br><br>We tend to have affection for those who constitute the constellation of our support system. Our love is distributed to all these facilitators of our good. However when we close our eyes and contemplate the notion that all these agencies of our happiness are actually emanating from one sublime source, those feelings are then focused into a rich concentration of love. Then the expression follows more naturally, Â“And you should love HASHEM your G-dÂ…Â”<br><br>If one recognizes the good done to him by his friend, he can more easily register thanks to HASHEM. This may help explain why the 5th Commandment of honoring parents is on the side of the tablets designated for Mitzvos between man and G-d.<br><br>I once heard from Rabbi Avigdor Miller ztl. that if one bentches (says the after blessing for food) and yet fails to express thanks to the chef, waiter, mom, wife, who sweated to meet his needs, then his bentching is, considered according to Â“mussarÂ” standards worthless. Why? Since we tend to experience life in concrete terms, it is not likely that we can bypass the local tangible actors that serve our immediate needs and then sincerely leap to the loftiest level of abstract thought. The blessing is presumed to be lacking authentic gratitude.<br><br>There was a fellow who stepping out onto the golf course removed a brand new Top-Flight ball from a cellophane wrapper and proceeded to hook it deep into the woods. He moved ahead, took out another new ball and sliced it Â“Kerr-plunkÂ” into the middle of a pond. A third time he unwrapped a brand new golf ball, and in typical fashion whacks it onto a highway where a passing hay truck carries it to destinations unknown. About to take out a fourth new ball in as many swings, the caddie diplomatically interjects, Â“Why donÂ’t you use an old ball?Â” He wryly replies, Â“I donÂ’t have any old balls!Â”<br><br>Joseph had had not only saved Egypt from famine but he collected the wealth of the world and consolidated PharaohÂ’s empire. Yet Pharaoh revised the historical record to purge away any appreciation for what Joseph had done. Having burned his bridges with the past, Pharaoh now needed to invent a new paradigm of reality. Blind to contributions from the more recent past, he is surely in denial of the most Â“Ancient OneÂ” from the deepest past. Such a person has to keep changing the rules, searching desperately for new solutions and allies because he has left himself in the end with no old friends.<br><br></div>
