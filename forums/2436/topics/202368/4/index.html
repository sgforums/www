            <div class='col-md body'>Psalm 110:1<br>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.<br><br>Ben was a diligent worker in his firm. He put forth his best effort in all he did, but unfortunately he lacked the assertive personality so many of his co-workers possessed. Promotions came and went, always passing Ben by, falling to the men and women whose personalities caused them to be noticed. After thirty years of service, Ben struck out on his own, forming a new company. Within months the new company rose to the top of the field, and many of Ben's former co-workers came to work for him.<br>It is easy to begrudge others their fortune when they are no more deserving to them than we are. Yet, God calls us to rejoice in the triumphs of others, and to await His justice rather than seeking our own. Often we must wait a long time, but the justice of the Lord will prevail, and those who once kept us down will be made a footstool for our feet. Have faith in the Lord, and He will set all things right.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Fill me with Your patience, Lord. When I see others receive rewards, help me to rejoice in their benefit rather than be bitter that I did not receive it. Amen.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Treasure that Turns Other Treasures to Garbage</strong><br>John Piper<br><br>But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Yeshua. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Yeshua my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Yeshua and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Yeshua, the righteousness from Yahweh that depends on faith.<br><br>Paul has a way of playing your game, winning, and then saying the game is bunk. He does it, for example, in 2 Corinthians 11:21-12:11 where he lists his "superior" achievements and then says, "I have been a fool! You forced me to it" (2 Corinthians 12:11). In other words, I can play your game of measuring myself by your standards, win, and then call it all worthless. It is fool's play.<br><br>He does it again here in Philippians 3. He warns the church to watch out for the evildoing dogs who mutilate the flesh (people who insist on circumcision as a way of getting right with Yahweh). The problem with these people is that they "put confidence in the flesh"-that is, they bank on their works for justification (vv. 2-3, cf. v. 9).<br><br>So Paul says, OK let's play that game for a moment. And then he lists his works of the flesh and knocks his opponents out of the ring with legal achievements. "If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more." Indeed he does.<br><br>Then come three of the best verses in all the Bible. In essence: the victory I just won in the contest of the flesh is a pile of garbage (the Greek is sku,bala, v. 8 ). And the reason he uses such a strong word (refuse!) is that the alternative is Yeshua. Compared to Yeshua being the greatest Pharisee of his time was foul garbage.<br><br>But that is too vague. He is not vague. He does not say simply that compared to Yeshua legal achievements are garbage; he is more specific. He says that what is superior to moral and religious achievements is 1) knowing Yeshua, 2) gaining Yeshua, and 3) being found in Yeshua.<br><br>1. Knowing Yeshua. "Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Yeshua my Lord" (v. 8 ). "Knowing" here is not just knowing the fact that Yeshua is Lord. It is the kind of knowing that prompts the phrase, "my Lord"! He knows the supreme Lord of the universe (see 2:9-11) as his Lord. So there are two aspects to Paul's passion for Yeshua here. One is the rational and relational knowledge of the greatest person in the universe. Paul's mind and heart are full of Yeshua. The other is that he belongs to Yeshua as subject to the all-ruling, all-protecting Lord. This is better than being at the top of any human heap.<br><br>2. Gaining Yeshua. "For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Yeshua" (v. 8 ). "Gain" means get all that Yeshua is for us in heaven, not just on earth. Paul has already said, "To live is Yeshua and to die is gain" (v. 21), because "to depart and be with Yeshua, for that is far better" (1:23). And he is about to say, "I press on to make it my own, because Yeshua has made me his own" (3:12). So it is clear that part of what makes human achievement a pile of garbage compared to Yeshua is that soon (and very soon!) he is going to meet the king-in a way far more full and intimate and stunning and satisfying than anything he has known here. And he has known so much of Yeshua here that the garbage verdict has been rendered on that alone.<br><br>3. Being found in Yeshua. ". . . and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Yeshua, the righteousness from God that depends on faith" (v. 9). Paul was overwhelmed by the fact that "in Yeshua"-that is, united to Yeshua by faith alone-he possessed a righteousness that was infinitely better than all his legal achievements could ever be. Paul knew he needed a righteous life in order to be accepted by Yahweh and in order to enjoy all the glories of Yeshua forever. He did not have such a righteousness in himself. He needed the free gift of righteousness from Yahweh himself. Yahweh gave it to him in Yeshua.<br><br>Therefore Yeshua was both the treasure he cherished and the one who provided the right to have the treasure. In Yeshua alone Paul had a right to know and gain Yeshua. And that is all he wanted. That is the gospel. This is what we mean by treasuring Yeshua together. Yeshua alone is the ground of our acceptance with God and the goal of our heart's desire. He is our righteousness and our reward. Compared to him (knowing him, gaining him, being found in him) all else is garbage.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God Relates to Man<br><br>John 15:14-17<br><br>There is no higher compliment than this: God wants to have a personal relationship with you. Some people see the Lord as some distant deity who is busy with global problems. Others view Him as a vaporous being who created mankind and then cut us loose.<br><br>The truth isÂ… He deeply desires a relationship with His followers. If the LordÂ’s purpose in creating mankind had been simply to get something done, He would have fashioned us like robots without initiative or free will. Instead, we are uniquely designed to receive our FatherÂ’s love and to choose whether or not weÂ’ll love Him in return.<br><br>God cares for His Creation and wants to intimately know every single one of us. While Jesus Christ poured His life into 12 men, modern believers tend to focus on His miracles and preaching. Many overlook the fact that He spent every day with the disciples. JesusÂ’ priority was to teach and prepare them. He wanted the 12 to continue reaching the world with the Gospel after He returned to the Father.<br><br>We are the spiritual descendants of the LordÂ’s disciples, and God pours Himself into us.   He left His Spirit with us to serve as our closest companion and comforter. GodÂ’s intention is for every person to enter into a loving relationship with Him. If any man or woman chooses not to develop that connection, he or she has missed the purpose of life. Make yourself available to the Lord. He will reveal His love for you and show you His will.<br><br>by Dr Charles Stanley</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Experiencing His Presence<br><br>Does Hunger Bring God Out of Hiding?<br><br>Divine interruptions in our daily affairs provide some of our most significant "proofs" of God's existence. In one moment, perhaps just a half of a moment, the God beyond time can invade our clock-driven existence and turn our world upside down.<br><br>Have you ever experienced a divine interruption? How did you respond to it? Was it a brief interruption for the moment, or a divine marker signaling a lifelong course change?<br><br>As I noted in The God Catchers, God "interrupted my self-defined successful career as a full-time evangelist with a simple but shocking revelation: 'You know, Tommy, your favorite services and My favorite services are not the same. You leave your services full and satisfied, but when you leave, I'm still hungry'" (p. 2).<br><br>That brief statement suddenly reduced two and a half decades of ministry to a frustrated journey from "God's good" to "God's best." A sick feeling engulfed me when I realized that much of what I had been doing as a well-intentioned full-time evangelist may have helped to perpetuate the kind of services that left God hungry and dissatisfied.<br><br>I left that God-encounter with a permanent spiritual limp, knowing I could never again support or be satisfied by "church as usual." You may not be a full-time minister, but you do play a role through your worship and ministry to the Lord in every service.<br><br>Have you experienced the same thing I did? What can you do to make sure God leaves your church service satisfied instead of hungry?<br><br>The Lord began to teach me about the importance of being a God Chaser during a nine-month period of what I call "divine discontent," when I learned that the only way we can bless God in our meetings was to leave them feeling hungrier for Him than when we first came.<br><br>How would you describe your hunger level and how you feel about it right now?<br><br>The term, divine discontent, is described this way in my first book, The God Chasers :<br><br>I somehow sensed that destiny was waiting ... a hunger had been birthed in my heart that just wouldn't go away. The gnawing vacuum of emptiness in the midst of my accomplishments just got worse. I was in a frustrating funk, a divine depression of destiny ... I just sensed that something awaited us from God.<br><br>My personal season of divine discontent ultimately led to an encounter with God that turned my life upside down and permanently rearranged my ministry. As of this writing, I haven't "recovered," and I pray that I never do!<br><br>Can you identify with the term, divine discontent? Are you ready for a life-changing God encounter?<br><br>Erroneous Assumptions, Presumptions and Misaligned Paradigms<br><br>What assumptions or beliefs would make the terms, God Chaser and God Catcher seem offensive to someone? Check any of the beliefs or religious paradigms that you believe may prevent people from chasing or catching God:<br><br>[ ] "God does not hide."<br><br>[ ]  "God cannot be 'caught' by anyone or anything.<br><br>[ ]  God really doesn't care about us as individuals, especially in the sense of having a personal relationship with us. After all, He is the Almighty Creator. He doesn't have the time or desire to concern Himself with our petty desires and needs.<br><br>[ ]  We have nothing that God wants.<br><br>[ ]  Human beings are not worthy of God's attention, therefore they don't get His attention.<br><br>[ ]  I'm already saved, so God lives in me and I don't have t o chase Him. The Bible doesn't tell me to "do" anything other than believe and receive Jesus as Savior.<br><br>By Tommy Tenny.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Purpose of Life<br><br>Genesis 1:26-27<br><br>What is the purpose of life? For thousands of years, people have been trying to answer that question. Countless books have examined the subject. And philosophers have searched centuries for an explanation. But God has a specific reason for placing us on earthÂ—to form us into His image bearers. The FatherÂ’s intention from the beginning was to form people in His likeness. But Adam and EveÂ’s sin started a ripple effect which continues today.<br><br>Since mankind is sinful, none of us can be like the Lord. God knew His human creation would make wrong choicesÂ— that was the risk of giving us free will. So, even before He laid the worldÂ’s foundation, He had a plan for redemption: Any person who wants to be right with the Father is made blameless through the sacrifice of the Son, Jesus Christ. Salvation makes us new creatures who can start life anew.<br><br>God desires for us to live as Jesus would. So, He molds our spirit and character. That process doesnÂ’t end until we receive our new eternal bodies and become a true reflection of our Lord. While we remain on earth, we model Jesus to those around us. Like a Father, God is pleased to see His children maturing to look more like Him.<br><br>Regardless of our successes and achievements, He will not allow us to be content unless we are undergoing His work of transformation. Peace and joy will elude us until we submit to the LordÂ’s planÂ… because bearing His image is our very purpose in life.<br><br>by Dr Charles Stanley</div>

Proponents of planning say, "If you aim at nothing, chances are you will probably hit it." They say that to wander aimlessly through life is like sailing a boat without a sail and rudder. You end up wherever the wind takes you.<br><br>Paul understood his personal mission, which should be the personal mission of every believer in Jesus Christ. It is the one summary statement that best describes the purpose of our existence on earth and the goal of our Christian experience. It can be reduced to three important characteristics.<br><br>To know Christ.<br><br>To know and experience His power.<br><br>To identify with His sufferings.<br><br>All that flows from these three objectives becomes a by-product. Salvation is a by-product. Miracles are a by-product. Christlikeness is a by-product. Paul's focus was on relationship. He understood that the deeper the relationship, the more power he would experience. He also understood that as he grew in this relationship, there would be suffering. Whenever the Kingdom of Light confronts the kingdom of darkness, there is a battle, and this often results in casualties. Christ confronted these earthly kingdoms and suffered for it. If we are living at this level of obedience, we, too, will face similar battles; it simply comes with the territory.<br><br>Does this sound like your personal mission statement? Is your focus in life centered on knowing Christ and the power of His resurrection? If not, press into Him today in order to begin experiencing Christ more intimately.<br><br>By Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Disappointments </strong><br>Proverbs 13:12<br>Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.<br><br>Life is filled with disappointments. Many of God's greatest servants experienced deep disappointment in their journeys of faithfulness to God. Joseph, after spending years as a slave and in jail for crimes that he did not commit, revealed deep disappointment when he was forgotten another two years in prison. John the Baptist, when awaiting execution, doubted whether Jesus was, in fact, the Christ because he was sitting there awaiting his death. Elijah, losing all hope and despondent to the point of death, asked God to take his life in the desert; and Peter, who left his fishing business and invested three years of his life only to watch his Savior crucified, wondered whether the purpose of those three years could be justified.<br><br>When life doesn't add up, it leaves the heart sick. When we have done all we know to do and the formula has not worked, it leaves us questioning. These are times that try the very souls of men. There is no human sense to be made of it. We are left with a choice: to cling or not to cling. There are times when holding on to our Master's robe is all that we can do. It is all that He wants us to do.<br><br>The heights by great men reached and kept<br><br>Were not obtained by sudden flight;<br><br>But they, while their companions slept,<br><br>Were toiling upward in the night.<br><br>Standing on what too long we bore,<br><br>With shoulders bent and downcast eyes,<br><br>We may discern-unseen before-<br><br>A path to higher destinies!<br><br>Longfellow<br><br>There is only one answer to life's disappointments. Like the psalmist, we must "Find rest, O my soul, in God alone; my hope comes from Him. He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my fortress, I will not be shaken" (Ps. 62:5-6).<br><br>By Os Hillman</div>

Jerry loved fun and games, and it was difficult for him to be serious about anything for very long. Ed was studious and hardworking, and nothing swayed him from his course, once his mind was made up. The two boys decided they were going to enter a ten-mile run sponsored by their school. Ed practiced every day, exercising and running, and eating foods that would get him in shape. Jerry exercised occasionally, ran a few times, and paid little attention to his diet. When the race came and went, Ed was leading the pack and Jerry couldn't even finish.<br>Leading an upright life prepares us for the race that God has waiting for us. Our spiritual fitness puts us in shape to run that race of life. Without a healthy spirit, we cannot hope to finish. Life without God beats us down and defeats us. Life in the Spirit lifts us above any obstacle and empowers us to meet every challenge.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Like Paul the Apostle, I want to run the good race and fight the good fight. Make me fit to be a member of Your team, Lord. Inspire me to prepare my spirit to meet all the challenges which might come my way. Amen.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Still Counting - Division<br>by Ed Young<br><br>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you (Matthew 28:19-20).<br><br>Division is defined as the act or process of separating things into parts. God is into division-he made the decision for division long ago. It is apparent in his very essence; God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit-three in one, one in three.<br><br>He has also shown division in the local church. God divided gifts into people's lives to reflect himself within the church. Each of us has been given specific talents and gifts according to God's desire for the purpose of spreading his word. In other words, God has delegated his authority to each of us to complete his math.<br><br>Before he ascended to heaven, Jesus delegated the responsibility of spreading his message to his followers. You and I have been handed that responsibility. What God has placed in our lives, what he has divided among us, is there for the purpose of reaching others for his glory.<br><br>What has God divided into your life? What talents or gifts has God given to you? Use those gifts the way that he intended. Use them to complete his math. Because after all, that is how his equation will be completed-through you and me dividing Christ among other people who still count to God.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jesus Proves He Is for Real<br>John 4:1-43; Psalm 103:19-22; Proverbs 18:2<br><br>Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples), He left Judea and departed again to Galilee. But He needed to go through Samaria.<br>So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.<br><br>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give Me a drink." For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.<br><br>Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.<br><br>Jesus answered and said to her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."<br><br>The woman said to Him, "Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water? Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?"<br><br>Jesus answered and said to her, "Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life."<br><br>The woman said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw."<br><br>Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."<br>The woman answered and said, "I have no husband."<br><br>Jesus said to her, "You have well said, 'I have no husband,' for you have had five husbands, and the onewhom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly."<br><br>The woman said to Him, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship."<br><br>Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."<br><br>The woman said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming" (who is called Christ). "When He comes, He will tell us all things."<br><br>Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am He."<br><br>And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He talked with a woman; yet no one said, "What do You seek?" or, "Why are You talking with her?"<br><br>The woman then left her waterpot, went her way into the city, and said to the men, "Come, see a Man who told me all things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?" Then they went out of the city and came to Him.<br><br>In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."<br>But He said to them, "I have food to eat of which you do not know."<br><br>Therefore the disciples said to one another, "Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?"<br><br>Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work. Do you not say, 'There are still four months and then comes the harvest'? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest! And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together. For in this the saying is true: 'One sows and another reaps.' I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labors."<br><br>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, "He told me all that I ever did." So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they urged Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. And many more believed because of His own word.<br><br>Then they said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world."<br><br>Now after the two days He departed from there and went to Galilee.<br>John 4:1-43<br><br>WORSHIP<br>The LORD has established His throne in heaven,<br>And His kingdom rules over all.<br>Bless the LORD, you His angels,<br>Who excel in strength, who do His word,<br>Heeding the voice of His word.<br>Bless the LORD, all you His hosts,<br>You ministers of His, who do His pleasure.<br>Bless the LORD, all His works,<br>In all places of His dominion.<br>Bless the LORD, O my soul!<br>Psalm 103:19-22<br><br>WISDOM<br><br>A fool has no delight in understanding,<br>But in expressing his own heart.<br>Proverbs 18:2<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DEFEATING  DEPRESSION<br><br>PART 6<br><br>Trust in Yah will take you out of depression<br><br>Shabbat Shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>He who is of a proud heart stirs up strife, But he who trusts in Yahveh will be prospered. Proverbs 28:25<br><br>As we paraphrase the above verse from the original Hebrew it will read as follows,<br><br>Â“He who is of a proud heart stirs up strife, but he who trusts in Yahveh will be fertilizedÂ”<br><br>In other words, the humble ones that trust in and are dependant on The Almighty will suffer Â“stinking situationsÂ” that will fertilize their lives and bring their lives in to abundance fruitfulness! Fertilizers are very strong in smell, but without them we cannot get abundant crops. And it is the same in our lives, we will go through Â“hard to stomachÂ” situations and every one else will see that we are suffering, however the purpose of these Â“stinking, fertilizing situationsÂ”; is to bring us to fruitfulness, prosperity and abundance!<br><br>So many times we wonder why is it that hard situations Â“hitÂ” our lives? How can it be that we, being people of The Covenant live through distresses, tragedies and disasters? How can it be that Israel has suffered so much after 2000 years of exile in order to fulfill YahvehÂ’s plan to reestablish her as a Light unto the Nations? So many times we get angry with YAH (God) and point a finger at Him for allowing hard things to happen in our lives. And what is worst, many have developed the culture of Â“JobÂ’s comfortersÂ” trying to find fault with whoever is suffering! Â“It must be his fault, they say. It is probably the sins of so and so, or the terrible sins of Israel that have brought this terrible predicament forthÂ”.<br><br>Now as YÂ’shua passed by, He saw a man who was blind from birth. And His disciples asked Him, saying, Â“Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?Â”  YÂ’shua answered, Â“Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him. John 9:1-3<br><br>It is always in the nature of man to point a finger, however every time that we point a finger to someone else, three fingers will be pointing at us- The Triune God Himself.<br><br>For a righteous man may fall seven times And rise again, But the wicked shall fall by calamity. Proverbs 24:16<br><br>We need to understand that The Covenant People of God, be it Gentiles or Jews will fall some times, yes, even seven times, which means Â“an unlimited amount of timesÂ”, but they will rise again EVERY time! However the wicked will fall and will not rise up!<br><br>The difference between the wicked and the righteous is not that the righteous has no troubles or even prospers more than the wicked, no! The difference is in the response of the righteous during hardship. His response of faith and trust in YAH will cause him to rise up above the fallen wicked! Jeremiah said:<br><br>Righteous are You, O Yahveh, when I plead with You; Yet let me talk with You about Your judgments. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are those happy who deal so treacherously?  Jeremiah 12:1<br><br>The wicked will prosper for a time, but when trouble hits, he will be suddenly destroyed and that without a remedy.<br><br>If you are going through a hard situation and everyone can see your vulnerability, be encouraged today- You are being fertilized! You are being made fruitful and prosperous! It is not necessarily your sins that have brought this about, it may really be that your trust in YAH has brought this about! He has put His eye on you as a Â“fruitful landÂ” and has decided to fertilize you so that you will be prosperous! If you have Â“JobÂ’s comfortersÂ” around you or Â“well meaning criticsÂ”, just thank them and YAH, for they are part of your Â“fertilizationÂ”. Eventually every one will also be able to see the gorgeous fruit in your life and glorify the Father in Heaven for your Â“suddenÂ” prosperity and success. Only you will know the years of Â“fertilizationÂ” that you have gone through!<br><br>Keep yourself in love, in forgiveness and thankfulness and do not lose sight of the vision for which purpose you are being Â“fertilizedÂ”. Then the perfumed anointing of Adonai will be in you and upon you mightily and it will cause you to forget the Â“stinkÂ”.<br><br>Looking unto YÂ’shua, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2<br><br>In YÂ’shuaÂ’s Love<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Rabbi Baruch and Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br></div>

And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.  Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away.  For we know in part and we prophesy in part.  But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.  1 Corinthians 13<br><br>This chapter is here to encourage you that when you feel that all else has failed, there is only one thing that will never fail and that is LOVE.

            <div class='col-md body'>DEFEATING DEPRESSION Part7b<br><br>Ã Ã¤Ã¡Ã¤<br><br>The word AHAVAH is the most revealing word of the Hebrew language! Let me explain:<br><br>The first and the third letter form the word AB with the letters ALEF and BET. In Hebrew the whole alphabet is called ALEF, BET and also the foundation of anything is called the ALEF BET. Without the ALEF BET, the first two letters of the Hebrew alphabet we have no foundation for the language! The letters ALEF BET form the word AB or AV which means FATHER. Without the love of a FATHER there is no foundation to life! Most of the people that suffer from depression and especially suicidal depression have lacked the stabilizing presence and love of their father, this the ALEF BET, The A,B,C or the foundation of life is missing.<br><br>The second and last letters of AHAVAH is the letter HEH or H. That letter is always used to write the name of Adonai, so HEH means God. But the HEH represents the BREATH of GOD or The RUACH ADONAI who in Hebrew is a feminine form. Yes, Holy Spirit in Hebrew is feminine. So, the HEH represents the Â“mother spiritÂ” and in this case the love of a mother, the life bringer. The word AHAVAH represents a perfect balance between the masculine and the feminine attributes of God. Please remember that The Creator created ADAM in His image, Â“male and female created He themÂ”, so He has both male and female in Him.<br><br>Then God said, Â“Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.Â”  So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Genesis 1:26-27<br><br>That is why a married couple, a father and a mother are to be the foundation for a healthy life for the child. Ungodly parents, abusive parents, divorced parents, etcÂ…are the cause for the most instability in the life of their children! Nearly every mental problem in a child can be linked to the condition of his parents. Are they holy, healthy, stable, loving or are they not? A child experiences the love of God through his/her parents, if they are unable to give that, their children will experience many struggles such as depression and even suicide.<br><br>Though both parents are equally needed and complementary in order to demonstrate The Love of God, the lack of proper fatherhood is the most detrimental because the blood line of the children is communicated through the fathers. That is the reason why in The Holy Scriptures we mostly know who the father is and not who the mother is. The lack of fatherhood in this generation is appalling! And it is definitely a plan of satan by destroying the very fiber of society- The family unit!<br><br>We could easily ask ourselves, Â“ what can we do now?Â” So many of us were raised with absent fathers, whether alcoholic, abusive, selfish, workaholics, divorced or non existent altogether. So, the predicament for our generation and the next is mental problems, emotional problems, depressions and suicide! And indeed these are unfortunately and steadily on the rise! But I have Good News for you! There is a way out of this and it is BOTH a Miracle and a Process!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DEFEATING DEPRESSION Part7c<br><br>AHAVAH-LOVE IS A CHOICE!<br><br>If you are among those that were not properly parented, welcome to the Â“clubÂ”, you are not alone, this is a general problem. You can as of today make a choice to change your whole outlook on life from victim to victor! You can choose AHAVAH right now by choosing to give full entrance to the Messiah YÂ’shua into your heart and life and by deciding to imitate Him.<br><br>How God anointed YÂ’shua of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him. Acts 10:38<br><br>YÂ’shua is the FRUIT OF AHAVAH; He is the product of The Father in Heaven impregnating Miriam a young Jewish virgin with the Holy Spirit, The Ruach (the feminine mother side of YAHVEH). The Oneness of God conceived a Son in the womb of Miriam as prophesied by the Hebrew Prophet Isaiah.<br><br>Therefore Yahveh Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel. Isaiah 7:14<br><br>YÂ’shua is the LOVE, The AHAVA of God incarnate, made flesh. He proved Himself to be LOVE all the way up to His execution and sacrifice on a Roman Cross in order to pay for our sins. He did the ultimate act of love; He gave His soul a ransom for our sins! When we accept YÂ’shuaÂ’s Love Sacrifice, The AHAVAH of His Father enters us through The Ruach, The Spirit of God and washes away all orphan- hood from us. We become then Children of God newly born of the Love of God. That is the miracle!<br><br>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16<br><br>Now the process begins; the process of retraining our minds to believe in love and to choose love in our thinking, in our feelings and in our actions. We need to choose the AHAVAH LIFESTYLE daily and against all odds and circumstances. Love is always the BEST choice in every situation and it cannot fail! The only one that failed among the 12 apostles of YÂ’shua was Judas Iscariot who lived and fellowshipped with Love Himself for over three years. He chose to betray and reject LOVE and ended committing suicide! There was no more hope for him because he had known Love intimately and still chose wickedness, money, fame and hatred instead. Rejecting GodÂ’s Love in the person of YÂ’shua is most particularly detrimental for those that have had a lack of AHAVAH parenting as they do not have what it takes to cope with this life, sooner or later they break! Most people did not enjoy the blessing of Judas Iscariot that knew love intimately and so most people that try to commit suicide, they do so because of the unbearable pain they suffer. If they knew LOVE, they knew YÂ’shua they would shift that unbearable pain to Him who took all of their sin and also all of their pain! (Isaiah 53)<br><br>Surely He has borne our griefs And carried our sorrows; Yet we esteemed Him stricken, Smitten by God, and afflicted.  But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to his own way; And Yahveh has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.   Isaiah 53:4-6<br><br>And these are the Good News that AHAVAH Himself took all of your sin and all of your pain. There is no need to escape pain through depression or suicide- just give it up to Him that already took it for you and breath LOVE in; His endless, unconditional all encompassing LOVE and COMPASSION for you! Do not reject or be afraid of such LOVE any longer, accept Him fully and let Him teach you AHAVAH! Then make AHAVAH your choice FOREVER!<br><br>A LIFE CHANGING PRAYER<br><br>YÂ’shua come into my heart and life, be my father and my mother, fill me with your AHAVAH and lead me in LoveÂ’s way. I forgive all that have wronged me, ask and receive your forgiveness for all my wrongdoings and I am yours forever!<br><br>Choose love, choose life and be made whole!<br><br>In YÂ’shuaÂ’s AHAVAH<br><br>We love, care and pray for you always<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Rabbi Baruch and Bishop Dominiquae Bierman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do It Again, Lord<br>A Prayer for Troubled Times<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>DEAR LORD,<br><br>WeÂ’re still hoping weÂ’ll wake up. WeÂ’re still hoping weÂ’ll open a sleepy eye and think, What a horrible dream.<br><br>But we wonÂ’t, will we, Father? What we saw was not a dream. Planes did gouge towers. Flames did consume our fortress. People did perish. It was no dream, and, dear Father, we are sad.<br><br>There is a ballet dancer who will no longer dance and a doctor who will no longer heal. A church has lost her priest; a classroom is minus a teacher. Cora ran a food pantry. Paige was a counselor, and Dana, dearest Father, Dana was only three years old. (Who held her in those final moments?)<br><br>We are sad, Father. For as the innocent are buried, our innocence is buried as well. We thought we were safe. Perhaps we should have known better. But we didnÂ’t.<br><br>And so we come to you. We donÂ’t ask you for help; we beg you for it. We donÂ’t request; we implore. We know what you can do. WeÂ’ve read the accounts. WeÂ’ve pondered the stories, and now we plead, Â“Do it again, Lord. Do it again.Â”<br><br>Remember Joseph? You rescued him from the pit. You can do the same for us. Do it again, Lord.<br><br>Remember the Hebrews in Egypt? You protected their children from the angel of death. We have children too, Lord. Do it again.<br><br>And Sarah? Remember her prayers? You heard them. Joshua? Remember his fears? You inspired him. The women at the tomb? You resurrected their hope. The doubts of Thomas? You took them away. Do it again, Lord. Do it again.<br><br>You changed Daniel from a captive into a kingÂ’s counselor. You took Peter the fisherman and made him Peter an apostle. Because of you, David went from leading sheep to leading armies. Do it again, Lord, for we need counselors today. We need apostles. We need leaders. Do it again, dear Lord.<br><br>Most of all, do again what you did at Calvary. What we saw here on that Tuesday, you saw there on that Friday. Innocence slaughtered. Goodness murdered. Mothers weeping. Evil dancing. Just as the ash fell on our children, the darkness fell on your Son. Just as our towers were shattered, the very Tower of Eternity was pierced.<br><br>And by dusk, heavenÂ’s sweetest song was silent, buried behind a rock.<br><br>But you did not waver, O Lord. You did not waver. After your Son lay three days in a dark hole, you rolled the rock and rumbled the earth and turned the darkest Friday into the brightest Sunday. Do it again, Lord. Grant us a September Easter.<br><br>We thank you, dear Father, for these hours of unity. Disaster has done what discussions could not. Doctrinal fences have fallen. Republicans are standing with Democrats. Skin colors have been covered by the ash of burning buildings. We thank you for these hours of unity.<br><br>And we thank you for these hours of prayer. The Enemy sought to bring us to our knees and succeeded. He had no idea, however, that we would kneel before you.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Finger of God<br>Exodus 31:18<br>When the Lord finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of the Testimony, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.<br><br>Throughout the Bible, the word testimony is used in many ways. Testimony comes from the Hebrew word eduwth, which means "witness." The Ark of the Covenant contained the Ten Commandments, written and inscribed personally by God and given to Moses on Mount Sinai. These became known as the testimony. The ark was a divinely inspired structure that was to be used as a witness to the people of Israel and the whole world of God's power and majesty. These divinely created tablets were a witness of God's activity on earth with man.<br><br>Throughout the Bible, God looked to create testimonies with His people. At the Red Sea, He created a testimony through Moses. God created a testimony through Joshua when He parted the Jordan River and allowed the people with the Ark to cross on dry land. When Lazarus lay dead for days, Jesus came and created a testimony of His ability to raise the dead.<br><br>Jesus is still looking for those who are willing to have a testimony created through their lives. One of the major characteristics of a God-ordained testimony is for something to happen that cannot be explained in the natural. In other words, if you can make it happen through your abilities, it is not a testimony about God, but about you.<br><br>One time, I was invited to go to South Africa to a major conference, but I did not have the funds to go. I sensed that I was to attend this conference, but refused to use a credit card to fund the trip. I waited and waited. Finally, on the day of the registration closing, a man came to my office and said I was to go to this conference and he would fund the trip. He took out his checkbook and wrote a check for $2,500. That has become a testimony of God's activity in my life.<br><br>God wants to create a testimony in every aspect of your life-your family, your work, your church, and in your community. He is waiting to put His finger on your next endeavor to reveal His power through your life. Look carefully at the events where God might want to create a testimony out of an impossible situation. He delights in using His children for this purpose because it brings Him glory.<br><br>By Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't Be Disturbed<br>The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.<br><br>Â–(Psalm 33:10)<br><br>You may be facing trouble today that's being caused by people who have willfully plotted to do you harm. They may be trying to steal your business, your home, your children, or even to destroy your marriage. If so, I have a word of encouragement for you. According to Psalm 33:10, God will bring the plans of those people to nought. He will make their devices of none effect. The counsel of the heathen is brought to nought, but the counsel of the Lord stands forever!<br><br>Remember this: When you make God your stronghold in the time of trouble, no one can overcome you. No matter how powerful they are in the natural, the odds are in your favor because you trust in the Lord. They may think they've got an edge over you, but God is on your side and that gives you the advantage!<br><br>Rest assured, you are eventually going to triumph over this trouble. In the meantime, if you'll set your affections on the Lord, the thoughts of His heart continually will be coming into your heart. "The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide" (Ps. 37:30-31). God's counsel will give you stability when all the world around you is shaking. Evil tidings will not be able to steal your peace. The thoughts of God will immediately rise up and rebuke the evil tidings from taking root in your heart.<br><br>Don't let the temporary successes of the troublemaker disturb you. Instead, "mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace" (verse 37).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Go for Revelation Knowledge<br>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.<br><br>Â–(2 Peter 1:2)<br><br>If you were to look up the Greek word that's translated "knowledge" in that scripture, you'd find out that it means more than just a mental understanding of something, more than the kind of knowledge that can be gained through your senses. It means exact knowledge. Knowledge that's been revealed directly to your heart by the Spirit of God. I call it revelation knowledge.<br><br>The lack of that kind of knowledge has caused more faith failures than anything else I know. That's because most Christians believe the Word with their minds, but they haven't meditated on it enough for it to "light up" in their hearts. If they had, that Word would absolutely revolutionize their lives. Nothing in heaven or earth would be able to shake them loose from it.<br><br>I know a widow who got hold of that kind of revelation one afternoon. She'd been meditating in the scriptures that say if you're a widow, God Almighty has taken His place as your provider and leader of your household.<br><br>She'd been feeling a little sorry for herself up until then. But when she received the revelation that God was actually head of her household now, she started talking to Him like she would a husband.<br><br>"I'm telling You, Lord, the plumbing in this house is pitiful. Will You please get it fixed?" she said. From that moment on, she never had any more trouble with her plumbing.<br><br>If you need something from God, determine right now that you're going to do what that widow did. Determine that you're going to meditate the Word until you get a revelation like that. Keep that Word before you until you receive a revelation of Jesus as your healer or your deliverer or your financier--whatever you need Him to be. Don't settle for a shallow mental understanding of Him. Get a deep revelation and His grace will be multiplied to you!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Clyde an Dee Kilough<br><br>Overcoming<br><br>At times we may feel like the apostle Paul didÂ—we want to do well but we keep doing what we hate (Romans 7:15-19). No matter how many times we try, we seem to end up failing. This can be especially frustrating if we have been trying to overcome a particular habit for a long time. It reminds me of what W.C. Fields said about quitting drinking: "It's easy. I've done it a thousand times."<br><br>It may seem like we have tried to overcome something a thousand times or more and still seem to come up short. Yet we mustn't give up. God is always there for us when we fail, and He will never leave us or give up on us (Hebrews 13:5). Overcoming is a process that includes moments of success, moments in which we pause and catch our breathÂ—and sometimes moments of failure. But consistent effort with God's help makes overcoming a certainly.<br><br></div>

We tend to dwell on our problems first, but if we turn that around and recognize how great our God is, then our problems become insignificant. He did not promise us a life without problems. We may build character by the things we learn through trial and misfortune. He may not fulfill all our wishes, but He will keep all His promises. Think big and think far, far ahead. Problems vanish, but God and eternity remain.<br><br>He has promised us: "I will never leave you nor forsake you" (Hebrews 13:5), and He will keep that promise if we turn to Him for our needs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ONLY YAHWEH IS YAHWEH<br>Genesis 3:4, 5<br>The serpent said . . . "you will be like Yahweh, knowing good and evil"<br><br>Adam was the first to be tempted by the notion that he could "be like Yahweh" (Genesis 3:5), which is the essence of the self-centered worldview that Satan promotes. Millions have been seduced by Satan into believing that they are Yahweh. The New Age Movement is promoting this lie on a grand and international scale.<br><br>However, the biblical account of creation clearly establishes that only Yahweh the Creator is truly Yahweh. Adam and his ancestors are not gods; we are created beings which cannot exist apart from Yahweh. The diabolical idea that man is his own god is the primary link in the chain of spiritual bondage to the kingdom of darkness.<br><br>The problem with man's attempt at being his own god is that he was never designed to occupy that role. He lacks the necessary attributes to determine his own destiny. Even sinless, spiritually alive Adam in the Garden of Eden before the Fall wasn't equipped to be his own god. Contrary to what the New Agers tell us, the potential to be a god never was in you, isn't in you now, and never will be in you. Being Yahweh is Yahweh's capacity alone.<br><br>If you desire to live in freedom from the bondage of the world, the flesh and the devil, this primary link in the chain must be renounced. The self-centered worldview which Satan and his emissaries are promoting must be replaced by the perspective that Yeshua introduced to His disciples in the wake of Peter's self-preserving rebuke in Matthew 16: "If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake shall find it" (verses 24, 25). In the next several days, we will examine the view from the cross.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Father, forgive me for the occasions when I have usurped Your place in my life. You are my Yahweh.</div>
