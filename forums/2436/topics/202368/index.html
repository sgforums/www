            <div class='col-md body'>May 21, 2006<br><br>Francis Frangipane: "Repentance Precedes Revival"<br><br>A true revival does not just happen. There are conditions that must reside in the human heart before the Lord visits His people.<br><br>We Must Want Deliverance, Not Just Relief<br><br>Too often, ministries today seek to deliver people who are unwilling to repent of sins, who have not cried in their heart to God for help. The effect is that those prayed for, may receive limited relief, but they soon fall back into sin and oppression. The key to successful deliverance, is to discern if an individual is ready and willing to be released before we minister deliverance. Are they repentant? H ave they put away their idols? Is their heart truly turning towards God?<br><br>God's pattern for us as individuals, is also His pattern for the church and the city. Even as the Lord did not deliver us until we cried for help, so the war for our churches and cities will not be won until a significant number of us are crying to God in prayer. Christ's purpose in bringing the citywide church to prayer, is to provide the proper heart attitudes to which the Almighty can respond.<br><br>Without the substructure of prayer and crying before God, deliverance, "binding and loosing," and other forms of spiritual warfare are significantly limited. Deliverance, according to Scripture, is the last stage of a process that began when a person's abhorrence for his present condition led him to cry to God for help.<br><br>The Deliverers<br><br>The Old Testament reveals God's pattern for deliverance and revival: In answe r to the prayers and sufferings of His people, the Lord raised up deliverers. They were individuals who were anointed and empowered by God to defeat Israel's oppressors.<br><br>It is important to note that the effectiveness of these deliverers was never based upon their own worthiness or credentials. While they were uniquely sent by God, their arrival was synchronized with Israel's repentance. No repentance; no deliverance. As Israel cried to God, the deliverers were commissioned and anointed with the power of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>The essence of this Old Testament pattern for renewal, can be applied to us in our day. We may not see actual "deliverers," as much as we will see revival emerge in those cities where prayer and repentance is deep and widespread.<br><br>Again, looking at the Israel model, national sin brought defeat and dominance by foreign powers. With foreign domination, came the worship of demons and the complete seduction of Israel's heart by the enemy. As Israel blatantly defied God's laws, so came the economic, cultural and physical collapse of the nation. Where once the people enjoyed the blessing of God, now despair and misery dwelt upon the land.<br><br>It was in this context of a suffering people, who were genuinely and deeply crying to God, that the Lord raised up deliverers. These individuals led a repentant Israel into victory over their oppressors. As true worship was established, national peace and prosperity followed.<br><br>It should be noted that the route to revival was not set according to a timetable; it was not precisely scheduled. No one can forecast how long judgment might last, or when repentance has so excavated the heart of sinful man that God is satisfied. This one fact will be true:<br>The time it takes will always be longer than we expect. The determining factor is the acknowledgment of sin and the retu rn to God. Once the core of the nation was securely turned towards God, healing for their land followed.<br><br>Nehemiah speaks of this pattern of repentance preceding national deliverance. He prayed:<br><br>"Therefore Thou didst deliver them into the hand of their oppressors who oppressed them, but when they cried to Thee in the time of their distress, Thou didst hear from Heaven, and according to Thy great compassion Thou didst give them deliverers who delivered them from the hand of their oppressors." (Nehemiah 9:27.)<br><br>We must not hurry this process nor be frustrated if our prayers do not immediately activate divine intervention. The Lord is waiting for the nation to break beneath the weight of its rebellion. Yet, in this, we should be encouraged:<br>Our intercession is the first fruits of what is destined to become a nationa l response to the Almighty!<br><br>There may be, at times, flurries of spiritual activity, but before a national revival will come, there will be a nation crying to God. This period is called, "The time of their distress," and it is not consummated in revival until the nation has been crying unto the Lord for a number of years.<br><br>Man's Misery, God's Heart<br>In the book of Judges, this pattern occurs time and time again. While Israel tumbled deeper into sin, God waited for the burden and consequences of Israel's sin to humble their souls. He waited to bring them back to Himself.<br><br>Yet, the Lord was not aloof from Israel's sorrows. Even when they were in rebellion, He felt their sufferings. When the Lord "could bear the misery of Israel no longer" (Judges 10:16), He sent them deliverers. The misery and desperation of Israel readied them for God.<br><br>We see this pattern in the Lord's encounter with Moses in Exodus. The Redeemer said,<br><br>"I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have given heed to their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings. So I have come down to deliver them." (Exodus 3:7-8.)<br><br>Notice the Lord saw the affliction of His people; He heard their cries; He knew their sufferings. God is never far from the plight of mankind. In truth, He bears the misery of our society:<br>Our distresses distress Him; our suffering becomes His sorrow.<br><br>Returning to our text in Exodus, observe also that it was not merely their prayers which God heard; He heard their cries. It is one thing to pray about a need, quite another to weep over it. It is those who mourn whom God comforts.<br><br>The Lord knew their afflictions and their sufferings. The prayer to which God responds is a constant cry, often born out of "afflictions" and "sufferings," as is occurring today in parts of Africa and Asia.<br><br>Perhaps the Lord has not fully answered us, because our prayers are still comfortably contained within a schedule. In 1970, I came to Christ during the Charismatic Renewal. This move of God began in the constant, "day and night" cry of a million mothers. This was not the result of a mere hour of prayer; it emerged out of the continual cry of mothers (and fathers), who were deeply troubled about their children's involvement with drugs and rebellion. Their prayer was not a religious discipline, it was the heart-throb of their existence. Without the sophisticated machinery of spiritual warfare, the tears and weeping of their unceasing intercession prevailed before Go d and He rescued their children.<br><br>Perhaps what delays revival in our times, is that we are troubled, but we are not afflicted by the conditions of our society; though saddened, we are not yet weeping.<br><br>It must be acknowledged, however, that a growing number of God's people, have truly surrendered to the vulnerability of Christ's compassions. They bear in their intercessions not only the needs of the people, but the pain of the people as well. They are laying down their reputations, their jobs, yes, even their lives to see the sins of our society cleansed.<br><br>Although still a minority, these intercessors carry in their souls the anguish of their cities. They hear the cry of the oppressed; they know the suffering of both the unborn and the born. God is ready to respond to their prayer. Out of the womb of their distress, God shall bring forth deliverance.<br><br>The praying church, should not limit the length of its dedication to intercession. God is looking for a life of prayer, not just a season. If the duration of time required to bring change can stop us, it is obvious that the preparatory work in our hearts is not deep enough to draw divine intervention.<br><br>How does all this relate to revival? Spiritual renewal is the only antidote for our cities and our nation. It is God's answer to all who cry unceasingly to Him for help.<br><br>Prayer:<br>Lord, forgive us for wanting relief instead of deliverance; for looking for shortcuts instead of Your perfect will. Master, we know that Your heart cannot refuse the genuine cry of the afflicted, that You cannot long bear the misery of Your people without acting on our behalf. So, we cry to You today! Send the rain of Your presence back to us! Cleanse us from our lusts for comfort and apathy. Bring us to the place where You can honor Y our integrity and bring revival to our land! For Your glory we pray. Amen.<br>Francis Frangipane<br>Francis Frangipane Ministries<br>www.frangipane.org<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jill Austin: "God is Redefining Church"<br><br>God is Redefining Churches and Nations<br><br>The Lord is taking His finger, and He is not only redefining the borders of nations but also the church. He says, "I am going to redefine even how you see My presence. I am going to take the walls down between different denominations, and give you a hunger and fire for one another; a jealously for each of you who love the Lamb of God, and have that fire for each other."<br><br>It is as if you were up in the Heavens looking at the earth, and you see that certain nations are full of different amounts of the glory of God. There are prophetic time clocks on different nations, according to His sovereign purposes for radical revival.<br><br>The Glory of the Cross<br><br>The Lord says, "As you receive more and more, and come into the fullness of the revelation of the glory of My Cross--of Who I Am--the more My glory and the more of Heaven will kiss earth." There needs to be a cry in you that says, "Lord, I am earth. Kiss this lump of earth, Lord. Let your fire and presence consume me!"<br><br>The apostolic anointing in Acts 2, shows us that Holy Spirit came like a mighty rushing wind. At 9:00 a.m., a crowd of more than three thousand people gathered and accused the Christians of being drunk. Immediately Peter said, "We are not drunk, as you think." He spoke with an apostolic anointing, preaching the crucified Christ--the glory of the Cross, that all are sinners needing to repent, and that Jesus is the Messiah!<br>As Peter preached the glory of the Cross, the crucifixion and the resurrection, three thousand people were saved!<br>Be Radically Used in the Market Place<br>Our cry, is that we don't want to just say "Come Holy Spirit"; we want to say "Stay Holy Spirit!" We don't want just a visitation, we want an inhabitation! I feel like the Lord is asking, "Are you willing to be radical for Me? Are you willing to let Me use your hands, your feet, and your mouth to be radically on fire for Me? I am calling for a new militancy, a new passion, a new revelation of the Cross."<br>Why isn't everyone moving with an apostolic anointing where you work, go to school, or how about the gas station and grocery store, and wherever you are? There needs to be a place in you, where you say, "Jesus, give me that fiery anointing. Lord, use me to powerfully touch my world."<br><br>We, as a church, have abdicated our posts! We've said yes, to sending out missionaries, itinerants, and others, but the Lord says, "I want YOU! I want you to be My hands and My heart. I want you to be My mouth and My eyes. When you see people, I don't want you to automatically give them a tract. I want you to look at that person and ask Me what I have for that living soul."<br><br>Be Naturally Supernatural<br><br>You will start seeing people as living souls, and God will begin to give you words and other things they need. If you don't get anything, you can always ask them to get a cup of coffee with you. Be naturally supernatural. Be real.<br>I feel like the Lord is trying to break religious evangelism. He wants to start working with prophetic evangelism, where you are naturally supernatural--being real people, who love a real God! Then you can be one who goes through real life situations, with a God who is with you in the midst of it all, and you can share that with others!<br><br>Do you want to be a carrier of the anointing? How much fire do you want? When people reach out and touch your clothes, are you so saturated with anointing that people are instantly healed? Have you even prayed for that? "Lord, let Your anointing and Your glory seep out of me." May it be that we don't even know when it happens because it is so naturally supernatural.<br><br>Your Commissioning<br><br>Is there that cry in you that says, "Lord, I want to see people radically touched right where I live, where I walk, and where I live real life." The Lord says He wants to bend the walls of the church and take you to the world, so that you can be His hands, His heart, and His feet.<br>If you are waiting for someone else to do it, He says to forget it! You are it! He wants to give us fishing nets. For years, He has been healing the holes in the nets, so that we can throw out our nets into the dark sea of humanity. As we throw our nets out, the Shekinah glory will come as the nets hit the water, and the fish will see the nets and come running. Jesus our Lord says that He is going to bring in such a great harvest that many of you will have to team together to bring in His fish.<br><br>Can you say, "Here am I, send me!" That is sweet music to His ears! This is part of why He gave His life on the Cross!<br><br>Jill Austin<br>Master Potter Ministries<br>www.masterpotter.com<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Robert Ricciardelli: "Me-ology and Feel Good Theology"<br>Pursuit of Feeling Good<br><br>I think most of us would agree--if you had a choice between things that make you feel good and things that don't, our natural inclination would be to pursue things which make us feel good. We go to the movies or want to be entertained, with the idea of feeling something positive at the end of the experience. Also, we could choose people, sermons and churches, all designed to make us feel good. In our pursuit of feeling good, we could easily wander into things that may not be the truth or the reality of what the Lord desires for us.<br>His truth, His reality, may not always feel good, but His way for each of us is excellent. We are all called to hear His voice and follow His truth, and not get caught up in the evangelical humanism that wants to strip us from our destiny in Him.<br><br>Discerning Mixed Truths<br>There is a continued trend throughout the western church, of preaching and teaching messages that appeal to our souls, but do little in changing our souls or renewing our minds to His ways. Many times these teachings are contrary to what the Father desires for each of us. There are truths being spoken out of context, which are mixed truths to tickle the ears of man.<br>Because there are Scriptures attached to false doctrine, many fall into the trap of false reality. Much of it has its root in a muddled "world view" and an uninspired "Word view." Many read the Bible through the eyes of self. They gravitate towards sermons that bring focus to self and the pleasures of this world. They glory in God when things go according to their plans, but often whine or rebel when things go according to His plans.<br><br>Quoting and Applying Scripture to Our Own Desires<br><br>1 Chronicles 4:9-10, "Jabez was more honorable than his brothers. His mother had named him Jabez, saying, 'I gave birth to him in pain.' Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, 'Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain.' And God granted his request."<br><br>Many have prayed the prayer of Jabez and have expected the same results, not even considering what the Lord may have for His glory in their lives. God granted Jabez his request, because it was according to His plans and His will that Jabez prayed. I do not think Joseph prayed that he would be left for dead by His brothers. I do not think Joseph prayed to be thrown in prison. Yet, it was part of God's divine plan for him. He had dreams of His brothers bowing to him, and certainly did not expect the results he had to endure. The final result was the glory of God being manifested through a servant, who did not live for self, but lived for the glory of God.<br><br>Just because God granted Jabez his request, does not mean God is going to grant you your request. Think of Joseph reading a copy of the Jabez prayer and believing God to keep him from pain, just before His brothers left him for dead and enduring years of pain. God did expand his territory and did bless him, but it was in God's design and timing. I am not saying to not ask or pray such things, I am saying, be prepared for His will, His timing, and most of all, His glory to come forth.<br><br>The territory and resources He has for you now, may be all you need to accomplish what He has ordained for you. You can confess, profess, name it, claim it, and get very discouraged that your will did not change His mind. Many people want to be blessed and have their territory expanded, but are not willing to be transformed through death to themselves.<br><br>Colossians 3:5-6, "Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. Because of these, the wrath of God is coming."<br><br>Galatians 2:20, "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."<br><br>In contrast to the feel good passages of the Bible, we do not see many pray regarding the Scriptures above, or pray as Paul did in Philippians 3:10, "I want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in His sufferings, becoming like Him in his death,"<br><br>Praise God that our loving Father denies often our selfish requests, so that we live as disciples for His plan for us.<br><br>We are Here for His Glory<br><br>We are here for His glory and only His glory. When we are done in this life, we are done for His glory. Have you ever thought of Job's first wife and children? God took them to Himself early for His glory. He did not love the wife and children any less than he loved Job. It did not seem fair. Sovereign God allowed His Son to be crucified for His glory. Stephen was martyred as a young man for His glory! We all know that God could choose to call someone home at the age of 18 or even at 120 years of age. He chooses the time He will allow that to happen.<br><br>The western church is taught, and tends to gravitate towards Jabez types of prayers, and Jabez types of results that really appeal to the core of our fleshly nature. We shy away from wanting to read, study, or apply the teachings of sacrifice and death to self. Selfless life does not sell in the American church experience. We often quote the feel good Scriptures, but do not gravitate to Job or Joseph realities. There certainly is more desire for a season of harvest over any wilderness experience. We do not want to sacrifice our next meal, let alone a career, a house, or a lifestyle for His Kingdom.<br>We must embrace the wilderness, suffering, and sacrifice as a part of His plan, in changing us into His image.<br><br>The Reason and Season is His Choice<br><br>Matthew 11:28-30, "Then Jesus said, 'Come to Me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you. Let Me teach you, because I am humble and gentle, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke fits perfectly, and the burden I give you is light.'"<br><br>We all like the Scripture above. I am so glad we can rest in Him, and He will carry the burden for us as we follow Him. So hold on to this, but also hold on to the whole counsel of God, the whole Word of God, including the Scriptures below. He has seasons for each of us. Some are sowing, some are reaping, and some may be looking for the farm.<br><br>Matthew 5:23-25, "This is how I want you to conduct yourself in these matters. If you enter your place of worship and, about to make an offering, you suddenly remember a grudge a friend has against you, abandon your offering, leave immediately, go to this friend and make things right. Then and only then, come back and work things out with God. Or say you're out on the street and an old enemy accosts you. Don't lose a minute. Make the first move; make things right with him."<br>Mark 11:25-26, "And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in Heaven may also forgive you your trespasses. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in Heaven forgive your trespasses."<br><br>Now these passages are a lot tougher. The Word says I need to forgive before I can be forgiven. Ouch! Human nature would want to lean towards "the burden is light" type of Scriptures, rather then having to actually forgive somebody. Verse 26 is conditional forgiveness from God and that is a scary thing.<br>We must always examine ourselves with the luminary light of the Holy Spirit. We must willingly and speedily forgive others, in order to apply the full measure of His grace upon our lives. The entire Word of God is true, but which part of it is most often being quoted or applied?<br><br>What are you Choosing Off of God's Buffet Table<br><br>Can you imagine going to a Buffet table with a tremendous variety of foods, and yet always selecting what tastes the best without regards to what is the best for you? This will get you out of shape and unhealthy rapidly. The same thing goes with the Word of God. If you only lean towards grace, blessings, and comfort messages from the Word of God, you will soon be unhealthy spiritually, and unable to allow God to impact your own life, let alone anyone else through you.<br><br>Why do we ignore certain truths that we need? Why do we want the apple pie of the Word, and ignore much of the meat? What we are really saying is that certain truth does not feel good, does not fit my lifestyle, and therefore, I am going to skip that Scripture. I am not going to obey that truth, because it is not meant for me at this time.<br>He is Lord of the harvest, and He is Lord of the wilderness. He is Lord over much, and He is Lord over little. HE IS LORD over ALL. God loves us enough to do whatever it takes to prepare us as ambassadors of His light to the world.<br><br>We must not continue to read the Bible with just ourselves in mind. We must read His word, and hear His counsel towards what He has chosen for us. If we continue to digest and interpret His Word selfishly, and listen to flesh-pleasing teachings, we will never mature towards Christ-likeness in our journey.<br><br>If you do not deal with sin in your life, or if you do not continue to die to self, you will limit how God can use you. Destinies have been shipwrecked because of pleasure seeking lifestyles. Opportunities have been missed, for not seeing the reality of God's Word and God's nature.<br><br>May the Lord continue His global shift. May His leaders and organizations called by His name, move towards the full counsel of the Holy Spirit. May swift repentance come to those who have proclaimed His name, but have not applied His life. We have shouted Hallelujah, while we did our thing, and Amen, while we ignored His thing.<br>Lord, cause us to die to ourselves. Bring it on; bring it upon, anything You choose. Do whatever it takes, dear Lord, to conform us into Your image, for Your glory, in Jesus name.<br><br>A believer rejoices in the good times, a disciple rejoices all the time. And all of the disciples of Christ say...Amen!<br>Robert Ricciardelli<br>Visionary Advancement Strategies<br>www.vision2advance.com<br></div>

Some times people that have suffered from over 50 years of chronic depression are able to smile and rejoice for the FIRST time in their lives!<br><br>One such case happened to us in Ecuador. As we were leaving from the Guayaquil airport after and intense time of ministry in Ecuador, some people came to bid us good-bye and among them there was a middle age toothless lady. She was smiling from ear to ear and had no front teeth at all!!! She made a considerable effort to come to the airport from a remote village and without any private transport. Her purpose for coming was to show us her Â“toothless smileÂ” as a sign of appreciation for our ministry. She told us that she had suffered from chronic depression for over 50 years and that she was healed under our ministry and could now genuinely smile and be happy for the FIRST time in 50 years!!! Needless to say we were overjoyed and tears ran down our cheeks as we received this marvelous testimony as a gift from heaven and as full reward for our time spent in Ecuador. What a privilege it is to make people SMILE and rejoice from their hearts after so many years of suffering!<br><br>In one of our meetings in Mexico, as I was asking for people to give their testimonies of healing, a young man came to answer the altar call for salvation, tears streaming down his face as The Lord had healed him from depression right there on the spot. His testimony caused around 100 people to answer the altar call for salvation on that day! The lady that brought him to our meeting was HIS OWN CHRISTIAN THERAPIST that in desperation hoped for a miracle for her own patient! What medicine could not do, The Holy Spirit did it in a split second! To Him is all the glory forever!<br><br>I am not disclaiming in this article the use of drugs and medications in certain cases. Psychiatric help can be as a Â¨life boatÂ¨ to a drowning person. Many of my loved ones have been greatly helped by medication, however if you know the root cause of depression you can live a life of freedom from this plague that is a major attack on modern day man.<br><br>My own testimony<br>It is in my weakness that YAH (The Lord) uses me in the area of depression as nearly every member of my immediate family has been plagued from depression and one even committed suicide due to it. I have suffered the deep distress of catering to people in serious, critical depressions and mental disease all my life. As I am writing these very lines my own son who is a soldier in the Israeli Army is suffering from depression that has been caused by pressure and anxiety.  As a mother I am going through a very painful  time, yet in the midst of my own pain I feel compelled to write this letter so that all those that are suffering from depression can receive HOPE and a WAY OUT!<br><br>The Factors that cause depression<br><br>A family curse that is repeated throughout the generations due to witchcraft, involvement in the occult, Kabbala and the active membership in secret lodges such as the Free Masons, Odd Fellows, etcÂ…It can also manifest as a Â“genetical chemical imbalanceÂ” (Deuteronomy 5:8, 28:28,29)<br>A root of bitterness, hidden anger and unforgiveness. (Matthew 18:34,35)<br>Fear, anxiety and stress. (Proverbs 12:25, 1 John 4:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>A serious disappointment in life such as broken promises, divorce or a broken relationship, the death of a loved one or any frustrated expectation. Â“Hope deferred makes the heart sickÂ” (Proverbs 13:12)<br>Unresolved grief. (Genesis 37:34-36)<br>Vitamin and nutritional deficiency<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 1B<br><br>TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION<br>1. Repentance: In 2 Chronicles 7:14 we have the antidote for all sickness, be it spiritual, emotional or physical,<br><br>If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.<br><br>*Humility to recognize the need<br><br>*Prayer to seek YAH and inspect our hearts<br><br>*Turn from our wicked ways of mistrust, and fear rather than faith, disobedience to GodÂ’s Commandments and any unforgiveness and hidden anger. Forgiveness is a KEY issue, forgive yourself, others and even God!<br><br>Â“For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.  Matthew 6:14,15<br><br>2. Confess your sins to someone you trust that has a holy walk with God and have that person pray for you.<br><br>Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. James 5:16<br><br>3. Taking the Word of God as medication.<br><br>Â“He sent His word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions.Â”  Psalms 107:20<br><br>Â“My son give attention to My word, incline your ear to my sayings do not let them depart from your eyes, keep them in the midst of your heart, for they are life to those who find them, and health to ALL their fleshÂ” Proverbs 4:20-22<br><br>Make for yourself a Word Prayer of at least 5-7 scripture promises, declare and meditate on those scripture promises day and night and at least 3 times a day! Record this scripture prayer and listen to it while you are driving, speaking it out loud and also silently to yourself all day long.<br><br>4. Begin to obey GodÂ’s Commandments to you with no excuses.<br><br>Â“The work of righteousness will be peace and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance foreverÂ” Isaiah 32:17<br><br>I will paraphrase from the original Hebrew:<br><br>Â“The actions of those that are made just by doing what is right in the eyes of God will be shalom, wellbeing and wholeness in every way; And those who worship Him according to His Commandments (Holy Worship!) will be quietness and absolute confidence forever.Â”<br><br>The word RIGHTEOUS from the WebsterÂ’s Unabridged Dictionary<br><br>Right in wise manner, upright, virtuous, acting in a just way, morally right, good, excellent, satisfying, pleasant, authentic, Godly, just, upright, virtuous.<br><br>Our righteousness comes from having been made right with YAH (God) through YÂ’shuaÂ’s blood sacrifice and it is to be followed by obedience to His Commandments and by a right walk with Him.  When we are made right with Elohim through YÂ’shua, in a forgiven state we then begin a personal walk with Him, a walk of loving obedience to His Commandments as written in our hearts by The Holy Spirit. (Jeremiah 31:31-33)<br><br>If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My FatherÂ’s commandments and abide in His love. John 15:10<br><br>Walking in love, obedience and forgiveness is an antidote for fear and thus fights and defeats the torment of depression.<br><br>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.  1 John 4:18<br><br>5. Total trust in Elohim-God, His Word, His Plan and His Character. Trust is the antidote against anxiety, one of the major root causes of depression in the 21st century. Trust develops through continual prayer and meditation of the Word of God.<br><br>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through the Messiah YÂ’shua. Philippians 4:6,7<br><br>This is actually a commandment- Â“Be anxious for NOTHINGÂ” and the way to achieve it is by,<br><br>Prayer, supplication and thanksgiving<br><br>Most people are anxious because they lead a prayer-less and unthankful life, so they are always revolving around themselves and their own problems.<br><br>6. Praise is an important KEY to release healing and the presence of YAH<br><br>You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have put off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness, To the end that my glory may sing praise to You and not be silent.  O Yahveh my God, I will give thanks to You forever. Psalm 30:11-12<br><br>7. Inner Healing is the key for inner soul and heart pain. Inner healing happens when we acknowledge the pain and let the Spirit of Truth and the Word of God bring light to the most hidden corners of our soul.<br><br>Then YÂ’shua said to those Jews who believed Him, Â“If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.Â”  John 8:31,32,<br><br>Â“The Spirit of Yahveh GOD is upon Me, Because Yahveh has anointed Me To preach good tidings to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives, And the opening of the prison to those who are bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of Yahveh, And the day of vengeance of our God; To comfort all who mourn, To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; That they may be called trees of righteousness, The planting of Yahveh, that He may be glorified.Â”  Isaiah 61:1-3.<br><br>Inner healing can happen when someone else prays for you or when you pray and let YAH work on your soul to bring truth and light to your deepest painful emotions.<br><br>8. Conventional treatment- In some cases there is a need to receive conventional medication and drug treatment before a person can be settled enough to allow for GodÂ’s word and spirit to work. In these cases by all means receive treatment and then apply all the rest.<br><br>9. Deliverance from demons- is an important part in defeating depression as in many cases there is demonic activity involved in depression, however depression is not only caused by evils spirits and it is important to treat spirit, soul and body!<br><br>Then His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.  Matthew 4:24<br><br>10. Nutritional supplements are very important in order to treat depression and most particularly vitamin B complex and Vitamin C, however for a more thorough list consult with a professional nutritionist and health consultant. There are also some herbs that can be helpful such as St. JohnÂ’s Wort, Chamomille, Valerian Root, etcÂ…It is also important to change your nutritional habits to healthy habits decreasing white sugar, processed foods, chemicals such as nitrates and MSG.<br><br>For thus says Yahveh GOD, the Holy One of Israel: Â“ In returning and rest you shall be saved; In quietness and confidence shall be your strength.Â” Isaiah 30:15A<br><br>On the next issue we will talk about fear and anxiety as a root cause of depression, meanwhile have a Shabbat Shalom, full of wellbeing and DO NOT GIVE UP!

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>An Audience of One </strong><br><br>John 21:22<br>Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow Me."<br><br>For several weeks I awoke with heaviness over me. It seemed it did not matter how much I prayed or how much I read the Scriptures. Finally, one night I was reading a book by Os Guinness that described the conversation between Jesus and Peter. God had just commissioned Peter in the famous "Peter, do you love Me" passage of Scripture. This was after Jesus' resurrection. Jesus was calling Peter to feed His sheep, and He informed Peter of the death he would encounter for following Him. But Peter had a question. He wondered what was going to happen to John. Would John have the same trials, the same responsibility, as Peter? Jesus quickly retorted to Peter, "What is that to you?"<br><br>That night I realized I was guilty of envy. I had several friends who were now "making it" in business. I began to compare where I was in life. It brought me into a state of depression. Once I realized this, I asked the Lord to forgive me. I knew in my head I was to have only one audience-the audience of One. That knowledge needed to get to my heart. I also knew I was experiencing spiritual warfare in the area of unbelief.<br><br>The next morning I awoke, and as I normally do, I checked my e-mail to see what the devotional was for that day that is sent to other businesspeople. Although I write the devotional myself, I read it because I get letters from readers regarding the devotionals. To my shock, the devotional was on this same passage of Scripture. It talked about the sin of envy. I was amused by God's sense of humor, as He convicted me with my own devotional message. But that was not the end of it.<br><br>That day I went to lunch with a friend. After lunch I got into my car. I turned on the radio and Os Guinness, the author of the same book I was reading the night before, was being interviewed. They were talking about the discourse between Jesus and Peter and the sin of envy! I was floored! "Okay, God, I get the message!"<br><br>The Holy Spirit has an uncanny ability to communicate to us. The Lord wanted me to know that I am not to worry about someone else. God has called us to a unique life that may look totally different from anyone else's life. Once we begin to compare ourselves to others, we begin to live for others and ourselves.<br><br>There is only one audience we should be living for-the audience of One. Ask the Lord today if you are living solely for His pleasure.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DEFEATING DEPRESSION PART 2<br>Depression- from WebsterÂ’s New Unabridged Dictionary<br>Low spirits, gloominess, dejection, sadness, a decrease in force, activity, amount, and a decrease in functional activity. An emotional condition either normal or pathological characterized by discouragement, a feeling of inadequacy, the act of humbling abasement as a depression of pride. Abasement, reduction, sinking, fall, humiliation, dejection, melancholy<br><br>FEAR AND DEPRESSION<br>Â“For God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mindÂ” 2 Timothy 1:7<br>Shabbat Shalom dearly beloved:<br>As I write this series on Defeating Depression, I am basing my approach on the assumption that Elohim-God is the Creator of Man and therefore His Word has the final say about His creation. The Bible or the Word of God as manifested through The Hebrew Holy Scriptures known as TANACH or by some as the Â“Old CovenantÂ” and through The Apostolic Writings or also called the New Covenant, is the ManufacturerÂ’s Manual of Instruction. It contains all the information for manÂ’s right functioning and wellbeing. In the same way that if we violate the instructions given in the manual of any expensive machine, we could cause the malfunctioning of that machine and eventually its total breakdown and loss, if we violate GodÂ’s instructions it can cause the total breakdown of Man. Man is a much more intricate creation than man made cars and other machines. Man is a unique creation and ONLY the Creator knows all about the Crown of His Creation- ADAM. Fortunately for us He left us the manual of instruction- The Bible.<br><br>Â“He sent His word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions.Â”  Psalms 107:20<br><br>I am fully aware that conventional PsychiatryÂ’s approach is different than mine. Psychiatry sees as the root cause of most mental illness a factor called Â“chemical imbalanceÂ”. I see Â“chemical imbalanceÂ” not as root cause per se but as an outcome of a deeper root cause. Psychiatry would prescribe medication to solve the situation and I see medication as a possible Â“life boatÂ” when people do not respond to reason, prayer and spiritual treatment. But even so it needs to be followed by a retraining of the mind that would prevent such occurrences in the future. I see a mind transformation as the KEY for most if not all mental diseases.<br>And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fear and all its derivatives such as stress and anxiety are one of the major causes for depression. </strong><br><br>Â“Anxiety in the heart of man causes depression, but a good word makes it gladÂ” Proverbs 12:25<br><br>Fear and all its derivatives causes torment,<br>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love. 1 John 4:18<br><br><strong>What is fear? </strong><br>1.      Fear is a demonic spirit that makes people crazy- This is a very tormenting fear based upon tormenting lies inspired by spirits of darkness that plague the mind with Â“scary scenariosÂ”. This demonic spirit can come in through watching horror movies, involvement in witchcraft activities and especially traumas.<br>2.      Fear is also a Â“fight or flightÂ” reflex when in danger- this is a normal or even a Â“healthy fearÂ” that can keep you from trouble, for example it will make you function quickly if a car is about to run you over and thus save your life!<br>3.      The healthy Â“fight or flightÂ” reaction activates the adrenal gland to secrete a large quantity of adrenalin and in some cases due to trauma, it does not Â“shut offÂ” and it keeps working over time, thus causing terrible distress and a constant state of ANXIETY. Some times it is triggered by Â“push buttonsÂ” related to the trauma in completely unrelated situations. For example a person that suffered financial collapse might become anxious in subsequent years whenever there is even a minor financial challenge that poses no real danger.<br>4.      Fear is also an emotion that can be caused by a real situation or by demonic spirits. Demonic spirits can work through trauma and past experience in order to create a vicious circle of negative thoughts. The more that the person thinks negatively, the more that the fear and the anxiety grow, thus affecting the chemical balance of the brain and causing a psychiatric disorder termed Â“PsychosisÂ” which is characterized by terrible dread and by taking things out of proportion, imagining some devastating scenarios that do not exist or even feeling physical discomforts with no evidence of disease at all. Depression can very often be accompanied with symptoms of Psychosis<br>5.      The Fear of God is the healthy spirit, emotion and attitude that heals people from all other unhealthy fears.  Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear Yahveh and depart from evil. It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones.  Proverbs 3:7,8, The fear of Yahveh leads to life, And he who has it will abide in satisfaction; He will not be visited with evil. Proverbs 19:23<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>HOW TO TREAT DEPRESSION CAUSED BY FEAR? </strong><br><br>In order to treat depression that is caused by fear, stress and anxiety there is a need to treat both the external symptoms of anxiety and dread and the root cause of the fear. In many cases people develop a harmful fear and anxiety because they are worried about their daily sustenance-what shall we eat? What shall we wear? How will we pay? What will my future be?<br>YÂ’shua warned us about that in Matthew 6:25-34  Â“Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?  Â“So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?  Â“Therefore do not worry, saying, Â‘What shall we eat?Â’ or Â‘What shall we drink?Â’ or Â‘What shall we wear?Â’ For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.<br>So the best antidote against anxiety is faith and trust in GodÂ’s provision, His perfect plan for our future and of course obedience to God and to His commandments- Â“Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness (His right way of doing things) and all these things shall be added unto you.Â”<br>Miraculous healings of depression and all mental healing still needs to be followed by a complete program for mind Transformation!<br>Mind Transformation begins with salvation:<br><br>PLEASE PRAY THE FOLLOWING PRAYER<br>Dear Father in Heaven, I choose to put all my trust in You and in Your Word and Plan for me. Thank you for sending your Son YÂ’shua the Messiah to take my place as a sinner. Thank you YÂ’shua for dying for me that I may live! I believe in you and that you rose from the dead on the 3rd day, and I invite you to be my Master, Savior and Healer, please forgive me of all my disobedience and rebellion and teach me to walk with you. Thank you for making me free and whole to serve you all the days of my life. Amen<br>Congratulations! This is the first step to come out of depression, put your trust in GodÂ’s provision of salvation for you, salvation includes healing and deliverance from depression, it is all Â“in the packageÂ”!<br><br>continued...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Practical Steps to Follow:<br>1. Build yourself up in faith-Since faith and trust in GodÂ’s provision is essential in order to maintain a healthy emotional life it is necessary to build yourself up in faith.<br>So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God        Romans 10:17<br>It is necessary that you constantly hear the Word, which is the truth about GodÂ’s faithfulness to provide for you in every way. Begin with making for yourself Â“Word PrayersÂ” of at least 5-7 scriptures that talk about YAHÂ’S (GodÂ’s) unfailing provision for your situation. Read, meditate, melodize, think and declare those scriptures day and night until you believe them. You will experience anxiety leaving you and your faith will be built up! If you suffer from depression due to the fear of death or of sickness, then make sure that you have given your life to God through YÂ’shua and begin to meditate on scriptures concerning healing and/or eternal life.<br>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. Joshua 1:8<br>Since during depression your mind goes in vicious circles of negative thoughts, then changing the meditation of your mind will eventually turn around your situation!<br><br>Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthyÂ—meditate on these things. Philippians 4:8<br>2. Another way of building up faith is by prayer,<br>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through YÂ’shua the Messiah.  Philippians 4:6-7<br>This kind of prayer has the element of,<br>Petition b) Supplication c) Thanksgiving<br>When you have Â“prayed throughÂ” you will experience a great relief and His peace, shalom, wellbeing will flood your soul! The best way to make a petition prayer is by quoting His word and promises to Him and then pleading with Him to manifest His promises (that apply to your situation) in your life, finishing with thanksgiving and praise for His Grace and Mercy! Remember, He does not Â‘oweÂ” us anything but He is committed to keep His word. We are in constant need of His mercy.<br>This kind of prayer should be prayed as often as you feel anxiety creeping back, after you have Â“prayed throughÂ” leave everything in YAHÂ’S (GodÂ’s) able hands!<br>3. Prayer in Tongues or in the Spirit.<br>But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit Jude 20<br>This is one of the main reasons of why it is essential to receive the Baptism in The Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues, because it builds us up in our most holy faith. This is a SURE ANTIDOTE against depression!<br>4. Repentance from any selfishness, self-centeredness and any known sin in your life. Remember that He said that if you put Him and His Kingdom FIRST everything else that you need will be added unto you with no stress, nor striving.<br>5. Contentment and thankfulness,<br>Now godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content. 1 Timothy 6:6-8<br>Selfish ambition, covetousness and jealousy can cause terrible distress and unnecessary stress to run after things because Â“others have themÂ”. Of course the end result of this would be depression. A life of praise to YAH (God) and thanksgiving is essential for mental health.<br>6. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE- Since fear is the OPPOSITE of LOVE and GOD IS LOVE, your choice to love God and others, (including your enemies!) at all times will keep you emotionally healthy all of your life!<br>And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him. Â“So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his trespasses.Â” Matthew 18:34,35<br>A lot of the fears and torments are connected with bitterness and unforgiveness. Forgive EVERYONE at ALL TIMES and for EVERY REASON and you will have a very healthy soul! When we forgive, we humble ourselves to be like YÂ’shua who forgave us when we did not deserve it. Unforgiveness is a form of pride and He said that He resists the proud,<br>But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: Â“ God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.Â” James 4:6<br>When you walk in forgiveness you walk in love and when you walk in love, fear flees and so does depression!<br>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love. 1 John 4:18<br>7. Vitamins and nutrition: Fear and stress cause the body to be depleted of vital nutrients such as vitamin B, vitamin C and Calcium. I strongly suggest taking a higher quantity of those during stressful times and to improve you nutrition with healthy foods, again ask your nutrition expert about these.<br>WHEN FEAR IS CAUSED DUE TO DEMON SPIRITS<br>Though all unhealthy fears are connected with the operation of evil spirits as well as the coping with some realistic problems, there are some situations of fear that are plainly demonic, such as fears caused due to the watching of horror movies and/or due to idolatry or witchcraft activities such as Ouija board sÃ©ances, the contacting of the dead and other spirits of deceased people and of course all satanic worship. In these cases it is imperative that you go through a proper prayer of DELIVERANCE from demons by a qualified and trusted minister.<br><br>When a person is an unbeliever or is in a non receptive state, the only treatment available against this kind of depression will be psychiatric treatment with some tranquilizing drugs, and even anti-psychotic dugs, accompanied with psychological treatment. As I said in my previous issue, I do not discard this kind of treatment, when it is needed and nothing else works. This is a necessary Â“life boatÂ” in some instances. However I believe that most of the fear related depressions can be overcome with the spiritual instructions given in this chapter.<br>In the next issue, we will talk about Depression due to Lies that cause soul pain.<br><br>In order to finish I would like to bless you with the prayer of 3 John 2,<br>Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.<br>In YÂ’shuaÂ’s Love that casts out ALL fear!<br>We care for you!<br>Bishop Dominiquae and Rabbi Baruch Bierman<br>Your friends in Israel<br>Â© Bishop Dr Dominiquae Bierman 2006  - Permission is granted (and we encourage you) to distribute these writings.

            <div class='col-md body'>Rick Joyner: "THE NATION OF ISRAEL WILL AWAKEN TO ITS PURPOSE AND ITS MESSIAH"<br><br>Coming Out of Deep Darkness<br>Even a cursory look at church history, reveals many things that were not only contrary to the teachings and nature of Christ, but were diabolical in nature. Today the church tends to deal mostly with matters of insensitivity, but in times past, the issues were how to deal with the brutal and inhuman cruelty being inflicted on literally millions in the name of Christ. Certainly, progress has been made out of the deep darkness which the church had fallen into. So where are we now? What's next?<br><br>This terrible time of darkness was clearly prophesied in Scripture, and it was allowed for a reason. In the same way that the nation of Israel failed in its covenant relationship with the Lord and was scattered over many nations, the church failed also, and was likewise scattered into thousands of denominations. Just as Israel has been regathering to its inheritance in the natural, there is a corresponding regathering of the church to its spiritual inheritance. As we are told in I Corinthians 15:46, "However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual." What is taking place in the natural is a forerunner and prophecy of what is about to take place in the spiritual realm.<br><br>The Jew has always been a prophecy of the condition of the nations. Just as Israel has been regathering to its promised land, but has no peace within or without, and is still groping for its purpose, the church is likewise in a similar place. The nation of Israel will awaken to its purpose and its Messiah. When it does, we can expect the church to likewise awaken to its purpose in these times, which is linked to Israel's purpose in the natural.<br><br>The Seed of Abraham will Join in Purpose<br>The spiritual seed of Abraham--those who are grafted into the vine by their faith, and the natural seed of Abraham, the Jew according to the flesh--will join in purpose. When they do, it will open a bridge between the Heavenly realm and earthly, leading to the restoration of all things lost by the Fall. Even death will ultimately be destroyed.<br><br>There was a time of about 2,000 years in which the Lord worked almost exclusively through the Jews to lay the foundation of His plan for the redemption and restoration of the earth. Now there has likewise been a time of about 2,000 years, the "times of the Gentiles" in which He has worked almost exclusively through the Gentiles.<br>Contrary to what many believe, what we are about to enter into is not another time of the Jews, but a time of the Jews and Gentiles being joined together in purpose. We will witness the Jew--the natural seed of Abraham, and the church--the spiritual seed of Abraham, becoming the "one new man" Paul wrote about in Ephesians 2:15. When these two are joined, it will open the gate between the Heavens and the earth, and for the Kingdom of God to be established on the earth.<br><br>Because of the terrible history that both Israel and the church has suffered (and since the greatest threat to the existence of the Jewish people came from the institutional church or "Christian nations" ), it will take a great miracle to cross the gulf between Israel and the church. This is a reflection of the similar gulf between God and mankind which seems to be greater than ever. How will these be bridged?<br><br>Just as all of Israel's problems are really beyond human remedy and will take a miracle from God to solve, so are the church's and the world's problems. The great troubles at the end of this age are the result of mankind trying to run this world without God, a lesson that will finally and profoundly be learned. However, God will resolve the entire mess that we have made of things.<br><br>continued....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prepare the Way for His Return<br>In the meantime, between now and these great miracles that will surely come, the greatest of all being the return of the Son of God Himself, it is our calling to help prepare the way for His return. How do we do this? In the prophecy that was quoted from Isaiah in relation to John the Baptist, who prepared the way for Him the first time He came, the same principle applies for how we are to prepare the way for His return:<br><br>"A voice is calling, 'Clear the way for the Lord in the wilderness; make smooth in the desert a highway for our God.'"<br><br>"Let every valley be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; and let the rough ground become a plain, and the rugged terrain a broad valley."<br><br>"Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all flesh will see it together; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken" (Isaiah 40:3-5).<br><br>Here we see that a highway must be prepared for the Lord in the wilderness, "Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed." So building this highway is first. How do we do this?<br><br>If you have ever been part of a crew building a highway, you know that this is some of the most difficult of all construction work. As this text declares, it requires mountains and hills being brought down, and valleys being built up. It is slow, tedious, and messy, as anyone who has lived near the building of a highway can surely attest. There are times when it is easier and faster than at other times, but it can be grueling work for days, weeks, or even months to make the smallest amount of progress, and it is fraught with constant danger.<br><br>Preparing the Way Can Be a Thankless Task<br>After extraordinary labors, when the highway is finished, people will drive on it, and zip through at 70 mph in the same place where progress was at times measured in inches a day. And very few of those people who go merrily along the highway (which was so much labor to accomplish), will ever think for even a moment about those who built it, much less ever thank them. Few who build highways are celebrated, but they have made the progress of the modern world possible, both in the spiritual and natural.<br><br>In this same way, the job of preparing the way for the Lord is hard, being done through the wilderness, the most inhospitable territory where the progress is usually slow and difficult. Few will thank us for what we are doing, and some will curse us for the mess we are making, especially if it brings them any inconvenience. Few who see the present mess have the vision to see how much better it will be when the highway is finished. It is quite a thankless task.<br><br>In seeking to see authentic, Biblical, prophetic ministry restored to the church, our team at MorningStar has experienced some of this. It has been hard work, with at times seemingly very little progress. Most who see us working, just remark about the mess we are making, with very little encouragement coming even from those who will ultimately benefit from what we are doing. We know also there will be very little thanks when it is finished, at least from people, but to hear the words "Well done, good and faithful servant" (Matthew 25:21) from the King, will be worth it. We are doing it for the church, which may have little appreciation for it now, but more than this, we are doing it for Him, and are very thankful just to have a job in His service.<br><br>Even so, for those who labored for so long and hard to watch others walk on the path they have cut with such difficulty, just taking off, may be hard. However, that is the reason for building a highway--to make it much easier and faster for those who come behind us. If we have been successful, others will be able to go as far as we have much faster, easier, and safer. In fact, that is what church history has been.<br><br>Past Generations Have Made the Way For Us<br>The great souls in history took ground that future generations could walk over much easier, faster, and safer. A good example is Count Zinzendorf and the Moravians, who took a generation to establish the principles of modern missions. They not only cut a path which others could follow, but at times, they wandered up box canyons and had to turn around, seemingly losing a lot of time and resources with their mistakes. However, even those diversions saved future generations from having to make the same ones. They prepared a highway and a good map to go with it.<br><br>We only stand where we are today because others fought through the forests and underbrush, cut down mountains and hills, and built up the low places--spiritual swamps that were full of dangers and disease. They left us a wonderful highway, so we could easily make it this far with relatively little effort. Let us resolve to carry this highway as far as we can in our own generation, making it much easier for others to make it as far as we have, and then go farther.<br><br>Build A Highway<br>There will be a generation who actually finishes the job. It could even be ours. We may go around the next turn, cut through the next acre of underbrush, and come face to face with His glory. Even if we are not the one who finishes the job, let us do our part as well as it can be done. The way we prepare the way for the Lord and His Kingdom to come to the earth, so that His will be done here just as it is in Heaven, is to build a highway.<br><br>If we have been wise in raising up those with true prophetic gifts, maybe we can send scouts ahead so that they can map out the territory well enough, so we do not go up any more box canyons. Maybe they can see easier paths, which to us would look like diversions from a straight line, but in fact, will make our progress toward the goal much easier, faster, or safer.<br><br>If the highway becomes more clear, maybe others who are now all cutting their own individual paths in various directions, will join together, making the progress of our generation much greater. Instead of doing so much work that will not really be used (cutting down a lot of underbrush destined to grow right back because no one is going to follow on that path), wouldn't it be better to see our efforts actually result in a useful highway which leads to the Kingdom?<br>There is a highway being built. We should all want to be sure that we are a part of building the one which really prepares the way for the King.<br><br>Rick Joyner<br>MorningStar Ministries<br><a href="http://www.morningstarministries.org" rel="nofollow">www.morningstarministries.org  </a></div>

Will you walk in the fear of false prophets and kings or will you follow His perfect way though the cost is great?

            <div class='col-md body'>On being Thoughtful<br>by Todd Elder<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Being a thoughtful person is becoming a lost art in todays society. Yet this is what believers are called to be. We are not supposed to comform to society's standard. Instead, we should be able to distinguish what is right from wrong, good from evil, and helpful from selfish.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The American Heritage Dictionary defines thoughtful as 'occupied with thought, well thought out and well considered, showing regard for others, and considerate'. 'Thought out' and 'considerate' suggest that we have taken the time not only to know the intended effects of our actions but the side effects as well. 'Considerate' and 'showing regard' means we are taking another persons desires, feelings, or care into account when we weigh the pros and cons of what we are thinking of doing. This is so important and so commonly overlooked anymore.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The problem<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In today's world it is far too easy to just be busy and spend our life without actually thinking about what it is we are doing. We are actually trained to do this all through the school system and through our jobs ... they teach us to take in information and spit it back out in predetermined formats and to just follow orders. We are almost like machines just following the program that we have been given. Very few of us are actually trained to think for ourselves or to be creative and imaginative or to do things differently. Even peer pressure causes people to do what is considered normal in society. As believers in YHVH and as followers of Messiah we are called to do more than this. We are to pay attention not only to what we are doing, but to what is going on around us so that we can help others as it is needed.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>We have become lax to the point that we can just sit and do what the world is doing and not even notice. We do not consider the consequences of our actions either to ourselves, to others, physically, and especially spiritually. Our society does not bring us up in an environment where the punishment fits the crime ... it is liberal and allows many things to go unpunished or simply let go with a warning which has brought about a bunch of lawlessness, careless attitudes, rudeness, and worse. We do not learn to take responsibility for our actions. We do not bother to see how our actions affect others.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In Fellowship<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It should be obvious to us, through the Scriptures and through the Messiah's messages that we are to care for one another. In the law, there are many provisions for the poor, the widow, the orphan, for those in debt, or in other situations. In Messiah's teachings we are given instruction on how to care for another and to not be selfish. Those who help are people who get blessed and whose prayers are heard.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In the epistles, it is written how the body of Messiah is one and that if one part of the body hurts all hurt. In fellowship we are to help each other out. It is not enough to simply attend a group and sit there taking in teaching and then do nothing in return for the group as a whole nor for the individuals in the group. We are called to be attentive to needs. Not all the work is done in a congregational setting ... in fact most of the work probably falls outside the congregation. People have difficulties in their lives for which they would appreciate assistance, some people need to talk or receive counsel, some are in need of money, and others are in need of prayer. Are we actively looking for these things? There are many different gifts of the Spirit and they are given to a person so that they can be used. Most of the gifts are for edification of others and not to be used for oneself.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Our actions in a place of worship are particularly meaningful ... when we are before the Almighty and around other brethren what are we doing? Are we disruptive and causing commotion? Do we break into conversations because we are not patient? Do we cause unneccesary problems by giving unasked for advice and expecting people to follow it? If we approach a person, we should take the moment of time to check and see what they are doing, whether they need to be alone a moment, or if they are uncomfortable with what is being done. This should be taken into consideration.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Society<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>How we act in our life influences others ... wether it is our own family, our friends, our society, even our world in both its population and its resources. Have we considered the impact we are having on any of these levels? What we do, what we wear, how we speak, the jobs we take, the hobbies we participate in ... all these things are important to consider.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>For most of us, we probably do a better job of caring when it comes to our families than we do with other people. We care about them more and are more considerate because of this. Yet this is a poor standard ... we should be more considerate of everybody (believer and non-believer alike) and do even better with family and brethren. We are to be a light in this world and one of the best ways to shine is to go out and help someone.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In society in general, at least here in the United States, we should realize that we represent the Almighty and the actions of a believer do stick out ... we are watched. If we go along with things like magic, whether it is Harry Potter or simply Walt Disney's magic kingdom, then we are giving a message that these things are okay when in reality all types of magic are an abomination to YHVH. This society promotes, sex, drugs, alcohol, foul language, and all types of physical pleasure and puts this type of advertising on everything from sports equipment, through clothing, and even into childrens toys. We do not make a good witness to society nor a good example for other brethren when we participate in or promote such things through the use of these products. Again, the world does notice when someone does things a little differently.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Thoughtfulness<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>What does it mean to be thoughtful? It simply means we make a conscious decision in regards to the things we do for ourselves or for others. It means we pay attention to what is going on around us. It means that if we have to go out of our way to do something scripturally or to help someone ... that we go out of our way to do it. It means taking responsibility for our actions and therefore thinking things through before acting or reacting.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>With practice, we learn that most of the time helping another person only takes but a moment. We learn that stepping out and offering to help is not difficult or complicated and is usually welcomed quite warmly. As we gain experience, we start gaining a glimpse into the kind of compassion Yahshua had for both individuals and for mankind. Over time, we learn the joys, benefits, and blessings of following the Scriptural guidelines to help others because it promotes our own life as well.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In short, when we learn to be thoughtful, we begin to grow as individuals in the ways of the One Most High. Our world becomes a better place. More people have less problems because we take care of each other rather than being selfishly motivated.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Desires of Your Heart<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>Â“Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart.Â”<br>Psalm 37:4 NIV<br><br>I recently met a twenty-year-old, just discharged from the military, and pondering his future. He bore a square jaw, a forearm tattoo, and a common question. He didnÂ’t know what to do with the rest of his life. As we shared a flight, he told me about his uncle, a New England priest. Â“What a great man,Â” the ex-soldier sighed. Â“He helps kids and feeds the hungry. IÂ’d love to make a difference like that.Â”<br><br>So I asked him the question of this chapter. Â“What were some occasions when you did something you love to do and did it quite well?Â”<br><br>He dismissed me at first. Â“Aw, what I love to do is stupid.Â”<br><br>Â“Try me,Â” I invited.<br><br>Â“Well, I love to rebuild stuff.Â”<br><br>Â“What do you mean?Â”<br><br>He spoke of an old coffee table he had found in a garage. Seeing its potential, he shaved off the paint, fixed the broken legs, and restored it. With great pride, he presented it to his mom.<br><br>Â“Tell me another time,Â” I prompted.<br><br>Â“This one is really dumb,Â” he discounted. Â“But when I worked at a butcher shop, I used to find meat on the bones others threw out. My boss loved me! I could find several pounds of product just by giving the bone a second try.Â”<br><br>As the plane was nosing down, I tested a possibility with him. Â“You love to salvage stuff. You salvage furniture, salvage meat. God gave you the ability to find a treasure in someone elseÂ’s trash.Â”<br><br>My idea surprised him. Â“God? God did that?Â”<br><br>Â“Yes, God. Your ability to restore a table is every bit as holy as your uncleÂ’s ability to restore a life.Â” You would have thought heÂ’d just been handed a newborn baby. As my words sank in, the tough soldier teared up.<br><br>See your desires as gifts to heed rather than longings to suppress, and youÂ’ll feel the same joy.<br><br>Reflect on your life.

Just Begin!<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>What difference will my work make?<br><br>GodÂ’s answer: Â“Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work beginÂ” (Zech. 4:10).<br><br>Begin. Just Begin! What seems small to you might be huge to someone else. Just ask Bohn Fawkes. During World War II, he piloted a B-17. On one mission he sustained flak from Nazi antiaircraft guns. Even though his gas tanks were hit, the plane did not explode, and Fawkes was able to land the plane.<br><br>On the morning following the raid, Fawkes asked his crew chief for the German shell. He wanted to keep a souvenir of his incredible good fortune. The crew chief explained that not just one but eleven shells had been found in the gas tanks, none of which exploded.<br><br>Technicians opened the missiles and found them void of explosive charge. They were clean and harmless and with one exception, empty. The exception contained a carefully rolled piece of paper. On it a message had been scrawled in the Czech language. Translated, the note read: Â“This is all we can do for you now.Â”<br><br>A courageous assembly-line worker was disarming bombs and scribbled the note. He couldnÂ’t end the war, but he could save one plane. He couldnÂ’t do everything, but he could do something. So he did it.<br><br>God does big things with small deeds.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Receiving Only From God<br>By Os Hillman<br><br>Genesis 14:24<br>I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me-to Aner, Eshcol and Mamre. Let them have their share.<br><br>Abraham's nephew was a man named Lot. Lot was part of Abraham's household until the land on which they fed their flocks could no longer support their growing families and herds. Abraham allowed Lot to choose the land where he wanted to live. Lot chose the land of Sodom.<br><br>Afterwards, Sodom was invaded by four kings, and Lot's family and goods were taken into captivity. When Abraham learned of this, he immediately gathered his best fighting men and pursued the armies to free Lot and his family. He was successful in freeing Lot's family and the families of Sodom. The king of Sodom was grateful to Abraham for what he did and wanted him to keep the goods he recovered. Abraham had made a decision before the battle that he would only keep what he recovered for his nephew Lot, and goods as payment for the men who fought.<br><br>Abraham understood the principle of receiving from God. He was a man with great integrity in God. He did not want to be known as someone who became wealthy because of the kindness of a wicked king. He wanted others to know that whatever prosperity he gained was a result of the blessing from God's hand alone. Abraham understood an important principle of receiving from God.<br><br>Jesus also modeled this principle by receiving only what His Father wanted Him to receive. God's will for Jesus was to receive based on a carpenter's wage even though He was the God of the universe who had access to all things. Imagine the discipline Jesus had to have, knowing what He could have had. He upheld His own financial integrity in God.<br><br>Each of us must discern what comes from the hand of God rather than the hand of man. As businesspeople, there are situations that allow us to manipulate, sweat, and toil our way to profit. There is also profit as a result of hard work done in obedience to our calling to the marketplace. Knowing the difference in these two concepts is a sign of integrity before God. Only God receives glory when we receive what God wants us to receive. Are you receiving the fruit of your labor in God? Ask God to show you the difference of these two concepts for your own life.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wisdom from Psalms<br>by Dan R. Dick<br><br>Psalm 101:2<br>I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.<br><br>Gwen couldn't help remembering how her grandmother used to tell her to, "Act like a perfect little lady." She had hated to have her grandmother constantly nagging at her to sit properly, speak properly, walk, chew, and sneeze properly. However, the lessons she had been taught had stayed with her, and they had helped her many times. She had gotten the job at the gallery because they had been impressed by her manner and poise. Perhaps she wasn't a "perfect little lady," but she made a good showing, nonetheless.<br>Our behavior is important. People see us in many situations at many different times, and the way we act can be a powerful witness to the power of Christ in our lives. Christ calls us to a perfection that we cannot achieve on our own. Rely upon the Lord and He will give you the capacity to live an upright, holy, and pleasing life.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Lord, You are the author of perfection. You have created me to be an example of Your image, a light of the world. Fill me with the brilliance of Your holy light, that I might shine forth in beauty and power. Amen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Created for His Good Pleasure<br>By Os Hillman<br><br>Ephesians 2:10<br>For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.<br><br>Eric Liddell was an Olympic runner from Britain who won a gold medal in the 1924 Paris Olympics. He was a man who had a deep commitment to the Lord and had future plans of being a missionary. In the meantime, he knew God had given him a special gift to run, and he often said, "I feel God's pleasure when I run."<br><br>He spent years training for the Olympics. He passed each hurdle and qualified for the Olympics. Finally, the day came for him to run in the games that were held in Italy. There was only one problem. One of his running events was held on Sunday. Liddell refused to run on Sunday, believing it dishonored the Lord's Sabbath. He held to his convictions and brought great persecution on himself. He made a decision that even if it meant losing his opportunity to compete, he would not run. God's laws were greater than man's applause. Just when the circumstances seemed hopeless, another situation arose that allowed Little to run on a different day.<br><br>So often this is the case in the spiritual realm. God tests our hearts to see if we will remain faithful to Him at the cost of something important to us. Once He knows where our loyalty lies, He opens a new door that meets the desires of our hearts.<br><br>God takes pleasure in seeing His creation used for His glory. Liddell understood why he was made to run; he used his gift of running to bring pleasure to his Creator. Later, Eric Liddell went on to serve God on the mission field.<br><br>Does your life work bring pleasure to the Lord? Do you understand that God instilled certain gifts and talents in you so that He might find pleasure in His creation of you? Take pleasure in the gifts God has given to you this day. And let His glory shine through you.<br><br></div>

An emotional condition either normal or pathological characterized by discouragement, a feeling of inadequacy, the act of humbling abasement as a depression of pride. Abasement, reduction, sinking, fall, humiliation, dejection, melancholy.<br><br>Freedom from Pain, Lies and Depression<br><br>Â“YÂ’shua spoke to the Jews who had believed him. Â“If you obey my teaching,Â” he said, Â“you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth. And the truth will set you free.Â” John 8: 31-32<br><br>Shabbat Shalom dearly beloved:<br><br><strong>MY TESTIMONY</strong><br><br>The more that I write about the subject of DEPRESSION, the more people that are Â“coming out of hidingÂ”. It is quite amazing to find out how many in the Body of YÂ’shua are suffering from depression and are afraid of letting anyone know for fear of being judged by others. Many of those that suffer greatly are actually pastors and leaders and those are even more afraid and ashamed to let others know, so they suffer in secret and some times even come to the verge of suicide! I fully understand, one time I suffered from depression for an entire year and hid it so well that even my husband didnÂ’t know. I would cry myself to sleep every night and only me and YÂ’shua knew of my loneliness and pain. Of course I had real good reasons for my depression, my daughter had been sick for three solid years, coming and going from hospitals and the last report of the doctor was Â‘ that there was no hopeÂ’. Everyone would agree with me that this was enough cause for depression and sadness, however I was regarded as so strong and full of faith by all that no one doubted my ability to stand under all pressure! However I was falling apart and no one knew it! Fortunately for me, I have a really good relationship with  YÂ’shua and so I decided to retreat myself in my pastoral office for three days and three nights in order to find an answer from Him. The contents of this chapter are the result of my three day prayer retreat from the 9-11 of November of 2001. What The Holy Spirit showed me during those three critical days has changed my life, my ministry and my daughter who is alive and well FOREVER! My prayer is that it will also change yours!<br><br><strong>What hurts you, Dominiquae?</strong><br><br>When I entered the three day retreat as I mentioned above, I sat before YAH (God) unable to do anything, let alone really pray! I just sat there and He asked me the question that has changed my life! Â“What hurts you, Dominiquae?Â” This question took me by surprise since I was not there to talk about my pain, but rather to get an answer of why was my daughter not healed if I had been solidly believing, never faltered in declaring His Word and was, in my eyes, obeying His will and serving Him? It did not make any sense to me to be Â‘punishedÂ’ with loosing my daughter to this terrible illness! However God decided not to answer my question but rather ask me one, about my condition, about my pain! No one has asked me that question before, everyone was praying for Adi and for her situation and pain but not for mine. It took me a few seconds to react to this surprising question! But when I did, boy I did!!! Â“My motherhood is hurting me Lord!Â” to which He answered, Â“write it all down, write all your pain, all your feelings down and do not try to be Â‘prim and properÂ’, write from your guts even if itÂ’s ugly!Â”<br><br>Uuhhh, I am not used to this, I only speak faith, who knows what will come out of my heart? This was scary, nevertheless I obeyed my Master and Healer and I wrote. I must have written a scroll or a small book, but I do not remember as I was crying too hard as I was writing, I was crying and screaming! Once it was all written, I felt an amazing peace, like 1000 tons had fallen off my chest, I could breathe again. But I was peacefully sad as I detected that on these pages I had written what I TRULY felt about me, my daughter and God and it was not pretty! Neither did it line up with His Word, in other words in spite of my courageous faith stand I had believed many lies and thus was in tremendous emotional pain!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DEFEATING DEPRESSION PART3 PartA</strong><br><br><strong>Emotional Pain </strong><br><br>Â“My soul melts from heaviness, strengthen me according to your WordÂ”  Psalms 119:28<br><br>What is emotional pain? I would say that it is the hurt or pain that we feel inside because of what we believe about ourselves or about some traumatic situations that have happened in life. For the most part our emotional pain lingers and becomes DEPRESSION and other forms of mental illness due to our erroneous interpretation of traumas or hard circumstances. In other words IF we would get the true interpretation, then pain would leave and with it depression also!<br><br>DENIAL is a Â‘safety mechanismÂ’ that its purpose is to keep the pain Â“hiddenÂ” pretending that it does not exist.<br><br>However this works for a while allowing the victim of that traumatic pain to live a border line bearable life, however all of a sudden like in a pressure cooker, pressure builds up and it begins to want to come out and erupt! It normally erupts in the form of depression, mental breakdown, psychosis etcÂ…Most people live in one or another level of denial. What The Holy Spirit did with me during my life changing retreat was to challenge my denial by asking me the surprising question, Â“what hurts you?Â”, and then instructing me to Â“write it downÂ” honestly. In other words, He had me blowing off my built up steam in the security of His Loving and Accepting Presence! Anyone that would take time off in His Presence and do the exact same things will get the exact same results!  You will feel like tons of pressure have fallen off you and you will detect that you have been believing some lies that are contrary to His Word and Will for you! The good news is that nothing is hidden from Him, so though this will be Â‘newsÂ’ for you, itÂ’s OLD HISTORY for Him, He knows you inside out!<br><br>Â“O Yahveh, you has searched me, and known me .You know my down sitting and my uprising, you understand my thought afar off. You compass my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.Â” Psalms 139:1-3<br><br>If you can believe this, then you will have the courage to be what I call Â“brutally honestÂ” when you express your pain on paper!<br><br><strong>LIES AND ERRONEOUS INTERPRETATIONS </strong><br><br>I am going to make a statement here:<br><br>Â“The more lies that you believe, the more pain that you will have. The less lies, the less pain. No lies, no painÂ”<br><br>Â“YÂ’shua spoke to the Jews who had believed him. Â“If you obey my teaching,Â” he said, Â“you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth. And the truth will set you free.Â” John 8: 31-32<br><br>When we know the truth intimately then we are free, freedom means no pain at all. Pain is an outcome of SIN, our own sin and the sins of others against us. The BEST NEWS that I ever heard in my life came to me during this retreat when YAH Himself said to me: Â“ Dominiquae, I did not design you for PAIN!Â”. My answer was: Â“You could have fooled me Lord! I thought that pain was my middle name!Â”. Do you feel like I did? I have GREAT NEWS for you! The Creator did NOT DESIGN YOU FOR PAIN! Now, go ahead and say it to yourself out loud! Â“I AM NOT DESIGNED FOR PAIN!Â”<br><br>I did not say that we will not suffer, I only said that when the suffering comes we are not supposed to hold onto and absorb the pain in order to carry it inside. He said clearly in Isaiah 53:4a<br><br>Â“Surely He has borne our grief and carried our sorrowsÂ”<br><br>He has already done it, and is ready to do it every day, so how come we carry so much pain, grief and sorrow?<br><br>The answer was given to me during my retreat: I had been believing LIES about myself, God and my daughterÂ’s situation. I had interpreted some traumatic events in my life in a wrong way. I had come to the conclusion that I was the worst mother in the world and I was trying to prove myself as a good mother by standing in faith for the healing of my daughter. Since Elohim did not answer me that proved the point that I was the worst mother and on top of it He hated me! Did I know all this in my conscious mind??? NOOOOOO, I was a woman of faith, I only believed and proclaimed the Word! I did not acknowledge my pain or my suffering, I loved and worshipped God all the time, I was in DENIAL! Deep within me I had pushed all these feelings of worthlessness and had put the Â‘lidÂ’ on them, The result of this denial was DEPRESSION!<br><br>Does this sound familiar to you? Maybe you have gone through some traumatic events such as death of loved ones, divorce, rape, abortions, bankruptcies or others and you have pushed the pain down instead of acknowledging it and allowing The Holy Spirit to truly interpret them for you, The precious, awesome, all healing Word of God give you the correct perspective? Do not despair, you are not alone, you can begin today!<br>Â“My soul clings to the dust, revive me according to your WordÂ”<br><br>continued...</div>
