            <div class='col-md body'>Obedience-Based Decisions Versus Skill and Ability<br>1 Chronicles 14:15<br>As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle.<br><br>The Philistines were attacking. David wanted to know how to respond. His first inquiry of God revealed that he was to attack the Philistines straightaway and God would give him victory. David followed God's instruction and gained victory. Shortly after, the Philistines mounted another attack. "So David inquired of God again, and God answered him, 'Do not go straight up, but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees' " (1 Chron. 14:14).<br><br>David was a well-trained warrior, a strategist. Yet, we find that David's dependence on God to direct his efforts was very great. In fact, after he won the first battle, he went right back to inquire again. This is the most important lesson we can learn from this story. God told David to attack, but only after he heard the marching in the balsam trees.<br><br>How many times have you or I operated in the marketplace based only on our skill and ability, without seeking to know the details of God's will in the matter? David could have simply assumed that since he had won the last battle, surely God would give him victory the same way. No. David had learned that communicating with the living God is the only sure way of victory. His skill was not enough. He had to have God's blessing.<br><br>How many times have we worked in our business life the same way each time only because it was the way we did it last time? What if God has a better way? What if God has a different plan than ours? "So David inquired of God..." These are the important words that we are to learn from. We must be in such relationship with God that we are constantly inquiring of His mind on every matter. When we do this, we can expect the same results that David achieved-success in our endeavor and recognition by God.<br><br>"So David's fame spread throughout every land, and the Lord made all the nations fear him" (1 Chron. 14:17). This is the reward of obedience to God. We don't have to build a name for ourselves. God will see to it that we are honored for our obedience. He wants to make known those servants who are willing to obey Him at all costs.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God's Tests<br>1 Samuel 20:1<br>..."What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, tthat he is trying to take my life?"<br><br>The cost of being one of God's anointed can be great. Those whom God has anointed for service and influence in His Kingdom go through a special preparation. David was anointed to be the next king over Israel. Shortly after this, while still a young boy, he was brought into King Saul's service to play music in Saul's court. While there, the opportunity to stand up against Goliath elevated David for his next stage of development as future king. As his popularity grew so did Saul's jealousy. However, even Saul's jealousy was God's instrument for molding and shaping David.<br><br>Saul finally decided he could no longer tolerate David's success and popularity among the people, so he tried to kill David. The confused young shepherd boy spent many years hiding in wilderness caves before he was able to see the hand of God in all of this. No doubt David thought that when he was anointed by Samuel he would be conveniently raised up to be king with all the accompanying benefits of kingship. Not so. God's preparation of David involved much persecution, disloyalty, and hardship. These were the lessons necessary to be a godly king. God brought many tests in David's life, just as He did with Saul. David passed these tests. Saul did not.<br><br>When God anoints us, it often is accompanied by some severe tests. These tests are designed to prepare us for the calling God has on our life. Should we fail these tests God cannot elevate us to the next level. For a businessperson, these tests often involve money, relationships, and other issues of the heart.<br><br>What if God has chosen you for a specific purpose in His Kingdom? Are you passing the tests He is bringing about in your life? These tests are designed to bring about greater obedience. In most instances it will involve great adversity. The Bible tells us that the King of kings learned obedience through the things that He suffered (see Heb. 5:8 ). If this is true, why would it be any different for His children? Be aware of the tests God may be bringing before you in order to prepare you for His service.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Obedience<br>Exodus 5:23<br>Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has brought trouble upon this people, and You have not rescued Your people at all.<br><br>Have you ever felt that the more obedient you are to following God, the more adversity there is? Moses had been instructed to go to Pharaoh and tell him to release the people of Israel. God had said He was going to deliver the people through Moses. The only problem is that God did not tell Moses at what point they actually would be released. When Moses complained to God, the Lord told Moses that He had to harden Pharaoh's heart in order to perform greater miracles. God was behind hardening Pharaoh's heart. We forget that the king's heart is in God's hand. God had a specific reason for each plague and each delay. God said to Moses,<br><br>"I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these miraculous signs of Mine among them that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed My signs among them, and that you may know that I am the Lord" (Exodus 10:1b-2).<br><br>God has a reason for everything He does. These delays were designed to bring greater glory to God and were to be a lasting legacy of God's miracle-working power for generations to come.<br><br>When the people were freed, God again hardened Pharaoh's heart to go after them. This action of God to harden Pharaoh's heart was to set the stage for an even greater miracle-the parting of the Red Sea. The people were angry with Moses for bringing them to the desert "to die." But God said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to move on" (Ex. 14:15b). There was only one place to go by this time-the Red Sea. God parted the Red Sea, and another greater miracle took place.<br><br>Moses learned several lessons that each of us must learn. God's promises are true, but His timing is not the same as ours. God always wants greater glory than what we might be willing to give Him. God puts obstacles and adversity into our lives in order to build perseverance and faith. Why has God put the mountain in your life at this time? To demonstrate His power through your life. To show His glory.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Transforming the Task List<br><br>1 Corinthians 10:31<br><br>What got you out of bed this morning (besides the lure of a hot cup of coffee)? If youÂ’re like me, you finally pulled yourself out of bed because youÂ’ve got stuff to do. In fact, your obligations for the day will probably end up being itemized on a list.<br><br>My to-do list is unapologetically low-tech. Just a small pad of lined paper with the date on the top and a handwritten itemization of things I need to get done before I hit the sack at the end of the day. I know that a Palm Pilot, a Blackberry, or even my trusted laptop could make my list look much trendier, but in the end a list is a listÂ—a long series of items that keep my feet to the fire.<br><br>WhatÂ’s troubling is that as I get to the bottom of one page of tasks, thereÂ’s often a note that says, Â“See next page.Â” And the scariest page is the one from yesterday that reminds me that I didnÂ’t get it all done after all. ItÂ’s easy to begin to feel that life is only about Â“living for the listÂ”! But if all of life is just about the stuff to do, it becomes little more than an accumulation of random, disconnected events in life. You climb in bed at the end of each day exhausted, thinking to yourself: There really has to be more to life than this.<br><br>The good news is that God has an overriding purpose for your life that encompasses everything on your list. When we put that purpose at the top of our priorities, even a day with an incomplete task list can be a smashingly significant, successful day. Are you ready to find out what it is?<br><br>GodÂ’s purpose for you is that you live to glorify Him. Not that you stop doing the list thing, but that everything on your list can be done to His glory. ItÂ’s just that simple. Glorifying God in all we do takes us beyond the routine of Â“just getting things done.Â” It fills the stuff on the list with a new sense of significance and in the end leaves us feeling that even the smallest task is significant. Getting the right degree, finding the right job, making lots of money, or landing a meaningful relationship is no longer the end game. Thankfully so, those kinds of pursuits left to themselves soon run out of gas. But getting a degree (or doing any of those things) so that you can use the degree to glorify God instead of yourself fills your life with a new and lasting sense of significance.<br><br>This is exactly what Paul had in mind when he wrote in 1 Corinthians 10:31: Â“Whether you eat or drink, do it all for the glory of God.Â” There is nothing in your life that canÂ’t be done to glorify God. Living to bring glory to Him is the all-consuming, driving, defining purpose that God has intended for our lives. Glorifying God simply means to do all we do in a way that communicates the attitudes and actions of God. It is filling life with His presence. When others see His mercy, justice, grace, love, tolerance, generosity, and humility in everything we do, they are seeing the glory of God through our lives. And tactfully giving Him the credit for all our accomplishments focuses the spotlight and applause on the right person.<br><br>LetÂ’s face itÂ—our lists are here to stay! LetÂ’s make something of them. Do it all to show your world what God is like!<br><br>YOUR JOURNEYÂ…<br><br>Look over your tasks and plans for the day ahead. What priorities are reflected in your list?<br>What are the dangers of being ruled by your task list? Have any of these dangers crept into your day-to-day activities?<br>Consider one of the more mundane items on the list. What are some ways God could use that task for His glory if submitted to Him?<br>Think of some practical ways you can submit your plans and lists to God each day. You can start right now. Take some time to ask the Lord to show you how to bring glory to Him in all your activities.<br><br></div>

They are stating that this person accomplished everything through his own efforts. His achievements were a result of his hard work and street smarts.<br><br>David was nearing the end of his life. The prophet Nathan was responding to David's idea to build a temple where the Ark of the Covenant would stay. God reminded David of his roots and where He had brought him. God took David from the fields of pasturing sheep to pastoring a nation. God reminded David that He cut off all of David's enemies. (David never lost a battle.)<br><br>Have you ever felt tempted to look at your accomplishments with pride as if you were the reason for your success? Have you ever thought your prosperity was due to your ingenuity?

It wasn't the sexual temptation that came inside Potiphar's house. It wasn't even the discouragement of years of imprisonment for being wrongfully accused. It was the temptation of prosperity and ownership. Once he was elevated, he was given choices that he never had before. It was totally up to him as to which choice he would make.

Can you cite the time when God's Spirit began demonstrating His power through you?<br><br>David knew the day the Spirit of the Lord began a special work in him. That Spirit was different from most leaders. Instead of seeking power and control, he led in response to a need. Instead of being a perfect person, he learned from mistakes and acknowledged them among those he led. Instead of placing confidence in his own abilities, he sought wisdom from the only real Commander in charge. David never lost a battle through his many years of leading Israel. He failed God by sinning with Bathsheba and by numbering the troops, but he learned from those failures, and he had to pay a price for them. However, God's Spirit never left David.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Purpose of Crucibles<br>Proverbs 17:3<br>The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tests the heart.<br><br>This proverb describes one of God's strangest mysteries. It is a description of God's formula to refine the human heart in order to bring out its finest qualities. The significant leaders who make the greatest mark for the Kingdom had to experience their own crucible and fire. Without it, the dross can never be removed from the human heart. Without it, the encumbrances weigh us down. God understands the human heart. He understands that for us to become all that He hopes for us, there are seasons of fire. Joseph went through many tests. Succeeding in the test qualified him for greater responsibility. The greater the use in the Kingdom the greater the crucible to prepare the right foundation. Some of God's greatest crucibles are found in the marketplace where we live every day: the employee who betrays our trust, the client who refuses to pay, the vendor who falls short of our expectations.<br><br>Each of these is God's tests to find out how we will respond. What tests are being brought your way today? His grace has been provided that we might pass the tests that He brings before us. Should we fail, we need not fear. His grace is sufficient for this as well. Ask God for the grace to walk with Him in whatever tests He has placed before you this day. He is able to accomplish what He wants for you.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shoftim Â“JudgesÂ”- Devarim (Deuteronomy) 16:18- 21:09<br><br>Yeshayahu / Isaiah 51:12-52:12<br>Mattityahu / Matthew 3:1-7<br><br>A leader is often required to make tough decisions. It is the leaderÂ’s responsibility to know when the time has come for war or when the time is right for negotiations. It is also the leaderÂ’s responsibility to assist his or her own people in recovering from a catastrophic event. Without a strong leader willing to make these types of decisions, citizens become disorganized and lose faith in the ability of their country. However, when a leader appears in control he or she creates a sense of peace and stability in the country.<br><br>The leadership structure in Yisrael placed HaShem as the ultimate leader. However, HaShem understood the need for the Children of Yisrael to see a strong leader in charge of the country. Therefore, HaShem knew that eventually the Children of Yisrael would want to be like other nations and put a king in charge. Devarim 17:14 states Â“When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God gave you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about meÂ” HaShem did not object to YisraelÂ’s desire to put a king in charge. However, before allowing a king to rule over Yisrael HaShem expected the king to meet the three commandments required of a king.<br><br>The first commandment HaShem expects a king of Yisrael to fulfill is that he would be native born. Devarim 17:15 states Â“You shall in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shall thou set king over thee: thou may not set a stranger over you, which is not your brother.Â” YisraelÂ’s king needs to be empathetic to the sufferings of Yisrael.  A foreigner would not feel a family bond to the rest of Yisrael. In other words a foreigner would always be an outsider. Therefore, HaShem forbade choosing a ruler that was a foreigner.  To be one with his subjects it was imperative that the king felt the sufferings and the joys of all of Yisrael. Yeshua addresses how YisraelÂ’s king must identify with his subjects in Mathew 25:34-40 which states<br><br>Â“Then shall the king say to those on his right hand, Come ye, the blessed of my Father, inherit the reign that hath been prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I did hunger, and ye gave me to eat; I did thirst, and ye gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and ye received me; naked, and ye put around me; I was infirm, and ye looked after me; in prison I was, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungering, and we nourished? Or thirsting, and we gave to drink? And when did we see thee a stranger, and we received? Or naked, and we put around? And when did we see thee infirm, or in prison, and we came unto thee? And the king answering, shall say to them, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did it to one of these my brethrenÂ—the leastÂ—to me ye did it.Â”<br><br>The king is required to suffer alongside his brethren. Most Yisraelite kings did not grasp this concept. As a result, most of YisraelÂ’s kings did not consider the consequences of their actions on the rest of Yisrael.<br><br>The second commandment HaShem expects a King to fulfill is that he will not be focused on the accumulation of wealth. Devarim 17:16-17 states Â“he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way. Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.Â” HaShem wanted the kings of Yisrael to focus on ruling Yisrael. The kingÂ’s desire to accumulate wealth while in office would distract him from committing himself completely to ruling Yisrael the way that HaShem desired. A king who becomes more interested in personal gain, looses interest in the welfare of his subjects. Satan even tempted Yeshua with the accumulation of wealth to distract Him from committing Himself completely to HaShemÂ’s will. We can see this in Mathew 4:8-10 which states Â“the devil took him up into an exceeding high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And said unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then said Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve.Â” HaShemÂ’s kings are to serve Him with all of their heart, mind, and soul.<br><br>The third commandment HaShem expects a King of Yisrael to fulfill is that he fully understands and lives by the Torah.  Devarim 17:18-20 states<br><br>Â“it shall be, when he sits upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites: And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them: That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.Â”<br><br>Fulfilling HaShemÂ’s plan for the Children of Yisrael is the most important duty of the king. HaShem wanted every king to write his own copy of the Torah. Writing a personal copy of the Torah forced the king to read every word.  As a result, a king became intimately familiar with the Torah. In other words, HaShem wanted YisraelÂ’s kings to live by and observe the same commandments that all Yisrael lived by. The king was not to consider himself better than anyone else in Yisrael. YisraelÂ’s king was to serve HaShem equally with his brethren.<br><br>HaShem wanted the kings of Yisrael to be totally focused on serving Him and serving Yisrael. HaShem gave the kings of Yisrael three commandments for this purpose. The first commandment HaShem required was that kings be native born. HaShem did not want an outsider to rule Yisrael. An outsider would not have the empathy for Yisrael that a Yisraelite does. The second commandment HaShem wanted fulfilled was to not accumulate riches while in office. HaShem wanted the king of Yisrael to serve him whole-heartedly. The accumulation of wealth would distract him from putting HaShemÂ’s will first. The third commandment HaShem wanted a king to fulfill was to write a personal copy of the Torah. HaShem wanted the king to realize that he had to abide by the same rules that all of Yisrael abided by. HaShem wanted the king to realize he was the same as everyone else. Therefore, the king was not above the law, he was equally yoked with his subjects.<br><br>By Rabbi Yaakov benYosef<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ReÂ’eh Â“BeholdÂ”- Devarim (Deuteronomy) 11:26- 16:17<br><br>Sh'muel Alef / I Samuel 20:18-42<br>Yeshayahu / Isaiah 54:11-55:5<br>Yaacov / James 2:19<br><br>The abundance of religions that exist today makes it difficult to discern the truth. As a result, many individuals are deceived into following false teachings. One of the most extreme cases of false teaching is a group that believes God is an extraterrestrial. They worship a God who they believe is technically advanced, and who will return to earth and reveal himself when humans are ready. Because of this, and other false teachings it is becoming easy for individuals to be confused. People can believe in and worship a God that fits into his or her own personal beliefs. However, HaShem defines Himself clearly in the Torah. Worshiping a God that that fits our personal beliefs can lead us to worship a false God. We must put aside our own impressions of what God is like, and discover the truth of HaShem from the Torah.  In fact, in Mathew 7:13-14 Yeshua stated Â“Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.Â” Deception is easy to accept because the deceiver always presents a God that fits into our perception of what God is supposed to be like. In other words, the deceiver tells us what we want to hear.<br><br>False prophets are some of the most dangerous types of deceivers. A false prophet not only tells individuals what they want to hear, a false prophet also presents his or her teaching in the name of HaShem. Therefore, a false prophet comes appearing as an emissary of the one true God.  Believers are often afraid to confront them, because false prophets come in the name of HaShem. However, Rav Shaul had no problem confronting false prophets. He warned the Corinthians in Corinthians 11:13-14 by saying Â“For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.Â” Even when false prophets come appearing as angels of light we must be prepared to confront them with the truth. In ReÂ’eh HaShem makes it clear that false prophets are to be confronted. ReÂ’eh establishes the guidelines needed to discern between a false prophet and a prophet of HaShem.<br><br>Devarim 13:1-3 states Â“If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder, And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; Thou shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreamsÂ” HaShem makes it clear that a prophetÂ’s use of signs and wonders is not sufficient proof that the prophet is a prophet of HaShem. According to the passage, the only way to determine a false prophet is whether or not the prophet leads individuals away from serving HaShem. We can see the danger of trusting in signs and wonders in Revelations 13:11-14, which states: Â“another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.Â” Following after signs and wonders will deceive many into believing the anti-Christ is a prophet of HaShem. Instead of relying on signs and wonder we must find a more accurate way of determining HaShemÂ’s prophets from false prophets.<br><br>Yeshua expounds on Devarim 13, and explains in Mathew 7:15-20 how to recognize false prophets when he states Â“Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheepÂ’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth-good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth-evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.Â” Yeshua makes it clear that it is by his or her fruit that a false prophet can be recognized. The fruit Yeshua is speaking of is the fruit that leads individuals back to HaShem. We can see this in Devarim 13:2-3 which states Â“Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; Thou shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God prove you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.Â” The desirable fruit of a prophet is to draw individuals and make them followers of HaShem. In other words, true prophets of HaShem produce the fruit of repentance.<br><br>The prophetÂ’s fruit of repentance can be determined by the prophetÂ’s use of the two tools HaShem has given for repentance. The first tool HaShem gives to a prophet to lead individuals to repentance is the Torah. The Torah was given to show the differences between HaShem and false Gods. Therefore, the Torah leads people to HaShem because it defines who He is. This goes against a false prophetÂ’s desire to exult idols, and to lead individuals away from HaShem. Yeshua even clarified that He was using the Torah to lead individuals to repentance in Mathew 5:17 when he stated Â“Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.Â” If a person proclaiming to be a prophet leads people away from HaShem by rendering the Torah meaningless he or she is a false prophet. Secondly, HaShem gave us Yeshua to reveal His own-essence. Therefore, Yeshua is a reflection of HaShem. False prophets lead individuals away from HaShem by negating the importance of Yeshua. One example of this can be seen in 1John 4:3 which states Â“every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.Â” Because a false prophetÂ’s mission is to lead individuals away from HaShem, the fruit of a false prophet will not magnify the Torah or exalt Yeshua.<br><br>The anti-messiah and other false prophets feed on the innate human desire to experience the miraculous. By producing signs and wonders false prophets can deceive individuals into following false gods. Yeshua warns us of this danger in Mathew 24:24 when He states Â“There shall arise false Messiahs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.Â” However, the elect of HaShem will be able to determine a true prophet from a false prophet by the fruit that the prophet produces. A false prophet produces fruit that leads individuals away from HaShem. A true prophet produces fruit that leads individuals into repentance and back to HaShem. Therefore, a true prophet will magnify the Torah and exult Yeshua, and a false prophet will not.<br><br>By Rabbi Yaakov benYosef<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thirsting After God<br>2 Kings 2:9<br>..."Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit"....<br><br>The first requirement to move in greater power and authority in God is to hunger for it. Yet even this hunger is born from God. Elisha hungered after God. Elisha saw many miracles as Elijah's servant. But he wanted more. He wanted a double portion of Elijah's spirit. When he asked Elijah for this, the prophet responded, "You have asked a difficult thing." It wasn't because it couldn't be granted. Elijah knew that with great anointing came a great weight of responsibility and difficulty.<br><br>Second, humility comes before honor. Elisha was known as the "servant of Elijah." How would you like to be known as "the servant of John"? Your name is not even mentioned. This was the preparation of Elisha. It has been the preparation of many men of God. Consider Joseph, the servant of Pharaoh. Consider David, the servant of Saul.<br><br>Third, Elisha committed himself totally to his calling. The Scripture says when Elisha was called to join Elijah, the younger man left his farm business completely. He slaughtered his oxen and had a great feast for the community. It was all or nothing. He could not fall back on his farm trade if his new venture didn't work. This demonstrates Elisha's pioneer spirit in stepping out, not knowing what was ahead.<br><br>Do you want greater anointing in God? "You will seek Me and find Me when you seek Me with all your heart. I will be found by you" (Jer. 29:13-14a). Begin thirsting for God's anointing in your heart today. This is the starting place.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Education and Relation: Truth and Love<br>John Piper<br><br>Think with me for a moment about education and relationships. Some of you care deeply that education not ignore or marginalize relationships of love. They are essential in real, lasting, life-changing education. Amen.<br><br>So I turn to the Bible. I find in place of the words, "education" and "relationship," the words, "truth" and "love." So what does the Bible say about how truth and love relate to each other? There are at least four ways of talking about this relationship.<br><br>1. Truth aims at love.<br><br>"The goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith" (1 Timothy 1:5). Note: instruction is not the goal, love is. Instruction is the means. It is subordinate. Truth serves love. Education serves relationships - mainly the relationship between us and God, but also between Christian and Christian, and between us and unbelievers. The "goal" of all our education is love.<br><br>"Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; and let us consider one another how to stir up to love and good deeds, . . . encouraging one another" (Hebrews 10:23-25, literal translation). The aim of our "considering one another" and "encouraging one another" is that we stir up love. We mingle insight into "the confession of our hope" with insight into "each other," and the effect is stirring each other to love. The truth of doctrine and truth of people-watching unite to aim at love.<br><br>2. Love aims at truth.<br><br>"Love does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth" (1 Corinthians 13:6). Love is glad when truth is spoken. Therefore love aims at truth. It supports truth.<br><br>"Out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have especially for you" (2 Corinthians 2:4). Here is an example of how love aims at truth. Paul is filled with love and it compels him to write a letter that was hard, and caused sorrow in him and in the Corinthians. But it needed to be said. So love said it. Love speaks the truth personally and doctrinally.<br><br>3. Love shapes how to speak the truth.<br><br>"Speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ" (Ephesians 4:15). There is an unloving way to speak the truth. That kind of truth-speaking we should repudiate. But there is a way to speak the truth in love, and that we should seek. It is not always a soft way to speak, or Jesus would have to be accused of lack of love in dealing with some folks in the Gospels.<br><br>But it does ask about what is the most helpful thing to say when everything is considered. Sometimes what would have been a hard word to one group is a needed act of love to another group, and not a wrong to the group addressed. But in general, love shapes truth into words and ways that are patient and gentle (2 Timothy 2:24-25).<br><br>4. Truth shapes how to show love.<br><br>"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and observe His commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome" (1 John 5:2). It is not always obvious which acts are loving. So John tells us some truth will help us know if our acts are loving.<br><br>One truth test for our love is whether we are keeping the commandments of God toward people. In other words, love cannot be cut loose from the truth of God's will. Truth shapes how to show love.<br><br>Let us pray that God will cause his love and truth to abound and mingle in us in all these ways for the glory of his truth-filled love and love-filled truth.<br><br></div>

LUKE 17:33 (PHILLIPS)<br><br>Â“There are two ways to view life,Â” Jesus is saying, Â“those who protect it or those who pursue it. The wisest are not the ones with the most years in their lives, but the most life in their years.Â”<br><br>What Annie Dillard says about writing in The Writing Life is true about life: Â“One of the few things I know about writing is this: spend it all, play it, lose it all, right away, every time. Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book, or for another book; give it, give it all, give it now.Â”<br><br>There is a rawness and a wonder to life. Pursue it. Hunt for it. Sell out to get it. DonÂ’t listen to the whines of those who have settled for a second-rate life and want you to do the same so they wonÂ’t feel guilty. Your goal is not to live long; itÂ’s to live.<br><br>Jesus says the options are clear. On one side there is the voice of safety. You can build a fire in the hearth, stay inside, and stay warm and dry and safe. You canÂ’t get hurt if you never get out, right? You canÂ’t be criticized for what you donÂ’t try, right? You canÂ’t fall if you donÂ’t take a stand, right? You canÂ’t lose your balance if you never climb, right? So, donÂ’t try it. Take the safe route.<br><br>Or you can hear the voice of adventureÂ—GodÂ’s adventure. Instead of building a fire in your hearth, build a fire in your heart. Follow GodÂ’s impulses. Adopt the child. Move overseas. Teach the class. Change careers. Run for office. Make a difference. Sure it isnÂ’t safe, but what is?<br><br>You think staying inside out of the cold is safe? Jesus disagrees. Â“Whoever tries to keep his life safe will lose it.Â” I like the words of General Douglas MacArthur when he was seventy-eight: Â“Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up interest wrinkles the soul.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Passion - Something to be Passionate About<br>by Ed Young<br><br>Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. Romans 12:4-5<br><br>The church has been called a "body" of believers with Christ at the head. And just like our human bodies, the body of Christ has many parts. But what are these parts? What does this body consist of? Is it the church building, the classrooms, the landscape, and the parking lot? No. The body of Christ consists of much more profound and important parts than physical locations or buildings.<br><br>The parts of the body of Christ are you and me.<br><br>Without each of its parts, a body will not function the way that it is designed. If your nose were missing, your body would not function to its full potential. Without your shoulder, your arm would not be as useful. For the church to function as the vehicle to spread God's message of truth, hope and love, all of the parts of the body must be present.<br><br>But there is one more thing necessary for the body to reach its potential. The parts of the body must be functioning - they have to work. If you have ever broken your arm or leg, then you know how useless that broken limb is until it is working again. That is true with the church too. Just showing up for one hour a week to worship corporately is not enough to keep the body healthy and working. God wants each of us to use our gifts for his glory and to use those gifts to serve in the church.<br><br>Too many of us, though, put church and service at church on the back burners of our lives. We cram our schedules full of events and activities until there is no longer room for everything. And too often church is what gets pushed aside. But that is not what Christ intended. He wants us to live our lives with the church - to do life with church as a priority. And nothing should take priority over living the life that Christ wants for each of us.<br><br>This week, remember that you are a vital part of the body of Christ. Remember that you are needed in order for that body to reach its potential. Use the gifts that you have to help spread God's message. Remember, the church is one thing that Christ was passionate about. It is something that you should be passionate about too.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today, Show up for Life<br>This devotional was written by Jim Liebelt<br><br>This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it. Â— Psalm 118:24 (NIV)<br><br>Recently, I made a remark to a friend about how quickly the year was passing by.  I received a blank stare in return. I remarked again.  Â“AndÂ….?Â” my friend questioned.  I tried to explain.  Â“AndÂ…?Â” my friend persisted. Then, it hit me, IÂ’m old. Actually, IÂ’m not old. But, I am twenty years older than my friend. I realized that my friend doesnÂ’t have the same perspective on time that I have gained. I experienced what IÂ’ve heard so many other people say, Â“The older you get that faster time flies.Â”<br><br>Whether we are young or old, whether time seems to drag on or fly by, itÂ’s important to remember that life is fleeting. While itÂ’s natural to desire a long healthy life, not all of us are granted the experience. All we have for sure is today; this moment. There are no guarantees for long life. So hereÂ’s an important reminder: live each day to its fullest Â– to the glory of God. Each day is a gift that needs to be treasured.<br><br>If you are like me, youÂ’ve wasted days planning for or dreaming about the future. Some days, weÂ’re so busy trying to get to our future that we donÂ’t show up for today. ThereÂ’s nothing wrong with planning and dreaming. We abuse the gift of life, however, when we forfeit todayÂ’s experiences trying to get to tomorrow. God wants us to be present today. He has created this day that we may know, experience and love him; that we may love and serve others. However you go about it, if you do these things, youÂ’ll make the most of your day.<br><br>Not too long ago, I spoke with a woman Â– the mother of a friend I grew up with. I remember her sparkle and vitality of those days.  In my mindÂ’s eye, I can see her; a busy mom in her early 50Â’s.  Now, sheÂ’s getting on in age. SheÂ’s in the twilight of her life; having struggled recently with the death of her husband and an ongoing bout with cancer. I gave her a hug and saw the same sparkle in her eyes. She looks good, all things considered. Â“How are you doing?Â” I asked.  Â“Well,Â” she hesitated, Â“IÂ’m okay. But, IÂ’m getting old.Â” Good answer, I thought. Then she quickly added, Â“But, IÂ’m truly learning to trust God more and more everyday.Â” She is making the most of the gift of life that God has given her.<br><br>IÂ’ve heard someone say, Â“Ninety percent of life is just showing up.Â” IÂ’m not sure about the percentage, but the saying rings true to me. Whether you are young or old, time is fleeting. Today, show up for life!<br></div>
