            <div class='col-md body'>Growth Period<br><br>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>"And you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath, from the day when the Omer was brought, seven complete weeks will they be." [23:15]<br>Our Sages tell us that the period of counting between Pesach and Shavuous came to separate the Exodus from Egypt and acceptance of the Torah on Mt. Sinai. The Jews in Egypt were stuck at a very base, non-spiritual level, and they needed this time period in order to grow and develop spiritually in order to be prepared for the reception of the ultimate spirituality, G-d's blueprint for Creation, the Torah. Rabbi Zalman Sorotzkin, author of Oznaim L'Torah, writes that the Omer remains relevant every year. We say this about all holidays - that in Judaism they are not merely commemorations, but an opportunity to relive the events. As the Haggadah says, "in every generation a person is obligated to regard himself as if he left Egypt."<br><br>Regarding the Omer, Rabbi Sorotzkin tells us that it has always been known to G-d that Israel - as a nation and as individuals - will fall from their spiritual heights. Therefore, he says, G-d set aside this time for us to work on spiritual growth each and every year. This period was sanctified for all time as conducive to self-purification and development.<br><br>There are several such time periods during the year, times when we can grow and accomplish more and more. The holidays form a natural spiral, leading us ever upwards in a lifetime of spiritual growth. Just... take advantage of it!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Ultimate Partnership<br><br>"The tribe of Zevulun, and the head of the children of Zevulun is Eliav ben Chelon." [2:7]<br><br>In the town of Vilna, several centuries ago, two Jewish merchants found themselves in a financial dispute which they could not resolve on their own. They decided to settle their dispute by using a traditional method known by the acronym "zablah" -- each side would choose an individual to act as a judge, the two judges would choose a third to sit with them, and the three judges would then adjudicate the case.<br><br>At that time, an outstanding scholar named Rabbi Eliyahu Kramer lived in the city -- he was called the Vilna Gaon, the "Genius of Vilna." One of the two participants chose a leading merchant to be a judge; the other went to Rabbi Kramer to be his.<br><br>Rabbi Kramer, however, refused. He said that the world of business and the world of Torah are often complete opposites. A person can get caught up in business affairs, and believe that wrong is right and right is wrong, so Rabbi Kramer could not serve on a court together with a merchant and ensure that they would agree upon the right answer. And, he said, we find a hint to this concept in this week's reading.<br><br>In the desert, the 12 tribes were divided into groups of three, and each group followed the flag of one tribe's camp: the flag of Yehudah to the east, Reuven to the south, Ephraim to the West and Dan to the north. In each case, said the Gaon, we find that when the tribes under each flag are mentioned, the Torah lists the first, the second, and then says "and the tribe of..." to indicate the third.<br><br>Only in the case of the flag of Yehudah is the third tribe not joined to the others with "and." The verse simply starts out of nowhere: "the tribe of Zevulun..."<br><br>Yissacher and Zevulun had a partnership. The children of Yissacher sat and studied Torah. The tribe of Zevulun supported Yissacher, and in doing so shared the merit of Yissacher's study. But even so, said the Vilna Gaon, the two were separate. They lacked a connection.<br><br>Those who studied in yeshiva for several years, and then went into the business world, know that this is true -- it is difficult to go into business, yet continue to think like a Torah scholar. They are different worlds, requiring a person to think and act differently, much as Western society in general calls for behavior which opposes Jewish values.<br><br>To actually move from work or business to Torah scholarship later in life is a deed worthy of Rebbe Akiva (who went to yeshiva at age 40, and grew to become the leading Rabbi of his time). It is also, of course, a tremendous challenge and accomplishment for a person to come from a non-observant, standard American Jewish lifestyle, and adopt full Jewish observance, at any age. And this too is much easier early in life, when a person is exploring various options without a strong commitment to any. For an older person, this is another transition, even greater than that from business to Torah study.<br><br>Last week, we lost a man who did what is difficult to imagine: as a successful businessman, he not only migrated to Jewish observance, but set aside his expertise to sit at the feet of teachers -- as if he were a young child -- to learn Torah.<br><br>Arthur Morgenstern spent his later years going to the Yeshiva of Philadelphia every morning, paying attention to the words of Abbayeh and Rava rather than the latest investment opportunities. He learned with people many years his junior, in order to learn to swim in the Sea of Talmud. And his accomplishments were considerable, to say the least -- I had the opportunity to attend a Siyum (celebration of completion of a Tractate) which he made a few years ago, and know that this was but one of his many accomplishments in learning.<br><br>His investments turned to Torah as well, as many Jewish institutions in Philadelphia and beyond gratefully attest. One of his most recent projects was to help found the Philadelphia Kollel, which is just getting underway. A Kollel, an advanced study center for Jewish scholars, often serves a crucial role in the development of an affiliated Jewish community -- and it was surprising that there was none in Philadelphia. Arthur recognized the need.<br><br>And I must also mention that he was the founding Chairman of the Board of Project Genesis -- in fact, he helped me to incorporate Project Genesis in 1993. He was one of the first to believe in Project Genesis and what it might accomplish. Today, what we provide to nearly 40,000 subscribers is in his merit.<br><br>Aharon ben Binyamin a"h will be sorely missed, by his family and by all who knew him.<br><br>Good Shabbos,<br><br>Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>In The Beginning </strong><br><br>"In the beginning, God shaped the heavens and the earth--the earth being nothingness and emptiness, with darkness on the face of the deep and Ruach 'Elohiym fluttering on the face of the waters--and God said, 'Let light be,' and light was."  B'reshiyt (Genesis) 1:1-3<br><br>In the beginning--from the very shaping of the heavens and the earth--was the Word.  And the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  Without Him, not even one thing existed; for it was through Him that "God said..." and all things came into being.

And yet, Creation faltered... in us.  When we heard the Word, substance became nothingness; light reverted to darkness.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hitting the Bull's-Eye<br><br>By Rabbi David Begoun<br>"And G-d spoke to Moshe in the Wilderness of Sinai." (Bamidbar/Numbers 1:1) This fourth of the Five Books of Moses always precedes the holiday of Shavuos, the reliving of our acceptance of the Torah on Mount Sinai, indicating that this Torah reading is, in some way, an overture to our receiving the Torah. The Medrash, responding to the question why the Torah was given in a desert, teaches that one who wishes to acquire the wisdom of the Torah must renounce his sense of self-ownership, just as a desert is ownerless. The absolute prerequisite for the acquisition of Torah wisdom is attainment of a high degree of humility. Far from being an indication of meekness or low self-esteem, humility is the ability to empty one's self of his focus on self to become an empty vessel open to receiving greater wisdom. The preparation that must be completed, in anticipation of the great gift of Torah that is given every year on Shavuos, is emptying our own vessels of all vestiges of ego and conceit to make room for the inflow of Torah.<br><br>The Torah refers to Moshe, our greatest prophet and foremost teacher of Torah, as the humblest of all men, and humility has continued to be the commonality shared by great Torah leaders. Rabbi Mordechai Gifter, the venerated Rosh Yeshiva (Dean) of the Telshe Yeshiva near Cleveland, learned of a newly married couple that was having a dispute. The husband, a budding Torah scholar, considered his stature such that it was belittling to fulfill the lowly task of taking out the nightly garbage. His wife disagreed. They consulted the Rosh Yeshiva, who decided that if the young man thought he was too important to do such a menial task, he should not have to; the matter was decided. That night after supper there was a knock on this young couple's door. To their astonishment, it was the stately Rosh Yeshiva. "I am here to take out the garbage," replied the acclaimed Torah giant. Noticing the dismay on the woman's face he explained, "We decided that your husband was too important to take out the garbage. Somebody has to do it and it surely should not be you, so I am here to do the job."<br><br>Why is humility crucial to one's ability to acquire and internalize the knowledge and values of the Torah? Simply, a humble person will bend himself and his understanding to correspond to the immutable principles of the Torah whereas a self-centered person will manipulate and distort the Torah to meet his principles and standards. A pre-requisite for being a member of the Sanhedrin (Temple era Jewish Supreme Court) was the ability to prove that a rodent carcass does not compromise one's ritual purity, despite the fact that the Torah says explicitly that it does. What was the purpose of such an exercise? Before earning the esteemed right to judge others, the prospective judge first had to come to the realization that if one is sufficiently intelligent and knowledgeable, he can always misconstrue the facts and opinions to prove and support his position, even if the position is completely incorrect. A creative person can always manipulate and bend the Torah to confirm his preexisting notions. Only a humble person will recognize that true Torah wisdom requires the opposite discipline: appreciation that the infinite Divine wisdom contained in the Torah mandates we reconfigure our priorities to alter one's thinking to correspond to the views of the Torah.<br><br>A parable is told of a man who happened upon an apparently expert archer who had succeeded in scoring dozens of bull's-eyes. Upon further observation the man understood this archer was no marksman but a charlatan. His practice was to shoot his arrow and, wherever it landed, paint a target around it so that it remained dead-center. In preparation for accepting the Torah on Shavuos and meriting to internalize its wisdom, we are reminded that when we make ourselves ownerless like a desert we will facilitate a relationship with G-d that will enable every arrow fired to be absolutely straight, a genuine bull's-eye.<br><br>Have a Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Who Can We Be?<br>The count of the people of Israel and the recording of the names of the leaders of its tribes, which forms the major part of this weekÂ’s Torah reading, is especially poignant and bittersweet. We, the listeners to the parsha, know in advance that all those counted and named, with few exceptions, are doomed to die in the desert, never to reach the Land of Israel. The Torah also knows that. So why did the Torah bother to take up so much space in recording for us in detail all of these matters and names when at the end of the day they apparently serve no purpose in the development of the Jewish people and the conquest and settlement of the Land of Israel?<br><br>As far as I am able to see, the major commentators to the Torah deal with this problem only in an oblique and indirect fashion. I am not presumptuous enough to tread here on ground that the greats of Israel in the past have apparently avoided. Yet, I think that there is here a great and important relevant message to us and to all generations of Jews. And that is that one should realize the tragedy of opportunity and inherent greatness squandered and brought to naught. Wasted potential is a tragic thing and in national affairs it is often the deciding weakness that dooms a people. The careful detailing of the numbers and names of the generation that died in the desert emphasizes to us the tragedy of what could have been and the failure to achieve that goal.<br><br>Implicit in JudaismÂ’s idea of free will and free choice for human beings is the fact that the Lord presents us with opportunities. In His omniscience, He is aware of what use man will make of those opportunities. But as Maimonides explains, GodÂ’s foreknowledge of the results of our choices in no way influences or guides our abilities to make those choices as we wish. The generation of the desert did not have to destroy itself with its wrong behavior and mistaken attitudes. It had the opportunity, because it was the dor deah Â– the generation of intellect and great potential Â– to build the Jewish state and people in a most positive fashion.<br><br>Its tragedy therefore lies not only in its behavior of folly but rather in its failure to exercise its potential in a positive manner. Heaven apparently measures us not only by who and what we are but also by who or what we could be. Opportunities squandered are much more painful and damaging than having no opportunities present at all. Our current State of Israel is a miraculous opportunity that has been extended to our generation. What we will make of this opportunity is the central question of current Jewish life and society. Hearing the names and numbers of the generation of the desert read to us this Shabat should sober us and make us realize that such an opportunity should not be frittered away because of lack of vision, faith and will. We can ill afford another generation of the desert.<br><br>Shabat shalom.<br><br>Rabbi Berel Wein<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Basis for Marriage<br><br>by Rabbi Chaim Dovid Green<br><br>The Maggid of Dubno was famous for answering all questions with a parable. Even when he was asked why he always answered with parables! Here is the answer he gave. "Truth was walking about town but everyone was scared to look at him. Wherever he went, people screamed and ran away because he was completely naked! Along came his friend named Parable who told Truth that if he wanted to be accepted, he would offer him a suit of clothing. That is what happened. Parable gave Truth a suit so people woild be more comfortable in his presence."<br><br>The Maggid was once asked why there is a need for the two Jewish Holidays of Simchas Torah and Shavuos as they seem to have the same function. Why don't we condense them into one grand Holiday? He answered with one of his most famous stories. Once there was a King and Queen who were without children for many years. In desperation they visited an old wise man who gave them a potent blessing with one caution attached. If the child would be a girl, no man must see her until her wedding day, lest she die! When the Queen gave birth to a baby girl a secluded island was prepared for the Princess to live on where she would be raised in the finest royal style with all female educators.<br><br>When the Princess came of age, the King approached a handsome nobleman and offered his daughters hand in marriage. "Sure" was the response, "let's meet her!" After the King explained that his daughter was not to be seen before the wedding day, the nobleman declined. Time after time the King was confronted with the same frustrating reaction. "Let's see her!" "If not, then how do I know what I'm getting myself into?"<br><br>Finally, the last worthy man told the King that he was greatly honored by the offer. If the princess had the attributes of her royal parents then he would be delighted to marry her even without seeing her till the wedding day.<br><br>A date was set and the whole world was invited to the celebration. Everyone came to dance and rejoice. A marvelous time was had by all...except the groom! He was overcome with anxiety. He had hidden his inner fears over not having even met his bride. Even after the wedding he remained apprehensive. He anticipated that, although she was beautiful, somehow her ugly side would eventually surface. After months of happy marriage, he came to appreciate more and more profoundly, her wonder, beauty, charm and wisdom. Each day another wondrous facet was revealed.<br><br>The Prince then became upset that he had withheld himself from joyful expression at his own wedding. He approached the King and admitted that although _now_ he was delighted beyond measure, at the time of the wedding he had been filled with inner turmoil. A decision was made that a new party would be arranged. All the guests would be invited back but this time only one person, the Prince himself, would dance to express his supernal delight.<br><br>The Maggid of Dubno explained that when the Torah was offered to the world there were questions about it's contents. However, when the Jewish nation was given it's turn to answer, there was a clear consensus that they were committed to do even before understanding all it contained. The goal, though, of _total_ trust was not yet complete. The mind can know what the heart cannot yet accept. After living with Torah and experiencing what King Solomon described as "All it's ways are pleasant and all it's paths are peace" (Mishlay), _then_ the Jewish nation is ready on Simchas Torah to express intense joy over The Almighty's precious gift.<br><br>A great Rabbi asked a group of his students who were preparing for marriage, "On what do you base your marriage?" They unanimously agreed, "On love and understanding!" The Rabbi corrected them saying that although their sentiments are correct, they would not be able to build a marriage on love and understanding because they as yet neither loved nor understood their respective brides. Love is something that grows with understanding and the experience of sharing.<br><br>Love and understanding are goals, not basis. The foundation of a marriage is a total and absolute commitment to arrive at the mountain peak of love and understanding. Similarly, the basis of our relationship with the Almighty is in this awesome initial step: to act...to learn...perchance to understand and therefore love. Sinai was a mountain of commitment, aspiring to an ocean of deep love and profound understanding. As the entire Oak tree resides in the acorn, so is the whole of Jewish destiny in the seed of that initial commitment from which we can continuously grow and to which is constantly referred to as a wedding day!<br><br>Good Yom Tov and Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br>There's No Place Like Home<br><br>A great scientist saw the need to send a spaceship to the nearest star and back. Knowing the trip would take approximately six thousand years, he designed a craft large enough and aesthetically pleasing to make the journey a more pleasant one. He solved with his genius and sensitivity all of the technical problems that could possibly arise. There were plants to replenish air and other creatures to create a constantly replenishing food chain.<br><br>The only problem that he struggled with was the radical of the human factor. People born on the craft after the generation of the first couple would think that this was their native home. They would forget about the original mission and may even tamper with and sabotage it.<br><br>Even the brilliant and creative scientist was desperate for a solution. The flight needed some human input and was ultimately for the sake of preserving humanity. The mission was for man, but how to keep man actively involved in the project was the question of the day.<br><br>It was decided a document would be introduced into the lives of the people on the spacecraft that achieved a few vital purposes. 1) It would include the blueprint of the entire craft to be used as a tool for understanding and repairing the craft along the way. It would advise about daily, weekly, and yearly maintenance of the ship and the proper use of all its buttons and levers, and of course sharp warnings and cautions about the abuse of certain buttons and levers. 2) Included in the document would be the original goal and philosophy of the mission. 3) It would describe the history of its initiation till its ultimate conclusion. 4) The document would help attune the participants as to the cycles of life on the craft for example; a) Every seventh day the window of the ship faces home. For those who are aware it is an awesome treat and it orients the inhabitants to their point of origin and destination. b) Every year, at different times, smells and sounds from fruits unique to planet earth are introduced to create a sense of longing and belonging to another time and place. These days correspond to days of historical significance such as launching and unsealing the document etc. 5) Laws of human conduct to maintain order and decency are vital for the continuity and safety of the flight. 6) Technical instructions whose purpose and origin only the brilliant scientist knows are promulgated in the document, partially to demonstrate the superior genius of the designer and partially to test the loyalty of the crew, but nobody really knows what the real reason is. Yet everyone with clear intellect understands that fools rush in where angels dare to tread and proceeds cautiously. 7) Procedures about keeping the integrity of the document and its myriad details are also a critical component of the document. As long as the message is clear there is still hope for a successful mission. Once the message is blurred then the entire project is at great risk. 8 ) Essential parts of the document itself are hung about the giant spacecraft at conspicuous junctures such as doorways. 9) The document is spread throughout the ship in all languages so that the information within is never lost. 10) A special group of scholars who are designated and heralded with the special task of representing and maintaining the integrity of the document and its grand plan so the project shall not fail. They are handpicked, as special commandos and are trained to give their life rather than change or consciously misrepresent the mission.<br><br>With these features intact the scientist felt more confident to launch the project that would save humanity while man himself would play the crucial role in bringing the ship back home.<br><br>When contemplating celebrating the holiday of Shavuos, which commemorates the giving and the receiving of the Torah by the Jewish Nation 3313 years ago, keep in mind this little science fiction tale and remember the following phrases while clicking your heals together three times. A hint is enough for a wise man. This ain't Kansas Dorothy. No analogy is perfect. Time wounds all heals. Things left to chance go to chaos. Truth is stranger and more organized than fiction. There's no place like home.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â“I WouldnÂ’t Want to Be the One to Break that Chain!Â”<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>And you should know it today and return it to your heart that HASHEM is G-d in the heavens above and on the earth below and the there is no other. (Devarim 4:39)<br><br>The Rambam states that foundation of foundations and the pillar of all wisdom is to know that there is a prime source of reality- namely G-d. It is not a matter of belief or speculation but rather of knowledge. He continues, Â“The knowledge of this matter is a positive commandment, as it says, Â“I am HASHEM your G-d Who took you out of the land of EgyptÂ…Â” The Kuzari asks, Â“Why such a small claim?Â” Â“I am HASHEM Who created heaven and earthÂ” would be more grandiose. The answer is that we were not there when the world was created but we did experience the Exodus from Egypt and the pronouncements on Mt. Sinai. This was a historical revelation and not a hysterical revolution. We, as a nation, were there and we witnessed it. ThatÂ’s how we know.<br><br>A general caught wind that that his army was beginning to grumble and complain overmuch. When he learned that the main source of their discontent was the quality of the food he became enraged and decided to address the troops. He barked at them, Â“Do you think NapoleonÂ’s men at Waterloo would have complained about the bread?Â” A small voice was heard from amongst the troops, Â“No sir! It was fresh then!Â” Leaving Egypt and receiving the Torah occurred 3318 years ago and it was fresh then. How do we Â“know it todayÂ”?<br><br>What occurred at Mt. Sinai was not an isolated moment of inspiration which fades like a sun tan. No! The memory of those uniquely powerful events were captured and bottled in many detailed programs of action, sublime souvenirs that are bubbling and alive till this very day. Just a few examples; At least twice daily we mention leaving Egypt fulfilling the verse, Â“In order that you should remember the day you left Egypt all the days of your lifeÂ” (Devarim 28:3)<br><br>Tefillin, which are worn daily, Â“Â… should be a sign on your arm and for Totafos between your eyes, because with a strong hand HASHEM took us out of Egypt.Â” (Shemos 13:15) Kiddush is recited as a testimony- a Â“remembrance of leaving EgyptÂ”, Â“You must remember that you were slaves in Egypt, when HASHEM your G-d brought with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. It is for this reason that HASHEM has commanded you to keep the Shabbos.Â” (Devarim 5:13-15) Pesach each year a whole week and more is dedicated to memorializing the events of leaving Egypt. Needless to say Shevuos commemorates and invites the re-reception of the Torah. Sukkos for seven days too is, Â“In order that your generations should know that in Sukkos I housed the Children of Israel when I took them out of Egypt.Â” (Vayikra 23:43) Not a day or a week in 3318 years has passed that the echo those events are not felt and acted on with earnest by multitudes of loyal Jews. About this the prophet Isaiah declared, Â“You are my witnesses, says HASHEM!Â”<br><br>One year when looking for a place in which to make a seminar we happened upon a fancy and yet reasonably priced hotel. We were taking a last walk through with the hotel staff before signing the contract. We came to the kitchen and met the chef and his crew. There was sufficient equipment and space to for us to share however there was only one exit. We realized it would be hard to ensure the integrity of the Kashrus with their waiters and ours co-mingling. It was a deal breaker. A palpable tension filled the room. I explained that it was not that we did not trust them. Even accidentally a spoon of theirs could end up in one of our sinks and change the whole equation. They didnÂ’t buy it. I tried again, Â“ItÂ’s not ours to negotiate. We have been doing it this way for 3300 years!Â” Just then a Chinese chef wearing one of those tall white hats broke the silence. With his cute accent he exclaimed, Â“3300 years? Â“I wouldnÂ’t want to be the one to break that chain!Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Order in the Camp<br><br>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This week's Torah reading begins with the directive to count a certain segment of the Children of Israel. Immediately after the count, the Jews are directed to arrange their camp in the wilderness in a specific order. All of the tribes excluding the tribe of Levi, would be divided into four groups of three. Each group would have its place around the Tabernacle which would be in the center of the camp. The tribe of Levi would camp around the Tabernacle and service its needs, as well as guard it. It seems somewhat counterproductive to divide up the Jewish nation as such, as it could lead to disunity. However, there is another way to view it, as we shall see.<br><br>Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler expounds on this topic. His says that there are various reasons for putting things in order. One reason is just for its own sake. Order creates the feeling that all is in order, implying that all is well. Another reason for order is practical. We know where to find things in places where order exists. A third reason is that some things need order to work properly, such as machines which depend on all of its parts to work in order.<br><br>On the spiritual level there is another aspect. At one extreme, disunity between individuals and groups impedes progress. At the other extreme, even if unity exists, disorder also impedes progress. Indeed, each person realizes his potential through his very individual talents. These talents need to express themselves in a particular context within a specific circle where it can be cultivated. Each circle becomes a conglamerate of the positive forces within it and it makes its contribution to the whole in its unique way. Each circle interacts with neighboring circles. Even if there are many circles expressing themselves in very different ways, in the end each contributes to and gains from the other. In this way each person can realize and express his own individualism in the context of his service to G-d. As we can see, order actually preserves unity by defining roles, direction, and purpose.<br><br>A simple analogy for this is the various skills which come together to build buildings. Each group contributes its unique expertise to the project. Each group of workers works in its own way, yet all are working toward the same goal.<br><br>This is what we learn from the arrangement of the tribes in the wilderness. Each was recognized in its role. Each was camping in equal proximity to the Tabernacle. The core and focus was doing G-d's will. The approach for each was different. However, each contributed its unique part, and gave what the others could not.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Removing The Biases<br><br>By Rabbi Moshe Peretz Gilden<br>"And G-d spoke to Moshe in the Sinai desert." (Bamidbar/Numbers 1:1) Medrash Rabba (1:6) inquires about the Torah's emphasis that this conversation took place in the desert? The Medrash expounds that the Torah's motivation is to teach that the Torah was given in a desert with fire and water. Alternatively, the Medrash comments that anyone who does not make himself like a desert will not be able to acquire the Torah.<br><br>But how does one derive from the word "desert" that the Torah was given with fire and water? And what does the Medrash mean by making oneself like a desert?<br><br>Rabbi Chizkiyahu Eliezer Kahan (1) explains the answer stems from the two types of commandments we find in the Torah, the positive acts incumbent upon us to complete and the negative commandments from which we are implored to refrain. Thus, in order to properly observe G-d's will, we need to be permeated with two opposite forces. We need to have a burning, active side, comparable to fire, which continually seeks growth and elevation; at the same moment we must maintain a cool, passive side that, like water, is a natural coolant and seeks out the lowest point to which it can drop. But having these attributes is not sufficient. Mesilas Yesharim (2) writes that "one's evil inclination can distance many matters which can be made to look evil but in reality are good. It can also embrace many things that appear to be good but in reality are evil.One needs that his heart be completely straight with no motive to do anything other than what is pleasing to G-d." It is not enough to embrace the attributes that assist us in properly following G-d's commands, for one can find his energies placed in the wrong direction under the influence of one's own agenda. The Torah, therefore, emphasizes that G-d spoke to Moshe in the desert, a barren place that symbolizes complete humility. The G-d conscious Jew must be a desert, barren of his biases and personal agendas. Only then will he possess clarity when to engage his burning drive for growth and when to exercise his cool passivity. The byproduct of the Torah being given in the desert is the proper use of the attributes of fire and water.<br><br>We are now in the waning days of the count from Pesach, the festival when we relive the experience of our release from bondage, to Shavuos, when we experience again our acceptance of the Torah and the mitzvos (Divine commands). Our Sages teach us that just as our forebears used the seven week period to develop their relationship with G-d and with one another, we, too, are charged to refine our character in preparation for renewing this Covenant. Our success in this holy but most essential venture is assured when we excise from within ourselves the passions and desires that too often lead us astray, when we make ourselves like a desert.<br><br>Have a Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I Will Remember My Covenant<br><br>"And God said [to Noach], 'This is the sign of the covenant which I am giving between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, to [all] generations forever:  I will put My rainbow in the clouds, and it will be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.  And it will come to pass that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud, and I will remember My covenant--which is between Me and you and every living creature among all living things--and the waters [will] never again become a deluge to destroy all living things.  And [when] the rainbow is in the cloud, and I see it, [it will cause me] to remember the covenant forever between God and every living creature among all living things which are on the earth.'" B'reshiyt (Genesis) 9:12-16<br><br>When we walk righteously with God, we offer Him trustworthy service.  Adonai honored Noach's righteousness by making him the representative recipient of His eternal covenant with all living things.  Because Adonai expects His covenants to be kept, He seals them with a sign, so that both of us will remain faithful and remember the covenant forever.<br><br>And yet, we forget, giving Adonai countless reasons to nullify His promises.  Thankfully, He doesn't, and though we fail to honor our end of the contract, Adonai goes on, continuing to remember, and refusing to go back on His Word.  Though the Lord brings rain and clouds to cover the earth, when they part, a sign in the heavens reminds the Creator that even while the sky is breaking, His promises will never be broken.<br><br>P R A Y E R<br><br>Adonai, Maker of heaven and earth, I give You praise! Thank You, Father, for remembering Your promises, even when I give You every reason to forget. I bless Your Name, Adonai, for You will never allow Your covenant to be broken.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Stick Figures</strong><br><br>The chronology of complaining and retribution in this weekÂ’s portion is not only disheartening, it seems almost endless. First, there is the terrible Korach rebellion where this prince of Israel challenges the authority of his cousins, Moshe and Ahron. A group of the 250 rabble-rousers are consumed by fire after offering the spiritually volatile kÂ’tores sacrifice. Korach and his close cohorts are swallowed alive as the earth opened its mouth. Then the remaining group complained, and again there was a plague. Ahron had to actually tender the feared kÂ’tores offering and walk through the camp in order to quell the Heavenly epidemic. And again the Jews complained. Finally, to establish the Divinity of Mosaic leadership and AhronÂ’s Priestly role, Hashem commanded Moshe to perform the ultimate sign.<br><br>"Speak to the Children of Israel and take from them one staff for each father's house, from all their leaders according to their fathers' house, twelve staffs; each man's name shall you inscribe on his staff: And the name of Aaron shall you inscribe on the staff of Levi, for there shall be one staff for the head of their fathers' house: It shall be that the man whom I shall choose -- his staff will blossom; thus, I shall cause to subside from upon Me the complaints of the Children of Israel, which they complain against you. Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel, and all their leaders gave him a staff for each leader, a staff for each leader, according to their fathers' house, twelve staffs; and Aaron's staff was among their staffs. Moshe laid their staffs before Hashem in the Tent of the Testimony. On the next day, Moshe came to the Tent of the Testimony and behold! The staff of Aaron of the house of Levi had blossomed; it brought forth a blossom, sprouted a bud and almonds ripened.<br><br>Moshe brought out all the staffs from before Hashem to all the Children of Israel; they saw and they took, each man his staff.Â” (Numbers 17:16-24)<br><br>A question I discussed last year seems glaring. Of what importance is it that the other princes took their sticks back. Also, why did the other princes take their sticks back. Of what value to them were those sticks, each being the same dry piece of wood?<br><br>Last week my wife and I shared the goodness of HashemÂ’s blessings. My wife gave birth to a baby boy. As what has become almost a ritual with all my previous children, I visited my wife in the hospital together with all the newbornÂ’s siblings, (those who are home and not studying away in Yeshiva). After leaving my wifeÂ’s room and our newborn son, my children stopped to peer through the large glass window of the infant nursery. All the newborns were lined up in their plastic bassinets. My older girls scanned the room Â“How adorable!Â” they whispered, balancing the excitement of the miraculous spectacle with proper hospital decorum.<br><br>My older daughtersÂ’ murmuring were muffled by the Â“I wanna see, I wanna seeÂ” coming a few feet below from my three-year old who was too small to reach the window of the nursery.<br><br>I picked him up and he looked curiously from wall to wall at the twenty-five newborns who were each in their separate compartments.Â”<br><br>Â“Hey, itÂ’s all the same thing!Â” he declared.<br><br>Perhaps, in defeat, in realizing that you are not endowed with greater power, one must still realize that he still has his own identity. Even if he looks outwardly exactly like all his cohorts, there is a unique character that makes him special. And those special attributes must be seized as well.<br><br>True, AhronÂ’s stick bloomed, while the others remained stagnant. But that is no reason to ignore them. And though they all may appear as the Â“same thingÂ”, their owners knew that each one had a quality, a nuance, a growth pattern or a certain form that was unique to them. They may not have been blooming sticks, they may not have sprouted almonds or yielded fruit, but to their owners they were unique! And each prince came back to reclaim not only what was his, but what was his to cherish as well.<br><br>Rabbi M. Kamenetzky</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Job Placement</strong><br><br>Once again, this week, Moshe comes under fire. This time he is attacked by his very own cousin, Korach, who claims that partiality and not Heavenly direction resulted in the choosing of Aharon as the Kohen Gadol.<br><br>Korach did not come alone. He riled up 250 prominent leaders to vilify Moshe, and question the entire process of appointing both the princely and the priestly leadership.<br><br>But Moshe did not cower. He gave them an offer they could not refuse. All 250 men were to ty to offer the k'tores, a highly potent combination of spices and fragrances that the kohen offered each day "in that way we will know, who is "the real, (pardon the pun,) McKoyhen."<br><br>He spoke to Korach and to his entire assembly, saying, "In the morning G-d will make known the one who is His own and the holy one, and He will draw him close to Himself, and whomever He will choose, He will draw close to Himself (Numbers 16:5). The double expression is troubling. If He will draw those holy close to himself, then of course those who He chooses will be drawn close to Him. Why the specific repetition of drawing near?<br><br>In the mid 1800's, Rabbi Avraham Shmuel of Aishishok served as the Rav of the town of Rassein, a small village near Kownus, Lithuania. A brilliant scholar and the author of the Amudei Aish, the community revered him and afforded him the utmost respect. Unfortunately, the Czar government of that era had different visions for a rabbi and appointed their own lackey, a puppet of the state known as a Rav Mitaam. The Rav Mitaam served as the official liaison to the Russian Government and any official dictate or transaction, having to do with Judaism, went only through the Rav Mitaam. Unfortunately for that Rabbi, the townsfolk knew of his very limited capabilities, and relegated him to a seat in the middle of the congregation near the Bimah as opposed to the traditional place up front near the Holy Ark.<br><br>But one week the young designate decided that he had enough. He wanted to be afforded the same dignity as Rabbi Avraham Shmuel. He woke up early that Shabbos and came to shul before anyone arrived. He sat himself down in the seat designated for Rabbi Avraham Shmuel next to the Aron Kodesh (Holy Ark). No one had the nerve to say anything to him for fear of government reprisal.<br><br>During that era, immediately before Musaf, all congregations throughout Russia said a special prayer on behalf of the Government and Czar Nikolai. That week the chazan, it is not known whether it was an orchestrated ploy or a lapse in memory, forgot to say the prayer. He was about to continue with the Musaf service when suddenly an elderly Jew, a former cantonist soldier who was captured as a youngster and forced to serve in the Czar's army for many years, jumped up from his seat and charged toward the front of the synagogue. He began raining blows on the official designated rabbi, the Rav Mitaam.<br><br>"What kind of Rabbi are you!" he shouted. "How dare you allow the chazan to forget the prayer on behalf of our benevolent leader? I served the Czar faithfully for twenty years and you forget to bless him?!" The congregants joined the fray, some trying to separate the older soldier from the bedazzled rabbi, others getting in the blows they always longed to afford the government appointed rabbi.<br><br>It was not long before the police arrived, and arrested the soldier, who was dragged out of the synagogue, yelling and hollering about the lack of honor afforded his Majesty. "After all the years I worked for the czar, I will not allow this poor excuse for a rabbi, to belittle the dignity of His Majesty!" The local policeman could not decide the fate of the soldier who struck a government official, to defend the honor of the Czar.<br><br>Finally the case was brought to the Governor General of the region who asked the "rabbi" to defend his inaction. "You see," stammered the Rabbi, I was sitting very far from the bimah and I truly did not hear the chazan skip, the prayer. After all, I was sitting next to the Holy Ark all the way up front!<br><br>The decision came down from the governor's office. No more would the official Rabbi be allowed to sit up front. From now on, he must sit amongst the people to make sure that all the prayers are said correctly.<br><br>People may feel that they are holy, but at the end of the day, it only matters who Hashem, the One who knows the true spirit of the heart and mindset of the spirit chooses to be close to. Some may run to be near the ark, when in truth, though they may physically situate themselves at the front, they have no spiritual place-setting there.<br><br>The story of Korach reminds us of the enduring saga of confused positions and roles that we often find in our community. It is the story of the chazzan who thinks he is the Rabbi, the Rabbi who thinks he is the President, and of course, the President who thinks he is the Creator! It is a parsha that reminds us that though we all have a place in Hashem's heart, our ego should not define our place in the community.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Copyright Â© 1997 by Rabbi M.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Grinding the Point</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>The sojourn in the desert was no walk in the park. True, it was a period of time in which miracles were the norm and the level of spirituality soared, but life next to G-d required a perfect commitment. The actions of the Jewish nation were scrutinized, the eyes of Hashem peering as a strict teacher, correcting and adjusting every wrong move with immediate censure and swift action. We suffered for our mistakes. The Jews wandered for 40 years because of the erroneous reports of the spies. And the many rebellions and uprisings concerning the manna and other matters, including the ever-resounding desire to return to Egypt, were met with swift, decisive retribution.<br><br>This week, however, the rebels are rebuked in three totally different ways, each a miracle onto itself. Korach organized a rebellion against Moshe and Ahron. Claiming nepotistic inconsistency, Korach said that Ahron did not deserve the position of Kohen Gadol. After all, he claimed "the entire congregation is holy, (they were all at Sinai). "Why, then," he argued with Moshe, "do you raise yourselves higher than the rest of the congregation of the Lord?" (Numbers 16:3)<br><br>But this time the punishment is not the ordinary plague. First, In a display of absolute power and sovereignty, Hashem opens the earth and swallows Korach and the immediate family of rabble-rousers whole and alive!<br><br>Then his 250 co-conspirators are consumed by fire as they attempt to offer a ktores (incense) sacrifice. And afterwards, to quell more grumbling, another miracle occurs. Each tribal leader is commanded to place a stick in the ground and miraculously only Ahron's stick begins to bud before their eyes. It grew leaves, flowers, and almonds -- a heavenly sign that only Ahron merits the exalted position of Kohen Gadol.<br><br>It always bothered me. The opening of the earth is no little feat. Earthquakes of that magnitude did not occur at a moment's notice! Wasn't that event powerful enough to make the point? Why was there a need to quell the whining and punish the perpetrators with such powerful punishments and magnificent miracles? Shouldn't a heavenly warning have been enough?<br><br>Rabbi Meshulm Igra of Pressburg was one of Europe's leading scholars in the latter part of the 18th century. As a young man, he was engaged to the daughter of a prominent community leader in the city of Butzatz. A few months before the wedding the young chosson ate a meal at the home of his future father-in-law. Dessert was served together with a hot treat a delecicy that the impoverished Reb Meshulam had never heard of -- coffee.<br><br>The servant brought out a cup of brewed coffee together with sugar and milk. The prospective father-in-law directed his son in law to partake. The young scholar looked quizzically at each of the entities and began to ponder. There were two liquids and sugar. The Talmud teaches that eating preceeds drinking. He took a sppon of sugar and ate it. Then he was unsure what to drink first the milk or the black brew. Noting that darkness in the Torah comes before day, he drank the black coffee. Noticing the grinds at the bottom of the cup, he took his spoon and began to eat them. Not wanting to embarrass his soon-to-be father-in-law who had served such a difficult-to-eat dessert, he slowly chewed and swallowed the grinds. His prospective bride stood in shock.<br><br>"Father," she cried "I cannot marry a man who does not know how do drink a cup of coffee. He is a total klutz!" The engagement was broken.<br><br>Years later this same community leader visited the home of Rav Yeshaya Pick the prominent Rav of Breslow. Upon entering the study he noticed the rav engrossed in a letter. He looked totally concerned and distraught. When the man asked what problem was, Rabbi Pick told him that he just received a letter that is filled with the deepest insights. "I have to be totally immersed in Torah thought to begin to comprehend the level of this man's brilliance. In fact," he continued, "I do not think a man of this caliber has emerged in the last fifty years! And," he added, "besides the brilliance, one can note his amazing humility and fine character throughout every word he writes."<br><br>Then he looked up at the man. "You come from Butzatz. Have you ever hear of a man called Meshulam Igra?"<br><br>The man didn't emit a verbal response. He fainted.<br><br>When he came to, he recounted the entire story of the engagement and its dissolution, how Rabbi Igra was meant to be his son-in-law but the match was broken over coffee grounds. Rabbi Pick looked up at him and shook his head sadly. "Is that so?" he exclaimed. "You gave up the opportunity for this great man because he did not know how to drink a cup of coffee?"<br><br>Then he looked at the man and simply declared, "Faint again!"<br><br>Perhaps the greatest undoing of our nation throughout its history is the non-appreciation of its great leaders. Among our midst exists diamonds, but they are often treated like raw coal. There is a most popular song, sung in the Yeshiva world on all holidays, " Moshe emes v'Toraso emes. Moshe is true and his Torah is true." The inseparability of the Torah and its teachers, the appreciation of the two as inseparable in their validity is a fundamental in throughout the writings of Maimonides and all the philosophies of Torah Judaism. Without recognizing the greatness of our leaders, we would be lost. Hashem did not the rebellion against Moshe to subside with just one action. It took three very different miracles, the splitting of the earth, the fire that consumed, and the budding of the dry sticks, to reiterate the most important point that sustains us until today. Because if we do not realize from where our strength comes, Hashem will remind us. And He will tell us to faint again!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>BLIND AMBITION</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>Love is blind. So is hate and any principle that begins to shade the intellect with emotion. This week, in what appears to be the worst ideological division of the Jewish people after the Exodus, a litmus test of human nature proved that the great divide bordered more on ego than on principle.<br><br>Korach, a cousin of Moshe and a brilliant man in his own right, began a rebellion that challenged the leadership and divine appointment of both Moshe and Ahron. In addition to his own family, Korach's iconoclastic actions inspired 250 Jewish leaders to denounce publicly the leadership of Moshe and Ahron. Foremost among the self-appointed detractors were two men with a history of vindictive activities toward Moshe - Dassan and Aviram. Back in Egypt, when Moshe killed an Egyptian taskmaster who was beating an innocent Jew, these men threatened to inform the Egyptian authorities.<br><br>But Moshe wanted to deal with them. As leader of two million people, he could have laughed at the complaints of a minute fraction of the population, but he didn't. He reached out to Dassan and Aviram and asked them to come and discuss their qualms with him. His request was met with a barrage of insults.<br><br>"Even if you gouge out our eyes - we shall not meet!" they responded (Numbers 16:14)<br><br>I was always amazed at this most arrogant response. Why did these men, who obviously were stubborn, arrogant, and supercilious, respond in a self-deprecating manner? Why did they suggest the horrific infliction of eye-gouging upon themselves? Would it not be enough to respond, even to the worst of enemies, "we will not come?" What connection does the loss of vision have with their refusal?<br><br>Reb Gimpel, a travelling salesman, developed an illness in a small village far from his home and was prescribed with a cure that entailed eating of non-kosher food. A foreigner in that town, he decided to ask the local rabbi if he was permitted to eat the medicine.<br><br>The gentile doctor did not know where the rabbi lived and suggested that Reb Gimpel ask the local butcher. Reb Gimpel went into the butcher shop. "Excuse me," he asked the burly meat vendor, "do you know where I can find your rabbi?" "The rabbi!" sneered the butcher, "why would a respectable-looking man like yourself need our rabbi?" The man was puzzled but continued to explain. "I'd like to ask him something. "Ask him something!" mocked the butcher. "Our rabbi doesn't know the difference between a horse and a cow! You're wasting your time! Ask the chazzan where he lives, I have no reason to tell you."<br><br>The shocked man went to the chazzan's home. "Excuse me," he asked. Do you know where the rabbi lives?"<br><br>"The rabbi?" asked the cantor in horror. "Why in the world would you want to meet that ignoramus? Surely you don't want to ask him a question! I wouldn't want to be party to your misfortune. Better ask the mohel."<br><br>Frustrated the poor man went to the home of the mohel where once again he was accosted with a barrage of insults and put-downs. Finally, however, the mohel acquiesced and directed the man to the rabbi's home. The man entered the threshold and before he even shook the rabbi's hand he exclaimed, "Listen, I don't know you, and you don't me. I came here to ask one question, but I will ask you something totally different. Why are you the rabbi here? The butcher thinks you're a thief, the chazzan thinks you're an ignoramus, and the mohel loathes you. Why in the world do you remain the rabbi of this town?"<br><br>The rabbi looked up from his bifocals and smiled. "Ah! The insults, the abuse and the criticism. But you know what: for a little honor it's all worth it!"<br><br>As the proverbial rabble-rousers of all time, Dassan and Aviram were preaching profound insight into the laws of arrogance. When one is set on a self-fulfilling mission of squabbling, as corrupt and perverted as his judgement is, so is his vision. He is blind to the critics, blind to the world, and worst of all, blind to his own self. Once a man is blind, you can gouge his eyes and he will not notice. Only those with a pure sense of mission, cherish the vision that lets them see a situation from every angle. Even if it is not their own. While Moshe, the leader of the entire nation asks to meet his worst enemies and discuss their gripes, thy refuse and would rather be blind to any criticism.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Internal Combustion </strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>"Any quarrel," says the Mishnah in Pirkei Avos (5:20) "that is made for the sake of heaven shall, in conclusion, last. However, if the argument has selfish motivation it shall not last." The Mishnah offers Hillel and Shamai as an example of heavenly opponents. Their arguments will last forever.<br><br>On the other hand, Korach and his congregation are the examples given for those whose debate stemmed from egotistical motivations. "Those types of disputes," says the Mishnah, "are doomed to fail."<br><br>The Mishnah, is of course referring to the episode in this week's portion. Korach, a first cousin of Moshe, contested the priesthood. He gathered 250 followers, formed a congregation, and openly rebelled against Moshe and Ahron, claiming that Moshe and his brother underhandedly seized both temporal and spiritual leadership. Moshe, in his great humility, offered a solution in which divine intercedence would point to the true leader. Korach and his followers were swallowed alive by a miraculous variation of an earthquake.<br><br>Yet two questions occur on the Mishnah. By using the expression that, "an argument for the sake of heaven will last," it seems to show that an ongoing argument is a proof of its sanctity. Shouldn't it be the opposite?<br><br>The other anomaly is that in referring to the kosher argument, the Mishnah refers to the combatants, Hillel and Shamai. Each was on one side of the debate. Yet, in reference to the argument that is labeled as egotistical, it defines the combatants as Korach and his congregation.<br><br>Weren't the combatants Korach and Moshe? Why is the latter part of the Mishnah inconsistent with the former?<br><br>On the week following Passover 1985, I began my first pulpit in an old small shul in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The scent of herring juice permeated the building, and the benches did not creak as they swayed, they krechtsed. As old as the furnishings were, the membership was older. But the Congregation's spirit of tradition of was feistier than its physical appearance.<br><br>My first week, I was asked to bless the new month of Iyar, Mevarchim HaChodesh. Then the trouble began. Every Shabbos, a somber prayer, Av HaRachamim, which memorializes Jewish martyrs during the era of the crusades is recited. On holidays or other festive occasions such as Shabbos Mevarchim, in deference to the spirit of celebration, the prayer is omitted. However, the month of Iyar is considered a sad time for Jews. 24,000 students of Rabbi Akiva perished in that period. Many congregations recite Av HaRachamim on Shabbos Mevarchim for the month of Iyar. I assumed my new congregation did the same and began reciting, " Av HaRachamim." Immediately I heard a shout, and an uproar began.<br><br>"We don't say Av HaRachamim today. We just blessed the new month," announced the President.<br><br>"We say it this month! It's sefirah, a period of mourning," yelled back the Vice-President.<br><br>" You know nothin'. We never ever say it when we bench (bless) Rosh Chodesh," yelled the Treasurer.<br><br>"We always did!" asserted the Gabbai.<br><br>The argument was brewing for five minutes when they all began to smile and instructed me to say the prayer as I had planned. Before I continued the service I sauntered over to the old Shammash who was sitting quietly through the tumult and asked, "what is the minhag (custom) of this shul?"<br><br>He surveyed the scene and beamed. "This shul is 100 years old. This is our minhag."<br><br>The Mishnah gives us a litmus test. How does one know when there is validity to an argument? Only when it is an argument that envelops eternity. The arguments of Shamai and Hillel last until today, in the halls and classrooms of Yeshivos and synagogues across the world. Each one's view was not given for his own personal gain, it was argued for the sake of heaven. However, Korach's battle with Moshe was one of personal gain. Moshe had no issue with them. It was a battle of Korach and his cohorts. Each with a completely different motivation -- himself. It did not last. A battle with divine intent remains eternal. In a healthy environment there is room for healthy differences. And those differences will wax eternal<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>His Final Undertaking!</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>And Korach tookÂ… (Bamidbar 16:1)<br><br>Find the motive - and youÂ’ve got the motive. (Groucho Marx Â– On crime detecting)<br><br>What had Korach done to deserve infamy? What was his tragic flaw? According to our sages he made many uplifting and true claims about the worthiness of the Jewish People. He stated that all Jews are holy since we had all heard The Almighty speak on Sinai. He only questioned the need for Moshe and Aaron to be the King and the Kohen? It sounds like a legit question. Why should he be swallowed alive into the earth for asking basic questions?<br><br>Apparently, his appeal was so attractive that he induced 250 heads of the Sanhedrin to join forces with him. This was no foolish bunch of thugs. The best and the brightest followed him to the grave. Where was he wrong and how did they fail to detect it?<br><br>A man enters a bakery hurriedly and asks the attendant how long it would take to make a brand new cake. He was told to return in one hour. An hour later heÂ’s back in the store and he looks disappointedly at the cake. Â“Maybe I didnÂ’t make myself clear. I would like the cake in the shape of the letter Â“KÂ”!Â” Â“Come back in a half hour!Â” HeÂ’s told! He promptly returns a half hour later and looks critically at the results. Â“I wanted it to be covered with bright pink icing and fancy flowers!Â” He is advised to wait a few more minutes. After a short while he is shown the finished product made according to his specs. Sensing his approval, the relieved attendant then asks as he does routinely, Â“Shall I put it in a box like this? Â“No!Â” he replies, Â“IÂ’ll eat it here!Â”<br><br>KorachÂ’s tragic flaw is sadly reflected in this silly joke. Sure he spoke of lofty matters, and many good people were persuaded by his seductive rhetoric but fundamentally he was gravely mistaken. How so? The Torah doesnÂ’t delay a word in telling us where the fault line lies. Â“Vayikach KorachÂ”-Â“And Korach tookÂ…Â” He was a taker. His motive in creating malcontent amongst the people was for his own hidden agenda. He wanted a title like Â“Kohen GadolÂ” for himself. All those convincing speeches he delivered with all their subtle profundity were ultimately self- serving. He wanted for himself a slice of the Kovod, the great glory. He baked that big fancy cake and it was for him to eat in the here and now! He was Â“takingÂ” albeit under the pretense of a Â“fairness doctrineÂ”.<br><br>Rabbi Dessler posits the thesis that at any given moment a person is either a giver or a taker. One is either motivated by some transcendental tendency to care and share or he is animated by an animal urge that centers on the self. The outer actions may not clearly betray the underlying motive, though. One may need a mind reader or a real prophet to truly tell even about himself.<br><br>One of the perks of being on the road a lot is that I get to see lots of different bumper stickers. The one I like the most and honk with approval at describes the essence of Torah Living: Â“Think global! Act local!Â” Seeing that we are each, in a nutshell, a microcosm of the universe, our moral imperative is to be an actor here and now for the sake of everywhere else. Korach was thinking local but acting globally! He was talking up a game of concern for the spiritual welfare of the entire nation but his interest in doing so was as local as local could ever be. He was effectively campaigning for his own Kovod!<br><br>Korach wasnÂ’t just a mover and a shaker. He was fundamentally a taker. When he was suddenly taken from the world he took many decent people down with him obviating the need for an undertaker. Tragically and whimsically this turned out to be with a capital Â“KÂ” his final undertaking!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of Mice and Men<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, and all the people who were with Korach, and their entire wealth. They and all that was theirs descended alive to the pit; the earth covered them over and they were lost from among the congregation. (Bamidbar 16:32-33),<br><br>I only open my mouth to change my feet! (My Uncle Al)<br><br>Why is said that the earth opened its Â“mouthÂ” and then it Â“swallowedÂ”? Is this some poetic personification or does the earth really have a mouth that swallows?<br><br>I still recoil in disgust when recalling a scene I witnessed as a child. A friend of mine showed me his new pet snake. Â“Neat!Â” I thought. It was OK but then came feeding time and I lost my appetite. A poor little mouse was dropped into the glass cage. He tried to hide but there was no place to go. The snake snatched him alive! The cruelty continued all the while struggling lump was swallowed whole. Ugh!<br><br>Sorry for the crude and unappetizing description. But- is the Torah any less delicate in describing Korach and his family being swallowed alive and whole into the earth?! They didnÂ’t just fall into a pit. No! It was deliberate and sudden- like the mouse. We should feel sorry for Korach, perhaps! But the greater purpose in giving color to this ugly episode is to learn Â“not to be like Korach and his followers.Â” So why did the earth open its mouth and swallow him alive?<br><br>The Chovos HaLevavos in the Section called Cheshbon HaNefesh- Â“Personal AccountingÂ”, there are listed not less than thirty matters one might meditate about. Number nine he suggests that one should imagine that a prince is sent by his father the king on a dangerous mission into hostile territory with a huge entourage to care for his every need. The prince should reckon for himself how his servants and attendants would behave if they become aware that the prince himself is not strictly following the rules of the king. If he stays up late and drinks they too will take his queue.<br><br>We similarly find ourselves vulnerable and delicately positioned. We are surrounded by attendants, including 60 trillion cells. If one rebels, G-d forbid, the whole system could crash. There are huge hospitals struggling to tame clusters of unpredictable erratic cells. The oceans, the earth, and all things are part of the friendly support system- that is, as long as the prince behaves accordingly.<br><br>Someone once asked Rabbi Avigdor Miller ztl., Â“Why did the earth open its mouth and swallow Korach? What are we to learn?Â” In typical fashion he gave the most direct and clear answer possible. Â“Korach had opened his big mouth and so the earth opened its mouth to swallow him alive.Â” Wow! Korach had everything in life! He was wealthy and wise and enviable in every way. He had it all! When he opened his mouth, though, he dug his own grave. Such is the fragile state of our existence and so go the best laid plans of mice and men.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All We Can Take From A Taker<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>And Korach tookÂ… (Bamidbar 16:1)<br><br>He took: He seduced the heads of the Sanhedrin with soft speech. (Rashi)<br><br>He took Â…a bad business for himself. (Tactate Sanhedrin 109B)<br><br>He took: He assumed the right to himself (Rabbi S.R. Hirsch)<br><br>What exactly did Korach take? The verse is purposefully ambiguous about what it was that Korach took perhaps to imply all of the above and more. The Chovos HaLevavos offers a Â“must readÂ” prescription on how to be a good neighbor or friend that may help us to understand where Korach went awry and why.<br><br>Â“If one who trusts in G-d has a wife and relatives, friends and enemies, he should trust that G-d will save him from being overly burdened by them and he should endeavor to meet his duties toward them to fulfill their wishes and to be sincerely concerned for them. He should avoid causing them any harm and promote their interests. He should be their steadfast supporter in all their concerns and advise them what is advantageous to them in religious and secular matters.<br><br>He should do this to serve G-d as it written, Â“Love your neighbor as yourselfÂ”, Â“Do not hate your brother in your heartÂ”. Not because he hopes to be repaid by them, not to make them indebted to him, not because he loves to be honored and praised by them, not to have authority over them, but rather to fulfill the commandment of the Creator and to keep His covenant and His ordinances in their regard.<br><br>For if his motive in fulfilling their wishes is one of those ulterior motives mentioned above, he will not obtain what he wants from them in this world, he will labor in vain, and he will lose his reward in the World-to-Come. If, however, he acts solely out of service to G-d, then G-d will help them (his beneficiaries) to repay him in this world and will put his praises in their mouths and will increase his stature in their eyes.Â”<br><br>The Chovos HaLevavos gives a clear Â“if/thenÂ” promise without any qualifications. If one engages personal interactions with a selfish motive then the mission will certainly fail. However, if one acts out of a sense of dutiful concern then success is guaranteed.<br><br>We can all testify with our own experience to our reaction when confronting a sales person in a store. Â“Can I help you?Â” We remain suspicious as to whom they hope to help. The agenda runs interference with our ability to trust. The child who is asked to recite Â“Mah NishtanaÂ” to impress the guests will also more likely freeze and fail recognizing subconsciously he is being asked to risk humiliation to offer someone else a feeling of success or nachas.<br><br>If a parent or teacher can convince a child that they have his or her best interest at heart then they can really begin to work wonders. The relationship becomes inspired with genuine respect. The personÂ’s needs are perceived as an end and not just a means.<br><br>Nobody wants to be a mere instrument for somebody elseÂ’s aggrandizement, a stepping stool or even a medal on their chest. Even if a person is pleasant and charming the weight of the agenda eventually crushes the relationship. I always imagine being hugged by one of those teddy bears on the front of a truck. Watch out!<br><br>Why is it that when we go to a doctor and if we donÂ’t like what we hear we go for second opinion and yet when we get on a plane we trust the first pilot offered? The difference is that the pilot is also getting on the plane. Korach tragically crashed a plane with 250 families and their possessions by convincing them and himself he had their best interest at heart when it was really only about him. Perhaps this profound lesson of caution is all we can take from a taker.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br><strong>Where is Here? </strong><br><br>In the morning (Hashem will make known): Moses said to them that The Holy One Blessed Be He apportioned boundaries in His world. Are you able to switch morning for evening? If so you would be able to undo this! As it says: "There was evening and morning ...and He separated"...so He distinguished Aaron for holiness. (Rashi)<br><br>The main goal and lesson for the man is to recognize his place and that his deeds should be for a definite purpose and rooted in the highest source. (Sefas Emes) The tragedy of Korach demands a post op. What went wrong? Korach was wealthy beyond comparison. He and his family had one of the most important tasks, to carry the Holy Ark. Who could ask for anything more and why?<br><br>Rabbi Yonason Eibshitz ztl., with an almost whimsical observation, compares two Talmudic sayings about human nature that seem to have a percentage point contradiction between them. One aphorism states, "No person dies having fulfilled half of his desires." The other claims, "If you have 100 you want 200." One implies that a person may approach but never reaches 50% of his or her ambitions. The second places the dividing point at exactly 50%. He reconciles the two with extra searing insight into the nature of the beast. He says, "The half that he doesn't have is more-dear to him than the half that he does have." King Solomon wrote, "Like a bird that strays from her nest so is a man that wanders from his place. (Proverbs 27:8 ) To the baby bird planted securely in her nest the forest floor is a lure. Similarly the big city calls the country youth. With one step too many the little fellow is out there. Once down on the ground, though, the proportions of the lurking dangers swell back to size. Suddenly, that defenseless creature with underdeveloped wings is in constant risk of being swallowed whole. Eventually she longs for the nurturing nest.<br><br>Moses tried to warn Korach and his group, "You have plenty -Children of Levi!" As if to say, "There's a lifetime of achievement in the role you've been given. Be ambitious to live up to the greatness of your G-d given task."<br><br>The Peter Principle sadly states, "A person rises to their level of incompetence!" Woe to the master teacher who concludes his career as a poor administrator or failed fundraiser. So much good remains and becomes undone when someone wanders into a field not there own finding there the jungle floor. A bad joke is told about a fellow who came to the doctor and told him, "I have a problem. Every time I take one step forward I take two steps backward." The doctor responded, "That's a terrible problem but I have one question. How did you get here?" To which the man answered, "You're right! I've been trying to get here for years. Eventually just I gave up and went home." Everyone has a uniquely defined mission to accomplish here. The question for each of us is, "Where is here?"<br><br></div>

(Bamidbar 16:2)<br><br>We need not go further than the first words to figure out the tragic flaw that foiled Korach. He was a taker. If the Torah had not revealed this to us, we too might have been taken by his rhetoric, platitudes, and pithy aphorisms. He managed to sway hundreds of good people to his side but how could his misdeed go undetected by so many highly intelligent and even sensitive people?<br><br>A great Rebbe received a visit from a wealthy man who deposited with the Rebbe ten thousand rubles to be distributed for charity at the RebbeÂ’s discretion. The Rebbe put the money in the top drawer of his desk for safe-keeping and the generous contributor left.<br><br>Immediately afterward entered a fellow in need of ten thousand rubles to assist in his daughter's marriage. The man was so desperate and deeply in pain but after a few moments of thought the Rebbe insisted he wait outside till a solution to his problem could be found. Outside the RebbeÂ’s office the fellow carried on with open weeping and sobbing.<br><br>The Attendant of the Rebbe observed with piqued curiosity, aware that the wealthy devotee had just left the ten thousand rubles in the Rebbe's care. "Why was this fellow left out here to suffer?" He wondered. He could only watch, though, and trust the Rebbe had his reasons. Eventually the RebbeÂ’s door opened and the fellow was relieved from his pain. The Rebbe called him in and bestowed the full amount of his request. The man was elated and left in a state of pure joy and filled with profound gratitude.<br><br>The Rebbe's attendant couldn't withhold his curiosity any longer. He needed to know what had just transpired. Why had the Rebbe left this fellow to languish unnecessarily? He had the money there all along. When confronted the Rebbe told him of his decision making process. He said that when the second man came in he began to consider what would be the most efficient way to apportion the funds he had just received. Perhaps it was a bigger mitzvah to give a smaller amount to many more people. That way more people would be helped and more acts of charity would be performed. Then he thought that if that was true, he should give one ruble to each of ten thousand people and the gift would see its broadest influence thereby.<br><br>The attendant listened with great interest to the Rebbe's reasoning and all the possibilities that his brilliant mind had entertained. Still, how the Rebbe had arrived at the final decision to give the one man the full sum was not clear. When questioned, the Rebbe made the following amazing revelation. He said that when he had placed all the possible permutations in front of him, he was more confounded as to what to do.<br><br>Finally after the Rebbe had reviewed his entire internal dialogue the decision became clear. The first word that he had exclaimed when the needy man came in was the word, "Don't" he had said to himself, Don't give him all ten thousand rubles, rather give ten men one thousand rubles." The word, "don't," he realized, was a selfish and negative inclination, and only after one full hour of inner conversation and after having visited the first word in the transcript of his mind he had finally concluded to counter that selfish tendency.<br><br>The instinct to take, Rabbi Dessler explains, comes from the animalistic urge, while the superior tendency to give, share, empathize, to transcend, is a manifestation of the noble divine soul blown deep into the chest of every human being. There is constantly a struggle for domination and at any one moment a person is either a giver or a taker depending upon which of these two forces reigns supreme at that moment. One may be "giving" in deed but because of ulterior motives taking in actuality. Similarly someone may be "taking" in deed and truly giving. Everything may depend upon, if we can get to that hidden, internal point, the true motive implied in the first thought.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Crime and Punishment<br>Crime and Punishment. In a corporeal world, the correlation of a jail sentence to a crime does not symbolize a cogent philosophical message. Of course, it may tell us that crime does not pay. Unfortunately, that comprehensive message does not differentiate between one who steals to sustain his family, and the greedy scam-artist who bilks widows out of their life's savings. The two felons may sit only a few cells apart from each other, with an arsonist or barroom brawler separating them, but the crimes that sent them to their dismal abodes are so very different in intent.<br><br>Divine justice does better. Every aveirah generates a punishment specifically designed to send a distinct Heavenly message to the afflicted. Of course, it may take an otherwise perspicacious mind to correlate what life is handing to him and how it relates to his mortal misdeeds. We do not always relate events that occur to the acts we have perpetrated. Sometimes it is too much for us to bear, and sometimes our ideas may lead us to wrongful conclusions, harming both our psyche and morale.<br><br>But when the Torah teaches us about crime and punishment we are more fortunate. The lessons of our past are now devoid of the guilt-ridden, depressive response we may have currently; rather they are moral springboard from which to bound to greater heights. And thus, when the Torah tells us of a clear crime and an immediate response, we have to transpose the relationship between the two to attain another moral lesson.<br><br>The people spoke against G-d and Moshe - "Why did you bring us up from Egypt to die in this wilderness, for there is no food and no water, and our soul is disgusted with the insubstantial food [Manna]?" G-d sent the fiery serpents against the people and they bit the people. A large multitude of Israel died. The people came to Moshe and said, "We have sinned, for we have spoken against Hashem and against you! Pray to Hashem that He remove from us the serpent" (Numbers,21:5-7). The people complained about their fare, and were punished with snakes. If Divine retribution is corollary to the crime, how do snakes correspond to kvetching?<br><br>Rashi quotes the Midrash Tanchuma. "Hashem said as it were - let the serpent which was punished for slanderous statements come and exact punishment from those who utter slander; Let the serpent to which all kinds of food have one taste [that of earth; cf (Gen:3:14) and (Yoma: 75a)] come and exact punishment from these ingrates to whom one thing (the manna) had the taste of many different dainties.<br><br>What was the slander of the snake? Didn't he just convince Chava to take a bite of the fruit? What connection is there with the Manna? The old Jewish yarn has a Bubby (grandmother) taking her grandchild, little Irving, to the beach toward the end of spring. There is hardly anyone around as the child, dressed in a spring suit, plays innocently on the shore. Suddenly a wave breaks and sweeps him into the vast ocean. The grandmother, who cannot swim, yells toward the deserted beach, "Someone! Please save my Irving! Please! Anybody!"<br><br>Out of nowhere, a man charges forward, dives into the ocean and swims valiantly toward the helpless child. Moments later he is holding the gasping child aloft, while his weeping grandmother dashes toward them. She whisks the child from the man, and looks over the child making sure he is still in one piece.<br><br>Then she turns to the man, nods her head slightly and parts her otherwise pursed lips. "He was wearing a hat."<br><br>In Gan Eden, the Garden of Eden, life was blissful. Adam and Chava had all they could have wanted, except for one type of fruit -- The Eitz Hada'as, The Fruit of Knowledge. It was the snake that taught his human cohort, the concept of total self-indulgence, rendering them powerless to say, "No!"<br><br>The desert dwellers did not fare much differently. Their celestial fare adapted to almost any flavor in the world. Water flowed freely from the rock. But they were not content. They wanted more. The unfulfilled flavors that the Manna refused to replicate were on their minds. They felt that Manna was only a mere simulacrum of the luscious cuisine that they desired. Their craving for everything, manifested itself in punishment through the animal that has his most favored fare, anytime anywhere -- the snake. To a snake, all dust is desirous!<br><br>When the Jewish nation were both led and fed, through a hostile environment, yet complained that their miraculous bread is insubstantial, then the only correlation, powerful enough to make them mend their thoughtless ways was the bite of the very being who gains no enjoyment from what he bites, while having all he desires.<br><br>Our goal in life is to revel in the blessing, rejoice in all the good that we have, despite the shortcomings of a limited world, and the trivial amenities we may lack. One must learn to appreciate his head, even if he is missing his hat.<br><br>Dedicated in memory of Joseph Heller by Beth and Ben Heller and Family L'iluy Nishmas Reb Yoel Nosson ben Reb Chaim HaLevi Heller -- 9 Tamuz<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Copyright Â© 1997 by Rabbi M.

            <div class='col-md body'>Snake Eyes<br>Volume 4 Issue 39<br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>I would not consider this week as one of Moshe's easiest ones. Through this entire portion Moshe suffers through a series of disappointments and tragedies. First, his sister Miriam dies. Then the miraculous well ceases to flow from the rock that traveled with the Jewish nation. The people complain bitterly and Moshe is told to talk to the rock and it will produce water. Moshe doesn't talk to the rock. He hits it. He is censured by Hashem for distorting His command. For that, he will not enter Eretz Yisrael. He and Ahron would both die in the desert. The setbacks do not end there. Next, Moshe sends messengers to the king of Edom, imploring him to allow the children of Israel, cousins of the Edomites, to journey through the land of Edom. "We will," they promise, "purchase supplies from the citizen's of Edom and only take the main roads" (Numbers 20:14-18 ). Yet Edom responds with an emphatic no and threatens war. Again Moshe acquiesces and takes the long route toward the land of Israel. Then the Torah tells us of another blow to Moshe - the death of his only brother Ahron. Now Moshe is left alone, with neither Miriam nor Ahron to support him. And the death of Ahron brings no tranquility. Immediately after Ahron's death, the Jews are attacked by the King of Arad in the south, whom the Talmud explicates as our evil nemesis Amalek. And though the battle is won, the Torah tells us that the Jews were still not satisfied. They verbally attack Moshe and Hashem complaining, "why did you bring us to die in this wilderness with no food or water and our souls are disgusted with the light fare of manna!" (Numbers 21:5). But Hashem is not quiescent. Fiery snakes attack the people. And Moshe, despite the trials and tribulation he has endured, has only one thing on his mind. Many people would have just given up. But Moshe had strength, courage, and love of B'nai Yisrael. He pleads to Hashem on behalf of his nation. "Stop the snakes!"<br><br>Hashem tells Moshe to make a snake and put it on a stick, and whoever was bitten shall gaze at the snake and will be cured. And so it was. Moshe made the snake. Those who were bitten looked at the snake and were healed. The Mishna in Rosh HaShana asks rhetorically, does a snake actually cure? Of course not! It explains that it was not the snake that healed but rather the snake was just a symbol for the nation to gaze heaven ward and repent.<br><br>The obvious mystery strikes every reader of the Torah. Why would the snake be an impetus of teshuva? Why didn't Moshe put a sacred scroll on the stick? Why had the symbol of fiery venom and certain death motivated the nation to repent? What transforms the very item we loathe and fear into the symbol of our cure?<br><br>In fact on a secular note; it is a slithering image gliding up a staff that represents an organization that fights the effect of its very venom. Based on the episode in this week's portion, the snake on a staff has become the symbol of those who are divinely guided to heal the very wounds that it inflicts. But why has our misfortune become the symbol of our cure?<br><br>Paul Harvey writes about a fascinating piece of American History, quite appropriate for Independence Day.<br><br>It was two decades before the Declaration of Independence. The Redcoats were tired of the colonies and they made sure the Americans knew it. They would sing a song, historians are not sure if the tune was of French, Spanish or German origin, but its lyrics were meant to taunt. The silly song mocked the colonists and was by the British sung outside the patriot's meeting places - even in front of their houses of worship. It was meant to scare them into submission. But it did not.<br><br>A strange thing happened with the very tune orchestrated to demoralize the fledgling nation. The Americans stole it. And the ragtag brigades used it against their enemy. They sang it in battle. They sang it in victory. They even sang it in defeat! And it was played and sung by the victorious Colonial Army at the surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781. The song that was meant to mock became a ballad of honor and was incorporated into the melodies and compositions that glorified the victories of the colonial army. It even was highlighted in Benjamin Carr's Federal Overture written in 1794.<br><br>So the very words that were meant to irritate were used celebrate, and the tune that was meant to jeer became a nation's cheer. Even today every American child knows it and sings it proudly. Yankee Doodle!<br><br>How did Moshe survive his the ordeals, suffering and hardship that plagued him through most of his career? Moshe in his earliest meeting with Hashem endured a very frightening experience. Hashem told him to throw down his staff. It transformed into a vicious snake. And Moshe ran. But Hashem told Moshe to confront the snake and grab it. And it miraculously conformed back into a very benign stick (Exodus 4:1-5). Moshe now teaches that very lesson to Klal Yisrael. It is easy to run from your fears and horrors. Sometimes you may be running from the very monster that bit you. But if you confront the monster with fire in your eyes and sincerity in your heart, then you have nothing to fear. For with the right frame of mind, the very animal that took control of you is not only harmless, it becomes a source of strength.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Open to Receive<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>This is the Torah (Teaching) of a man who would die in a tent: Anything that enters the tent and anything that is in the tent shall be contaminated for seven days. (Bamidbar 19:14)<br><br>Reish Lakish says, Â“From where do we know that the Torah is only maintained by someone who kills himself over it? As it says: This is the Torah of the man who would die in a tentÂ…Â” (Brochos 43B)<br><br>Every man of Israel is obligated in learning Torah whether he is poor or rich whether he is physically wholesome or languishing whether he is a youngster or an elder whose energies have waned, even if he is a poor person that must be provided for from charity and he needs to go door to door and even a man with a wife and children is obligated to fix for himself time to learn. (Rambam: Laws of Talmud Torah 1:8 )<br><br>If the Torah is Â“a tree of lifeÂ” then why is one expected to kill himself over it? What does that mean? It seems too extreme.<br><br>It is well known that R. Ephraim Margulies, the author of the Mateh Ephraim was not only a great scholar but a wealthy businessman. Many hours in the day he would cloister himself in his study and would remain removed from all his worldly concerns while he became immersed in Torah study. Even the most important business matters would not distract him from his learning. How did he do it? He posed the following hypothetical to his family and associates, Â“Imagine for your selves what you would do if I was dead, no longer in this world and you had no other address for your urgent questions. During these times I am to be considered as though I am no longer here.Â” So he explained the verse, Â“This is the Torah regarding the man who would die in the tentÂ…Â” A local businessman and close friend was determined to carry on his regular learning schedule on the day he was to move. His wife was none too pleased, at first, but he decided in principle that he wasnÂ’t going to miss out on his daily diet of learning no matter what.<br><br>Later in the morning he drove out of town to rent the truck he would need for the move. The truck rental place asked him for a $500.00 deposit. He didnÂ’t have anything like that kind of money on him and it meant that he would have to double back and delay the move until he could go home and get the money and return again. Now he was really going to be late and he was fearful he would be testing overmuch his wifeÂ’s nerves.<br><br>When he stepped outside the rental office in some industrial section of this town he noticed a fellow Jew passing by. He told him about the dilemma and the man pulled out $500.00 cash without hesitation and handed it to him as a loan for the deposit. My friend was amazed. What was this fellow doing there at that time? How likely is it to find someone with $500.00 cash on hand? Who says that even after all that that this fellow would be so agreeable to hand him the money? He felt that because he had kept his sacred learning appointment HASHEM had given him a little extra help and wink about which he was very grateful.<br><br>Nowadays the test and the need is greater than ever to gain even a few uninterrupted moments of concentration without intrusions from the ubiquitous cell phone. We might ask ourselves, Â“What if our phone battery was dead and we would be for a period of time unreachable?Â” If one would take Torah-Learning so seriously that he turns off his cell phone on his own, it would be no small thing and who knows what other signals he might be open to receive.<br><br></div>
