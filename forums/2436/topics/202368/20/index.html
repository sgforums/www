            <div class='col-md body'><strong>God Is Not A Reactor</strong><br><br>Shabbat shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>As the death threats over Israel's existence intensify and Ahmadinajad, Iran's president makes it more and more clear that he means "business" when it comes to the annihilation of Israel, and as the USA seems to be "bailing out" from defending Israel in this battle; we must remember that Yahveh is NOT A REACTOR. No, God does not and will not react to the plan of satan to annihilate for good His Chosen People and dispossess them from their Covenant Land. The Almighty has a plan and He has had a plan all along. He always WAITS for the right moment to trigger His winning strategy! The MOMENT is almost here, the momentum certainly is for Zechariah 12 to come to pass.<br><br>In Zechariah 12 we have the description of the present day situation as all the nations seem to come against Jerusalem and they call it the Road Map and the removal of settlements. We also have a Divine Intervention that even Hollywood would be jealous of! The Lord of Glory will do it again, He has to! His Covenant Promise is at stake. In Ezekiel 36 He tells us many times that He does not do it for us but rather for the sake of His Holy Name. He owes to Himself to rescue Israel from the hand of her enemies! And not only is a physical rescue prescribed but also a SPIRITUAL RESCUE! A great outpouring of the Spirit of Grace and Supplication! A MIGHTY REVIVAL is at hand! And this revival is in Jerusalem and even among the very orthodox!<br><br>So now you know how to pray for Israel this week and until He comes:<br><br>Adonai rescue Israel from all her enemies for the sake of Your Holy Name and pour out Your Ruach, Your Spirit of Grace and Supplication that they will recognize The Messiah!<br><br>Somehow the distress of being again before a "Red Sea" will cause a great outcry to Yahveh and He will answer both in the natural arena by rescuing Israel from her enemies and in the spiritual arena by the GREATEST OUTPOURING OF HIS RUACH (SPIRIT) since Shavuot (Pentecost) 2000 years ago! Impossible? No, actually to be expected from the God of Israel who ALWAYS keeps His promises!<br><br><strong>The 21st Century is like the 1st Century!</strong><br><br><strong>Please declare Zechariah 12 and Psalms 83</strong><br><br>Â“The burden of the word of Yahveh against Israel. Thus says Yahveh, who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him: Â“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples, when they lay siege against Judah and Jerusalem. And it shall happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem a very heavy stone for all peoples; all who would heave it away will surely be cut in pieces, though all nations of the earth are gathered against it. In that day,Â” says Yahveh, Â“I will strike every horse with confusion, and its rider with madness; I will open My eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, Â‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahveh of hosts, their God.Â’ In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a firepan in the woodpile, and like a fiery torch in the sheaves; they shall devour all the surrounding peoples on the right hand and on the left, but Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own placeÂ—Jerusalem.  Â“Yahveh will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall not become greater than that of Judah. In that day Yahveh will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the one who is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the Angel of Yahveh before them. It shall be in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. Â“And I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son, and grieve for Him as one grieves for a firstborn. In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning at Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. And the land shall mourn, every family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;  the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself, and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself, and their wives by themselves.Â”  Zechariah 12:1-14<br><br>For Zion's sake I will not keep silent. Isaiah 62:1<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Building His Mishkan</strong><br><br>Building tool #1<br><br>Offending the Mind to Reveal the Heart<br><br>Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, Â“Behold, the tabernacle (the Mishkan) of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. Revelation 21:2-3<br><br><strong>Mishkan -A dwelling place, or THE Dwelling Place of YahvehÂ’s Shekinah or GLORY</strong><br><br>Shabbat Shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.  From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more. Then YÂ’shua said to the twelve, Â“Do you also want to go away?Â”  John 6:56,66,67<br><br>So many times Adonai offends us on purpose in order to reveal our hearts. It is at the time that His words are offensive that our Â‘true colorsÂ’ manifest. Some people relate to offenses by what I would call Â“the cold warÂ”, in other words they shut down and give you the Â“left foot of fellowshipÂ”. Some cut you off their mailing list, phone list, friends list and any other list. Some get very Â“smugÂ” and self righteous in their attitudes and look down on the offensive party.  Others get Â“hotÂ” and they tell you off to your face. I absolutely prefer the ones that get mad and tell you off. At least you can work with them.  At least they are being very honest with their feelings and itÂ’s out there in the open. Unfortunately, there are very few that are that honest! For the most part people will just leave you Â“in the coldÂ”.<br><br>That is what happened to YÂ’shua when He stopped speaking in parables and told them the requirements to be united with Him. Unless you eat My flesh and drink My blood, you are just a religious bigot that wants to be Â“goodÂ” but you canÂ’t be ONE with Me! It was at that time that EVERYONE left Him. Only His original 12 remained.  Even they did not like it that much, but at least were enlightened enough to realize that escaping from Â“offensive truthÂ” is not an option! They were willing to endure the offensive treatment in order to be in the LIGHT! Imagine the harshness that Peter had to endure after his faithful service to the Master! This precious fisherman had left everything for YÂ’shua He was Â“in the fleshÂ” one time and was publicly rebuked and called SATAN-in front of EVERYONE!<br><br>Â“But He turned and said to Peter, Â“Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.Â”  Matthew 16:23<br><br>Imagine another time when they were going with the Â“hottest rabbiÂ” in town.  All of a sudden, He misbehaves so much, and begins to Â“act upÂ” by using a rope, and messing up all the business of the ungodly Temple merchants! I am sure some of his disciples, if not all, would have loved to be buried in the ground somewhere so as not to be seen with Him. Most of His disciples, besides Yochanan (John), and the women, left Him when He was arrested and later on executed on the Roman Cross. The act was far too offensive for them to stick around. Peter tried to flex a muscle though, but ended denying the Master more than all! YÂ’shua said:<br><br>Â“And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.Â”  Matthew 11:6<br><br>Not to mention the many times that He on purpose offended the religious hypocrites, the Â“holier than thouÂ” people,who used to ask him endless questions in order to trap Him. He was extremely offensive with them! So was Yochanan the Immerser (John the Baptist) come to think of it! YÂ’shua constantly questioned and contested the motivations of menÂ’s hearts.<br><br>Â“But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Â“Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance.Â”<br><br>Matthew 3:7-8<br><br>Â“Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things. But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment. Â“For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.Â” Matthew 12:34-37<br><br>Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: Â‘ These people draw near to Me with their mouth,  And honor Me with their lips, But their heart is far from Me. Matthew 15:7-8<br><br>Continued...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Building His Mishkan Part2<br><br>Both YÂ’shua and Yochanan, (John the baptizer) were Jewish Preachers and had the same spirit.  It seems like it is the same Spirit that all the prophets of old carried. This Spirit is constantly confronting hypocrisy, religiosity, self righteousness and sin, and it is a VERY OFFENSIVE SPIRIT. Most Christians call this spirit- Â“The Holy SpiritÂ”, and they describe Him as a very gentle, sweet accommodating grandmother! But in Hebrew He (for the most part described in female gender!) is called The Spirit (Wind) of The Holy-Ruach HaKodesh. In other words, this Spirit belongs to someone Holy-Kadosh-Separated-Uncompromised.  It is not a breeze kind of wind, but rather for the most part, a Strong Wind and even Wind mixed with Fire! Strong winds are very offensive and bothersome; as you canÂ’t really ignore them and they mess things up! In fact the best you can do when a strong wind is passing by is to close your windows and doors! If not you will find out that some things will be Â“gone with the windÂ” and the order in your home will be completely REARRANGED!<br><br>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them. Acts 2:2-3<br><br>When we want REVIVAL, we need to realize that a TRUE REVIVAL is the most offensive attack of Heaven on Earth! True revivals come as a strong wind to blow us, our doctrines, our hypocrisy and our lukewarm lifestyle away and to rearrange ALL of us! Right now we can put no more band aids on our critical condition in the Body of Messiah world wide! We need an INTERVENTION that will BLOW US AWAY and that will transform us completely! But only those that will endure the offensiveness of such an intervention will be able to survive it and be mightily used through it for the End Time harvest! The other ones will leave, escape, and will become irrelevant!<br><br>This is the time to make up your mind if you are willing, to let YAH, (God,) offend your mind in order to reveal your heart and practice an open heart surgery on you! If you are not willing, it is better that you stay in the comfortable pews of your church playing Sunday service; Â“Seeker friendlyÂ” services and the like. Just know that in a very short while everything will be shaken.  Your Â“comfortable church pewsÂ” will be comfortable no more! Then you will look for a Lighthouse in the midst of the STORM to prevent you from wrecking your faith altogether.<br><br>I have been making my choice as I go with Him. IÂ’d rather have my mind offended, and my life, and belief system rearranged by the Strong Wind and Fire of His Holiness; than to be a ship without a rudder at the time of Stormy Weather looking for a lighthouse. IÂ’d rather BE the lighthouse! What about you???<br><br>He is only interested in ONE thing. He wants a dwelling place for His glory, that is a MISHKAN, and everything that is standing in His way to have such a Mishkan will have to be shaken or moved out of the way! Time is too late to keep on playing the Â“be goodÂ” religious game! It is time for our desperately wicked heart with its hypocrisy, doubt, unbelief, fear, foolishness, selfishness, love of Mammon, compromise, lukewarmth, self righteousness, lust, etcÂ… to be revealed and cleansed;  Until we can SHMA, (hear and obey,) in order to demonstrate His Glory on the earth. It is time for the true Fear of Yahveh to be restored. It is time to tremble at His Word and to trust in Him like never before!<br><br>Thus says Yahveh: Â“Heaven is My throne, And earth is My footstool. Where is the house that you will build Me? And where is the place of My rest? For all those things My hand has made, And all those things exist,Â” Says Yahveh. Â“But on this one will I look: On him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word.  Isaiah 66:1-2<br><br>Committed to Be, Build, Cleanse and see YahÂ’s Mishkan Filled with His Glory<br><br>For His Glory<br><br>Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br>And the Kad-Esh MAP Team<br><br>PS: If you want to become this Glorious Mishkan, we invite you to train with us. Your mind and senses will most likely be offended, so that your spirit can soar, and He can get the most out of you!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dealing with Difficult Relatives<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>The following is an excerpt from In the He Still Moves Stones.<br>Download When You and Your Kin Can't" to read the full chapter.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Does Jesus have anything to say about dealing with difficult relatives? Is there an example of Jesus bringing peace to a painful family? Yes, there is.<br><br>His own.<br><br>It may surprise you to know that Jesus had a difficult family. If your family doesnÂ’t appreciate you, take heart, neither did JesusÂ’.<br><br>Â“His family Â… went to get him because they thought he was out of his mindÂ” (Mark 3:21).<br><br>JesusÂ’ siblings thought their brother was a lunatic. They werenÂ’t proudÂ—they were embarrassed!<br><br>ItÂ’s worth noting that he didnÂ’t try to control his familyÂ’s behavior, nor did he let their behavior control his. He didnÂ’t demand that they agree with him. He didnÂ’t sulk when they insulted him. He didnÂ’t make it his mission to try to please them.<br><br>Each of us has a fantasy that our family will be like the Waltons, an expectation that our dearest friends will be our next of kin. Jesus didnÂ’t have that expectation. Look how he defined his family: Â“My true brother and sister and mother are those who do what God wantsÂ” (Mark 3:35).<br><br>When JesusÂ’ brothers didnÂ’t share his convictions, he didnÂ’t try to force them. He recognized that his spiritual family could provide what his physical family didnÂ’t. If Jesus himself couldnÂ’t force his family to share his convictions, what makes you think you can force yours?<br><br>Having your familyÂ’s approval is desirable but not necessary for happiness and not always possible. Jesus did not let the difficult dynamic of his family overshadow his call from God. And because he didnÂ’t, this chapter has a happy ending.<br><br>What happened to JesusÂ’ family?<br><br>Mine with me a golden nugget hidden in a vein of the Book of Acts. Â“Then [the disciples] went back to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives.Â… They all continued praying together with some women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and JesusÂ’ brothersÂ” (Acts 1:12, 14, emphasis added).<br><br>What a change! The ones who mocked him now worship him. The ones who pitied him now pray for him. What if Jesus had disowned them? Or worse still, what if heÂ’d suffocated his family with his demand for change?<br><br>He didnÂ’t. He instead gave them space, time, and grace. And because he did, they changed. How much did they change? One brother became an apostle (Gal. 1:19) and others became missionaries (1 Cor. 9:5).<br><br>So donÂ’t lose heart. God still changes families.<br><br>From He Still Moves Stones<br>Copyright 1999, Max Lucado<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Psalm 145:2<br>Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.<br><br>Janet, Ann, and Jenny all agreed. This year they were going to get together daily to pray together and share their experiences. Over the past few months they had spent more time in fellowship with one another, and it was the best part of their weeks. They all worked in the same office, ate lunch together, went to church together, and they lived close enough that they could meet at one another's homes when necessary. In covenant with God and one another, they promised to get together for praise and prayer.<br>Perhaps such a set-up is not feasible for everyone, but it is easier and more enjoyable when we can share our faith with others. Other people hold us accountable to the commitment we make in a way that God does not. He will not force anyone to make time for Him. It is from a willing heart that God wants our time with Him to come. Friends and prayer partners can help us remember God every day, and thereby help us praise Him always.<br><br></div>

Cars were traveling along too fast for the conditions. Molly gripped the wheel and gritted her teeth. Suddenly, a car veered in front of her and went into a skid. Wide-eyed, Molly gasped, "Oh, Lord, help!"<br>The car passed by her with mere inches to spare, righted itself, and Molly was able to come to a stop, frightened, but unharmed. Once more Molly breathed out a short prayer, saying merely, "Thanks."<br><br>In our times of greatest need, lengthy prayers just won't come. Out sentiments and needs are already in God's heart, so all we need do is express them as our situation demands. The prayers of "help" and "thanks" are both acceptable in the sight of the Lord. Those two words say more than many wordy and pious prayers offered up in quieter times. How we pray is not so important as remembering to pray. The Lord hears them all.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE EXPRESSION OF PRIDE<br>Proverbs 16:18<br>Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling<br><br>Pride is a killer. Pride says, "I can do it alone. I can get myself out of this mess without God's help." Oh, no you can't! We absolutely need God, and we desperately need each other. Paul wrote, "We are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh" (Philippians 3:3). Humility is confidence properly placed. Examine the instructions on pride and humility in James 4:6-10 and 1 Peter 5:1-10. The context reveals that spiritual conflict follows the expression of pride. Pride is what caused Lucifer to be thrown out of heaven.<br><br>Jesus said, "Simon, Simon [Peter], behold, Satan has demanded permission to sift you like wheat" (Luke 22:31). On what basis could Satan make that demand? The context reveals the answer: "There arose also a dispute among them as to which one of them was regarded to be greatest" (Luke 22:24). Pride was Peter's downfall, and it opened the door to the devil's opposition.<br><br>The Lord says that pride goes before destruction and an arrogant spirit before stumbling (Proverbs 16:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. We must confess areas where we have not denied ourselves, picked up our cross daily, and followed Him (Matthew 16:24). In so doing we have given ground to the enemy in our lives.<br><br>Have we believed that we could be successful and live victoriously by our own strength and resources? We must confess that we have sinned against God by placing our will before His and by centering our lives around self instead of Him. We must renounce the self life and by so doing cancel all the ground that has been gained in our members by the enemies of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>We must pray that God will guide us so that we will do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but that with humility of mind we will regard others as more important than ourselves (Philippians 2:3). We must ask God to enable us through love to serve others and in honor prefer others (Romans 12:10).<br><br>Neil Anderson</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE FEAR THAT EXPELS ALL OTHERS </strong><br>Proverbs 14:26<br>In the fear of the LORD there is strong confidence, and his children will have refuge<br><br>I was conducting a conference for the leadership of one of America's flagship churches. The pastor is one of the most gifted Bible teachers I know and his staff is among the best. I asked the 165 leaders present if they had ever experienced a direct encounter with something they knew was demonic, such as a frightening presence in their room or an evil voice in their mind. Ninety-five percent answered yes. I went one step further to ask how many had been frightened by something pressing on them that they couldn't immediately respond to physically. At least a third raised their hand. Are these Christian leaders mentally ill? No, and neither are you or your children when you struggle against demonic influences in your life.<br><br>We warn our children about strangers in the streets. Don't you think we should warn them about "strangers" in their rooms? Our research suggests that 50 percent of Christian kids have encountered an evil presence in their rooms. Most of my students at seminary have had such an experience, and by the time they complete my class on resolving spiritual conflicts, several tell about having such an experience that semester. Would you know what to do if you or your child was terrorized by a presence alone at night? Do you fear such a possibility?<br><br>Most people fear demonic things they can't see, but have no fear of God. That's just the opposite of what Scripture commands. We are told to fear the Lord (Proverbs 1:7), but we are never told to fear Satan. Fear of the devil is an inappropriate response to the reality of the spiritual world. Knowing his schemes and learning to resist him and take authority over him is the biblical response.<br><br>Isaiah 8:13, 14, reads, "It is the LORD of hosts whom you should regard as holy. And He shall be your fear, and He shall be your dread. Then He shall become a sanctuary." The fear of the Lord is the one fear that expels all other fears.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>GREATER IS HE </strong><br>1 John 4:4<br>Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world<br><br>The Satanist organization is massive and extremely secretive. When you hear of satanic priests or rituals, you are hearing only about activities at the lowest level. You need not concern yourself too much with what you see or hear, since the Satanist activity which you read about in the newspapers or which is recorded in most police reports is usually the activity of mere dabblers. It's what you don't see that is pulling the strings and arranging events in Satanism. I have counseled enough victims of Satanism to know that there are infiltrators committed to infiltrating and disrupting Christian ministry.<br><br>To illustrate how human and spiritual forces of wickedness work together, ask any group of committed Christians this question: "How many of you have been awakened alertly or terrorized at 3:00 a.m.?" I ask that question regularly in my conferences, and about two-thirds of the participants raise their hands. Satanists meet from 12:00 to 3:00 a.m., and part of their ritual is to summon and send demons. The early morning hours are prime time for demon activity, and if you have awakened at that time, it may be that you have been targeted.<br><br>I have been targeted numerous times. However, it's not a frightening experience for me, and it shouldn't be for you. John promised, "Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world" (1 John 4:4). You have authority over Satan's activity and you have the armor of God to protect you. Whenever Satan attacks, you must "be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of His might" (Ephesians 6:10). Consciously place yourself in the Lord's hands, resist Satan with the spoken Word, and go back to sleep. You are only vulnerable when you are walking by sight instead of by faith or walking in the flesh instead of in the Spirit.<br><br>What should we do about Satan's hierarchy of demonic powers? Nothing! We are not to be demon-centered; we are to be God-centered and ministry-centered. We are to fix our eyes on Jesus, preach the gospel, love one another, and be God's ambassadors in our fallen world.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SIN-CONFESS-RESIST </strong><br>1 John 2:1<br>My little children, I am writing these things to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous<br><br>People who are caught in the sin-confess-sin-confess-sin-confess cycle eventually begin to lose hope that they can experience any real victory over sin. Sheer willpower can't keep them from repeating the sin they just confessed, and Satan pours on the condemnation. Self-control seems like an illusion, and the Christian life is one of unending ups and downs.<br><br>Suppose there is a door you are commanded not to open. On the other side of the door is a dog that keeps insisting, "Come on, let me in. Everybody is doing it. You deserve to have a little fun. Who will know? You can get away with it." So you open the door and the dog roars in and bits you on the leg. Ironically, the dog instantly changes its story: "You opened the door. I have a right to be here. You'll never get away with this!" If such a thing happened, would you beat on the dog or on yourself?<br><br>Sin which is allowed to reign is like the dog that bites you on the leg and won't let go. Not realizing there is a dog, you beat on yourself for leaving the door open and cry out to God for forgiveness. He forgives you, but the dog is still there. Why not cry out to God and beat on the dog instead of yourself? James 4:7 tells us, "Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you." We are correct in confessing our sin, but we have failed to follow the complete biblical formula which breaks the cycle: sin-confess- resist . We must first assume our responsibility for opening the door, then we must resist Satan and command him to leave if we are going to experience victory over sin.<br><br>We live as though God and a sick humanity are the only realities in the spiritual realm. We must turn to our righteous Advocate (1 John 2:1) and resist our perverted adversary if we are to experience victory and freedom over temptation and sin.<br><br>Neil Anderson</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BE DEFENSIVE </strong><br>1 Peter 2:23<br>While being reviled, He [Jesus] did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously<br><br>There are two reasons why you should not be defensive when there is a critical, negative evaluation of you.<br><br>First, if you are in the wrong, you don't have a defense. If you are criticized for saying something which is out of order or doing something which is wrong, and the criticism is valid, any defensiveness on your part would be a rationalization at best and a lie at worst. You must simply respond, "You're right; I was wrong," then take steps to improve your character and behavior.<br><br>Second, if you are right, you don't need a defense. Peter encouraged us to follow in the footsteps of Jesus who "while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously" (1 Peter 2:23). If you are in the right, you don't need to defend yourself. The Righteous Judge, who knows who you are and what you have done, will exonerate you.<br><br>A dear lady entered my office with a well-thought-out list of "things for me" and "things against me." I suggested that she share the "things for me" first. That didn't take long! As she was going through the "things against me," the part of me that is made of earth wanted to respond to every allegation. But I didn't. When she was finished, there was an awkward pause before I said, "It must have taken a lot of courage to come in and share that with me. What do you suggest I do?" She started to cry.<br><br>Nobody tears another down from a position of strength or judges another without being judged. Judgmental people are people in pain. If you can learn not to be defensive when someone exposes your character defects or attacks your performance, you may have an opportunity to turn the situation around and minister to that person.<br><br>Neil Anderson</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Power in Company </strong><br>This devotional was written by Kelly McFadden<br><br>Â“Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work: If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up! Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.Â”  Ecclesiastes 4:9-12<br><br>The show Â“Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?Â” drew in viewers as contestants answered multiple-choice questions in the hopes of becoming instant millionaires.  Each contestant got three Â“lifelinesÂ” that were available when stumped.  They could choose the 50/50 option where two of the four possible answers would be taken away.  They could call a friend or expert, who would be waiting at home to help with the answer.  The last option was to poll the audience.  While the experts did OK with an average of about 65% accuracy, the odds were in favor of the crowd.  The crowd was right 91% of the time.<br><br>The Bible talks about being surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses.  Walking through this life can be difficult, especially when done alone.  Humans were not made for isolation.  There are trials around every corner, but there is great strength in numbers.  Look at the Apostle PaulÂ’s life as recorded in the Bible.  He was an incredible evangelist and traveled from town to town and country to country spreading the message of the saving grace of Christ.  But even as he walked amongst nonbelievers healing and preaching, he always found fellowship with believers to encourage and be encouraged.<br><br>DonÂ’t be mistaken, Jesus is the ultimate strength for Christians.  You must first pursue a relationship with Jesus Christ.  But remember, God did not design us to walk through this life alone.  There is a reason that we are encouraged to meet in community.  As you praise the Lord in community, you not only honor God but strengthen your walk.  The passage from the book of Ecclesiastes says, Â“a cord with three strands is not easily broken.Â”  This is a verse often used at weddings to tell of the importance of keeping Christ at the center of your life in a marriage.  But, this is also key in your friendships.  Think of these cords as Christ, you, and other believers.  Sometimes, having others around you is the lifeline you need in tough times.  There is incredible power when Christians work together in this life.<br></div>

One day things looked bleak for the children in his orphanage at Ashley Downs. It was time for breakfast, and there was no food. A small girl whose father was a close friend of Muller was visiting in the home. Muller took her hand and said, "Come and see what our Father will do." In the dining room, long tables were set with empty plates and empty mugs. Not only was there no food in the kitchen, but there was no money in the home's account. Muller prayed, "Dear Father, we thank Thee for what Thou art going to give us to eat." Immediately, they heard a knock at the door. When they opened it, there stood the local baker. "Mr. Muller," he said, "I couldn't sleep last night. Somehow I felt you had no bread for breakfast, so I got up at two o'clock and baked fresh bread. Here it is." Muller thanked him and gave praise to God. Soon, a second knock was heard. It was the milkman. His cart had broken down in the front of the orphanage. He said he would like to give the children the milk so he could empty the cart and repair it.<br><br>There's a word that comes to my mind after reading that incredible story. It's not necessarily a spiritual word - but it's the word I bet was also on the mind of the hungry children that day. WOW.

He tried to tell the principal, but all he got was a lecture on not getting his friends in trouble and facing his punishment like a man. His friends had not intention of coming forth with the truth.

Sometimes we face the music for sins we have committed. Other times we stand alone for something we believe in. Comfort comes to us when we realize that, no matter how many earthly friends desert us, God is always standing right beside us. We need face no trial alone. Whether we have sinned or stood up for what is right, God will be near to us, to protect and defend.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Pure Milk</strong><br><br>Â“Â…as newborn babies, desire the WordÂ’s pure milk, [so] that by it you may grow into salvation.Â” Keifa Alef (1Peter) 2:2<br><br>Responsible parents take great care to protect and provide for their newborn child. They make sure that the babyÂ’s new environment is safe, comfortable, andÂ—especiallyÂ—clean. They are careful not to expose the infant to things that could introduce foreign bacteria or disease into the babyÂ’s precious little body. But one of the best ways to protect a baby for life is to give him the healthiest, strongest immune system possible. Until a baby is ready to eat solid food, a primary factor in building immunity is for the newborn to consume only his MotherÂ’s milk.<br><br>For a variety of reasons, many parents start their babies on Â“formulaÂ” from the very beginning. While the idea of giving a baby formula is not wrong in and of itself, there is no true replacement for pure milk that comes straight from MamaÂ—everything else is just a substitute. No matter how close it may be to the original, or how much it succeeds in nourishing the child, nothing can perfectly replace the God-designed function of a mother feeding her baby from her own body.<br><br>This is Â“the WordÂ’s pure milkÂ” that we are exhorted to desire. KeifaÂ’s point is not that we need to be bottle-fed the Word because we are immature, but that we should suckle on the Word as a newborn baby latches on to his motherÂ’s breast. It is life, it is satisfying, it is comforting, and it is pure. There is no opportunity for that pure milk to become taintedÂ—it goes directly from the source into the thirsty mouth of the suckling child.<br><br>Â“The WordÂ’s pure milkÂ” nourishes us naturally as God intended. By its purity, we build a strong resistance to infection, we are quicker to heal, and we are not easily brought down by the things around us. This is how we are able to Â“grow into salvationÂ”Â—we thrive because we were given something pure from the moment we left the womb. Without the untainted Word inside us, we cannot grow into the fullness of what God has for us. All too often, we become sickÂ—our bodies are unable to withstand illnessÂ—because we did not get the strength and protection we needed from the beginning. The Good News is that Abba gives us the gift of rebirth, and Â“as newborn babies,Â” we can beginÂ… againÂ…<br><br>P R A Y E R<br><br>Abba, teach me to look to You as a newborn baby looks to his mother. Make me unable to nourish myself with any kind of substitute, but instill in me the necessity to be thirsty for and satisfied only by the pure milk of Your Word. Let me be unable to digest anything else, and cause me to cry out and not be comforted until You come to me. Teach me to rely on You alone for my life, Adonai. I bless Your Name, Holy One, Giver and Sustainer of New LifeÂ….<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Fallacy of Full-Time Christian Work<br>Colossians 3:23-24<br>Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.<br><br>"I didn't know you were in full-time Christian work," said my close friend as we were driving. "I didn't realize that," she went on. I responded, "Every person who has followed the will of God in their life is in full-time Christian work." God calls some to the mission field, others to be accountants, and others to be advertising executives, and still others to be construction workers. God never made a distinction between sacred and secular. In fact, the Hebrew word avodah is the root word having the same meaning of "work" and "worship." God sees our work as worship.<br><br>We have incorrectly elevated the roll of the Christian worker to be more holy and committed than the person who is serving in a more secular environment. Yet the call to the secular marketplace is as important as any other calling. God has to have His people in every sphere of life. Otherwise, many would never come to know Him because they would be separated from society.<br><br>I learned this lesson personally when I sought to go into "full-time" service as a pastor in my late twenties, only to have God thrust me back into the business world unwillingly. This turned out to be the best thing He could have done for me, because it was never His will for me to be a pastor. He knew I was more suited for the marketplace.<br><br>We are all in missions. Some are called to foreign lands. Some are called to the jungles of the marketplace. Wherever you are called, serve the Lord in that place. Let Him demonstrate His power through your life so that others might experience Him through you today and see your vocation as worship to His glory.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Discerning the Work of God<br>Nehemiah 6:14<br>Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me.<br><br>Nehemiah set out to rebuild the wall at Jerusalem that had been destroyed. Nehemiah held a position in the Persian Empire that would be comparable to Chief of Staff in our government. Nehemiah wept over the destruction of the city wall and repented for the sins of his generation and the generations before him that had led to the fall of Jerusalem. Nehemiah responded to the news by seeking approval from his superior to take time off to rebuild the wall. Tobiah and Sanballat met Nehemiah's action with resistance, as did Noadiah the prophetess and other prophets. These were the religious and political leaders of his day. They became distractions to his work and opposed him.<br><br>Whenever God does a new work, it is often met with resistance by those in the established religious community, and sometimes among those from whom we would expect support. Jesus met the same resistance when He began His public ministry. This same phenomenon happens today. When God begins a new work that cannot be easily explained based upon prior experiences, many make the mistake of assuming it not to be of God. The very people who should embrace and encourage the work become the source of skepticism and opposition. God tells us that His ways are not our ways. He does things in ways beyond our limited understanding.<br><br>Before you are tempted to criticize or oppose something that looks different from your past experience, ask God for wisdom and discernment. Examine why you might be tempted to oppose it. The Lord cannot be put in a box. He delights in doing things in ways that may not fit our former paradigms.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>
