            <div class='col-md body'>Sour Milk<br>This week Hashem tells Moshe to inform the B'nai Yisrael, that the good times will soon come. "I shall rescue you, I shall redeem you with an out stretched hand, I shall bring you to the land which I have promised your fathers, Abraham Isaac and Jacob" (cf. Exodus 6:6-8 ).<br><br>It did not mean much. "The Children of Israel did not listen to Moshe from shortness of breath and hard work" (ibid v.9).<br><br>Next Hashem tells Moshe to tell Pharaoh to let the Jews out. Moshe responds with a reply filled with deductive reasoning. "Behold the Children of Israel did not listen, so how will Pharaoh listen?" (ibid v.12).<br><br>Our sages explain that this is on of ten "kal v'chomer" instances in the Torah. It is an example of reasoning used to logically come to halachic conclusions. ( eg. If a weightlifter can not lift the stone, surely a child can not!)<br><br>The problem is, that the reasoning seems flawed. "The Children of Israel did not listen to Moshe from shortness of breath and hard work. " Pharaoh did not suffer from either of those shortcomings! If the weightlifter with a broken back, can't lift a stone, it plays no role in telling us whether or not a child can.)<br><br>So what was Moshe's logical refutation to G-d's command?<br><br>Last week, on Thursday 23 Teves, the great Gaon, Rabbi Mordechai Gifter z"l passed away. As a student at the Telshe Yeshiva in Europe he developed a strong relationship with one Europe's foremost scholars of that era, Rav Mordechai Pogramanski z"l. He used to relate on a story Rav Pogramanski would share with his students.<br><br>A disheveled man was touring the Louvre with a group of tourists. As they passed Rembrandt's works the man looked at everyone and yelled, "Sour milk!" Puzzled, everyone thought he was crazy. He repeated it again. "It looks like sour milk!"<br><br>They moved on and passed the Mona Lisa. Again he screamed, Sour milk!" This went on a few more times until a wise man looked at the fellow. "Let me see your glasses."<br><br>The critical man gave them to him. "What did you have for breakfast?" he asked.<br><br>"Why cereal and milk," he answered.<br><br>The wise man laughed. Look at your glasses! They are speckled with milk! No wonder everything you look at appears as sour milk!<br><br>Moshe knew that Jews inherently believe. However the suffering of hard work and the evil treatment of Egyptian masters tainted their faith. But hard work alone does not taint faith. It is only when it is exasperated by the torment of the taskmasters, and their cruel taunts. How much more so, he figured, would Pharaoh be inattentive of the command that Hashem is in charge, and the Jews should be let free. If hard work stains the thought process, blocking the beauty of Hashem's word to filter through, how much more so does the idolatry and heresy of Pharaoh impede them from penetrating!<br><br>We look at Hashem's creation. We go to synagogue. We hear mussar. We read the prophets. But somehow it does not get through. The words are beautiful. Those who hear them can be inspired. But so many impediments block our vision and our hearing. Our lifestyles. Our desires. Even our work.<br><br>If we'd open our eyes we would see so much holiness! But only if their glasses are not tainted with sour milk.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We Knew It Was Right Then, And It Is Right Now!<br><br>In this week's Parsha, we find the posuk [verse], "And G-d spoke to Moshe and Aharon and commanded them regarding the Children of Israel and regarding Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to take the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt" [Shmos 6:13].<br><br>There is an interesting Talmud Yerushalmi in tractate Rosh Hashana, which infers from this pasuk that while still in Egypt, G-d commanded Moshe to give over the Mitzvah of Freeing Slaves to the Jewish people [Shmos 21:2-6]. When the pasuk tells us that Moshe and Aharon were to command the Children of Israel, it means that they would be delivering a command for the future: when they live in the land of Israel, and they have Jewish slaves, they should send them out to freedom after 6 years.<br><br>The question is obvious. Why is this an appropriate time to tell them about 'shiluach avadim?' They are slaves themselves. They don't own anything. They certainly don't own other slaves. Is it appropriate to give a person a mitzvah when he is years and years away from the ability to ever fulfill that command?<br><br>The answer, says the Mirrer Rosh Yeshiva, zt"l, is that there was no more appropriate time to tell them about 'shiluach avadim' than this very moment. Now they are slaves; now they know the feeling of having no freedom; now they know what it was to have a master.<br><br>It is a difficult thing to send away a slave. When one has a worker who has worked for him for six years, it is not easy to send him away. It will be very difficult to fulfill that mitzvah. If G-d would have given them that mitzvah later on, when they already had their own slaves, they would have heard it in a different fashion.<br><br>One needs to hear something at a time when he will be most sensitive to it. The Mirrer Rosh Yeshiva said that one has to "seize the moment." There are moments in life which must be grabbed and seized. One has to grab the occasion, because it is fleeting. Now is the time to tell them about sending away poor slaves. Now it will make an impression. Now it will be meaningful.<br><br>This lesson of seizing the moment is something that we have to do in our daily lives. There is an unbelievable Gemara in Sanhedrin [20a] which explains the pasuk [Mishlei 31:29] "Many daughters have acted with valor, but you have exceeded them all." The Gemara says: 'Many daughters have acted with valor' refers to Yosef, the son of Yaakov, who overcame temptation with the wife of Potifar; but 'you have exceeded them all' refers to Palti ben Layish. The deed of Palti ben Layish far exceeded Yosef HaTzadik's accomplishment.<br><br>What did Palti ben Layish do? The Talmud relates that King Saul had a daughter who was married to David, but Saul argued that based on a technicality she was not married to David and she legally had no husband [despite the fact that according to halacha, David was right and King Saul was wrong]. Saul took this daughter and gave her as a wife to Palti ben Layish.<br><br>Palti ben Layish was faced with the following situation: He could not refuse King Saul; he had to take her as a wife. Yet, he knew very well that this was a married woman. There he was in the bedroom, the first night, with a woman who was an 'eishes ish.' What does he do in order that he should succeed in withstanding the temptation? The Gemara says that he took a sword and stuck it in the ground and said "Anyone who 'occupies himself with this matter' will be stabbed by the sword." The Gemara goes on to say that because of this tremendous act that he did, he had the help of Heaven and he lived for years with this woman and never once did he touch her. G-d saved him from sin.<br><br>What was so magnificent about the act of sticking the sword into the ground? Why did he merit this unbelievable "siyata d'ishmaya" [help from Heaven] that for years he never touched her? What was so significant about sticking a sword in the ground?<br><br>The answer is that on that first night, Palti ben Layish knew what was right and what was wrong. On that first night, he had his priorities straight. On that first night, he knew that she was a married woman and that she was off limits. But, he also knew that as time went on, as the days and the months and the years passed, those feelings would dissipate. He would come up with a 'heter' -- he would find an excuse. He would do something.<br><br>Therefore, he said to himself, "I need a reminder; I have to seize the moment." There are moments when one does not rationalize, when one can clearly see the truth. Those are the moments to seize as our permanent reminders.<br><br>This, says the Mirrer Rosh Yeshiva, is something that we must do so many times in life. There are many occasions when we will be put into situations where in the beginning we will know what's right and what's wrong. But, later on, there will be considerations -- financial considerations, professional considerations, all sorts of rationalizations. How do we know what is right and what is wrong? We have to seize the moment. We have to stick that symbolic sword in the ground and say to ourselves "I know what's right and what's wrong, and I am not going to let my morals slip; I am not going to let my standards slide!"<br><br>That is the lesson of Palti ben Layish. And that is the reason why G-d tells the Jews about freeing slaves, right here, when they are still slaves and they are sensitive to what is right and what is wrong.<br><br>We have to grab the opportunity so that when the time comes, when we have temptations and questions, we will always be able to look back and say "We knew it was right then -- and we know it is right now!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Roots<br><br>By Rabbi Raymond Beyda<br>The holiday of Tu BÂ’Shebat Â– the fifteenth of the month of Shebat Â– is called the New Year of the Trees because most of the vegetation in the land of Israel begins to bud at this time of year. There are many laws regarding agriculture that are affected by this date. Regarding the young trees, the Torah forbids consumption of the fruit for the first three years, and permits full use of the produce anywhere from the fourth year on. The date that determines the Â“ageÂ” of any tree in Israel is Tu BÂ’Shebat. Additionally, Jews are required to separate Terumot and Maasrot, portions of the produce of the fields, on annual basis. The cutoff date for the Â“fiscalÂ” agricultural year is Tu BÂ’Shebat.<br><br>In order to commemorate the day and to highlight our thanks to G-d for giving us the Land of Milk and Honey, we indulge in consumption of many different types of fruits. There is a special reading called Â“Peri Es HadarÂ” which some people read on the night of Tu BÂ’Shebat. It includes portions of Mishnah and Zohar and listings of many fruits for people to enjoy at the table.<br><br>The sefer Bne Yissakhar teaches that one should pray on Tu BÂ’Shebat to merit a beautiful and kosher etrog Â– citron Â– for the performance of the misvah of the four species on Succot.<br><br>There are several lessons one should keep in mind on this day. Firstly, the Torah says, Â“For the man is the tree of the fieldsÂ”. The sages teach as a tree must be protected from harsh weather and from harmful insects, so too, a man must protect himself from the negative influences of society Â– the media, philosophies and immorality that bombard a person on a daily basis.<br><br>Secondly, one should assess the manner in which one recites berakhot - blessings. One is required to say a blessing before partaking of the pleasures of this world. How often one mumbles the words, is not concentrating on the meaning and rushes through the Â“formulaÂ” required permitting the pleasure to the individual. As we consider the beautiful fruits and say the appropriate blessings, one should evaluate oneÂ’s blessings and resolve to improve their effectiveness.<br><br>Thirdly, one should remember that if a tree has strong roots then it could support many wide branches. However, if a tree has many branches and weak roots then even a light wind can blow the tree over. A personÂ’s roots are oneÂ’s dedication to the study of Torah. Men must dedicate a set time to the daily study of Torah to shore up their knowledge of all aspects of our Holy Book. Women must study all the laws that pertain to the proper conduct of their lives as head of the Â“bayit neemanÂ” Â– Torah-true Jewish household. By strengthening or roots each of us will enable our people to survive the hurricane winds of exile and merit the coming of the Mashiah speedily and in our days<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Patient and Personal<br>Moshe is overcome with disappointment that somehow God has not acted as predictably and swiftly as Moshe thought he would in the process of redeeming Israel from Egyptian bondage. His complaint to God that "You have not saved Your people" and that the situation has worsened instead of improving is an understandable one. Yet, even though the facts seem to bear out the correctness of Moshe's words, the Lord, so to speak, is disappointed in Moshe's statements and attitude. God longs for the attitude and faith of the Patriarchs: Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov who, when faced with disappointments, tests and reverses, never wavered or complained to Him about His as yet unfulfilled heavenly promises and commitments. That is the meaning, the Rabbis teach us, of the fact that God appeared to them in a less personal "Name" than he did when revealing Himself to Moshe.<br><br>It is precisely because Moshe achieved the level of "knowing" God through His ineffable and the most "personal" of God's names, so to speak, that Moshe is more disappointed than were the Patriarchs and allows himself to express that disappointment to the God that he feels he apparently "knows" so well. It is the greatness and personal closeness of Moshe, the greatest of all prophets, that paradoxically engenders within Moshe this feeling of depression and disappointment at the apparent delay in the implementation of God's promise to redeem Israel from Egyptian bondage. We are always more frustrated and disappointed by those that we think that we know best than we are by those who appear more distant to us.<br><br>The Talmud teaches us that Moshe's statement to God and his words of complaint would yet somehow cost him dearly. God told him that "Now you will see" the defeat of Pharaoh and Egypt but you will not live to see the entry of the people of Israel into the Land of Israel and the defeat of the Canaanites and their thirty-one kings. God, so to speak, admires patience. It is one of the attributes and virtues recorded about the Almighty in His Torah. It is God's sense of patience, so to speak, that allows for human life to exist as it does in front of us in our daily world.<br><br>In the imitation of God's ways that is the core philosophy and way of life of Judaism, patience is seen as a supreme virtue. Patience with others, with one's own family members, with one's community and even with God Himself, is an essential hallmark of Jewish thought and attitude. If we review the lives of our Patriarchs we will readily see how patient an undemanding they truly were. They never insisted on "now" solutions and served God humbly in their unshakable belief in the validity of God's commitments to them and their future generations. By leading the Jewish people, Moshe will also learn the value of patience and we will not again hear insistent demands from him for immediacy and speed in the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.<br><br>Shabat shalom.<br>Rabbi Berel Wein<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br>YES Limits<br><br>"G-d said to Moshe, 'Come to Pharaoh and speak to him: "So says HaShem, G-d of the Hebrews: Send out My people, that they may serve Me."'" [9:1]<br><br>In this week's reading, we find one of the most famous of Biblical quotations: "Let my people go!"<br><br>But in actuality, it is one of the most infamous of half-quotes. It is a distortion of the truth -- for the message G-d told Moshe to deliver to Pharoah was "Let my people go -- that they may serve Me!"<br><br>The Western world's image of freedom is based upon our "unalienable right" to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" -- especially the latter. Self-governance, US-style democracy, is the ideal. We seek as few boundaries upon individual behavior as possible. Or as Madison Ave. presents it, we want "No Limits."<br><br>Most of us realize that "total freedom" is impossible -- it leads to anarchy and benefits no one. If we legislate no limits on personal behavior, it is impossible for us to prevent this behavior from interfering with the liberty and pursuit of happiness of others.<br><br>So, in fact, limits are necessary. But are they merely a necessary evil, or are they a positive good?<br><br>A distant relative, I am told, decided to raise her son by allowing him to discover his own boundaries -- meaning to say, she laid down no rules. Since I do not know the situation personally I do not know details, such as whether there was so much as a "suggested" bedtime.<br><br>What I do know is that this lasted no more than five years. Finally this mother realized that while overly harsh rules can hamper a loving relationship, some rules are in fact necessary.<br><br>This is something which I observed time and time again when I was a yeshiva student, and joined many different families for their Shabbos meals. It could hardly have been more obvious that the happiest children were not found in families with no rules, no limits, no guidelines. On the contrary, the happiest children were most likely to be found in families where the guidelines were clear, unmistakable, and fairly applied.<br><br>But, we say, we are different from children! We are adults, and capable of making our own decisions. We know what is right, and what is wrong.<br><br>Do we? Is there anyone who can say he or she really knows how the world works, and what is good for us? Or is it not clear to us that guidelines would help us as well -- if we only knew who we could trust?<br><br>That is why we have the Torah. Judaism recognizes that no person knows everything that the world has to offer -- but the Creator of the world certainly does!<br><br>So it is not simply "let my people go" but "that they may serve me" -- that they have no human master, but rather the guidance of a loving father. And this, in truth, is the greatest freedom of all!<br><br>Good Shabbos,<br>Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Impact of the Senses<br>by Rabbi Shlomo Jarcaig<br><br>This week's parsha opens one of the most widely known chapters in Jewish history, the Ten Plagues. But the first three are unique in that Hashem (G-d) tells Moshe (Moses) to tell Aharon (Aaron) to hit the water to turn it into blood, and to tell Aharon to hit the water to bring forth the frogs. He then tells Moshe to tell Aharon to hit the ground to commence the plague of lice. In contrast with the latter seven, for which Moshe directly served as Hashem's messenger to carry them out, Hashem deemed for these three that Moshe was inappropriate for the job, and designated Aharon as his replacement. Rashi explains that Moshe was not allowed to hit the water because it protected him when he was a baby, as he was cast into it in a basket. Similarly, he could not hit the ground because it protected him after he killed the Egyptian, since the Egyptian was hidden in the ground. Moshe's responsibility to appreciate the kindnesses which he received from the water and the ground made it improper for him to smite them.<br><br>As much as everyone realizes the importance of gratitude, Moshe not being allowed to hit the water or ground seems somewhat extreme. After all, these inanimate substances would never know the difference if they were hit or not. More so, the water and ground did not actively decide to help him. Why, then, is Moshe obligated to express his gratitude toward such objects? Furthermore, considering the results of hitting the water and ground, we find a great sanctification of Hashem's name. Such actions, which blatantly demonstrate Divine Providence, are among the MOST admirable deeds someone can perform, and are in no way degrading toward the water or ground themselves. To the contrary, these acts sanctify these mundane items. Why would Hashem not allow Moshe to be the one to bring about these results merely because he owed the water and ground gratitude?<br><br>Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler (1891-1954; of London and, later, Bnai Brak; one of the outstanding personalities and thinkers of the Mussar movement) explains that people, by their nature, are influenced by the experiences of their senses, even when logic dictates the opposite of what the senses perceive. Even with all of the cerebral knowledge of the resultant good generated by turning the water into blood, when Moshe would actually hit the water his eyes would absorb the image of him performing an outwardly violent act toward something from which he received unusually positive benefit. Even though the water and ground which he would be hitting are inanimate, the very act of hitting them would profoundly impact Moshe's psyche and would diminish his own personal level of gratitude. Gratitude is the essential attribute for appreciating Hashem and the world he created, and is, thus, integral for His service. As our leader and the one who would ultimately receive the Torah on our behalf, Moshe could not be flawed in this area.<br><br>Just as Moshe could not expose his senses to a stimulus which could negatively affect his character, we, too, must maintain the same caution. A complete intellectual grasp of a situation is still not enough to save us from spiritual corrosion. We must sustain the vigilance to focus our sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch toward things which influence us positively and help us grow.<br><br>Have a good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By Rabbi Aron Tendler<br>TRUE GRATITUDE<br><br>In this week's Parsha there are three plagues that were performed by Aharon rather than Moshe: Blood, Frogs, and Lice. Rashi explains that for Moshe to facilitate those plagues would have been a lack of gratitude and appreciation. The plagues of Blood and Frogs afflicted the waters of the Nile, which had saved Moshe when he was set afloat in the basket. The plague of Lice afflicted the sand and dirt of Egypt, which Moshe used to hide the body of the Egyptian overseer. Because Moshe personally benefited from the Nile and the sand it was wrong for him to perform those plagues.<br><br>Let's be honest. The Nile River and the sands of Egypt are objects. There is no basis to suggest that they have any kind of intelligence or feelings that should concern us or demand sensitivity on our part. Why does G-d insist that Aharon present the miracles of Blood, Frogs, and Lice rather than Moshe? For that matter, Pharaoh was partially responsible for raising Moshe in his own home for 20 years. Where do we see Moshe expressing appreciation and gratitude to Pharaoh for all the benefit he had received from him?<br><br>The Torah defines Moshe Rabbeinu's character. In Bamidbar 2:3 the Torah refers to Moshe as "exceedingly humble, more so than anyone else on the face of the earth." The Rambam in Hilchos Dayos - The Laws of Character Traits, 1:5 explains that all character traits exist on a continuum between two extremes. Depending on the individual and his personal circumstances, character can express itself in varying degrees along the continuum. It is incumbent upon the individual to develop his character so that he can willfully control its expression as required by the situation. This controlled expression is called the "middle path" or the mid-point along the continuum.<br><br>The Rambam explains that all aspects of our character are within our control. Character traits should be viewed as tools that were given to us in order to live our lives as effectively and productively as possible. Depending on the situation, different expressions of a character trait will be more effective than others. As an example, the Rambam presents the Arrogance - Meekness continuum. There are times when the most effective way to deal with a situation is for a person to be meek, "lowly" and deferential. There are other times when a person should be more arrogant and assertive. The Rambam plotted the extremes and determined that the mid-point between arrogance and meekness is humility.<br><br>Arrogance------------------------Humility---------------------------Meekness<br><br>This suggests that humility is an attitude that allows a person to express himself in a manner that is determined by judgment rather than emotion.<br><br>In the case of Moshe, it was proper for Moshe to be meek and deferential in relation to G-d. However, in relation to Pharaoh he had to be far more assertive and demanding. Moshe as an individual removed from circumstances was humble. He was confident in his abilities, secure in his self- image, and respectful of all others. He did not view himself as better than anyone else, even if his lot in life was to lead and facilitate miracles. He was given abilities to be used for the betterment of the Jewish people and in the service of G-d. He argued with G-d by the Burning Bush because he felt that his brother was far better suited for the job. However, once Moshe accepted the position as the Redeemer, he fearlessly confronted Pharaoh with confidence and determination.<br><br>Moshe's confidence was not a product of his own self- image. It was a reflection of his trust in G-d and the divinity of his mission. His talents and abilities had been given to him for the purpose of accomplishing G-d's requests. As the servant of G-d there was no cause for Moshe to demean Pharaoh or speak against him. At no time do we see Moshe venting any personal emotions. Moshe's only agenda was to serve G-d and deliver His message.<br><br>The character profile of Moshe is exactly as the Rambam plotted the Arrogance - Meekness continuum. In general, Moshe was accepting and respectful of all people without feeling superior to them in any way. He was exceedingly humble and recognized his talents and position as being tools with which to serve G-d. If his mission demanded a more aggressive stance, such as to protect the Jews, Moshe became fearless and strong. If the situation demanded deference and humility, such as in relation to his brother or father-in-law, Moshe became humble and obsequious.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By Rabbi Aron Tendler<br>TRUE GRATITUDE Part2<br><br>Humility is not simply a feeling or the way a person happens to be. The basis of humility is an active belief and trust in G-d, and it must be willfully developed. If a person believes that G-d truly created and maintains the universe, he must also believe that everything was created for a reason. Therefore, we must respect everything and every person as being intrinsic to G-d's purposes. Everything is therefore deserving of our appreciation and gratitude. Whether animate or inanimate, whether we are the direct or the indirect beneficiaries, we must recognize the holistic and interdependent nature of our universe and acknowledge our personal benefit in word and in deed.<br><br>It makes sense to say that, the more humble a person the greater his recognition of the Creator and his acknowledgement of the benefit he derives from the world around him. Therefore, Moshe had to show his appreciation and gratitude to the Nile River and the dirt of Egypt, not for the benefit of the water or the dirt, but as an acknowledgement of G-d's absolute control over all things.<br><br>When it came time for the first plague, G-d sent Moshe to greet Pharaoh "in the morning as he went out the water." Rashi references the Medresh that explains how Pharaoh attempted to declare himself a deity by virtue of his never having to go to the bathroom. In fact, he would wake up early and secretly go to the Nile River and take care of his needs.<br><br>In Bereshis 47:10, the Torah told us that Yakov blessed Pharaoh. Rashi referenced the Medresh Tanchumah that recorded what that blessing was. The Medresh says that Yakov blessed Pharaoh that the Nile River would rise at Pharaoh's command. Considering that Egyptian agriculture and economy depended upon the Nile River overflowing its banks and irrigating the fields, Yakov's blessing had profound and far- reaching benefits for Egypt. Additionally, it placed Pharaoh as the key figure responsible for the ongoing prosperity of his country.<br><br>G-d's intent in sending Moshe to speak to Pharaoh on the banks of the Nile River was two- fold. 1. Let Pharaoh know that Moshe knew that he wasn't a deity. 2. Give Pharaoh the chance of acknowledging his appreciation and gratitude to G-d and the Jews for all the benefit he had personally enjoyed by willfully granting the Jews their freedom.<br><br>Whenever the Torah presents us with an opposing figure or enemy, we must remember that G-d only chooses worthy adversaries for the Jews. The Nimrods and Pharaohs of the world were selected because they could otherwise have been partners with us in bringing the world closer to serving G-d. Instead, "they harden their hearts" and chose to oppose and oppress, rather than serve and benefit.<br><br>If Moshe was the most humble of all men, then Pharaoh had to have been the most arrogant of all men. If Moshe, as the most humble of all men, recognized his absolute dependency upon G-d and acknowledged his appreciation and gratitude for everything that G-d had provided for him; then Pharaoh, as the most arrogant of all men denied having anything to do with G-d. "Who is G-d that I should listen to His voice and send out the Children of Israel," (5:2) denied any appreciation to G-d for all the benefits he and his nation had enjoyed.<br><br>True appreciation and gratitude must be related to G-dly service. If the meaning behind gratitude is acknowledging the primacy of G-d and His intentions and recognizing how we are the beneficiaries of His providence, then it makes sense that we should only express appreciation to those things and individuals who willfully serve G-d through their actions. If someone willfully disregards G-d and does everything in his power to thwart G-d's plans, and yet G-d mercifully and lovingly makes it all come out to our benefit, that person is not deserving of our appreciation and gratitude.<br><br>Pharaoh was a worthy adversary to Moshe. He could have joined Moshe in serving the Jews and preparing them to receive the Torah and inherit Eretz Yisroel. Instead, he willfully chose to ignore G-d's primacy in his own life and the lives of his people and attempted to subjugate the Jews to his will rather than the will of G-d. As such, even the early years he invested in Moshe's upbringing were not deserving of appreciation and gratitude.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Vaera - To Ask or To Trust?<br>By Rabbi Aron Tendler<br><br>As the chosen redeemer of the Jewish people, what was Moshe's job description? History refers to Moshe as "Our Teacher." However, an analysis of Moshe's relationship with the Jewish people reveals a far more exacting and detailed job description.<br><br>Moshe's mission started at the Burning Bush when G-d said to him, "Go to Pharaoh and take the Jews out of Egypt." (3:10). For all intents and purposes, that was it for the job description. The interview was over, and Moshe had the job! Moshe was supposed to go to Pharaoh, and take the Jews out. That was it! What Moshe was supposed to say to Pharaoh and how he was to take the Jews out of Egypt were not explained. In fact, the only reason G-d continued talking to Moshe and gave him a bag of tricks with which to impress Pharaoh and the enslaved Jews was because Moshe began to question G-d. Had Moshe simply said, "OK, thank you!" off he would have gone to Egypt! What would have happened if Moshe had not questioned G-d? How different would the story of the Exodus have been?<br><br>I believe that an analysis of Moshe's exchange with G-d at the end of last week's Parsha, and G-d's answer to Moshe that continues in this week's Parsha reveals the answer.<br><br>In last week's Parsha it was decided that Moshe and Aharon would go to Pharaoh and tell him to let the Jews leave Egypt. As the Torah records, the confrontation did not go well and instead of the Jews being set free Pharaoh made their lot worse. The Jewish overseers verbally assaulted Moshe for making things worse and Moshe then complained to G-d. "Why have You done evil to this people, why have You sent me?"<br><br>There are two classic approaches to understand Moshe's question. 1. Moshe challenged G-d's justice. In his fervor and concern over the plight of the Jewish people, Moshe allowed himself the right to question G-d's judiciousness.<br><br>2. Moshe did not challenge G-d's judiciousness. Moshe was reflecting back on his own obvious inadequacies. Clearly, G-d's judiciousness could not be questioned. "G-d is a Rock and all His ways are just and perfect." However, G-d is limited by the actions of humans.<br><br>Whenever G-d works through a human agent, there is the possibility of that agent messing up. (Similar to the way computers must feel about us) If the human agent sins, or chooses to go against G-d's instructions, the original plan will not work. The result will of course be the same because G-d has unlimited resources with which to accomplish his intended goal. However, the original plan involving the human agent and allotted time schedule would have to be changed. Therefore, when the plan did not work as Moshe thought it would it was because Moshe was not worthy of being the medium through which G-d's power would be miraculously revealed.<br><br>G-d's response to Moshe must be analyzed in relation to both possible explanations of Moshe's complaint. According to Rashi, G-d immediately compared Moshe's questioning of either his own inadequacy or G-d's judiciousness to Avraham's unquestioning belief and loyalty. "Although I promised Avraham that his future children would come through Yitzchak, Avraham did not question Me when I told him to sacrifice Yitzchak! Yet, you now question my methods!" (Rashi 6:1)<br><br>Rashi's presentation of G-d's opening response easily follows the first of our possible explanations of Moshe's complaint. G-d was criticizing Moshe for questioning G-d's judiciousness by contrasting him with Avraham's absolute belief and trust in G-d. "Just as Avraham did not question My methods so too you should not question My methods."<br><br>In this week's Parsha, G-d continued his critique of Moshe's lack of trust. "In fact, Avraham had more reason to question My methods than Moshe. It was to Avraham that I had promised that Yitzchak would father a nation of children who would inherit the land of Canaan. Avraham lived to see two grandchildren and no more. He never lived to see the fulfillment of the promise. However, you Moshe are standing on the threshold of redemption. You are to be the fulfillment of My promise to Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov. What right do you have to question My judiciousness!" (Rashi, 6:2,3,4) However, according to the second explanation of Moshe's complaint, G-d's response does not seem to address Moshe's question. If Moshe was questioning his own inadequacies as the human agent and not G-d's judiciousness, how did the comparison with Avraham answer Moshe's doubts? If anything, it lent credence to Moshe's own sense of inadequacies. "Yes, You are absolutely right! I am inadequate. I am lacking in trust and belief. I am not an Avraham a Yitzchak or a Yaakov. They would have been deserving of revealing Your greatness in the world. I, as my own question reveals, am not worthy! Didn't I tell You to send someone else!"<br><br>The truth is that the comparison to the Forefathers was the perfect answer to Moshe's proclaimed inadequacy. Regardless of why, G-d had chosen Moshe to do the job. He was the one. Had G-d wanted to, He would have chosen someone else.<br><br>The truth is that Moshe was the perfect person for the job for the very reasons that he appeared to be inadequate. G-d wanted a human agent who on his own could not have possibly gotten the job done. Therefore, it would be clear to the world that G-d was the One Who had taken the Jews out of slavery and no one else.<br><br>Moshe was to one day be proclaimed by G-d as "the most humble of all men to have ever lived." However, there are times when humility is a weakness rather than a strength. Humility that recognizes ability but avoids arrogance is a virtue. Humility that denies ability and responsibility is a weakness. In last week's Parsha, G-d would have killed Moshe if not for Tziporah's quick intervention. This shows that G-d was prepared to pull the plug on Operation Moses if Moshe proved to be inadequate. Had that happened, we most likely would have never heard about Moshe's miraculous birth, development, and demise. Instead, the story of the Exodus would have had a different set of players and events. The result would have been the same. The Jews would have been freed and G-d's greatness would have been revealed. Therefore, it was incumbent upon Moshe to accept that he was the chosen Redeemer, whether he understood it or not, whether he wanted the job or not.<br><br>When Moshe confronted G-d by questioning his own adequacy for the job of Redeemer, he questioned G-d's methods. Moshe was not ignorant of his own actions. Moshe knew whether he had sinned between the time he was given the job and the time he stood before Pharaoh. He had not! The one sin of not giving his son a Bris had been dealt with. Therefore, Moshe should have proceeded with absolute confidence that what he was doing was playing a role in a script that had been carefully scripted by G-d. Regardless of his questions and doubts, G-d was in charge.<br><br>G-d compared Moshe to Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yakov because they epitomized trust. Regardless of why Moshe questioned G-d's plan, it reflected a lack of trust in G-d's handling of the operation. True, Moshe was to be the most humble of all men, however, G-d wanted to make sure that his humility was a virtue and not a weakness.<br><br>Had Moshe accepted the job from the very beginning without questioning his own inadequacy or his trust in G-d, the story of the Exodus would have been far more profound and revealing. Moshe would have gone directly to Pharaoh, told him that G-d had sent him with the message, "Let My people go!" and Pharaoh would have said "Yes, go!" That would have been it! No plagues, no other miracles, just a simple go! That would have been the greatest miracle of all. As my Grandfather Zt'l writes in Darash Moshe, it would have been the manifestation of the G-d who sets limits to the world and has absolute control over all things, including the actions of humans. When it was the time for redemption and the end of slavery Pharaoh would have let the Jews go! It would have revealed that the enslavement was for a reason and that G-d was the absolute ruler of all things including time and circumstance. Instead, Moshe argued with G-d and questioned His methodology necessitating a bag of tricks and miracles to reveal G-d's greatness<br></div>

Often people tried to help Ellen, but she just smiled and said she didn't want for anything. When asked why she lived as she did, Ellen said, "God has made sure that I've had enough to get by on. I don't need any more than that. He and I have a nice deal. When He needs me, He lets me know and shows me what I can do, and when I need Him, all I have to do is call.

He was a man whom God saw as worthy of a request that had significant consequences for him and his family. His name was Jabez. Here is how the Scripture describes him:<br><br>Jabez was more honorable than his brothers. His mother had named him Jabez, saying, "I gave birth to him in pain." Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, "Oh, that You would bless me and enlarge my territory! Let Your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain." And God granted his request (1 Chronicles 4:9-10).<br><br>When you think of territory, you probably think of land or some area in which you have dominion. Jesus often spoke about giving responsibility based on what we do with the little things first. Jabez must have been a very responsible person. God describes him as honorable. Jabez must have understood what it really means to be blessed by God. He was a man who knew what it meant to press into God and ask for God's favor with passion. God saw the heart of this man and gave him his request. His borders were enlarged! He lived a life free from pain. Imagine that!<br><br>The only reason God will enlarge a person's territory is that He knows that person will use it responsibly. He will steward what is given in light of God's Kingdom. God truly wants to increase our territory to have greater influence in the world around us. That territory can mean personal influence and/or physical territories.<br><br>It is rare to have a life without pain. Pain is often necessary to mold us and shape us. This is the only exception I have seen in Scripture. Jabez must have been quite a man with incredible integrity and purity of heart.<br><br>Are you this kind of person? Can God enlarge your territory and entrust you to use it for His purposes? Ask God today to enlarge your territory. Ask Him to make you the kind of man or woman who is worthy of such trust.<br></div>

One of the responsibilities of the Holy Spirit is to reveal His plans and purposes to us. They may be hidden for a time, but if we seek Him with our whole heart, we can know what He has given to us.<br><br>John the Baptist understood this principle. When asked if he was the Messiah, he replied, "A man can receive only what is given him from heaven" (Jn. 3:27). John understood his role in the Kingdom of God. He came to pave the way for the Messiah; he was not the Messiah himself. His ministry on earth was very brief, yet Jesus described his life in this way: " 'I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he' " (Mt. 11:11).<br><br>Once we understand what God has given to us, we can walk freely in our calling. However, if we strive to walk in a role that He never gave us, it will result in frustration and failure. God wants to reveal His plan to us by His Spirit. This requires a willingness to seek and accept what He gives us. It may be different from what we thought. It may require adjustments to follow His path for our lives. As we learn from the life of John the Baptist, obedience requires death to our own wills.<br><br>Ask God to reveal what He has freely given to you. Pray that you receive and embrace only those things He has reserved for you to receive and to accomplish in your life. Then you can be assured of a life full of meaning and purpose, and you can look forward to hearing those all-important words someday, "Well done, My good and faithful servant."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Fine-tuned Instrument<br>Os Hillman<br><br>...I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on My name and I will answer them; I will say, "They are My people," and they will say, "The Lord is our God." - Zechariah 13:9<br><br>My former business career was as an owner of an advertising agency. Over the years, I had the privilege to work on many different and prestigious accounts. One of those accounts was Steinway Pianos, the maker of the world's finest pianos. Each piano has always been made from scratch; it takes over a year to make one Steinway. The most impressive scene as I toured the manufacturing plant was the place where the soundboard is stretched to its maximum tolerance and allowed to sit for an extended period until it remains in the curved design. This was done in an off-to-the-corner part of the plant. If the wood were alive, it would be crying out for mercy.<br><br>After an extended time of stretching, the wood will never spring back to its original state. It is permanently changed. The piano is becoming a fine-tuned instrument. After this process takes place, the next step requires another point of stress. It takes 11 tons of pressure on a piano to tune it. Each step in the process moves the piano closer to a finished product that will ultimately be played by the world's finest musicians. These musicians desire a particular sound that only a piano like this can make.<br><br>God looks at each of us as a fine-tuned instrument. However, we begin as rough wood that He desires to transform into gold. Tuning us requires certain experiences that will stretch our faith, our frame, and our very life. Sainthood springs out of suffering. If we can stand the strain of this intense process, we will come forth as gold-as a sweet-smelling offering to our Maker. When we are in the midst of these times, it feels like fire. It is painful to be stretched beyond our perceived limits, but the Lord knows this is necessary for us to become an instrument that can play a beautiful song that others will seek after.<br><br>Let the master Craftsman have His way in your life today. You will be pleased with the instrument He fashions.</div>

The Lord delights in seeing those children of His who truly understand the meaning of life and why there is only one thing worth seeking God Himself.<br><br>I can always tell when I have not been seeking God. The cares of this life, the urgent over the important, and the petty irritations-these are the symptoms of a life that has not been in the presence of God. Do we understand, really understand? That is the question God raises to each of us today. If we understand, then why do we spend day after day toiling and fretting over what doesn't matter? Can we set proper boundaries in our lives that don't allow our time with Him to be continually stolen away? It is a challenge in a world that screams "activity, activity!"<br><br>Do you have a consistent time of seeking Him in your life? Are you committed to developing that intimacy with your Lord that He so desires? If not, ask Him today to help you. This is the longing of His heart. Ask Him to make it the longing of your heart. Then you will demonstrate to Him that you understand, and you will be a seeker of God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bo - Kid's Play<br><br>by Rabbi Chaim Dovid Green<br><br>This week's parsha contains the last three plagues which Egypt was smitten with. Before the 8th plague - locusts, Pharaoh temporarily agrees to send the Jews, and asks Moshe who he wants to take along on the trip to the wilderness to serve G-d. "Go and serve G-d, who and who is going?" "And Moshe said 'with our young and old we will go, with our sons and our daughters...because we have a celebration of G-d'" (Exodus 10:8-9). Pharaoh then replies "not so, let the men go and serve G-d, because that is what you are requesting" (Exodus 10:11).<br><br>The problem is that nowhere do we find that Moshe requested that only the men should go while everyone else remains. This question is addressed by the author of the work "Kometz Mincha". He quotes a midrash which explains on a deeper level why Pharaoh used the word "who" twice. Pharaoh asked "who and who is going?" This is figuratively referring to what is stated in Psalms (24:3), "_WHO_ may ascend the mountain of G-d, and _WHO_ can stand (remain) in His holy place?" The Psalm goes on to explain the strength of character of he who is great enough to ascend G-d's mountain and remain there.<br><br>The midrash conveys to us that this is why Pharaoh erroneously assumed that only adult men would go. Not to say that Pharaoh knew those two passages from Psalms (which had not yet been composed). The passages are quoted in the midrash because their theme depicts what was on Pharaoh's mind. He thought that service of G-d is really only for those few people completely dedicated to serving G-d with every fiber. Pharaoh felt that he was being generous to let _all_ of the men go. He could not conceive of the possibility that men, woman, and children would all have a part in the service. Moshe had never requested that only the men go, but that was Pharaoh's understanding of Moshe's request.<br><br>But Moshe's resounding words still echoed: "...with our young and old we will go, with our sons and our daughters...because we have a celebration of G-d."<br><br>In the traditional Jewish experience everyone participates. Everyone has a role to play; no one is exempt, and no one is insignificant. Everyone has an opportunity and an obligation to carry out their part in serving G-d. The young escort the old and they participate and learn from the experience. Moshe even placed the young before the old ("with our young and old we will go") to show the importance of the youth being present. Our relationship with G-d is a shared relationship. So too, the experience is meant to be shared. Particularly where people would be participating enthusiastically in serving G-d, at the mountain where He appeared to Moshe, was it an ideal atmosphere for all to witness and share in.<br><br>The Talmud says "if there are no kids, where will the old goats come from?" The Talmud also describes how things were in the days of Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Gamla. "If a boy had a father, then his father would teach him Torah. If he had no father, he wouldn't learn. The Rabbis saw the danger in this, and they set up teachers in Jerusalem for those boys to come and learn from." Eventually, teachers were arranged all over Israel to teach the boys who had no one else to teach them. Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Gamla was at the helm of this, and he virtually saved Torah observance.<br><br>Why did they originally institute the teachers only in Jerusalem? Shouldn't education be an equal opportunity for all, in every locality? The reason is that Jerusalem was filled with people dedicated to serving G-d. It was the perfect atmosphere for a young man to grow and see examples of people he could emulate. It was better that the students should come to Jerusalem, than that teachers should go to them.<br><br>A large segment of the emigrating European generation sought a better life for their children on the shores of the "New World". They made great sacrifices to expose their children to new experiences which they could use to better themselves financially. They succeeded. Were they, perhaps, too successful?<br><br>The lesson Moshe teaches us is that we're all in it together. The Jewish people wherever they may be, comprise one body, as it were. So too, from the beginning of Jewish history to the end - all of the generations - make up one unified body. Our service of G-d through Torah observance is what makes us a cohesive unit. Torah observance remains where positive examples are set for the young, and where Jewish education is provided. This is the approach which Moshe initiated for us 3,300 years ago.<br><br>Pharaoh's concept of how to serve G-d is pronounced dead on arrival. Moshe proclaims for all to hear "with our young and old we will go, with our sons and our daughters..." This is the only way to carry Jewish ideals over into the next generation.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oy Vey!<br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>"Don't get mad," said the philosophers of the eighties, "get even."<br><br>I am not sure if the objective of the ten plagues was for the Almighty to get even with the nation that had enslaved His people. Certainly there are Midrashic sources that correlate the ten plagues as direct punishment for Egyptian crimes against the Jewish people. (Tana D'bei Eliyahu Chapter 7) So perhaps we might say that the Jewish people got even.<br>There is, however, no scriptural reference to the fact that they got mad. In fact, each time Moshe went to Pharaoh a serene and calculated negotiation occurred. "Let My people serve Me," Moshe commanded. When Pharaoh refused his obstinence was met with a clear and calculated threat. "If you refuse to allow the people to leave, I will send the following plague in you land." And so it went. Sometimes a plague immediately followed a warning, other times plagues came with no warning at all. When Pharaoh found Moshe and arranged for a cessation of the scourge, Pharaoh reneged on his commitment soon after. Moshe became frustrated, perhaps he even became impatient, but there was no anger until the final plague. Then, he not only got even, he got mad.<br><br>Moshe warned Pharaoh with the words of Hashem, "At about midnight, I will go out in the midst of Egypt and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die." (Exodus 11:4) Though Moshe detailed the ramifications of the plague he was greeted with an apathetic response.<br><br>Finally the Torah tells us, that "Moshe left Pharaoh in burning anger" (Exodus 11:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Why, only then did Moshe storm out in a rage? Was he not accustomed to the callous recklessness of the Egyptian leader? What irked him during the last encounter more than any of the previous ones?<br><br>The great physicist Albert Einstein escaped the Nazi inferno to find a haven in the United States. During World War II his letter to President Roosevelt initiated the effort that spurred the creation of the atomic bomb. His theory of relativity was a prime factor in its development, and Einstein knew the destructive power that his ideas could potentially release. When Einstein heard in an August 6, 1945, radio broadcast that an atomic device was dropped on the city of Hiroshima, he reacted with stunned silence. After a moment of somber reflection he only found two words to say. "Oy vey!"<br><br>Rabbi Shimon Schwab (d.1994) explains that Moshe had patience with Pharaoh up to a point. Throughout the ordeal, the reckless king's obstinate decisions caused a great amount of discomfort to his people. Even when his advisors pleaded, "How long will this man [Moshe] be an obstacle, let them [the Jews] serve their G-d," Pharaoh refused. His recalcitrance brought plagues of pestilence, boils, locust, and darkness -- in addition to blood, frogs, and lice. All of these afflictions were vastly uncomfortable -- but not fatal. Even the fiery hail did not harm the G-d-fearing Egyptians that sought shelter.<br><br>The last, the Plague of the First Born, had the most devastating ramifications. It meant the deaths of thousands of Egyptians "from the firstborn son of Pharaoh to those of the maidservant who was behind the millstone." It was devastation so powerful that the Torah says that "such has never been and will never be again." (Exodus 11:6) Pharaoh was able to stop the imminent destruction with one simple word -- "Go." Yet he chose to remain steadfast in his denial, bringing the downfall of his people and the death of innocents. And that callous and reckless behavior infuriated Moshe, whose compassion for the simplest of beings earned him the right to be the leader of the Jewish nation. The stark contrast displayed by his nemesis appalled him to the point of rage. The Torah commands us, "do not to hate the Egyptian, for you were a sojourner in his land." (Deuteronomy 23:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> The Torah's attitude toward a nation that held us captive is even more compassionate than that of its own leaders. Barbaric leaders egging on many simple people throughout the world, to act in a self-destructive manner are reminiscent of the Pharaoh who destroyed his own family to save his ego. It's enough to make anybody -- even the most humble man who ever lived -- very angry.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Just Do It!<br>by Rabbi Pinchas Avruch<br><br>With all of the dazzling events in this week's parsha - the plagues of locusts, darkness and the killing of the firstborn, leading to the release of the Jewish nation from Egyptian servitude - one of the most significant transformations almost gets lost in the fray. In a prelude to the forthcoming revelation at Sinai, the Jewish people start to receive the Divine commands that are the framework of our life long pursuit of G-d consciousness, the mitzvos.<br><br>One of the first mitzvos they receive is that of the Korban Pesach (Paschal sacrifice). "On the tenth of the month (of Nissan) you shall take, each man a lamb for the father's house, a lamb for the household...And it shall a safekeeping for you until the fourteenth day..." (Shemos/Exodus 12:3,6) But the mitzvah to set aside the lamb four days early was unique to that first year. Why were the Jews in Egypt given this special condition? Rashi explains that when they did take the sheep, Moshe said "Draw and take for yourselves a sheep" (12:21); two verbs were needed because the Jewish people in Egypt were steeped in idolatry and the lamb was one of the deities, thus the action of setting aside the sacrifice involved withdrawing from heathen worship and taking a lamb for the service of G-d, for the performance of a mitzvah.<br><br>But how has this answered the question? How does their idolatrous state explain the four day delay? First, they, like the entirety of the Egyptian populace, had just witnessed nine stunning miracles, nine awesome displays of G-d's absolute majesty over nature purely for the benefit of the Children of Israel. How at this point could they entertain the possibility that there is any power in the universe other than G-d? And if, somehow, they would maintain a faith in idols, then they would not perform the service of slaughtering the lamb. Surely they could not commit such an act against their god. So what did that generation gain in the four days that served to draw them away from idolatry?<br><br>Rabbi Alter Henach Leibowitz (Rosh Yeshiva/Dean of Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim in Forest Hills, Queens, New York) expounds that in the deepest reaches of their hearts there was a penetration of the heathenous philosophies that even the nine plagues could not uproot. Yes, there was now an intellectual appreciation that G-d is the only force in the universe, but that would not budge the inculcated belief that came from decades of practice. This non-emotional acknowledgement would EVEN allow them to complete the rites of the Korban Pesach, but deep down in the core of their being, the idolatrous beliefs would still be intact. True and complete cleansing was possible only through contemplative action. The physical exercise of premeditatedly setting aside a lamb and appreciating the significance this lamb played in his service of G-d had the impact to truly bleach the heart of decades of idol worship, more than did the witnessing of the first nine plagues.<br><br>We often talk of the Torah we would like to study, the acts of chesed (kindness) in which we would like to participate, the lashon hara (slanderous gossip) we wish we did not speak. The common response is "Actions speak louder than words," but it is much more than that. Action is not the way we express our sincerity. Action is the way we CREATE our sincerity. The only way we can truly uproot the old and supplant it with the new and improved is to force ourselves to go through the motions and generate the new habits.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You Are What You Eat<br>Volume 5 Issue 15<br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>After 210 years on foreign soil, many filled with sadistic slavery, the Jewish people get a taste of freedom. The Egyptian oppressors are devastated with plagues, and the Jews are readied for freedom. But before they are released, they are charged with two mitzvos. The sanctification and establishment of the New Moon, and the laws of the Korbon Pesach (Passover Lamb). These mitzvos entail some of the most complex statutes in the entire realm of Jewish law. Establishing new months and setting the calendar entails knowledge of astronomical calculations and celestial sophistication that was hardly a charge for a slave nation! The laws of the Passover sacrifice are defined in intricate detail, not only pertaining to its preparation, but the way the sacrifice is eaten, and who may partake of it.<br><br>First, the Torah tells us that the offering may only be eaten with those who have been pre-designated as members of the festive meal. The Torah also instructs that the lamb must be wholly roasted, not one piece may be pan-fried or boiled. The Torah also commands how the lamb is eaten. It must be eaten in a rush -- after all, the Jews were about to exit Egypt -- and there was no time for long, drawn-out festivities. In fact, the Torah tells the nation to eat the korbon with their back packs readied and their staffs in hand! The instructions continue. "You must not break a bone. Do not leave over any meat." The lamb was to be eaten meticulously, every bit of meat was to be finished, yet no one was allowed to sink their teeth into it to the extent that the tender lamb's bone would break.<br><br>One may ask: Why is the introduction to Judaism so abstruse and replete with detail? After all, the nation had been slaves for 210 years! Time was never a factor, let alone a lunar calendar. They probably never ate meat, the god of the Egyptians, for the duration of that time. Why not as soon-to-be free men were they not allowed to indulge the way they wanted, in high style and with unmitigated freedom? Why is the first allowance of carnivorous cuisine so restricted and detailed? Shouldn't the first commands to a fledgling people be simple feel-good symbolism?<br><br>Dr. Viktor E. Frankel was a longtime prisoner in the bestial concentration camps of Nazi Germany. His parents, brother, and wife were killed and cremated in the ovens. Yet as a psychiatrist he devised a method of survival through the ravages of sadistic barbarism, detailed in his work, Man's Search for Meaning. He writes that though the Nazi's goal was to every eradicate every human trait, "hunger, humiliation, fear and deep anger are rendered tolerable by closely guarded images of beloved persons, by religion, and even by the healing beauties of a tree or a sunset." Frankel describes how he learned to relish every physical and spiritual entity he could grasp. These small acts would elevate their humanity. Scraps of wood formed pieces of meaningful art. He would analyze in his few free seconds every bit of good that was left to his existence.<br><br>One evening a fellow prisoner rushed into the barracks and asked him to run out to the assembly grounds to watch the beautiful sunset. He whole sky became alive with clouds of ever-changing shapes and colors, from steel-gray to blood-red. They watched the contrast of the majestic billows compared to the muddy-brown earth-tethered huts. After minutes of moving silence the prisoners turned to each other, "how beautiful the world could be."<br><br>Every nuance of life is actually filled with spiritual opportunities. By affording the nation two initial two commands that were replete with thousands of details, later expounded upon through thousands of pages of Talmudic and Halachic literature, The Holy One opened a new outlook to the formerly bonded. The moon that they watched for 210 years now became the embryo of spirituality. The sign of its lumens would herald the New Year and the Festivals. The experience of eating meat would become a royal meal filled with mitzvos and responses to Hashem's command. There would be no chomping at bones like barbarians. Cooked in a precise and instructed manner, every step of a seeming earthly - even physical -- act took on a magnificent sense of spirituality. Those most intricate, detail and sophisticated acts forged slaves into princes. Every detail was filled with spirituality and cognizance. There were messages of dignity, of restraint. No more were they starving prisoners grabbing any available food. These prisoners needed to reserve a place to dine. The slow means of preparation entailed finesse and patience; not one morsel was allowed to be eaten raw. Instead of grabbing the food and sinking their teeth straight to the bone, they were warned, do not shatter a bone! And they could not nibble at it and leave some over, as they were commanded not to leave any meat over. In the minutest detail there is great magnitude. And in the magnitude of those actions lie the magnitude of man who recognizes the magnitude of his Creator. Good Shabbos (c)1999 Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guaranteed--Overnight--Delivery<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>And they went and they did, the Children of Israel, just as HASHEM commanded Moshe and Aaron, so they did. (Shemos 12:2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>And they went: Did they already do it? Were they not just now commanded on Rosh Chodesh? Rather since they accepted upon themselves it is considered as if they did it already. (Rashi- Mechilta)<br><br>How potent are those seemingly extra words, Â“And they wentÂ”? WhatÂ’s the big deal about choosing or accepting? What can be greater than doing? Â“All is (measured) according to a majority of deedsÂ” the Mishne in Avos tells us. How is committing to action on par at all with performing?<br><br>Within the categories of thought, speech, and action are sub-categories. There is the thought of thought, the speech of thought, and the action of thought. A person enters a department store. It is filled with millions of items. Only a dozen are picked up, examined, and entertained for purchase. Only a few will actually be selected and paid for. So it is with pictures and ideas. Some flash past our radar- unheeded. Others are toyed with and observed casually. A chosen few shots are fully developed, blown up larger than life, and hung as posters on the walls of our minds. The action of thought is in a sense like an action.<br><br>Â“When a person commits to an action or accepts words of reproofÂ”, writes Rabbenu Yona, Â“that person in one instant goes out from darkness to a great light. Because at that moment that he tends his ear and makes attentive his heart, he understands and accepts the words of the speaker to fulfill them and to live up to them from today and further, and to be cautiously adherent to the words of those who know Torah wisdom and understand the times, at that very moment, with his Teshuvah he is transformed into a different person. From the time that he accepts all this in his thoughts and he his is committed so in his heart he acquires for himself the merit and reward of all future Mitzvos and lessons, and he is greatly enriched because he has corrected his soul in one moment.Â” And so our sages of blessed memory said, Â“They went and they did, the Children of IsraelÂ”. ImmediatelyÂ…since they accepted upon themselves to do, it is considered as if they did it already in the present.Â”<br><br>LetÂ’s marvel for one moment at the power of one moment. Like a seed, that developed thought contains in the present all the future accomplishments coded within. One is credited as having studied the entire Talmud in the moment one commits seriously to do so. All of the grandeur of Shabbos is contained in that second one chooses again to Â“keep the Shabbos holyÂ”. So too an abundance of purity is there in the DNA of that initial decision to guard oneÂ’s speech.<br><br>A Shabbos guest told us how and why he came to Yeshiva. He had been dabbling in learning and considering taking time out to learn. He was not entirely convinced it was the right thing to do. He was dogged by doubting thoughts he couldnÂ’t shake. He was driving Up-State New York on the Thruway along a stretch of Â“no exitÂ”- highway. His mind was turning this way and that. Â“Should I or shouldnÂ’t I?Â”<br><br>Then he couldnÂ’t hold back anymore and he blurted out, Â“If itÂ’s the right thing G-d then show me!Â” Just at that instant, believe it or not, he found himself boxed in for the next twelve miles by two huge trucks that seemed to have appeared from nowhere. One was now in front and the other hemmed him in on left with bold writing -the acronym for, Â“Guaranteed Overnight DeliveryÂ”- Â“GÂ”-Â“OÂ”-Â“DÂ”. His decision was sealed. It was then as if he had already accomplished all. And so the Children of Israel in a moment otherwise lost were able to find for all time Guaranteed--Overnight--Delivery.<br><br></div>
