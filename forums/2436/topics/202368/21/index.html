            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Don't Bring Up Past Mistakes Part2</strong><br><br>Amalek dwells.Â”1 What was the reason they (the spies Moshe sent to look over the land of Canaan) began their report with an account of Amalek? This is comparable to someone who did a bad deed and was punished with a strap. When it is necessary to frighten him, we remind him of the strap. So also, Amalek was a frightening reminder for Israel. The spiesÂ’ intention was to discourage Israel, as it is written, Â“And they swayed the hearts of the children of Israel.2<br><br>Â“And Calev calmed (the Jewish people).Â”3 In the beginning Calev told the Jewish people that he was united with them in their but in his heart he knew the truth was otherwise, as it is written, Â“And I answered the thing that was in my heart.Â”4 And G-d testified that Calev never really agreed with the other spies, as it is written, Â“And my servant, Calev, since he had another spirit with him.Â”5<br><br>When the spies said, Â“Calev is trustworthy,Â” he immediately stood on a bench and clamed all of Israel, since they were shouting at Moshe, as it is written, Â“And Calve calmed the people towards MosheÂ”.6 Because the people thought that he was going to say lashon hara, they kept quiet and let him talk. (Yalkut 743, par. Vayelchu)<br><br>What did the spies do wrong in mentioning the nation of Amalek at the beginning of their account? Mentioning Amalek was similar to a strap, and corporal punishment can, under certain circumstances, be a justifiable means of influencing peopleÂ’s behavior; so what specifically was wrong with the spies implementing it here? Why did Calev fool the other spies by telling them he was united with them? Why was Calev allowed to use deceit in his plans to persuade the Jewish people? Why did G-d have to testify for Calev? Why did Calev stand on a bench to speak immediately after the other spies said he was trustworthy? What did Calev gain by calming everyone?<br><br>Amalek was a name dreaded by the Jewish people. This was the nation that attacked Israel first when they went in the desert. Our Sages say that Amalek Â“cooled down the bath.Â”7 This is explained as meaning that all the nations were afraid to attack Israel after it left Egypt, since they had heard of all the miracles that G-d had performed for the Jews. But Amalek was the only one that had no fear, and once they had attacked, this was Â“cooling down the bath,Â” in the sense that other nations were no longer afraid to attack them.<br><br>This incident with Amalek left an indelible impression on Israel, because Amalek was a fearless nation that craved the destruction of the Jewish people. The spies played off IsraelÂ’s trepidation by telling them that Amalek would have to be dealt with as soon as they entered the land of Israel. This was a clever technique to instill fright in the peopleÂ’s hearts, since everyone knew that Amalek was ruthless.<br><br>It was wrong for the spies to use Amalek as a threat to the Jewish people, because corporal punishment can only be justified when needed to educate, but not when it is a deterrent to proper behavior. If the Jewish people were sinning, it would have been useful to remind them of the possibility that Amalek could attack them, so as to influence them to repent. But in this situation, when they were supposed to enter Israel, it was a time when they needed encouragement and the assurance that they would succeed with G-dÂ’s help against all their enemies. Using AmalekÂ’s name at such a time to frighten them, only succeeded in achieving the opposite effect.<br><br>Calev fooled the other spies by telling them that he was united with them. He was allowed to use deceit in his plans to persuade the Jewish people, since he felt it was the only way to fight against the terror that the spies were instilling in the Jewish people. He had to use deception in order to be able to show them how wrong the other spies were. He saw that the resentment against Moshe was so great that anyone siding with him would not even be allowed to speak. Seeing this to be the reality of the situation, Calev used a concept mentioned in Tehillim, Â“With someone crooked, be crooked.Â”8 Since the other spies were using deceit to influence the Jewish people, Calev used the same weapon to discredit them.<br><br>Anyone who had seen this whole incident, would have thought that initially Calev truly believed in the opinion of the spies. He was such a good actor, that it was impossible to know that truth of his opinions. Therefore, we need G-dÂ’s testimony to tell us that there was not even the slightest thought in CalevÂ’s mind that the spies were correct. Since the human eye could not have detected this, G-d had to present the truth. Even the fact that Calev sided openly with Moshe would not be enough to convince us that the felt that way from the very beginning. Only G-dÂ’s testimony would put him above suspicion. Calev stood on a bench to refute the other spiesÂ’ opinion immediately after they said he was trustworthy. The reason for this could be that Calev was looking for an opportunity to begin his defense of Moshe, but did not find one. When he heard his name being mentioned as a loyal opponent of Moshe, he realized that this was the best time to step forward and voice his dissent, now that he had their full attention and was considered trustworthy.<br><br>What did Calev gain by calming everyone? He felt that he could not speak at all as long as there was such a vocal opposition again Moshe. He thought it not possible to shout above all the noise that the excited people were making. In order for his words to have any effect, he needed quiet , so that he could be heard clearly. Therefore, in order to draw their attention, he started with words they wanted to hear, Â“Is that the only thing that Moshe did to us?Â” implying that he would further denigrate Moshe with his upcoming comment. After that opening he had their attention and was able to say what he really felt about Moshe.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DonÂ’t Bring Up Past Mistakes Part3</strong><br><br>Reminding Israel of their encounter with Amalek brought down their spirits. So too, in marriage we can cause our spouses great sorrow when we remind them of their past problems and mistakes. Usually one says this sort of unkind words when he is angry and wants to make his spouse suffer too. Such a cruel act hurts terribly, especially if the person being reminded has already repented. It does not make sense to torment a person who has repented, since if G-d readily accepts repentance, surely we should also.<br><br>By bluntly pointing out your spouseÂ’s past mistakes, it is as if you are saying that your are flawless and have nothing to correct. However, it is obvious that everyone makes mistakes and that on one is perfect. Our Sages say, Â“Decorate yourself first, and then decorate others.Â”9 Before you criticize others, blemishes. Otherwise, in addition to making yourself seem unjustifiably self-righteous, the other person will not be at all inclined to accept your criticism, since he sees that you are doing nothing to correct your own behavior.<br><br>When a person is anxious about something, he is liable to take out his anxiety on his spouse. This is often true because he can easily find mistakes in her, since he sees her constantly. Obviously, it is not fair to make your spouse a scapegoat, since no one is to blame for your anxiety except yourself.<br><br>Think about what is bothering you and talk it over with your spouse to see if you can find ways to alleviate that anxiety. In any event, your spouse should not be made to suffer because of you. Be mature enough to handle your problems without burdening your spouse with them.<br><br>Whenever possible, it is a good idea to refrain from speaking for a least half an hour after you become angry. That will give you time for your anger to cool down. If you react immediately, you are bound to make mistakes. Additionally, make sure to speak quietly and not to raise your voice when you must speak. These two valuable pieces of advice will save you from the many troubles that arise from anger.<br><br>The spies tried to discourage the Jewish people from entering the land by reminding them of the incident of Amalek. From that reminder, the people became discouraged and lost confidence. We should take this lesson to hear and take special care not to remind our spouses of uncomfortable memories; otherwise we will be committing a terrible sin just as the spies did. Instead we must concentrate all our efforts on reminding our spouses of their successes and encourage them to higher levels of achievement. This can only make our marriages stronger and more loving.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prisoner of Unconscious<br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>Near the end of this week's parsha, the Torah tells how Yoseph is falsely accused of adultery and is sent to prison. During Yoseph's detention "Hashem was with Yoseph, He was endowed with charm and had much favor in the eyes of the warden. In fact, the warden placed all the other prisoners in Yoseph's custody and Yoseph was in charge of all their duties. The warden trusted everything that Yoseph did and, everything that Yoseph discharged was successful" (Genesis 39:21-23).<br><br>In addition to the Divine Providence that cloaked Yoseph, another striking incident occurred. Back at Pharaoh's palace, the king's was served wine with an insect floating in it, and a foreign substance was baked into Pharaoh's bread. The baker and butler were both jailed for those breaches, and were placed in Yoseph's charge. After a year in prison, theu both dreamt a strange dream. Yoseph, Divinely ordained, interpreted each dream in amazingly accurate fashion. He predicted that the baker would be executed for his infraction while the wine steward would be returned to his former position and stature. Yoseph, convinced at the power of his predictions, did not stop with mere interpretations. He implored the wine steward to discuss his own plight with Pharaoh. "If only you would think of me when Pharaoh benefits you, and mention me to Pharaoh, then you will get me out of here," pleaded Yoseph (Genesis 40:14). Yoseph erred. The wine-steward completely ignored Yoseph's requests and left him to languish in prison for another two years. In fact, upon mentioning Yoseph to Pharaoh, the butler even referred to him in a very disparaging manner.<br><br>The midrash explains that this response, or lack thereof, was a heavenly punishment. Yoseph should not have urged a mortal man to be the vehicle of his release. He should have rather placed more faith in Hashem. Many commentaries are bothered by this midrash. They ask, "is it not one's duty to employ the help of others? Why should Yoseph have relied solely on Hashem? What is wrong with asking for help from below instead of relying solely on the One Above?<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prisoner of Unconscious Part2<br><br>My grandfather, Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetzky, of blessed memory, had a keen sense of direction, not only in spiritual life, but on the mundane streets of the city as well. He was once in a car together with a colleague, a Rosh Yeshiva (dean) of a prestigious Yeshiva. That particular Rosh Yeshiva was a nervous individual and panicked when the driver, a student of his, lost his way in an area of the city that was not accustomed to welcoming rabbis with open arms. The young man wanted desperately to get back on the highway. "Please," pleaded the Rosh Yeshiva of his student, "freg a politzmahn (ask a policeman)!"<br><br>Reb Yaakov interrupted. "You needn't ask. I know the way." Reb Yaakov turned his attention to the driver. "Continue for two blocks, make a left. After the first light, you make another left. Make an immediate right and you will see the entrance to the highway that we need."<br><br>Reb Yaakov's colleague was not convinced. "Please," he insisted of the driver, "ask a policeman!" The student felt obliged to listen to his Rosh Yeshiva, and spotted a police car on the other side of the street, two blocks away. Quickly he made a U-turn, drove the two blocks, and stopped the officer. "Excuse me, officer, asked the nervous driver, "how do you get back on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway?"<br><br>The officer saw the two sages in the back seat of the car and realized the severity of the situation. He began to explain the directions. "First of all, turn back around and go four blocks. Then make a left. After the first light, you make another left. Make an immediate right and you will see the entrance to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway."<br><br>My grandfather turned to his colleague and smiled.

            <div class='col-md body'>Prisoner of Unconscious Part3<br><br>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (who incidentally was not the other Rosh Yeshiva) explains that there are two types of individuals. There are those who have no heavenly signs, and the thought of Hashem is quite distant from them. Then there are those whose every action is blessed with the guidance of a spiritual force. It is almost as if Hashem is walking hand in hand with them or even as if Hashem is sitting next to them. Yoseph should have realized that the events that transpired in the prison cell were supernaturally divine. Within one year of entering prison, he is charged with the welfare of every prisoner. Then, two Egyptian stewards were sent to be with him, and each had a dream that Yoseph, divinely inspired, interpreted in prophetic fashion. At that point, Yoseph should have understood that his freedom was imminent. Hashem, through His own mysterious yet miraculous ways would surely get him out of jail. The wine-steward was extremely impressed when Yoseph's interpretation pro ved correct. Yoseph did not have to implore the steward twice with requests for mercy.<br><br>When G-d is driving, there is no need to ask for directions.<br></div>

In the preceding weekly portion, the concept of accepting the Yoke of the Heavenly Kingship is discussed. It would seem at first that a commitment to fulfill all of the mitzvos is included in the acceptance of HaShem's rulership. After all, if one accepts HaShem's dominion over oneself, it automatically follows that one is obligated to fulfill HaShem's laws - the mitzvos. Why, then, is the idea of accepting the mitzvos discussed as a separate concept?<br><br>There is an important aspect to the concept of accepting the mitzvos that is not included in the idea of accepting HaShem's dominion. This aspect is the importance of fulfilling the mitzvos out of love for HaShem, and not only because HaShem is the Ruler of the Universe. This significant aspect of fulfilling the mitzvos out of love for Hashem is not necessarily included in an acceptance of HaShem's dominion. Consequently, it is appropriate to accept upon oneself the yoke of miktzvos out of love for HaShem, independently of one's acceptance of the dominion of HaShem.<br><br>Darash Moshe<br><br></div>

The gabbai called a venerable Cohen to the Torah followed by a boy barely past Bar Mitzvah for a Levi. He gave the next aliya to a simple man seated in the back row. The guest expressed his bewilderment to the gabbai. The gabbai said "Our shul has an elaborate system to ensure the fair distribution of aliyos.

Compared to the length of the eternity and the complex webs of cause and effect throughout the world, our view of world events is as narrow as the guest in the shul. (Choifetz Chayim)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE LEGAL SACRIFICE : </strong><br>"Vayovay Kayin MePree' Ha'adomah Mincha LaHashem" .<br>AND KAYIN BROUGHT FROM THE FRUITS OF THE LAND AS A SACRIFICE TO HASHEM<br>.<br>As Rashi says, Kayin brought inferior produce as a sacrifice. This led to the rejection of the sacrifice, which spurred Kayin's envy of his brother Hevel. The question remains, If Kayin realized on his own the importance of bringing a sacrifice, why did he bring an inferior one? It is possible that Kayin rationalized that Hashem doesn't need our sacrifices for any purposes of His Own, so to speak. A sacrifice is just a personal opportunity for us to be giving. Hashem doesn't care about quality. Rather, it is the thought that counts. However, if someone is truly giving on the emotional level, it would be natural to give only the best. Kayin was lacking in this element. We must be emotionally involved in each Mitzvah to do it to the fullest, instead of rationalizing that we are getting by<br>(R' Moshe Feinstein ZT"L)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by Daneal Weiner<br>email: daneal@actcom.co.il<br><br>Based on the Torah of Rav Moshe Shapirah.<br><br>Well, I did the summer camp hashgacha thing and guess what? I interviewed at a residential drug and alcohol rehab facility for Jewish youth, HÂ’y, and they took me in- uh- I mean I got the job. America went drug happy in the 60Â’s, so, 40 years is about right for infiltration into religious Jewish circles. Like camp, itÂ’s another 13 hour day, but in catering to 15, instead of 550, I have a little more time to myself. [As I understand it we could easily end up with 550 kids at our doorstep, but, someone would have to admit that thereÂ’s a problem.] So this week IÂ’m going for it! IÂ’m going for something short, so there is a great chance I may actually get through it. My library is still in Israel and all I have are my wits. Wait, I think I only packed half of them.<br><br>Based on the Torah of Rav Moshe Wolfson.<br><br>Rav Pinchas of Korits, zyÂ’a, would light up with excitement for Shabbos Lech Lecha<br><br>and no doubt,<br><br>Parshas Vayaira<br><br>HeÂ’d say that Parshas Bereishis and Noach had in them upsetting content, AdamÂ’s sin and NoachÂ’s flood. Those parshas, spanning the first 2000 years of history, were years of tohu, turbulent times. Last and this weekÂ’s parsha brings world history across that millennia threshold and into a new world order. And, of course, we are introduced to the man who carries us over the threshold, our father, Avraham Aveinu.<br><br>Speaking of introductions, Ramban would like to know where it is? Lech Lecha opens with Hashem telling Avraham to take a hike. Who is he? At the opening of last weekÂ’s parsha we are told there is a man named Noach who walked with Hashem. Very nice. This week we take off with a running start. A walking start anyway.<br><br>Rav Wolfson says that being that Avraham is the first Jew, what introductions need there be? The first Jew on the planet and the Torah has to tell you heÂ’s a good guy? A Jew is good to the core. Certainly at the core. If the Torah told us this Jew is good, maybe weÂ’d think another Jew wasnÂ’t.<br><br>The first lesson we learn is that if a Jew gives off the appearance of being bad or of participating in inappropriate things, as deep as the flaws may seem, they are superficial to the fact that that descendant of Avraham, that branch of the tree has the same roots as every other branch. At the core of every Jew is the kind of goodness that needs no introduction. Our job, as was AvrahamÂ’s through his 10 tests, is to bring our good potential into reality.<br><br>Spending some time on this we canÂ’t help but marvel, what a remarkable thing it is. What do you think of when you look at a seed? Not a sunflower seed because then you think of a row of Israelis sitting behind you in a movie theater but any other seed, what are you looking at? That little seed contains a robust tree, which will grow from it, every branch, twig and leaf, and the hundreds of fruits which will grow. Those fruits contain thousands more seeds. Those thousands of seeds are potentially thousands more trees and fruits and seeds and on and on. They all trace back to that one seed.<br><br>Avraham Aveinu was every single Jew until the end of time. And we do the tracing back. Just as Avraham Aveinu contained every Jew, every Jews goes back to Avraham. But more than that. Our connection is not just on paper. There is a spark, a feature, in every Jew of the original Avraham Aveinu. ItÂ’s a signature of our Jewishness. As it says in Gemorah Yevamos, there are three answers to who is a Jew. One who has shame, who is merciful and who does good deeds. If one of these is missing than we are not talking about a descendant of Avraham Aveinu. This parsha is the beginning of Am Yisrael and the final journey towards world reparation.<br><br>Staying in Lech Lecha, after Avraham defeats the four kings and saves Lote, Hashem reassures him that his merits were not used up and, in fact, his reward will be very great. Avraham says to Hashem, Â“What can You give me seeing that I go childless and the steward of my house is the Damascusian (Damascuser) Eliezer.Â” This comment needs to be understood since previously Hashem had promised to make Avraham a great nation and that means offspring. We canÂ’t say that Avraham didnÂ’t believe that promise so what is it Avraham is saying here?<br><br>Following the lead of the Yonason ben Uziel, he says Avraham said to Hashem that Eliezer is hoping to inherit from him.<br><br>AvrahamÂ’s pervasive attribute was chesed. That great goodness in him made him willing, even wanting, to forgo the literal meaning of HashemÂ’s blessing and assume Hashem meant children spiritually speaking. Not only did Eliezer run AvrahamÂ’s household but he also was his primary disciple and was and would continue teaching AvrahamÂ’s Torah to the world. Since Eliezer was all this to and for Avraham, and since he desired to inherit from Avraham, Avraham wished him to be the inheritor. He looked passed HashemÂ’s literal promise and understood Him to mean Eliezer, his studentÂ… his son.<br><br>Introducing a famous few words between the Baal Hatanya, zyÂ’a, and Rav Baruch of Medzivuz, zyÂ’a. Rav Baruch said to the Baal Hatanya, Â“YouÂ’re starting with me, the grandson of the holy BaÂ’al Shem Tov.Â” The Baal Hatanya responded, Â“Yes, your are his grandson in body, but I am his grandson in spirit. For he taught the Magid of Mezeritch and the Magid taught me!Â” As we say in the Shema every day, vÂ’shinantem lÂ’vanecha, not only does it mean to teach our children but it also defines that those whom we teach are considered as our children. Avraham heard HashemÂ’s promise of being a great nation to be 100% possible without every having a single child because he taught Eliezer.<br><br>Nevertheless, HashemÂ’s intention was even in the simplest sense of His words. Avraham would have physical descendants. Because the way Hashem set up the system, biological offspring receive traits from the parents that do not get come by way of the soul. AvrahamÂ’s holiest attributes would never be passed on to Eliezer even as sole inheritor to his fortune.<br><br>Hashem responded to Avraham saying Eliezer would not inherit him but a child that he would give birth to. He will inherit it all. In this weekÂ’s parsha that child is born. Some of AvrahamÂ’s negative traits are siphoned off into Yishmael. The essence of what is a Jew goes to Yitschak. Avraham is every Jew. Yitschak is the first link in the chain.<br><br>So any and every grandchild of Avraham Aveinu has those same attributes that endeared Avraham to Hashem over every other human on the planet. The attributes which require no introduction. If a Jew may have acquired other attributes antithetical to his/her essence, it is not a contamination that reaches their core. It is only surface dirt which needs to be wisked away. Every Jew is good to the core.<br><br>Hashem chose Avraham and took him out of Ur Casdim.<br><br>Hashem chose Yitschak and took him out of the Akeida.<br><br>Hashem chose Israel and took them out of Egypt.<br><br>Of course.<br><br>They are all one in the same.<br><br>Every week, Shabbos is a new beginning. These weeks, these Shabboses are special new beginnings. ItÂ’s the beginning of every Jew. ItÂ’s the beginning of a human chain of goodness and compassion that will span the rest of human history. ItÂ’s the beginning of the end, the final redemption of Israel and the reign and Name of Hashem permeating the world.<br><br>Tradition says Eliyahu Hanavi will introduce the Mashiach 3 days in advance, but, then again, we believe the Mashiach will come this very day.<br><br>Maybe itÂ’s because there is a kind of good news that needs no introduction.<br><br>Shabbat Shalom.<br><br></div>

Show me the way I should go, for to You I lift up my soul.<br><br>David is the only person in the Bible whom God describes as a man after His own heart. Despite David's many setbacks he continually sought to know and do God's will in his life. Like many of us, his will got in the way of a sinless life.<br><br>In the morning hour, David sought to hear from God. I can imagine David sitting on the open deck of his palace looking over the hills of Jerusalem, listening to God. There, in his morning watch, he felt God's unfailing love. He reaffirmed his trust in God. He also understood that the key to knowing God's will lay in spending such moments alone to reflect on what God had done and was doing in his life.<br><br>Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; may Your good Spirit lead me on level ground (Psalm 143:10).<br><br>Sometimes we fall prey to believing that God is not concerned, and that He does not lead us in our work life. We are tempted to think that He leads us in other areas, but not in our daily workplace. The truth is that God is in every aspect of life and desires to direct us.<br><br>Do you need direction in your life today? If so, David provides the best example of gaining direction. Set aside the morning hour to draw close to His presence. There, you will sense His unfailing love for you. His direction for your life will be a natural by-product of this time of communion with Him. Ask God to lead you by His Spirit today.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Training Ground of God<br>Psalms 144:1<br>Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.<br><br>David was a man skilled in war. From his days as a shepherd boy to the days of serving in Saul's army to leading his own army, David learned to be a skillful warrior. How does one become a skillful warrior?<br><br>The only way one can become a skillful warrior is to be trained and placed in the middle of the battle. It is only when we are placed in the furnace of battle that we truly learn to fight the real battles. Practice doesn't make you battle ready. War games won't prepare you for facing your real enemy in the battlefield. The stark reality of being in the midst of the battle makes us effective warriors.<br><br>Simply reading your Bible will not make you a warrior for the Kingdom. Knowledge without experience is mere folly. Only when you are placed in situations where there is nothing or no one who can save you but God will you learn the lessons of warrior faith. This is the training ground of God, which will make you into a soldier for Christ in the marketplace. Consider it to be suicidal faith-faith that says I want to be dead to anything that keeps me from fulfilling God's purposes for my life. It is when your efforts can do nothing to change your circumstance and you are at the mercy of God. These are the real training grounds of God. Do not shrink back from the battle that God may be leading you to today. It may be a training ground that is necessary for the calling He has on your life.<br><br>If you can trust Him in these times, you'll know that you have gained a faith that will move mountains and will sustain you in the most difficult of circumstances.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Anguish of Faith<br>Psalms 143:7<br>Do not hide Your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit.<br><br>Of all the biblical characters, David gives us a glimpse of a man who walked with God with great emotion in victory and in defeat. David never lost a battle throughout his many years of serving as king of Israel. In many of the Psalms, David often lamented about the difficult places where God had placed him. He talked of his enemies and the need for God to deliver Him. He talked of God's everlasting love for him. How do you suppose David came to this understanding after years of being sought after by King Saul who wanted to take his life? His years of turmoil within his family gave him many reasons to lose all hope in a loving God.<br><br>David often began his Psalms in a place of discouragement and loss of hope. But He never ended one Psalm in defeat. He always came to a place of victory in God by the end of the Psalm. David always placed his life in God's hands, knowing He would care for him.<br><br>Let the morning bring me word of Your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in You. Show me the way I should go, for to You I lift up my soul. Rescue me from my enemies, O Lord, for I hide myself in You. Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; may Your good Spirit lead me on level ground (Psalm 143:8-10).<br><br>It is okay to feel discouragement. It is part of the process of grieving and working through those times of pain. But God wants each of us to allow Him to walk with us in these places. If you find yourself in one of these places, do what David did. Ask God to show you the way and let Him bring the word of His unfailing love to you.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

Put on your best behavior. You will be judged accordingly." The townspeople knew that Jesus was a special man, and so they dressed in their finest clothes. The merchant stood at the front of the line, followed by the carpenter, the tent maker, and the miller. A poor girl came along and tried to get in line. The merchant shoved her aside and called her a name. The carpenter threatened to hit her, and the tent maker pushed her into the dirt. The miller raised a boot to kick her, but stopped. The four men realized that they were being watched. They looked up to see Jesus watching their behavior. Christ stepped forward and took the girl by the hand. He said, "Come. Dine with me."<br>To the others, He said, "Depart from me. You know me not, and so I neither know you."<br><br>This story was written about 1700 years ago. Though it is not from the Bible, it reflects well the sentiment of God toward the poo r and abused. He will raise up the afflicted, but the abuser will He cast aside. Look kindly upon the poor, viewing them with Christ's own eyes. Then will He be real in you.<br><br></div>

The father lamented, "Neil, Sarah is so difficult to handle that we have to drop her off at my parents' home every other weekend so we can get away. We want to love Sarah, and we are going to choose to do that. But she is so difficult to be around that there are times we just hate her! She is ruining our home, and the pressure on our marriage is threatening to pull us apart."<br><br>I encouraged them to ask Sarah what was going on in her mind when she acted belligerently. They seemed a little skeptical, but they agreed to try. To their surprise Sarah admitted to receiving all kinds of bizarre thoughts as well as having frightening experiences in her room. The parents made an appointment with me and brought Sarah with them. Together we took a stand against the enemy. I heard from the parents six months later that Sarah was living a "normal" life.<br><br>Another father pulled me aside after a speaking engagement. "Neil, I have a problem with my 14-year-old daughter, Mindy," he began. "There's a barrier between us to the point that we can hardly talk. What should I do?"

            <div class='col-md body'>CONSULT YOUR GOD<br>Mark 13:22<br>False Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, in order, if possible, to lead the elect astray<br><br>You can identify a false prophet by the fact that not all his prophecies come true. Deuteronomy 18:22 instructs us not to believe the prophet whose prophecies fail. But Deuteronomy 13:1-3 also warns us about the false prophet whose signs and wonders do come true: "If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, and the sign or wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, 'Let us go after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,' you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the LORD your God is testing you to find out if you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul." (See also Matthew 24:4-11, 23-25; Revelation 13:11-14).<br><br>Many Christians have become conditioned to think that anything relating to the miraculous automatically verifies that God is involved. God can still use signs and wonders to confirm the Word, but the Bible also warns that false Christs and prophets will arise seeking to lead believers astray with their "signs and wonders." Satan can also perform signs and wonders, but he only does so to direct our worship away from God to himself. Deuteronomy 13:5-11 reveals the seriousness of attributing to God the activity of Satan. Persons who were involved in it were to be executed even if they were relatives. We are to love God, obey His Word, and test all signs, wonders and dreams. Isaiah wrote, "When they say to you, 'Consult the mediums and the wizards who whisper and mutter,' should not a people consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn" (8:19,20).<br><br>Neil Anderson</div>

They did not permit them to learn Torah or perform the mitzvos, and they sent forth their hands against their property and their daughters."<br><br>Let us consider this list: They nullified our religion, they did not let us learn, they did not permit us do mitzvos, they took away our daughters, and they took away... our money. Money may be important, but should it be listed in the same breath with the others? Should the Ramba"m be equating taking our money with taking our daughters (and not only that, but the Ramba"m mentions money first!)?<br><br>How are we to understand this statement of the Ramba"m?<br><br>Many people have the custom, on Motzaei Shabbos [Saturday night], to say a Pizmon [poem] which begins with the words "HaMavdil bein Kodesh L'chol, chatoseinu Hu yimchol" -- He who distinguishes between that which is holy and that which is not holy, He will forgive our sins. These are beautiful words. The poem says that we sin because we do not appreciate the difference between that which is Sacred and that which is mundane. We spend our time and efforts on foolishness. We do not know what is Kodesh and what is Chol. We ask G-d, Who has the ability to distinguish between Kodesh and Chol, to please forgive our sins.<br><br>(The Lubliner Rav, Rav Meir Shapiro, once said about American Jews that they know how to make Kiddush, but they don't know how to make Havdalah. In other words, they put the wrong emphasis on things. That which is holy, they treat lightly, and that which is really unessential, they make holy. They do not know how to differentiate.)<br><br>What is the next line of the Pizmon? "zareinu v'chaspeinu yarbeh k'chol," which means: "May our children and our money increase like the sand." This, in and of itself -- the lumping of children and money in the same breath -- would be difficult to comprehend. But, moreover, we just finished saying that we are inadequate for not being able to distinguish between Holy and mundane, and now we go ahead and make the same mistake all over again -- equating that which is Holy (children) with that which is mundane (money)!<br><br>This would be like davening Ma'ariv [the evening service] immediately after Yom Kippur, without having the proper Kavanah [concentration]. We've just finished confessing our sins for improper thoughts during prayer, and then we turn around and do it all over again! Here too, we have just confessed our failure to properly set priorities, and then we lump children together with money.<br><br>Rav Shimon Schwab offers a beautiful insight, both in the Ramba"m and in the Pizmon. Rav Schwab says that what the Ramba"m means by saying the Greeks took away our money and our daughters, is that the Greeks knew how to destroy us. If we are to succeed with our children and with our religion, we need money. In order to have Yeshivos, shuls, a community, one needs money. Money is a wonderful thing. Let's not kid ourselves. We can do tremendous things with money. We cannot exist without money.<br><br>But money corrupts, sometimes... most of the time. However, money, in and of itself, can be the greatest tool that there is. The Midrash says that when G-d showed Moshe Rabbeinu [our Rabbi] a Half-Shekel coin, He showed Moshe a 'coin of fire.' The reason is because that is what money is. Money can be terribly destructive, like a fire. But where would we be without fire? No heat, no light, nothing.<br><br>Money is the same way. If one handles it right, it can save him. If one handles it wrong, it can destroy him.<br><br>This, the Ramba"m says, is what the Greeks understood. When they wanted to take out the foundations of the Jewish people, they sent forth their hands against their money and their daughters. Take away their money. Don't let them have Yeshivas, don't let them have Torah educators. That is how the Jewish People will be destroyed. The Ramba"m has his priorities very straight. The Greeks knew how to wage a war.<br><br>Rav Schwab says that this too, is what we say on Motzaei Shabbos: If we want to be successful with our children, then we also need 'our money (to) increase like sand.'<br><br>Imagine! Money like sand, unlimited funds! Consider what that would mean. We could pay educators, instead of their current low rate salary -- one-half, one-third, or one-quarter of what the lawyers and the doctors are earning - an amount that they truly deserve.<br><br>Imagine if we could pay our teachers top dollar. What would the face of Torah education in America look like if we had unlimited resources and could pay top dollar? What would be if we could drop the class ratio from one teacher per 25 kids, to one teacher per 15 kids?<br><br>What about the children that need extra help? For those children, we could even have one teacher for every two children. It wouldnÂ’t matter if that would require an extra salary! We could do amazing things. The Jewish People would be a different Jewish People if our children and our money were 'increased like the sand.'<br><br>That is the prayer. We know what is holy and sacred and we know what is mundane and profane... and we know what money can do. We can do the right things with money. We can change the Jewish People with money. We pray that we have 'children and money like sand' to accomplish wonderful things for the Jewish people.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Things are shaky every where yet most people are continuing business as usual. Let us pray and blow a shofar for a wake up call:<br><br>1.     For the Body of Messiah. Â“For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?Â” 1 Peter 4:17<br><br>2.     For the Jews in exile to come home- Â“Behold, I will send for many fishermen,Â” says Yahveh, Â“and they shall fish them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.Â” Jeremiah 16:16<br><br>3.     For IsraelÂ’s struggle to exist- Â“Do not keep silent, O God! Do not hold Your peace, And do not be still, O God! For behold, Your enemies make a tumult; And those who hate You have lifted up their head. They have taken crafty counsel against Your people, And consulted together against Your sheltered ones. They have said, Â“Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, That the name of Israel may be remembered no more.Â”  For they have consulted together with one consent; They form a confederacy against You: The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagrites; Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; Assyria also has joined with them; They have helped the children of Lot.  Selah  Deal with them as with Midian, As with Sisera, As with Jabin at the Brook Kishon, Who perished at En Dor, Who became as refuse on the earth. Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb, Yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, Who said, Â“Let us take for ourselves The pastures of God for a possession.Â” O my God, make them like the whirling dust, Like the chaff before the wind! As the fire burns the woods, And as the flame sets the mountains on fire, So pursue them with Your tempest, And frighten them with Your storm. Fill their faces with shame, That they may seek Your name, O Yahveh Let them be confounded and dismayed forever; Yes, let them be put to shame and perish, That they may know that You, whose name alone is Yahveh, Are the Most High over all the earth.Â”  Psalms 83<br><br>4.     For Revival in Israel. Â“And I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son, and grieve for Him as one grieves for a firstborn. Zechariah 12:10<br><br>5.     For Rabbi Baruch to be restored fully to health. Â“For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh.Â” Proverbs 4:22<br><br>6.     For me and the team in Ivory Coast. Â“For you shall go out with joy, And be led out with peace; The mountains and the hills Shall break forth into singing before you, And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. Isaiah 55:12<br><br>Much love from Zion and Ivory Coast!<br><br>Â¨For ZionÂ´s sake I will not keep silentÂ¨ Isaiah 62:1<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Rabbi Baruch and Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two Sticks<br><br>Â“And [Eliyahu]Â… came to the city gate, and saw there a widow woman gathering sticks. He called to her and said, Â‘Bring to me, please, a little water in a container that I [may] drink.Â’ And she went and brought it, and he called to her [again] and said, Â‘Bring to me, please, a morsel of bread in your hand.Â’ And she said, Â‘[As] Adonai your God lives, I have no cakeÂ—only a handful of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a dish. Look, I am gathering two sticks, that [I] may go in and prepare it for myself and for my sonÂ—we will eat it, then die.Â’ And Eliyahu said to her, Â‘Fear not! Go [and] do according to your word, but first, go make me a little cake, and have [it] brought out to meÂ—make [food] for you and for your son last. For this [is what] Adonai, God of YisÂ’rael says: Â‘The jar of meal will not be used up, and the dish of oil will not [be] lacking until the day Adonai gives rain on the surface of the ground.Â’ So she went and did according to the word of Eliyahu, and she ateÂ—she and he, and her householdÂ—[for many] days.Â” MÂ’lachiym Alef (1Kings) 17:10-15<br><br>When Eliyahu asked for a drink of water, the widow obliged. But when He requested a morsel of bread, she replied with a lament all too familiar to many in todayÂ’s Body of Messiah: Â“All I have is a handful of meal, a little oil, and a couple of lousy sticks. IÂ’m as good as dead.Â” Too many of us feel as if we are constantly living on the brink of deathÂ—that this is our lot in life, should we happen to live another day at all.<br><br>Perhaps we can learn from the lesson Eliyahu taught this hopeless widow. Eliyahu saw that the widow was full of fear, and what little faith she did have was in her own strength rather than in the One who could truly provide for her. So Eliyahu put a challenge before her: take the miniscule amount of food she had, make a small loaf of bread out of itÂ—and give it all to him.<br><br>Eliyahu teaches us a critical principal for living in Messiah: giving out of our lack builds faith. Had the widow chosen not to honor EliyahuÂ’s requestÂ—to hoard what little she hadÂ—surely, she and her family would have starved to death, fulfilling her greatest fear. Instead, she did as the Man of God encouraged her. By glorifying Adonai, she was blessed, and her household then ate Â“[for many] days.Â”<br><br>Today is the day to Â“go [and] doÂ” what the Lord is saying to you. Adonai wants you to know that your Â“jar of meal will not be used up, and the dish of oil will not [be] lacking.Â” If you will trust in AdonaiÂ—not hoarding the little you have, but freely giving it to HimÂ—He will give you more than just a couple of sticks. You will eatÂ—you and your householdÂ—for many, many daysÂ…<br></div>
