            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Uses and Misuses</strong><br><br>The rabbis of the Talmud compared Bilaam to Moshe. On the surface at least this is a very strange comparison. Bilaam was certainly a master of prose and poetry, as was Moshe. But I do not believe that the rabbis were judging literary abilities in making that statement. Rather I believe they were talking about the potential to teach and influence masses of people, as well as generations yet unborn. Moshe uses that gift granted to him by God to transmit the values of Torah and morality to the Jewish people and through them unto the world. Bilaam uses his gift for unprincipled personal gain and the destruction of others. Bilaam in effect becomes a professional hired gun, willing to curse and destroy innocents because of his own personal wants, hatreds and agenda. Because of this startlingly different treatment of their seemingly similar gift of teaching masses and influencing others, we find Moshe raising himself to becoming the most humble of all human beings, while Bilaam on the other hand, sinks into the morass of self-congratulatory hubris and arrogance. Moshe says; Â“Compared to the holiness of my mission and message, I am personally insignificant in the scheme of GodÂ’s world.Â” Bilaam says: Â“Because of my message of negativity that I can control and inflict on anyone, I am the most important person in the world!Â” Moshe is a savior of mankind. Bilaam is a tyrant and murderer of humans.<br><br>The rabbis of the Talmud, in discussing the phenomenon of almost permanent anti-Semitism, stated; Â“ He who attempts to harm Jews/Israel becomes a rosh Â– a head or a leader.Â” The simple explanation of this cryptic statement is that being anti-Jewish is a shortcut to rising to leadership in the non-Jewish world. This does not mean that every world leader or national ruler is anti-Semitic. It does however point out the reality that from Haman to Sadaam Hussein, being against the Jews automatically gains one an audience and a platform if not, eventually, actual power. There are plenty of people around today in the world who prove the accuracy of this assessment of the rabbis. However, I would venture to offer an additional insight into this statement of the Talmud. Hatred of Jews (and I believe that unreasoning hatred of anyone) automatically makes one a rosh Â– a person with a swelled head and a view of oneÂ’s self that is filled with hubris and arrogance. Bilaam is the paradigm model for this disease of the soul and personality. Bilaam is so confident of his greatness that he convinces himself that he can fool God, so to speak, into allowing him to curse Israel. The man of arrogance, by misusing the divine gifts granted to him, becomes a malevolent and evil person. Using oneÂ’s gifts for persuasion and not demagoguery, for blessings and not curses, for enhancing G-dÂ’s standing, so to speak, in the world and not debasing it, means following in the steps of Moshe. Doing otherwise, dooms one to becoming a follower and disciple of Bilaam.<br><br>Shabat Shalom.<br>Rabbi Berel Wein<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PhD. in morals</strong><br><br>This century, the bloodiest in all of human history, should have lain to rest two of the most cherished theories about mankind that the Enlightenment and Secular Humanism postulated. One was the idea that all moral questions, all issues of right and wrong, good and evil, were subject to being correctly decided on the basis of man's reason alone, without the necessity (better put, without the interference) of divine revelation or organized religion. Man, and man alone, would be the final and autonomous arbiter of morality. This idea brought with it as a necessary corollary, the firm belief that man, left to his own reasoning devices, would invariably choose to do what is right, what promotes life and fairness and the common good. This second idea of man's innate choice of goodness was aided and abetted by an arrogant belief that an educated person was more likely to do good than an illiterate one - that a Ph.D. graduate would be less likely to kill, harm, maim and destroy than a poor, hardscrabble, backwards farmer. But none of these theories have proven true. Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Milosevic and the entire slew of other murderers of this century have all given the lie to these fantasies about human morality and rectitude. One-third of all of the commandants of the Nazi death camps held either a Ph.D. or M.D. degree. Man, left to his own reason, will not choose right. Reason, by itself, is death and destruction, oppressive theories and murderous social engineering. No faith, no belief, has led us to the brink of the social abyss of self-destruction.<br><br>In a powerful op-ed piece in the New York Times (May 24, 1998 ), Michael Novak states:... "our present crisis is better described as religious, or at least as moral and religious, rather than simply as moral alone. For the underlying question is deeper than moral. Why are our sentiments about justice so strong? Why do we long for universal unity? Why should we trust reason? Why should we be moral, especially when no one is looking and no one is harmed and no one will ever know?" Our society hungers for a return to self, to a system of eternal values, to a disciplined life-style and to the true liberty of faith, which will free us from the ills of mindless conformity.<br><br>Balak and Bilaam, the two main characters in the Torah reading of this week are powerful, respected, intelligent people. Bilaam even possesses the gift of divine intuition and prophecy. But they are both base, evil and immoral people. They are so convinced of their own powers, of their own ability to reason correctly, that they are convinced that they can hoodwink G-d and destroy the Jewish people, all without consequence and hurt to themselves. They exhibit all of the immoral traits of the dark side of human behavior - greed, corruption, jealousy, foul speech and causeless hatred. But their worst trait is arrogance - they know better, they are better, they deserve better. And the People of Israel, and through it, the G-d of Israel and His divine Torah, apparently stands in their way. So, by denying God and destroying the People of Israel, the world will be somehow improved. We have seen the genocidal plan of Balak and Bilaam take on the flesh of reality in this century as well. We now know how dangerous such people are. But many, especially and inexplicably many Jews, are loath to relinquish the good old theories of the Enlightenment. And that is a truly sad and dangerous error. Jewry needs a healthy dose of realism and should forsake many of the utopian, naive and dangerous beliefs and theories that have characterized our journey in the modern world over the past two centuries. We should never forget that Balak and Bilaam are unfortunately real. But so is our faith and tradition.<br><br>Shabat Shalom.<br><br>Rabbi Berel Wein<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE SMALL STUFF</strong><br><br>Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch, since you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. Therefore, let us observe the feast, not with old yeast, or with the yeast of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. - 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 HCSB<br><br>In Africa, there are many strange and splendid creatures. I used to have a pet chimpanzee named Julius who would go to church, sit on the pew (a log with the top shaved flat) and sing with the rest of us. I owned a miniature antelope, called a Dik Dik, that would knock on the door if it wanted in or out.<br><br>Many African creatures were not nearly so cuddly. There are spiders large enough to hunt birds. A scorpion stung my mother on the foot and she nearly died. I remember her foot being the size of a football. Army ants will march ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>across the jungle in columns 10 to 15 feet across and an eighth of a mile long. Do you have any idea how many ants it takes to create such a sight? Neither do I. All I know is when they come through, you donÂ’t try to stop them. You simply move yourself and anything you want to save out of the way and let them pass. It actually is a benefit to have them come. They go through the mud huts and eat all the spiders, lice, roaches, and scorpions, leaving you a clean house to move back into.<br><br>However, do you know what the scariest thing of all was? Little bugs you can barely see like mosquitoes and tsetse flies. I remember seeing swarms of flies so thick they cast a shadow on the ground. They all carry terrible, deadly diseases. Something that small is difficult to fight and they are all over the place. They swarm over you until you get this feeling of panic.<br><br>ItÂ’s not usually the big sins that get you because you see them coming and either prepare for them or you step out of their way. People will usually rise to the occasion when the big stuff happens. What really gets us, what makes our marriages fail and our children lose faith, is the small stuff. A little yeast goes a long way. The rolled eyes when your wife says sheÂ’s sorry for something; the little snide remarks and slams that start accumulating. The Â“not now honey, DaddyÂ’s busyÂ” thatÂ’s said all too often.<br><br>LifeÂ’s little issues keep coming and coming, swarming over us until we do something stupid. Imitate the Africans. Put up screens in your life to keep the pests out. DonÂ’t take your job home so much. DonÂ’t let your church or volunteer organization keep you from your kids. Take care of the little things and the big ones are no sweat.<br><br>Kevin Pauley<br><br>Kevin Pauley is a pastor and writer. He lives in Illinois with his wife, Lynn, their five children and two dogs.<br><br><a href="http://www.liveasif.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.liveasif.org/  </a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A fixed point</strong><br><br>"So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai." (v. 10)<br><br>For reading &amp; meditation:<br>Esther 7:1-10<br><br>We look now at the second highlight of the book of Esther - the downfall and defeat of the scheming Haman. This verse, and the one we looked at yesterday, form the two hinges on which the book turns. One shows us the sovereignty of God in placing Esther in the king's palace during a time of impending peril, and the other points to the ultimate end of evil. God is on the throne, and no matter how things appear, it is His purposes that eventually hold sway.<br><br>Many years ago, I studied the book of Esther during a a time of great spiritual drought, and I caught such a vision of God's sovereignty and power that it turned my life around. I long that the same thing might happen to you. Let me be absolutely frank with you. We are in a storm. The people of God are being subjected to extreme pressure not only from Satan but also from an increasingly hostile world. If we are to keep our sanity in a world that is seemingly going mad then we must have some concrete convictions to guide us. Opinions are not enough. Just as a mariner has to be sure of the utter dependability of the points from which he takes his bearings, so we too must be sure of certain elemental dogmas as we make our way through the world.<br><br>A conviction concerning God's sovereignty is one of them. The book of Esther is one of those fixed points from which we are able to take our spiritual bearings. An understanding of the book will enable us to avoid spiritual shipwreck.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">My Father and my God, I am on a difficult journey through life but I am thankful that You have charted my course with care. I have fixed points from which to take my bearings - the book of Esther being one of them. I am so very grateful. Amen.</span></strong><br><br>Selwyn Hughes.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Need to Control </strong><br>1 Samuel 13:13<br>"You acted foolishly," Samuel said....<br><br>The prophet Samuel had anointed Saul the first king of Israel. Saul was now 30 years old and was leading the nation in battle against the Philistines. The Philistines had gathered at Micmash to come against Saul and his army. The Lord was directing Saul through the prophet Samuel. Samuel instructed Saul to go ahead of him to Micmash, and he would follow in seven days. He would then offer a burnt offering on behalf of the people of Israel.<br><br>The pressure began to build as the Philistines gathered around Micmash preparing for battle. The people of Israel grew fearful and began to scatter throughout the countryside. Saul was also afraid. Samuel did not show up on the morning of the seventh day. Finally, Saul, fearing the impending attack, took it upon himself to offer the burnt offering. After he had done this, Samuel showed up.<br><br>..."You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you; if you hhad, He would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after His own heart and appointed him leader of His people, because you have not kept the Lord's command" (1 Samuel 13:13-14).<br><br>Saul believed he needed to take control of the situation. Whenever we try to take control of a situation out of God's will, we demonstrate that we are led by fear. Many a boss is so driven by fear that he attempts to manage by overcontrolling his people. This results in codependent relationships in which the employees are fearful of making the wrong decisions, and are driven to please the manager at all costs. This results in loss of respect for the manager. Many times the employees make poor choices just to please their manager; as a result, resentment begins to build among the employees due to the manager's overcontrol.<br><br>Do you see any signs of overcontrol in how you relate to others? Can you allow others the freedom to fail? Do you find yourself changing directions in midstream when you see something you don't like? Are you fearful of failure? These are all symptoms of a Saul-control spirit. Pray that God will allow you to walk in the freedom of trusting in Him and those around you.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Traveling Light</strong><br>by Max Lucado<br><br>I fell asleep in the Louvre.<br><br>The most famous museum in the world. The best-known building in Paris. Tourists are oohing and aahing, and thatÂ’s me, nodding and snoring. Seated on a bench. Back to the wall. Chin to my chest. Conked out.<br><br>The crown jewels are down the hall. Rembrandt is on the wall. Van Gogh is one floor up. The Venus de Milo is one floor down. I should have been star struck and wide eyed.<br><br>Denalyn was. YouÂ’d have thought she was at FoleyÂ’s Red Apple sale. If there was a tour, she took it. If there was a button to push, she pushed it. If there was a brochure to read, she read it. She didnÂ’t even want to stop to eat.<br><br>But me? I gave the Mona Lisa five minutes.<br><br>Shameful, I know.<br><br>But it wasnÂ’t my fault. I like seventeenth-century art as much as the next guy Â… well, maybe not that much. But at least I can usually stay awake.<br><br>But not that day. Why did I fall asleep at the Louvre?<br><br>Blame it on the bags, baby; blame it on the bags. I was worn out from lugging the family luggage. We checked more suitcases than the road show of the Phantom of the Opera.<br><br>I canÂ’t fault my wife and daughters. They learned it from me. Remember, IÂ’m the one who travels prepared for an underwater wedding and a bowling tournament. ItÂ’s bad enough for one person to travel like that, but five? ItÂ’ll wear you out.<br><br>You think IÂ’ll ever learn to travel light?<br><br>I tell you what. LetÂ’s make a pact. IÂ’ll reduce the leather bags, and weÂ’ll both reduce the emotional ones. After all, itÂ’s one thing to sleep through the Louvre but quite another to sleep through life.<br><br>We can, you know. Do we not dwell in the gallery of our God? IsnÂ’t the sky his canvas and humanity his magnum opus? Are we not encircled by artistry? Sunsets burning. Waves billowing.<br><br>And isnÂ’t the soul his studio? The birthing of love, the bequeathing of grace. All around us miracles pop like firefliesÂ—souls are touched, hearts are changed, andÂ…<br><br>Yawn. We miss it. We sleep through it. We canÂ’t help it. ItÂ’s hard work carrying yesterdayÂ’s guilt around.<br><br>ItÂ’s also enough to make you miss the magic of life.<br><br>Then letÂ’s get rid of the bags! Once and for all, letÂ’s give our luggage to him. LetÂ’s take him at his word! Â“Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you restÂ” (Matt. 11:28 NLT).<br></div>

James 4:7 </strong></span><br><br>Submit - In Greek hupotasso. The pieces that make up this word are extremely helpful in understanding its meaning. It comes from hupo (a prefix that means "under" ) and the verb tasso (meaning "to place in order" ). Literally, it means "to put under in an orderly way". It is an imperative. Do it! And it is reflexive YOU do it to yourself! Submission to God is not blind faith. It is not irrational. It is the reasonable, proper, orderly thing to do. But it clearly means that we acknowledge His rule and authority and deliberately, with conscious forethought, put our lives under His control. It can't happen by osmosis or accident.<br><br>I submit to you today. I acknowledge your power and majesty. You and you alone are the God of creation. You are my God. I worship you by bowing my knee in humility and respect to you. I want you to know that I know you are in control of my life and my circumstances.<br><br>God, there are lots of things in my life that I would change if I had the power to do it. But I am not you. I don't see the scope of my life the way you do. So, I surrender all these to you. I give them up. I stop fighting the world and myself. The circumstances of my life are yours to do with as you please. If you decide to change my situation, then that is up to you. I am bankrupt without You God, but with you I share in your ownership of everything. You have promised it. So, I just put myself under your authority. Change what you want, leave what you want. I know you will do what is best for me, so help me to be content with what I have.<br><br>So many times I come to you asking for what I think I need. What I really need is to listen to you. What do you want me to hear today, Father? Instruct me. Correct me. Let me understand your desires and then help me to do them. Today I just want to do what you want. Your will be done.

Well, what had he done? How was he able to earn such great credit from a single deed?<br><br>ItÂ’s admittedly a bad joke but it may help illustrate what the case of Pinchus is not like. A schul Rabbi and an Israeli Egged bus driver are called before the heavenly court upon the occasion of their having parted this world. The bus driverÂ’s life is made to appear upon the computer screen. The interviewing agent hums and haws and evaluates. Afterward a door is thrown open with a glowing light of love that embraces the driver lovingly as he enters. Now the Rabbi confidently takes his place next before the screen that shows his life in review. The angelic agent sadly shakes his head and reveals the opening to another door. Streaks of intensely hot fire jump forth to grab the poor fellow. The Rabbi shouts in protest, Â“Why did that simple bus driver get preferential treatment. He just drove a bus but I was a Schul Rabbi and the leader of a precious and loyal flock!Â” He is given the following explanation, Â“Rabbi, you must understand that when you gave your speeches- your sermons people became extremely tired and fell asleep, but when that Egged bus driver started driving his bus ooohhhh everyone began to pray!Â”<br><br>In this crazy account the funny point is that one is considered to have achieved and is credited so due to secondary results he had no idea he had inspired while anotherÂ’s good and noble intentions and deeds are deeply discounted. By the incident involving Pinchus the opposite forces may have been be more at play.<br><br>The Mishne in Chapters of the Fathers makes the following amazing claim, Â“All who exert themselves for the community should do so for the sake of heaven, for then the ancestors will assist them, and their righteousness will endure forever. And you, I will bestow upon you as great a reward, as though you had done itÂ” What does this mean?<br><br>The Maharal explains that there is universe of difference when one performs a deed for some local immediate concern or if one has in mind the total and eternal mission of G-d and Israel. Just like the patriarchs were the architects of the entire building and share in every detail of the future accomplishments of their children throughout history so too any later personality that has in his mind that even his small part should have a positive affect upon the entirety of the edifice will be credited as if he too had created the whole thing, even though he had only worked on one part of a part of one floor and even though his part was hardly his own doing. Wow! Working for the community can have some incredible benefits and dividends. One can borrow from the bank account of the patriarchs and with the correct mind-set be credited with accomplishments far beyond oneÂ’s individual means.<br><br>The verse reveals that Pinchus was granted unending generations of Priesthood Â– holy public service, because his action was not a response of anger, personal and passionate or of zealous rage. Rather he purely intended to take up G-dÂ’s cause and to achieve atonement for the Children of Israel. Since he was focused, in that single deed, on defending the honor of the Almighty and the welfare of the Nation of Israel, he was rewarded with a gift of endless opportunity, available to those who dares to care!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Fine-tuned Instrument </strong><br><br>Zechariah 13:9<br>...I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will ccall on My name and I will answer them; I will say, "They are My people," and they will say, "The Lord is our God."<br><br>My business career has been as an owner of an advertising agency. Over the years, I have had the privilege to work on many different and prestigious accounts. One of those accounts was Steinway Pianos, the maker of the world's finest pianos. Each piano has always been made from scratch; it takes over a year to make one Steinway. The most impressive scene as I toured the manufacturing plant was the place where the soundboard is stretched to its maximum tolerance and allowed to sit for an extended period until it remains in the curved design. This was done in an off-to-the-corner part of the plant. If the wood were alive, it would be crying out for mercy.<br><br>After an extended time of stretching, the wood will never spring back to its original state. It is permanently changed. The piano is becoming a fine-tuned instrument. After this process takes place, the next step requires another point of stress. It takes 11 tons of pressure on a piano to tune it. Each step in the process moves the piano closer to a finished product that will ultimately be played by the world's finest musicians. These musicians desire a particular sound that only a piano like this can make.<br><br>God looks at each of us as a fine-tuned instrument. However, we begin as rough wood that He desires to transform into gold. Tuning us requires certain experiences that will stretch our faith, our frame, and our very life. Sainthood springs out of suffering. If we can stand the strain of this intense process, we will come forth as gold-as a sweet-smelling offering to our Maker. When we are in the midst of these times, it feels like fire. It is painful to be stretched beyond our perceived limits, but the Lord knows this is necessary for us to become an instrument that can play a beautiful song that others will seek after.<br><br>Let the master Craftsman have His way in your life today. You will be pleased with the instrument He fashions.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Confrontation With God </strong><br>Isaiah 61:3<br>They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of His splendor.<br><br>"God, is this the way You treat someone who is faithful to You?" I yelled out loud on the top of the wooded hill where no one but God could hear me. "I have waited and waited and now this! I hate You, God! I have had enough!" Those were my words that day as I wrestled with news of an event that devastated me to the point where I broke down weeping.<br><br>As I sat there among the trees deciding what else I could say to God, I was speechless. I was angry. I was confused. I wondered if He even existed. If He did, I felt like He really didn't honor my faith and obedience. I sat for hours wrestling internally with my feelings.<br><br>Finally, without answers and sensing that God wasn't answering me, I turned to leave. I had been sitting on an old oak tree that was broken at the base. The tree pointed toward the base of another huge oak tree. Finally, a still quiet voice inside said, "Today, like this broken oak tree you are sitting on, you are a broken man. But this brokenness was needed in order for you to become this large oak tree you see."<br><br>Months and even years had passed with many struggles. But God was true to His word from that day. He began to replace the pain and disappointment with an inner joy that only His grace could provide.<br><br>Have you ever wrestled with the events of life, feeling that God has deserted you? Have you been honest with God? He is the kind of Father who is willing to have those difficult conversations. He won't always change things, but His purposes will be accomplished and peace will come if you trust. Trust Him this day with those things that are most difficult.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Paradigm of Peace</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>"Therefore say, Â“Behold! I give him My covenant of peace!Â” (Bamidbar 25:12)<br><br>ItÂ’s a strange thing that the Â“peace prizeÂ’ should be offered to one who just carried out such a brutal act as Pinchas had done. Sure it was a surgical strike and it stopped the scourge of destruction that was sweeping the Jewish camp but the Â“peace prizeÂ”?<br><br>It is reported that a student of the sainted Chofetz Chaim came to him with a seemingly mundane question. This young man was considering a banking position. He wanted to know whether or not he should accept a seat at the window that cashed checks or the one that accepted deposits. The Chofetz Chaim had a definite opinion on the matter. He advised him strongly to plant himself in the place that was cashing the checks, reasoning that if he would be receiving money daily over decades it would misshape his personality into a taker but if he would be handing out money he would be more inclined to become a giver.<br><br>There is a principle stated by the Sefer HaChinuch that Â“a person is impacted by the action of what he does.Â” The Mesilas Yesharim says a similar idea in a slightly different way, Â“Outer movements awaken our internality.Â” For this reason so much emphasis is placed on Â“doingÂ” on Â“performingÂ” deeds even if the heart is not Â“in itÂ” initially. We can be made to care and love by performing acts of caring and acting in a loving fashion. A hardened criminal can actually be softened by doing constant acts of kindliness, and a sweet kindly Candy Striper can be made mean and callous over time by being made to perform continuous actions of cruelty.<br><br>For this reason a Doctor is advised to do some extra acts of kindliness each day. Every profession has its peculiar occupational hazards, but why should a Doctor need to do Â“make niceÂ” after a full day of healing? The answer is that we are impacted by the experience of what we actually do. Even though the good Doctor is helping people when administering a shot or feeling around for the point of soreness to determine whether itÂ’s a break or a strain, still, the experience is a an experience of afflicting pain, all day, sometimes. Â“This wonÂ’t hurt a bitÂ…or only for a momentÂ…Â” and then the torture begins.<br><br>The same applies to the fellow at the bank tellerÂ’s window. In theory the one who takes money for deposit is helping people save and the money he handles is clearly not his own, still, his experience is training him to be a taker. The one who is handing money out, although it is certainly not his own to be generous or stingy with, he is being made into a giver. Over the course of time a difference in character would be manifest.<br><br>Pinchas perhaps needed to receive a Â“covenant of peaceÂ” as a kind of protection from the impact of the deed that he had performed. He had just carried out an act that in any other context would be considered cruel and criminal. Regardless of his noble intentions and the ultimate good that resulted from his deed there remains a stain of bloodshed and a residue of cruelty in his system. The extra reward that Pinchas received in this instance was that he would be spared the internal consequences of the terribleness of the action he carried out. He and his children would become Cohanim, the students of and heirs to AaronÂ’s legacy, Â“Pursue peace and love peace, love people and bring them close to Torah.Â”<br><br>ItÂ’s reputed that the pilots that dropped bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki later went insane, even though it can be argued that their actions actually spared further deaths. We can appreciate how haunting life might be after such an episode. Pinchas was no less sensitive to the life of a single individual. For some lofty reason, perhaps due to the extreme purity of his intentions, he was granted the ability to transcend any trace of the tragic and even with a single act become the paradigm of peace.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br><strong>Forever Sensitive </strong><br><br>It's a big wonder that the Bilaam and the Moabites (sounds like a rock band) successfully conspired to ensnare even part of a "Holy Nation". What led them to believe that such a seductive strategy would be affective against a "Priestly People"?<br><br>Someone asked in a Q/A session a similar question. "Rabbi, since I started learning Torah I feel even more vulnerable in certain areas. There are places I used to go in "The City" and I remained unaffected. Now I'm afraid to go there. Who knows what it might do to me?! Shouldn't it be the other way around? Shouldn't I be more morally secure now that I'm learning?"<br><br>One of the rabbis answered with the following personal account. He said that he had been walking past some street in Israel where there was a crew of men repairing a broken sewage line. It was extremely repulsive. He felt he had to run quickly past this place to distance himself from the disgusting smell. As he was hurrying by, a bell sounded and the men working there stopped abruptly and took out their lunch boxes and proceeded to eat right there. He was sickened but they were unaffected because they were already used to it. How does that help us?<br><br>The Talmud tells us that the greater one is the greater is his negative inclination. (Tractate Sukkah 52) How so? Maybe, now we can partly understand it. A clean white garment can become more easily soiled and wrinkled than an already soiled one. What's the other option? Should one wear a shirt which is ruined just to avoid the hazard of dirtying it or the aggravation of having to set it straight again? Of course not! It doesn't work that way for clothing or for human beings.<br><br>In spite of the risks it's better to remain spiritually and emotionally clean and sensitive. We can simply enjoy the wholesome pleasures of life when our senses are fine tuned. However, when the old synapses are overloaded from all too frequent firings the person tends to look for more unhealthy and eventually self destructive activities just to feel the sensations of being alive.<br><br>About this the Piazetzna Rav wrote, "The human soul relishes sensation, not only if it is a pleasant feeling but the very feeling of stimulation. Sooner sadness or some deep pain rather than boredom of non-stimulation. People will watch distressing scenes and listen to heartrending stories just to get stimulation. Such is human nature and a need of the soul, just like all its other needs and natures. So he who is clever will fulfill this need with passionate prayer and Torah learning. But the soul whose divine service is without emotion will have to find its stimulation elsewhere. It will either be driven to cheap, even forbidden sensation or will become emotionally sick from a lack of stimulation."<br><br>Bilaam and the Moabites understood that if some could be distracted they would be easier and more vulnerable targets because of their heightened sensitivity. The best defense, though is not to become sensually dull because that only lures the individual further beyond the original battle lines and deeper into the filth of the enemy territory. The secret is to learn the fine art of sipping goodness and reveling in the holy to remain forever sensitive.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Understanding What God Has Given </strong><br>1 Corinthians 2:12<br>We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.<br><br>God desires for us to know what He has freely given to us. One of the responsibilities of the Holy Spirit is to reveal His plans and purposes to us. They may be hidden for a time, but if we seek Him with our whole heart, we can know what He has given to us.<br><br>John the Baptist understood this principle. When asked if he was the Messiah, he replied, "A man can receive only what is given him from heaven" (Jn. 3:27). John understood his role in the Kingdom of God. He came to pave the way for the Messiah; he was not the Messiah himself. His ministry on earth was very brief, yet Jesus described his life in this way: " 'I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he' " (Mt. 11:11).<br><br>Once we understand what God has given to us, we can walk freely in our calling. However, if we strive to walk in a role that He never gave us, it will result in frustration and failure. God wants to reveal His plan to us by His Spirit. This requires a willingness to seek and accept what He gives us. It may be different from what we thought. It may require adjustments to follow His path for our lives. As we learn from the life of John the Baptist, obedience requires death to our own wills.<br><br>Ask God to reveal what He has freely given to you. Pray that you receive and embrace only those things He has reserved for you to receive and to accomplish in your life. Then you can be assured of a life full of meaning and purpose, and you can look forward to hearing those all-important words someday, "Well done, My good and faithful servant."<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>One Of God's Great Don'ts</strong><br><br>"Fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil doing."<br><br>Psalm 37:8<br><br>Fretting means getting out at elbows mentally or spiritually. It is one thing to say "Fret not," but a very different thing to have such a disposition that you find yourself able not to fret. It sounds so easy to talk about "resting in the Lord" and "waiting patiently for Him" until the nest is upset - until we live, as so many are doing, in tumult and anguish, is it possible then to rest in the Lord? If this "don't" does not work there, it will work nowhere. This "don't" must work in days of perplexity as well as in days of peace, or it never will work. And if it will not work in your particular case, it will not work in anyone else's case. Resting in the Lord does not depend on external circumstances at all, but on your relationship to God Himself.<br><br>Fussing always ends in sin. We imagine that a little anxiety and worry are an indication of how really wise we are; it is much more an indication of how really wicked we are. Fretting springs from a determination to get our own way. Our Lord never worried and He was never anxious, because He was not "out" to realize His own ideas; He was "out" to realize God's ideas. Fretting is wicked if you are a child of God.<br><br>Have you been bolstering up that stupid soul of yours with the idea that your circumstances are too much for God? Put all "supposing" on one side and dwell in the shadow of the Almighty. Deliberately tell God that you will not fret about that thing. All our fret and worry is caused by calculating without God.<br><br>Oswald Chambers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Sanctify them through thy truth."<br>- John 17:17<br><br>Sanctification begins in regeneration. The Spirit of God infuses into man that new living principle by which he becomes "a new creature" in Christ Jesus. This work, which begins in the new birth, is carried on in two ways-mortification, whereby the lusts of the flesh are subdued and kept under; and vivification, by which the life which God has put within us is made to be a well of water springing up unto everlasting life. This is carried on every day in what is called "perseverance," by which the Christian is preserved and continued in a gracious state, and is made to abound in good works unto the praise and glory of God; and it culminates or comes to perfection, in "glory," when the soul, being thoroughly purged, is caught up to dwell with holy beings at the right hand of the Majesty on high. But while the Spirit of God is thus the author of sanctification, yet there is a visible agency employed which must not be forgotten. "Sanctify them," said Jesus, "through thy truth: thy word is truth." The passages of Scripture which prove that the instrument of our sanctification is the Word of God are very many. The Spirit of God brings to our minds the precepts and doctrines of truth, and applies them with power. These are heard in the ear, and being received in the heart, they work in us to will and to do of God's good pleasure. The truth is the sanctifier, and if we do not hear or read the truth, we shall not grow in sanctification. We only progress in sound living as we progress in sound understanding. "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path." Do not say of any error, "It is a mere matter of opinion. " No man indulges an error of judgment, without sooner or later tolerating an error in practice. Hold fast the truth, for by so holding the truth shall you be sanctified by the Spirit of God.<br><br>CH Spurgeon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully."<br>- Psalm 24:4<br><br>Outward practical holiness is a very precious mark of grace. It is to be feared that many professors have perverted the doctrine of justification by faith in such a way as to treat good works with contempt; if so, they will receive everlasting contempt at the last great day. If our hands are not clean, let us wash them in Jesus' precious blood, and so let us lift up pure hands unto God. But "clean hands" will not suffice, unless they are connected with "a pure heart." True religion is heart-work. We may wash the outside of the cup and the platter as long as we please, but if the inward parts be filthy, we are filthy altogether in the sight of God, for our hearts are more truly ourselves than our hands are; the very life of our being lies in the inner nature, and hence the imperative need of purity within. The pure in heart shall see God, all others are but blind bats.<br><br>The man who is born for heaven "hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity." All men have their joys, by which their souls are lifted up; the worldling lifts up his soul in carnal delights, which are mere empty vanities; but the saint loves more substantial things; like Jehoshaphat, he is lifted up in the ways of the Lord. He who is content with husks, will be reckoned with the swine. Does the world satisfy thee? Then thou hast thy reward and portion in this life; make much of it, for thou shalt know no other joy.<br><br>"Nor sworn deceitfully." The saints are men of honour still. The Christian man's word is his only oath; but that is as good as twenty oaths of other men. False speaking will shut any man out of heaven, for a liar shall not enter into God's house, whatever may be his professions or doings.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Redeeming the Time </strong><br><br>Acts 8:40<br>Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.<br><br>Many times I've heard a businessman or woman say they cannot participate in an event, a service, or activity for God because of the time it will take away from their business. God has called each of us to be good stewards of our time and our resources. It is just as important to learn how to say yes as it is to say no, and we must be faithful to our employers if we do not have freedom to take time away. However, many times I sense that businesspeople justify a lack of obedience under the guise of stewardship.<br><br>Philip was one of the first businessmen who was given a commission to preach the gospel. He was in the city of Samaria preaching when many miracles began to take place and the crowds came to see what was happening. Then in the midst of this great move of God, the angel of God spoke to Philip and told him to leave Samaria and go to a desert road that led from Jerusalem to Gaza. Imagine how Philip must have questioned the logic of this decision when he was seeing such results in Samaria. But Philip was obedient to the angel. Along the road, he met an Ethiopian eunuch who wanted to have the Scriptures explained to him. Philip explained the Scriptures to the Ethiopian, who was the treasurer of Ethiopia under Queen Candace, and led him to the Lord, then baptized him in a nearby lake. A few moments later, Philip was supernaturally transported many miles northwest of his location to Azotus, where he preached Christ along the way toward his final destination of Caesarea.<br><br>So often we think that if we give our time outside our business life, our business will suffer. God redeemed the time for Philip by supernaturally transporting him to the next place he was to be. God always blesses those who serve Him. He can redeem lost time for those who willingly give of themselves for His purposes. Do not fall into the trap of believing that God cannot redeem the time you give for Him. If He calls you to give outside your normal business life, be assured He can make up that time. I have heard countless examples of businesspeople who experienced God's supernatural financial provision for time given for the sake of the gospel through unexpected business or unusual income that resulted after they made the commitment to take time away from their business for service to God.<br><br>God desires that we respond as Philip did in order to be used by Him in the life of another person. Listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit so that you can go and speak when He says go and speak. Do not fear the consequences of what that might mean if it requires leaving your business interests for a time. God will make it up. He always takes care of those who are obedient. He is more concerned about obedience than the bottom line.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rock Flowers </strong><br>"Thou hast shewed thy people hard things" (Ps. 60:3).<br><br>I have always been glad that the Psalmist said to God that some things were hard. There is no mistake about it; there are hard things in life. Some beautiful pink flowers were given me this summer, and as I took them I said, "What are they?" And the answer came, "They are rock flowers; they grow and bloom only on rocks where you can see no soil." Then  I thought of God's flowers growing in hard places; and I feel, somehow, that He may have a peculiar tenderness for His "rock flowers" that He may not have for His lilies and roses.  --Margaret Bottome The tests of life are to make, not break us. Trouble may demolish a man's business but build up his character. The blow at the outward man may be the greatest blessing to the inner man. If God, then, puts or permits anything hard in our lives, be sure that the real peril, the real trouble, is what we shall lose if we flinch or rebel.  --Maltbie D. Babcock<br><br>"Heroes are forged on anvils hot with pain, And splendid courage comes but with the test. Some natures ripen and some natures bloom Only on blood-wet soil, some souls prove great Only in moments dark with death or doom." "God gets his best soldiers out of the highlands of affliction."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Word, Necessary Food</strong><br>"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God"   (Matthew 4:4).<br><br>If God so willed it we could live without bread, even as Jesus did for forty days; but we could not live without His Word. By that Word we were created, and by it alone can we be kept in being, for he sustaineth all things by the Word of His power. Bread is a second cause; the LORD Himself is the first source of our sustenance. He can work without the second cause as well as with it; and we must not tie Him down to one mode of operation. Let us not be too eager after the visible, but let us look to the invisible God. We have heard believers say that in deep poverty, when bread ran short, their appetites became short, too; and to others, when common supplies failed, the LORD has sent in unexpected help.<br><br>But we must have the Word of the LORD. With this alone we can withstand the devil. Take this from us, and our enemy will have us in his power, for we shall soon faint. Our souls need food, and there is none for them outside of the Word of the LORD. All the books and all the preachers in the world cannot furnish us a single meal: it is only the Word from the mouth of God that can fill the mouth of a believer. LORD, evermore give us this bread. We prize it above royal dainties.<br><br>CH Spurgeon<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Time Effort and Money</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Chaim Dovid Green<br><br>In this week's parsha we learn of the zealous deeds of one of the members of the tribe of Levy by the name of Pinchas, a grandson of Aaron the Kohein. How was it that Pinchas merited to have this week's Torah portion named for him and to be elevated to the priesthood, he and his generations forever?<br><br>The nation of Israel, after forty years of wandering and wondering were finally allowed to begin conquering the land they had so looked forward to inheriting. At that time the future of the nation which was on the brink of a beautiful dawn almost set at mid-day.<br><br>Pinchas saw the men of his nation being tempted by the women of Midian to sin by serving the idol called Baal Peor. In one fell swoop he put an end to the whole affair in the name of Heaven. The collective sinning ceased. The Torah tells us that the wrath of G-d was turned away. Pinchas needed to be strong for as we know, when a large group of people revels in destructive behavior and invests their time, effort, and money towards making it acceptable, being the voice of reason can literally and figuratively get you your head handed to you on a silver platter.<br><br>Pinchas acted when it was most needed that he do so. The chance to turn the tide and bring everyone back to their senses was in his hands. He was keenly aware that if another moment would have transpired with nothing done about the horrible situation at hand, all would have been lost. Either they would triumph or they would trip into oblivion. After all the Divine guidance and all the years of waiting, to see his nation disappear through assimilation into the Midianite culture was too much for Pinchas. Continuity as a holy nation remained intact all because of the action of one person at the right time.<br><br>Rabbi Israel Flam, one of the Deans of the Yeshiva of Spring Valley in Monsey New York made a very significant point in a dvar Torah he wrote this year for the parent body of his school. It was based on the saying of our Sages that "One who acts with alacrity merits to perform (many) mitzvos". Rabbi Flam pointed out that running at the last second to leave only _just_ enough time to squeak through on a commandment isn't what was meant when the Sages described a person who acts with alacrity. It is not the ideal to wake up at the last second and rush like a fool to grab the only moment left to do a mitzvah but rather to take the necessary amount of time, proceed carefully, and then see it through to fruition.<br><br>Pinchas was no hothead, who was rewarded for acting in a rash manner without stopping to think. His was the kind of zealousness honored by the Torah. He came, he saw, he acted but not over a split second of anger or spite but with a heart and mind set to achieve the honor of Heaven. Only a well honed heart and mind worked on with much prior thought and effort can achieve split second results accurately and effectively. There is no better tool with which we can hone our hearts and minds to be best prepared for the moments in which we need to act with alacrity than Torah study. Just do it!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Faithful Woman<br>Proverbs 31:28<br>Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her. </strong><br><br>She was the Vice President of Household Affairs for her entire adult life. She had a husband, four daughters, and one son whom she managed. Her calling was not to the marketplace; it was to the home. It was a calling that she fulfilled well. She often went beyond her job description to fulfill menial tasks like sewing clothes for her twin girls, playing dolls, and even playing catch with the only boy in the clan.<br><br>Things were going along well until midway in life a telephone call came that changed everything. The caller informed her that the love of her life had been killed in an airplane crash. She was in her early 40's, still beautiful, with five kids to raise on her own in spite of the fact that she hadn't worked in the business place for nearly 20 years. The death of her husband removed their steady upper middle-class income, and she was now faced with the greatest test of her life. At her lowest moment, wondering how she was going to make it, she cried out to God. God answered, "Trust Me, Lillian." Those audible words became the strength that she needed to care for her family for the next 40 years. &gt;From that moment on, she came to know her Savior personally and shared Him with her family. Her children came to know Him as well. Grandchildren became the recipient of her prayers, and they came to know Him too. She was building an inheritance in Heaven, one prayer at a time, one soul at a time. She never remarried; Christ became her Husband.<br><br>Whatever wisdom and encouragement has come to you through these devotionals, it is only as a result of one who answered the call to the greatest and most important workplace there is: the home. You can thank my mom, Lillian Hillman, for whatever grace you have gained from these messages throughout the year because she remained faithful to the call to invest in those she was called to love and serve. "Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her."<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>His Love; His Gift; His Son<br>"For God so loved the world, that He gave His Only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have Everlasting Life"   (John 3:16).</strong><br><br>Of all the stars in the sky, the polestar is the most useful to the mariner. This text is a polestar, for it has guided more souls to salvation than any other Scripture. It is among promises what the Great Bear is among constellations.<br><br>Several words in it shine with peculiar brilliance. Here we have God's love with a "so" to it, which marks its measureless greatness. Then we have God's gift in all its freeness and greatness. This also is God's Son, that unique and priceless gift of a love which could never fully show itself till heaven's Only-begotten had been sent to live and die for men. These three points are full of light.<br><br>Then there is the simple requirement of believing, which graciously points to a way of salvation suitable for guilty men. This is backed by a wide description -- "whosoever believeth in him." Many have found room in "whosoever" who would have felt themselves shut out by a narrower word. Then comes the great promise, that believers in Jesus shall not perish but have everlasting life. This is cheering to every man who feels that he is ready to perish and that he cannot save himself. We believe in the LORD Jesus, and we have eternal life<br><br>CH Spurgeon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Vision And Reality</strong><br><br>"And the parched ground shall become a pool."<br><br>Isaiah 35:7<br><br>We always have visions, before a thing is made real. When we realize that although the vision is real, it is not real in us, then is the time that Satan comes in with his temptations, and we are apt to say it is no use to go on. Instead of the vision becoming real, there has come the valley of humiliation.<br><br>"Life is not as idle ore,<br>But iron dug from central gloom,<br>And batter'd by the shocks of doom<br>To shape and use."<br><br>God gives us the vision, then He takes us down to the valley to batter us into the shape of the vision, and it is in the valley that so many of us faint and give way. Every vision will be made real if we will have patience. Think of the enormous leisure of God! He is never in a hurry. We are always in such a frantic hurry. In the light of the glory of the vision we go forth to do things, but the vision is not real in us yet; and God has to take us into the valley, and put us through fires and floods to batter us into shape, until we get to the place where He can trust us with the veritable reality. Ever since we had the vision God has been at work, getting us into the shape of the ideal, and over and over again we escape from His hand and try to batter ourselves into our own shape.<br><br>The vision is not a castle in the air, but a vision of what God wants you to be. Let Him put you on His wheel and whirl you as He likes, and as sure as God is God and you are you, you will turn out exactly in accordance with the vision. Don't lose heart in the process. If you have ever had the vision of God, you may try as you like to be satisfied on a lower level, but God will never let you.<br><br>Oswald Chambers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Called to be Saints</strong><br><br>To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 1:7 NKJV).<br><br>Many of us strive to know the calling of God on our lives. We question whether or not we should be in a particular ministry, take a certain job, move across the country, and so on.<br><br>It is easy to get so caught up in trying to figure out the call of God on our lives in the above mentioned areas (and others) that we often forget the primary call of God on our lives: to be saints.<br><br>Although it is not easy to live out, the call of God to be saints never has to be questioned. Regardless of what stage we are in our lives, whether we are rich or poor, intelligent or lacking intelligence, talented or seemingly without great talent, every Christian is called to be a saint.<br><br>To understand what it means to be called to be a saint, letÂ’s first look at what the words, Â“calledÂ” and Â“saintÂ” mean. The word translated Â“calledÂ” in the Greek is kletos and means to be invited, and to be divinely selected and appointed. The word translated Â“saintÂ” in the Greek is hagios and means to be holy. Thus, we have been invited and divinely selected and appointed by God, to be holy.<br><br>I think I would give up if I focused initially on the word, Â“saintÂ” with its meaning to be holy, because I recognize how far short I fall. From a natural perspective, holiness is an impossible thing for us to achieve.<br><br>But we take comfort in the fact that God has called, or invited and divinely selected us to be holy. The fact that we are called indicates GodÂ’s involvement in the process. WeÂ’re not alone in our calling to be holy; the all-knowing God, the Creator of the Universe, is right there with us, as we walk out this calling on our lives.<br><br>Does God call us to do other things as well, other than to Â“justÂ” be holy? I think so. But I also believe that as we focus on the call to be holy, the other things God has called us to do will become clear, and weÂ’ll be better equipped to do them. If we focus first on our calling as saints, everything else will fall into place.<br><br>Father, we thank You that You have invited and divinely appointed each and every Christian to be saints. We thank You that You havenÂ’t left us on our own to accomplish this task, but indeed are right here with us as we walk out this calling on our lives. Help us not to get so caught up in the other things You have called us to do that we forget our primary calling: to be saints. Amen.<br><br>Thought:<br><br>Â© 2007 by Rebecca Livermore<br><br>This week, spend some time in prayer or in your journal working through what it means to be called to be a saint. Consider how your calling as a saint fits with the other things God has called you to as well.<br><br>meet the author<br>Rebecca Livermore is a speaker and freelance writer from Denver, Colorado.
