            <div class='col-md body'><strong>INJUSTICE IS BEING JUDGED</strong><br><br>"You shall have a full and just weight; you shall have a full and just measure, that your days may be prolonged in the land which Yahveh your Elohim gives you.   Â“For everyone who does these things, everyone who acts unjustly is an abomination to Yahveh your Elohim.  Remember what Amalek did to you along the way when you came out from Egypt, how he met you along the way and attacked among you all the stragglers at your rear when you were faint and weary; and he did not fear Elohim. "Therefore it shall come about when Yahveh your Elohim has given you rest from all your surrounding enemies, in the land which Yahveh your Elohim gives you as an inheritance to possess, you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven; you must not forget.  Deuteronomy 25:15-19<br><br>Jews have suffered unjust treatment for thousands of years by nations that have oppressed them. We can remember Egypt that forgot Joseph and enslaved the Children of Israel for 430 long years. Later on when Adonai was leading us through the desert, the Giant Amalekites attacked us mercilessly and especially in our WEAKNESS. Adonai was so upset about it that He commanded us NEVER to forget it and actually to execute absolute judgment on AMALEK. Amalek is a spirit that is leading all the enemies of Israel. Amalek is in Islam and Amalek has been in Christianity trough Replacement Theology. Amalek sneaks in through the policies of the nations that are seeking to divide the Land of Israel in the name of Â“PeaceÂ” instead of punishing the terrorists and the murderers that blow themselves up.<br><br>It is time for Injustice to be dealt with.  Just like at the time of the Pharaoh in Egypt that was unjust against the People of Israel for 430 years, and finally Yah listened to the cries of His people, delivered them and punished Egypt. So today YAHÂ’S ears are attentive to the cry of His Covenant People and is about to Â“come downÂ” and deliver them Â“in styleÂ” and then punish the nations that have oppressed them. The time of repentance for the nations is very short!  ( Joel 3:1-3)<br><br>Â“The burden of the word of the Yahveh concerning Israel. Thus declares the Yahveh  who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, "Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. "It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.Â”  Zechariah 12:1-3<br><br>When I was in the USA recently I watched the State of the Union speech of President Bush. It was a great speech.  I was so proud of him! But then he touched on Israel VERY QUICKLY and said: America will keep on fighting for the two state Â“solutionÂ”, and then went on onto another subject. It was only ONE sentence but this one sentence makes all the difference between life and death to Israel and to America. The two state Â“solutionÂ” is a demonic plan for the purpose of the annihilation of Israel and it includes the division of Jerusalem. IT IS AN AMALEKITE PLAN. No Palestinian or Moslem organization has ever agreed that if they get a Palestinian State they will be satisfied. They have all said the same- ALL of Palestine for ALL the Palestinians! This is Replacement Theology to the uttermost.  ItÂ’s TOTALY contrary to YahÂ’s word that states CLEARLY in numerous promises- ALL of the Land of Israel to My People Israel! (Genesis 15:8; 17:8-14; 26:3; 28:13,14; 35:12; 48:4, Exodus 32:13; 33:1; Deuteronomy 1:8; 11:9; 34:4,       Psalms 105:8-11)<br><br>No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. Â“I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come forth from you. "I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be Elohim to you and to your descendants after you.  "I will give to you and to your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their Elohim."  Genesis 17:5-8<br><br>The problem is that President Bush and Condoleeza Rice have placed the USA in grave danger. I strongly suggest that you order my book Â“Stormy WeatherÂ” on the subject. This book was given to me by the Holy Spirit as I was landing in Seoul Korea on December of 2005. He Â“downloadedÂ” that book to me as I was together with my team in a one week prayer retreat in Prayer Mountain. This book is an eye opener that will help you prepare for what is to come, and will teach you how to pray and to be victorious in the midst of very adverse circumstances. Order from Miskhan David Shop click here<br><br>Immediately after the State of the Union speech, Yah sent me to Florida to a congregation that has entered into The MAP Revolution, and have turned their hearts towards the Jewish Roots of the Faith and towards Israel. He told me to Â“put them in the eye of the stormÂ” as Florida was going to suffer again from stormy weather (and not only Florida). As I claimed the promises of Genesis 12:3 I blessed them and asked Yah to hide them and protect them in the Eye of the Storm and to make them a Lighthouse in the midst of it.<br><br>A very short while later tornados hit Florida again bringing much devastation.<br><br>This is my prayer for all of you from USA and the nations where your governments are pushing Israel to divide the Land and commit national suicide through the Road Map and the Â“two state solutionÂ”:<br><br>I pray that as you love Israel in ACTION, and stand by her Covenant rights to her Land, and bless her by Coming, Praying, and Giving unto the Work of Adonai in her midst, that this year you will be in the EYE OF THE STORM.<br><br>We invite you to come to the Land to pray for IsraelÂ’s Wellbeing and Shalom, and to intercede for mercy for your nation according to the prayer prayed by King Solomon when he dedicated the Holy Temple.<br><br>Moreover, concerning a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, but has come from a far country for the sake of Your great name and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm, when they come and pray in this temple; then hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, that all peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this temple which I have built is called by Your name.Â” 2 Chronicles 6:32,33<br><br>There is an Open Door for all the lovers of Israel and the God of Israel to pray in His Land and to have their prayers answered this year.<br><br>Â“For IsraelÂ’s sake I will not keep silentÂ” Isaiah 62:1<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Rabbi Baruch and Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>FEAR NO EVIL</strong><br><br>Â“Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me, Your rod and Your staff they comfort meÂ” Psalms 23:4<br><br>Shabbat shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>During these End times where terror seems to be having the upper hand this passage of Scripture is extremely revealing and encouraging.<br><br>Our life is full of mountains, valleys, creeks and rivers. In order to move from one mountain peak to another we have to cross a valley. Some valleys are very easy to cross and they have more light in them but many valleys are quite dark and surprising. Every time that we move from one mountain peak to another mountain peak we will have to confront the fear of the unknown. While mountains are open spaces and they are reached by the light, a valley is normally a Â“shadowyÂ” place. The word talks here about the Valley of the Shadow of Death, in other words, it is not A Valley of Death because valleys are in the shadow.  We feel the threat of impending danger and even the fear of the unknown. In some cases peril is lurking in the darkness of the valley and it is ready to attack us. It can try to attack us, our finances, our families, business, reputation or ministry and it normally creeps and Â“landsÂ” on us. It is at that time when that shadow of death, (that projection of satan,) tries to overwhelm us and envelop us with its deceptive voice trying to convince us to Quit, Retreat, Give Up, or Go Back. When those Â“shadowy circumstancesÂ” come against us and wrap themselves around us trying to choke the life, the joy, the peace and the faith out of us, we need to REMEMBER this simple truth-<br><strong>YAH IS WITH ME, I AM NOT ALONE!!! </strong><br><br>As simple as this may sound and as basic as it seems, this is a most profound Truth, and when FULLY BELIEVED, it will totally transform your walk in the Valley. Your walk will not be hesitant and apologetic anymore, but you will walk with great confidence and will CONTINUE advancing without one step of retreat. You will give satan no time and not one inch! That is why the fear factor here has to be defeated thoroughly. Fear is the very nature of satan.  That is why the first thing that Adam displayed after falling from Grace in the Garden is FEAR.<br><br>Â“Then the Yahveh God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you? "He said, "I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself."  Genesis 3:9,10<br><br>Walking through the valley is part of our walk and overcoming the fear in it is what will make us grow into maturity. When we walk through the valleys that are necessary for our growth we realize that we are naked or that we have sinned and fallen short of His glory.<br><br>When all things are going right, we are normally deceived to think that we are perfect already and that we know everything.  When things get hard, then we realize that we still need a lot of cleansing if we are to be just like the Shepherd!<br><br>In some cases some people may display anger, violent reactions, extreme sadness and even depression.  Many people feel disappointed in YAH.  Others want to quit the faith or the ministry altogether, some display a Â“victim mentalityÂ” and blame others for their misfortunes. Deep within us we know that our reactions are not really Â“holyÂ” and the tendency of most is to Â“hideÂ”, sulk and murmur. In many cases you will be ashamed that others could see you in this condition, and so you pretend to be Â“self righteousÂ” and cover yourself with your own Â“fig leavesÂ” and excuses. Deep within you an old lie speaks inside: Â“I am no good, I am defective, Elohim does not love me reallyÂ”. You totally forget that He so loved the world, (you and I,) that He gave His only begotten son for us. In other words He has placed so much value on us that He gave His BEST just to REDEEM us or purchase us back from the devil, sin, death and the grave! He totally gave Himself so that satan will have no say and no hold in our lives in ANY situation or in any Valley!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>FEAR NO EVIL Part2</strong><br><br>He TOTALLY redeemed us from the CURSE so that we can be in His Kingdom of Blessing!<br><br>Â“Messiah redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us--for it is written, "CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A TREE"-- in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.Â” Galatians 3:13,14<br><br>Valleys are the ideal place to reveal character.  You may be very disappointed at what comes out of you when you are walking through the valley.<br><br>That very disappointment will try to convince you to escape or to give up in bitterness against yourself, Elohim, people and circumstances! When you realize that you are Â“nakedÂ” and that you are imperfect and have broken His Commandments or you are not displaying His nature, you must decide the exact OPPOSITE of Adam; instead of hiding from YahÂ’s Presence, RUN INTO HIS PRESENCE and REPENT! He will take you right back into His arms and will BOTH Comfort you and exhort you. Inside of His embrace He will teach you what you have done wrong so that you can do it right next time. His rod is His exhortation and discipline and His staff is His embrace which is His Mercy. Mercy and Truth will keep you stable and walking through the Valley without stopping.  You have a Mountain to climb and more territory to possess!<br><br>You must confront and overcome all fear and the only way to do it is to walk in love.<br><br>Â“There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love. We love, because He first loved us.Â” 1 John 4:18,19<br><br>This is the only thing that will keep you stable and advancing through the Valley; Love YAH with all of your heart, mind and strength and love your neighbor as yourself! When I love Yahveh, I do not quit on Him or on my calling. I keep on walking through the Â“shadowy circumstancesÂ” until I reach the peak of the next mountain. I never give up! I forgive everyone, myself included and keep moving!<br><br>As you keep walking on, you will come into the light.  For when the Valley ends, the shadow also ends and you come out into a fully lit up place!<br><br>As long as you are in the Valley there will be shadows and threats.  If you delay your walk in the Valley by giving in to circumstances and quitting, (whether it is your walk with YAH or your ministry, or quitting on hope for His promises to come to pass,) the longer you will have to endure the shadows.  For the shadows are only in the Valley. So keep walking with confidence, conquering that valley.  In fact, PRAISE YOUR WAY THROUGH IT! There is nothing that dispels the demons of fear more than PRAISE!   As you walk make sure that you exercise your full authority and crush the devil under your feet!<br><br>"Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will injure you.Â” Luke 10:19<br><br>Exercise full authority over the spirits of fear and unbelief.  Bind and lose, sing and praise, dance, jump and run, rejoice and declare His promises! Come on, go ahead and have a PARTY in the Valley! You will have such a great time that before you know it, you will be out of the valley altogether and on your way up the next mountain, the next ministry project, the next business venture, the next university course, the next success that YAH has for your life! Soon enough you will be a victorious Â“Valley WalkerÂ”.   You will be able to pass through them so well that He will be able to lead you from Mountain to Mountain, from Glory to Glory with NO LIMITATIONS!<br><br>Â“Who will separate us from the love of Messiah? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  Just as it is written "FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED." But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Messiah YÂ’shua our Lord.Â”                Romans 8:35-39<br><br>Remember not to concentrate on the circumstances or the Shadow of Death, put your absolute focus on the ONE that is with you and comforts you and keep doing His will! Very soon the valley shall pass and you will be stronger and more mature in order to undertake greater conquests and greater projects!<br><br>Your friend in Israel<br><br>Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ISRAEL IS NOT DISCARDABLE</strong><br><br>Â“Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;  but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:  for there is no respect of persons with Elohim.Â” Romans 2:10-11<br><br>Shabbat Shalom, Shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>The word DISCARDABLE comes from the word CARDO from which the work CARDIAC comes and it means heart.<br><br>ISRAEL IS NOT DISCARDABLE,<br><br>This particular word was given to me by the Ruach, the Holy Spirit in our 4 AM prayer meeting on the Mountains of Jerusalem. In other words, Israel is the HEART and you cannot throw away the HEART or kill the HEART.  If you do that you would be killing the entire person. Whatever happens to the heart affects the entire functioning of the body both physically, emotionally and spiritually. If the heart is sick the entire being is sick. Whatever happens to Israel will happen to the nations! In this article I will show you some eye opening scriptures that should provoke ALL to seek YAH, (God,) and ask Him what can we do to save, heal and deliver the heart of the nations- ISRAEL- from the strong enemy that has threatened to destroy her. It will not do to Â“forgetÂ” about it or to be Â“ignorantÂ” at this time lest we fall into the danger of the reproach mentioned in Psalms 137:5,6:<br><br>Â“If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill! If I do not remember you, let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouthÂ— If I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy.Â”  Psalms 137:5-6<br><br>When the right hand forgets its ability we lose our authority and without the authority the enemy can do what he wants with us. When our tongue clings to our palate we cannot talk, pray, preach, prophesy, sing or even kiss.<br><br>In all the maps of the ancient world Jerusalem is exactly in the CENTRE of the world and is described as the heart of the nations.<br><br>Many well meaning Christians are prophesying a new holocaust for the Jews in the nations and a Â“blood bathÂ” of Jews in our Land. I have no doubt that these prophets mean well but they do not know what they are saying or doing. YES the enemy has planned another demonic holocaust, (Shoa). YES he has planned and seems to be succeeding in his plan to divide and rule the Land of Israel through The Road Map which is backed up by powerful nations such as USA, UK and the European Union.  YES Israel has felt Â“discardedÂ” by the nations and Â“disheartenedÂ” by the situation and is seriously trying to commit national suicide. BUT NO IT CANÂ’T HAPPEN! The prophecies are too numerous to count when YAH swears by Himself that it canÂ’t happen. He brought us back to Israel to do us GOOD,<br><br>Â“For thus says Yahveh of hosts: Â‘ Just as I determined to punish you When your fathers provoked Me to wrath,Â’ Says Yahveh of hosts, Â‘And I would not relent, so again in these days I am determined to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fearÂ” Zechariah 8:14-15<br><br>To cleanse us and give us a new heart and a new spirit,<br><br>Â“For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land. Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them. Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall be My people, and I will be your Elohim.Â” Ezekiel 36:24-28<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ISRAEL IS NOT DISCARDABLE part2</strong><br><br>Those that are prophesying a Â“blood bathÂ” in Israel, do they realize that it is to the Jew FIRST and THEN to the Nations? Do they realize that whatever they allow or push Israel into they shall be pushed into also? That if Iran, or the Hamas, or the Â“PalestiniansÂ” manage to harm us they will harm them next? IsnÂ’t 9/11 enough, or the bombing of the London tube enough of a proof that the devil wants to destroy Israel FIRST and then ALL the nations. IsnÂ’t it time to stop the injustice of the wicked Road Map Plan and the division of the Land? Unfortunately, many people are prophesying but not enough people are PRAYING, FASTING and ACTING. For the most part people in the Church are passive about the situation and feel like it does not Â“belongÂ” to them, it is about Israel and the Jews and not the Church or the nations. Well, I have NEWS: Whatever happens to Israel will also happen to the Church and to the nations! Only that both the good and the bad happen to Israel FIRST and then to the nations! So, if you do not fight for Israel and her Covenant Land you are basically setting yourself and your nation up for the same distress! That is a sobering thought! But if you actively fight for Israel to be in SHALOM, wellbeing and completeness by struggling for:<br><br>ALL of Israel, (People,) to live in ALL, (Land,) of Israel,<br><br>You will be greatly rewarded and greatly protected and during the time of judgment.  You will not be condemned with the nations that did nothing the help the Jewish People in their distress.<br><br>"Because of violence to your brother Jacob, You will be covered with shame, and you will be cut off forever.  "On the day that you stood aloof, on the day that strangers carried off his wealth, and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem--You too were as one of themÂ…"For the day of Yahveh draws near on all the nations as you have done, it will be done to you Your dealings will return on your own head. "Because just as you drank on My holy mountain, all the nations will drink continually.  They will drink and swallow and become as if they had never existed. "But on Mount Zion there will be those who escape, and it will be holy and the house of Jacob will possess their possessions.

For Yahveh's indignation is against all the nations, and His wrath against all their armies; He has utterly destroyed them; He has given them over to slaughter. So their slain will be thrown out, and their corpses will give off their stench, and the mountains will be drenched with their blood.  And all the host of heaven will wear away, and the sky will be rolled up like a scroll; All their hosts will also wither away as a leaf withers from the vine, or as one withers from the fig tree.   ..For Yahveh has a day of vengeance, year of recompense for the cause of Zion.Â”  Isaiah 34:1-8<br><br>Â“For behold, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,  I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat then I will enter into judgment with them there  on behalf of My people and My inheritance, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations; And they have divided up My landÂ”   Joel 3:1-2<br><br>Â“Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, and gather yourselves there bring down, O Yahveh, Your mighty ones. Let the nations be aroused and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations. Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe come, tread, for the wine press is full;The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.Â”  Joel 3:11-13<br><br>What is the great wickedness of the nations?<br><br>That they have scattered the People of Israel and they have divided His Land. Yah wants ALL of Israel in ALL of Israel. That is True Shalom, absolute completeness and fulfillment of His everlasting Covenant with Abraham. Â“<br><br>In that context Genesis 12:3:<br><br>I will bless those that bless you and uphold My covenant with Abraham<br><br>I will curse those that curse you and obstruct My Covenant with Abraham<br><br>Â“Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of Yahveh is near in the valley of decision. The sun and moon grow dark and the stars lose their brightness.  Yahveh roars from Zion and utters His voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth tremble but Yahveh is a refuge for His people and a stronghold to the sons of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahveh your Elohim, dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain so Jerusalem will be holy, and strangers will pass through it no more.Â” Joel 3:14-17<br><br>The roaring of the Lion of Judah from Zion is the mercy of Yahveh, as He is warning the nations to repent for hating Zion and dividing her Land!<br><br>Â“And in that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine, and the hills will flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah will flow with water; And a spring will go out from the house of Yahveh to water the valley of Shittim. Egypt will become a waste, and Edom will become a desolate wilderness,  because of the violence done to the sons of Judah, in whose land they have shed innocent blood. But Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem for all generations. And I will avenge their blood which I have not avenged, for Yahveh dwells in Zion.Â” Joel 3:18-21<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Rabbi Baruch and Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE TABLE OF YAHVEH</strong><br><br>Â“You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies, You have anointed my head with oil; my cup overflowsÂ” Psalms 23:5<br><br>Shabbat shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>As I meditate on this Scripture I see our Shabbat Table. Every Friday night our family and ministry team sits around the Shabbat Table to partake of the most delicious meal of the week. It does not matter what has happened throughout the week or how many enemies are raging all around us, when we sit to our Shabbat Dinner we are happy and in shalom.  We live on the Mountains of Jerusalem in the MOST IMPORTANT GATEWAY OF JERUSALEM.  We are surrounded by SEVEN  hostile Arab villages that for the most part would like to see us wiped off the map, and yet as we eat our Shabbat Dinner we enjoy His Table in the presence of our enemies. The anointing of the Living God falls on our heads as we sing, worship and share. As we do the KIDDUSH, (-sanctification ceremony of separating the Shabbat as HOLY,) with the braided Chala bread and the SWEET SHABBAT WINE, our Shabbat cup RUNS OVER. Every week we eagerly wait for SHABBAT to come! Shabbat is the reminiscent of the PASSOVER and it is a REHEARSAL for the MARRIAGE SUPPER OF THE LAMB. We literally canÂ’t wait for it to come by EVERY WEEK!<br><br>Â“Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.Â” And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. Then he said to me, Â“Write: Â‘Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!Â’Â” And he said to me, Â“These are the true sayings of God.Â” Revelations 19:7-9<br><br><strong> Whoever celebrates and honors the Shabbat as HOLY is GREATLY BLESSED!</strong><br><br>"If because of the sabbath, you turn your foot from doing your own pleasure on My holy day, and call the sabbath a delight, the holy day of  Yahveh honorable, and honor it, desisting from your own ways, from seeking your own pleasure and speaking your own word, then you will take delight in Yahveh, and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father, for the mouth of Yahveh has spoken."  Isaiah 58:13,14<br><br>Â“And I will make you ride on the heights of the earth;Â”<br><br>In Hebrew it says I will put you on My back (like a father takes his child Â“piggy backÂ”,) and will lift you up to the Highest Stages of the earth! I will exalt you to fame all over the world! This is a TOTAL FULFILLMENT of the promise given to Abraham and to His descendants!<br><br>Â“And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great; and so you shall be a blessing;Â”Genesis 12:2<br><br>HaleluYAH somebody!!!<br><br>Â“And I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father, for the mouth of Yahveh has spoken."<br><br>In the Hebrew it is likened as a loving father feeding his child with great love the choicest foods. He has prepared the TABLE and He is also the ONE who feeds us at the table. This is no work that will be delegated to anyone else. The Father Himself will make sure that we are FED with ALL the INHERITANCE that He has promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob!  I can imagine all my enemies drooling over this picture! The Father Himself is ENTIRELY FOCUSED on feeding me with ALL of His blessing. Satan, (and all his cohorts,) watching the SHOW and the SPECTACLE of me just enjoying THE BLESSING and THE PRESENCE of Yahveh; and he can do NOTHING to stop it or thwart it! I can imagine all my enemies, (and demons full of jealousy and frustration ,) bursting with envy, with myself smiling and OPENING MY MOUTH WIDE to receive the next spoonful of exquisite FOOD and BLESSING from YahvehÂ’s prepared Shabbat Table.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE TABLE OF YAHVEH Part2</strong><br><br><strong>This Shabbat Table of BLESSING is a place of<br><br>COMPLETE REST and RESTORATION! </strong><br><br>The place where all your prophecies come to pass and all the Promises He has given you are fulfilled.  Finally all that we have believed for MANIFESTS IN THE NATURAL and no one can wipe the smile off our face!<br><br>Â“Thus I have seen You in the sanctuary, to see Your power and Your glory.  Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, my lips will praise You. So I will bless You as long as I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name. My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth offers praises with joyful lips. Â“  Psalms 63:2-5<br><br><strong>HE ANNOINTS MY HEAD WITH OIL</strong><br><br>When you sit at His prepared table, you forget the hardship of all the past years.  You sigh with relief and say: It was all worth it!<br><br>It is time to REST from your hardship and from your enemies. Shabbat is the DAY of REST!<br><br>This is what Joseph may have felt when he was taken from the Prison to the Palace in one day and when he ate before his wicked brothers. YAH had prepared a table for Joseph in the presence of his enemies, his own brothers!<br><br>Many times our own brothers are our own enemies, especially when we have a High Call and we are visionaries and dreamers.<br><br>Just like Joseph when the TABLE is READY and He exalts us to sit at His Shabbat Table of BLESSING, the enemy/brothers will come.<br><br>Â“The evil will bow down before the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.Â” Proverbs 14:19<br><br>Then just like Joseph we will be in a position of extending forgiveness, grace and mercy to them and repaying GOOD FOR EVIL by sharing our TABLE OF BLESSING with them! (Genesis 45) Then us and our former enemies, (now restored brothers,) will be able to praise Yahveh that all things truly have worked for our good! I can really imagine the Accuser of the Brethren (satan) having a deathly heart attack at that moment! There is nothing that he hates more than true unity and brotherly love. He works overtime to destroy Kingdom Relationships so that we donÂ’t enter into the BLESSING.<br><br>Â“Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, coming down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, coming down upon the edge of his robes.  It is like the dew of Hermon coming down upon the mountains of Zion; For there Yahveh commanded the blessing-- life forever.Â” Psalm 133<br><br>Now the TRUE RELEASE OF ANOINTING has come, the anointing to bring eternal life to millions, amazing signs, wonders and miracles are released! The Book of the Acts of the Apostles 21st Century style!<br><br>Â“That they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.Â” John 17:21<br><br>Â“And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them.  And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord YÂ’shua, and abundant grace was upon them all.Â” Acts 4:32,33<br><br>BETEAVON:<br><br>BON APPETIT ENJOY HIS SHABBAT TABLE AND ANOINTING AND REMEMBER THAT YÂ’SHUA HIMSELF HAS PREPARED IT FOR HIS SHEEP!<br><br>Your friend in Israel<br><br>Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MY CUP OVERFLOWS</strong><br><br>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Psalms 23:5<br><br>Shabbat shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>In Hebrew the word used for OVERFLOW is the word REVAYA it comes from the word RAVUY.<br><br>This particular word means Â“Fully WateredÂ” or watered to the point of bursting, exploding with water. A derivative of the word describes the bliss of the climax in the marital relationship when both parties are fully satisfied and absolutely happy. When you imagine this CUP you would see that it is so full that if you lightly touch it, it will spill over! In other words, when our Â“cupÂ” overflows we cannot be any happier, it is the best, the maximum bliss, you feel Â“enraptured to HeavenÂ”. For those that have experience lack, suffering, disappointments and distresses this is extremely GOOD NEWS! Can you imagine yourself so happy, so fulfilled, so blessed that you are bursting from happiness?<br><br>You become so contagious that everyone around you gets affected by your blessedness and fulfilled condition. No one can stay sad and broke around you. You have more than enough for yourself and for others! More than enough, joy, love, hope, strength, finances, blessings. You become the Â“more than enoughÂ” person! Your blessedness condition simply changes the world around you. It actually bows down to your overflowing blessing! The curse, sickness, disease or poverty cannot stay around you and they flee from anyone that is with you. Now that is KINGDOM POWER. This cup is a cup of wine that is used to sanctify the Shabbat and separate it as a Holy Day.  It is the cup of Passover wine and the LordÂ’s Supper. It represents His BLOOD that has purchased FULL redemption for us! His Blood, His Love, His Blessing!<br><br>Â“What shall I render to Yahveh, for all His benefits toward me? I will take up the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of Yahveh.Â”  Psalms 116:12,13<br><br>The table is prepared by your Heavenly Father, Yahveh your Shepherd, then you receive the New Anointing and before you know it your CUP, your life, your soul, your spirit, your ministry, your marriage, your family, your business, your HEART overflows with YAHÂ’S goodness. The realization of what the Blood of the Lamb has purchased for you fills your thoughts and affects your entire being. You receive the FULLNESS of His Blood, Salvation and Redemption! Come on begin to imagine it, live in this truth! This His perfect will for His children. Dream, dream, dream and tap into this Kingdom TRUTH! See yourself in it, remember what Hebrews 11:1,6 says:<br><br>Â“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.Â”<br><br>Â“But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to Elohim must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.Â”<br><br>YeshuaÂ’s name reveals all this truth. His name in Hebrew means SALVATION and it is SALVATION:<br><br>From sin<br>From sickness<br>From enemies and demons<br>From poverty<br>When my CUP OVERFLOWS I simply manifest the FULLNESS of Yeshua. He paid the highest price to make our cup to overflow for the Glory of the Father! Look if you are a father, would you like your children displaying who you are? Yahveh is LOVE, He is the HEALER, He is the PROVIDER, He is the DELIVERER and He wants His children to display who He is. That is why He sent YESHUA-to save us, so that we could become heirs to His Kingdom and we could display and demonstrate Him on earth as it is in Heaven. In heaven the cup is constantly overflowing. There is no poverty, no sickness, no sin and no enemies.<br><br>Â“Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.Â”  Matthew 6:10<br><br>Satan and a 1/3 of the angels were kicked out of the 3rd Heavens long ago!<br><br>Â“And He said to them, Â“I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.Â”  Luke 10: 18,19<br><br>When my cup overflows I display heaven on earth for all to see what YAHVEH is like!<br><br>In the Valley you learnt not to fear but to trust.  You have been prepared for His table.<br><br>Remember that the table is not prepared in a Â“safeÂ” place but rather in the PRESENCE OF YOUR ENEMIES; in the midst of Â“your troublesÂ”. It is there that you display YeshuaÂ’s authority against satan and have the victory. It is there that you show your unconditional love and forgiveness to those that hurt you! When anything Â“badÂ” tries to happen to you, instead of surrendering to the curse, or to the evil that satan is trying to do, you surrender to the blessing. The evil CANNOT TOUCH YOU.  IT CANNOT AFFECT YOU. It will come and go and you will remain blessed with a wonderfully dressed table and a FULL CUP!<br><br>Â“Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:Â”  Deuteronomy 11:26<br><br>We need to bow down our knees and surrender to the FORCE of His LOVE, to the FORCE Of His Blessing in every situation! We can choose what spirit/current/attitude/reality we surrender to: To faith or to unbelief, to love or to fear to obedience or rebellion, the blessing or to the curse. As we surrender to His Love and Blessing, our cup, life, heart, soul, ministry, relationships, business, finances will be FULL and will stay FULL all the time. There are TWO forces in the world: The Blessing or the Curse: When you surrender to the Force of Love and the Blessing, it is to the Holy Spirit, to the Glory of Yah, that you are surrendering.   Then something supernatural happens and His Power comes to your rescue! When people surrender to negative thinking and to hopelessness, bitterness, disobedience or to fear, it is to satan that they are surrendering and his demonic spirit comes to steal, kill and destroy. (John 10:10).<br><br>Surrender to the Spirit (Ruach) of Love and the Blessing at all times as an act of your will and faith, and you will see the miraculous power of Elohim available to make your cup of       JOY FULL!<br><br>Pray the following scriptures with me and personalize them.<br><br>Â“This reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord YÂ’shua the Messiah, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Messiah may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and heightÂ— to know the love of Messiah which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of Elohim.  Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, to Him be glory in the church by YÂ’shua the Messiah to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.Â” Ephesians 3:14-21<br><br>May you and I be filled with His FULLNESS this year.  May your cup of sorrows, distress and lack be discarded and may it never be found again! May your cup of JOY and BLESSING be filled, exceedingly abundantly above all that you may ask or think!<br><br>Speak this out loud in faith every day and in every situation:<br><br>I surrender to the Force of Love, I surrender to the Force of the Blessing! LECHAYIM! (the Hebrew toast Â“to lifeÂ”!)<br><br>In YeshuaÂ’s NAME and ALL that He means<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Bishop Dominiquae &amp; Rabbi Baruch Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Break Up the Fallow Ground<br><br>"Sow for yourselves in righteousness, reap according to loving-kindness, break up the fallow ground for yourselves, [because it is] time to seek Adonai, until He comes and rains righteousness upon you.  You have plowed wickedness, perversity you have reaped.  You have eaten the fruit of lying, for you have trusted in your [own] way, in the abundance of your might." Hoshea (Hosea) 10:12-13<br><br>What kind of farmer plants in fallow ground?  Is he wicked and evil?  Is he corrupt and full of sin?  Possibly... but that's not why he sows untilled soil.  Could it be that he is lazy?  Or maybe he's just not a very clever farmer.  Perhaps he has simply gone mad.  It may very well be a mixture of all of the above--but in the end, a farmer who fails to break up the fallow ground has lost more than his sanity... he's lost his way.<br><br>Untilled ground can be deceiving.  It can be soft and moist at the surface, giving the illusion that the ground is ready for planting.  The seed may be sown at a healthy distance from the surface--not too deep, and not too shallow--and for a time, it may even appear that the planting has been a success.  But in time, the devastating future of the crop becomes apparent.  In the hard and unbroken ground beneath, the seedlings have nowhere to stretch out their roots, and the crop soon finds itself threatened by other plants and invaders that have been lying in wait to take advantage of the helpless land.<br><br>When we leave our fields untilled, they are quickly overrun.  Wild, unwanted weeds that thrive in the shallow soil will soon slither along the surface and choke out the life of our crops.  The rootless seedlings will burn up and be destroyed, having no way to drink from the cool moisture hidden deep within the ground.  Upon such land, we can plow only "wickedness," reaping nothing but "perversity"--all because we failed to till the ground and instead "trusted in [our own] way, in the abundance of [our] might."<br><br>As we stand before the planting-fields of life, we have a choice:  to plant in futility in the unbroken, unyielding, unpromising soil; or to break up the fallow ground in our lives--to dig in, lift it up, turn it over, then do it again... and do it deep.  Only then will we become a field ready to receive the implantation of righteousness and abundantly yield the fruits of grace.  Today, "break up the fallow ground for yourselves, [because it is] time to seek Adonai, until He comes and rains righteousness upon you."<br><br>P R A Y E R<br><br>Rain on me, Adonai, and shower the fallow ground of my life.  Teach me how to break up the untilled soil of my stubborn ways, and to seek You unceasingly until You come and rain down Your righteousness upon me.  I bless You, Father, for our goodness and loving-kindness.  Plant Your righteous ways deep inside of me, that I may bear fruit worthy of Your Name.  Break me, Lord--lift me up, turn me over, then do it again... and do it deep...<br></div>

Among those believers, it was thought there were three types. The largest number of believers were those who came to Jesus for salvation. They served Him little beyond coming to Him to receive salvation. A much smaller number, say 500, actually followed Him and served Him. Then, there were the disciples. These were those who identified with Jesus. They lived the life that Jesus lived. Each of these ultimately died in difficult circumstances. They experienced the hardships, the miracles, and the fellowship with God in human form.<br><br>If you had to say which group best represented your life, which one would you fall into-the 5,000 who simply believed, the 500 who followed and sought to implement what they were learning from the Savior, or the 12 who identified completely with the life and mission of the Savior? Jesus has called each of us to identify with Him completely. "This is how we know we are in Him: Whoever claims to live in Him must walk as Jesus did" (1 Jn. 2:5b-6).<br><br>Pray that God will allow you to walk as Jesus did.

            <div class='col-md body'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob<br>Genesis 50:24<br>Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land He promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."<br><br>I was boarding the airplane in Frankfurt, Germany, when a mentor of mine asked me this question, "Would you consider why God referred to Himself as the 'God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob'? Why didn't He simply say, 'the God of Jacob'?" What a strange question, I thought to myself.<br><br>For the next hour I racked my brain trying to discover the meaning to this question. I had never read it in a commentary, and the Scriptures do not really say why this is so. It became a good exercise with the Holy Spirit that led to some interesting observations-one from my mentor, one from my own insight.<br><br>First, could it be that the Lord has given us a "type of trinity" in Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Abraham was considered a father figure to the nation of Israel. Isaac was the son who had to be sacrificed on the altar. Jacob was the man who had to learn to walk according to the Holy Spirit instead of his flesh. Each of these patriarchs had a particular relationship with God to fulfill.<br><br>My friend asked about an hour into the flight, "So, what did you discover?"<br><br>I told him of my observation.<br><br>"Hmm...that is interesting. I believe that what we also see in the patriarchs are examples of three distinct types of personalities. If the Lord had cited only one of the patriarchs, we would tend to seek to model that leader. However, the Lord has given us three distinct personalities in whom He performed His work. Abraham was the pioneer who ventured out into unknown territory and was considered righteous for his faith. Isaac was faithful to follow in his inheritance with few ups and downs in his life. He had the fewest calamities among the three. He was called simply to be faithful to what had been already given. Jacob had extreme conflict in his life. He suffered more pit experiences than either of his predecessors. He had much conflict in relationships that became the source of his inheritance. Each of us can identify with one of these men in how God has related to them."<br><br>God works in each person's life uniquely, and He has provided examples of lives for us to identify with from the Scriptures. Who do you identify with most in your pilgrimage? Discover this for yourself. You will find encouragement as you seek to learn from someone who has gone before you.<br><br></div>

God's desire for each of His children is to walk in relationship with Him, to uphold His righteousness and integrity. It is a high calling that we will fail to achieve without complete dependence on Him.<br><br>The greatest tests come not in great adversities, but in great prosperity. For it is in prosperity that we begin to lose the sensitivity to sin in our lives. Adversity motivates us to righteousness out of a desire to see our adversity changed. Prosperity fails to provide this motivation for obedience. We fall into a satisfaction and confidence in life that is based on our prosperity rather than on God.<br><br>Hezekiah was a great godly king. He was a faithful, God-honoring king most of his life, but toward the end he became proud. God wanted to find out if he would still honor Him and recognize His blessings in his life. He failed the test when God sent an envoy to his palace to inquire about a miracle that God performed on behalf of Hezekiah. The test was designed to find out if Hezekiah would publicly acknowledge the miracle performed on his behalf.<br><br>But when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart (2 Chronicle 32:31).<br><br>Hezekiah's failure resulted in his children failing to carry on as rulers of Israel, and the nation would eventually be taken over by Babylon.<br><br>The lesson of Hezekiah is clear. If we are to remain faithful to our Lord, we must remain steadfast in our obedience to Him. Prosperity can be our greatest test. Ask the Lord to give you the grace to be a faithful follower during times of prosperity.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hearing the Father Speak<br>John 10:27<br>My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me.<br><br>An Englishman tells a true story of his encounter with a Muslim man while walking in the country. The Englishman wanted to share the gospel with this man but knew little of Muslim beliefs. The two men talked as they walked and agreed they would each share their beliefs with one another. The Muslim went first and dominated the time of sharing. The Englishman asked the Holy Spirit how to share his faith with the Muslim man. "Do you consider your god your father who speaks?" asked the Englishman.<br><br>"Certainly not," replied the Muslim man.<br><br>"That is one of the big differences between your god and my God. I consider my God as my Father who speaks to me personally."<br><br>"You cannot prove that," stated the Muslim man.<br><br>The Englishman again prayed to himself, "Lord, how do I prove this to this man?"A few moments later the two men began walking toward two young ladies on the other side of the road coming toward them. As they approached, the Englishman spoke to the ladies and made small conversation. He then said to one woman, "I believe you are a nurse, is that correct?"<br><br>The woman was startled that a man whom she had never met had just informed her of her occupation. "How would you know that? I have never met you before," she questioned.<br><br>He replied, "I asked my Father and He told me." The Muslim had his proof.<br><br>Many of us do not hear God's voice because we do not believe He speaks or desires to speak to us. In order to hear, we must listen. In order to listen, we must believe that He speaks. Ask the Lord today for a listening ear so that others might know that you have a heavenly Father who speaks.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Goal of the Christian Life<br>John 12:24<br>I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.<br><br>The goal of the Christian life is death, not success. A popular teaching says that if we follow God, we will prosper materially. God may, in fact, bless His people materially, but few can make this claim among third-world countries. Wealth must never be the goal of a person's life, only a by-product.<br><br>A missionary to a Middle-Eastern country has shared a motto among their ministry team: "God does not require success, but radical, immediate obedience." Jesus' obedience gained Him the cross. It did not gain Him popularity among the heathen, the religious or financial success, or a life of pleasure. His obedience resulted in His death on the cross. This is the same goal Christ has for each of us-death of our old nature so that He might live through us. That may not sell well among outcome-based Christian businesspeople, but it will result in an eternal reward that far exceeds any earthly reward. "Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is with Me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done" (Rev. 22:12).<br><br>The believers life is a paradox-the first will be last, death in return for life, and we are encouraged to offer praise to God to overcome a spirit of heaviness. It requires faith in a God who operates from a different set of values that are sometimes difficult to measure from human standards. Let death work in you a life that only God can raise up.<br><br></div>

To abide in Yeshua is never to quit Him for another love or another object, but to remain in living, loving, conscious, willing union with Him. The branch is not only ever near the stem but ever receiving life and fruitfulness horn it. All true believers abide in Yeshua in a sense; but there is a higher meaning, and this we must know before we can gain unlimited power at the throne. "Ask what ye will" is for Enochs who walk with God, for Johns who lie in the LORD's bosom, for those whose union with Yeshua leads to constant communion.<br><br>The heart must remain in love, the mind must be rooted in faith, the hope must be cemented to the Word, the whole man must be joined unto the LORD, or else it would be dangerous to trust us with power in prayer. The carte blanche can only be given to one whose very life is, "Not I, but Yeshua liveth in me." O you who break your fellowship, what power you lose! If you would be mighty in your pleadings, the LORD Himself must abide in you, and you in Him.<br></div>

He argued from past deliverance's that he should receive help in a new danger. In Jesus all the promises are "Yea" and "Amen" to the glory of God by us, and so the LORD's former dealings with His believing people will be repeated.<br><br>Come, then, let us recall the LORD's former lovingkindness. We could not have hoped to be delivered aforetime by our own strength; yet the LORD delivered us. Will He not again save us? We are sure He will. As David ran to meet his foe, so will we. The LORD has been with us, He is with us, and He has said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee," Why do we tremble? Was the past a dream? Think of the dead bear and lion. Who is this Philistine? True, he is not quite the same, and is neither bear nor lion; but then God is the same, and His honor is as much concerned in the one case as in the other. He did not save us from the beasts of the forest to let a giant kill us. Let us be of good courage.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Blessing on Littleness<br>"He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great"   (Psalm 115:13).<br><br>This is a word of cheer to those who are of humble station and mean estate. Our God has a very gracious consideration for those of small property, small talent, small influence, small weight. God careth for the small things in creation and even regards sparrows in their lighting upon the ground. Nothing is small to God, for He makes use of insignificant agents for the accomplishment of His purposes. Let the least among men seek of God a blessing upon his littleness, and he shall find his contracted sphere to be a happy one.<br><br>Among those who fear the LORD there are little and great. Some are babes, and others are giants. But these are all blessed. Little faith is blessed faith. Trembling hope is blessed hope. Every grace of the Holy Spirit, even though it be only in the bud, bears a blessing within it. Moreover, the LORD Yeshua bought both the small and the great with the same precious blood, and He has engaged to preserve the lambs as well as the full-grown sheep. No mother overlooks her child because it is little; nay, the smaller it is, the more tenderly does she nurse it. If there be any preference with the LORD, He does not arrange them as "great and small" but as "small and great."</div>

Art thou entangled in a dark wood and canst thou not find thy paths? Stand still, and see the salvation of God. He knows the way, and He will direct thee in it if thou cry unto Him.<br><br>Every day brings its own perplexity. How sweet to feel that the guidance of the LORD is continual! If we choose our own way or consult with flesh and blood we cast ok the LORD's guidance; but if we abstain from self-will, then He will direct every step of our road, every hour of the day, and every day of the year, and every year of our life. If we will but be guided, we shall be guided. If we will commit our way unto the LORD, He will direct our course so that we shall not lose ourselves.<br><br>But note to whom this promise is made. Read the previous verse: "If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry." We must feel for others and give them, not a few dry crusts, but such things as we ourselves would wish to receive. If we show a tender care for our fellow-creatures in the hour of their need, then will the LORD attend to our necessities and make Himself our continual Guide. Yeshua is the Leader, not of misers, nor of those who oppress the poor, but of the kind and tenderhearted. Such persons are pilgrims who shall never miss their way.<br></div>

Yahweh sends it, and Yahweh removes it. Do you sigh and say, "When will the end be?" Remember that our griefs will surely and finally end when this poor earthly life is over, Let us quietly wait and patiently endure the will of the LORD till He cometh.<br><br>Meanwhile, our Father in heaven takes away the rod when His design in using it is fully served. When He has whipped away our folly, there will be no more strokes. Or, if the affliction is sent for testing us, that our graces may glorify Yahweh, it will end when the LORD has made us bear witness to His praise. We would not wish the affliction to depart till God has gotten out of us all the honor which we can possibly yield Him.<br><br>There may today be "a great calm." Who knows how soon those raging billows will give place to a sea of glass, and the sea birds sit on the gentle waves? After long tribulation the Rail is hung up, and the wheat rests in the garner. We may, before many hours are past, be just as happy as now we are sorrowful. It is not hard for the LORD to turn night into day. He that sends the clouds can as easily clear the skies. Let us be of good cheer. It is better on before. Let us sing hallelujah by anticipation<br><br></div>

He was so tired, and he just didn't feel he had anything left in him that people ought to hear. He couldn't understand it. He'd always tried to do the lord's work and lead people to Jesus. He had preached the Gospel every chance he got. He had even achieved a certain level of fame. No one could deny what a powerful soldier for Christ he had been. Reverend Davis just couldn't make sense out of the fact that God wasn't helping him now, when he needed it most. At least God owed him that.<br>Too often we fall into the trap of believing that we do God's work for Him. That's not true. The most we can do is open ourselves to let the Lord do His own work through us. When we try to do it for Him, we can only expect to grow weary. However, when God works through us, we will find a new energy and vitality that we have never experienced before. The Lord is exalted through His own strength, not ours. Open yourself to Him now, and let the true power begin to flow.<br><br></div>

And if he claims that he heard the Megilah, he probably was not listening. Imagine, the Prime Minister draws lots and decides to annihilate the entire Jewish nation. Within 24 hours he has approval from the ruler of the not-so-free-world, King Achashveirosh.<br><br>Within days, the plot is foiled, the Prime Minister is hanged and his prime target is promoted to replace him! Pretty political. Pretty miraculous. And definitely divine. Yet Hashem's name is not mentioned once in the Megilah. Why? Of course, the Megilah is replete with allusions. There are acronyms that spell the name of Hashem, and our sages explain that every time the word "King" is mentioned in the Megilah, it has a divine reference. But, still, why does the last book of the Prophets, a Divinely inspired Megilah, have only veiled references to Heavenly intervention?<br><br>It was a sweltering August day when the Greenberg brothers entered the posh Dearborn, Michigan offices of the notoriously anti-Semitic car-maker, Henry Ford.<br><br>"Mr. Ford," announced Hyman Greenberg, the eldest of the three, "we have a remarkable invention that will revolutionize the automobile industry. " Ford looked skeptical, but their threats to offer it to the competition kept his interest piqued. "We would like to demonstrate it to you in person." After a little cajoling, they brought Mr. Ford outside and asked him to enter a black Edsel that was parked in front of the building.<br><br>Norman Greenberg, the middle brother, opened the door of the car. "Please step inside Mr. Ford."<br><br>"What!" shouted the tycoon, "are you crazy? It must be two hundred degrees in that car!"<br><br>"It is," smiled the youngest brother, Max, "but sit down, Mr. Ford, and push the white button."<br><br>Intrigued, Ford pushed the button. All of a sudden a whoosh of freezing air started blowing from vents all around the car, and within seconds the automobile was not only comfortable, it was quite cool! "This is amazing!" exclaimed Ford. "How much do you want for the patent?"<br><br>Norman spoke up. "The price is one million dollars." Then he paused, "And there is something else. We want the name 'Greenberg Brothers Air Conditioning' to be stamped right next to the Ford logo."<br><br>"Money is no problem," retorted Ford, "but no way will I have a 'Jew-name' next to my logo on my cars!"<br><br>They haggled back and forth for a while and finally they settled. One and one half million dollars, and the name Greenberg would be left off. However, the first names of the Greenberg brothers would be forever emblazoned upon the console of every Ford air conditioning system.<br><br>And that is why today, whenever you enter a Ford vehicle you will see those three names clearly defined on the air-conditioning control panel: HI -- NORM -- MAX.<br><br>The writers of the Megilah left us with a message that would accompany us throughout our long exile. You will not always see G-d's signature openly emblazoned upon every circumstance. However, throughout persecution and deliverance, He is always there. And just like on Purim His obvious interference is undocumented; but we know and feel it -- and we search for it, and we find it! So, too, in every instance we must seek His name, find it, and recognize it. It may not be emblazoned on the bumper; it may be hidden on the console -- but it is there. For Hashem is always speaking. All we have to do is listen. Joyous Purim!<br><br>Text Copyright Â© 1996 by Rabbi M.
