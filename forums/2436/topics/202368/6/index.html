            <div class='col-md body'>Are You Going on With Yeshua?<br><br>It is true that Yeshua is with us through our temptations, but are we going on with Him through His temptations? Many of us turn back from going on with Yeshua from the very moment we have an experience of what He can do. Watch when Yahweh changes your circumstances to see whether you are going on with Yeshua, or siding with the world, the flesh, and the devil. We wear His name, but are we going on with Him? "From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more" ( John 6:66 ).<br><br>The temptations of Yeshua continued throughout His earthly life, and they will continue throughout the life of the Son of YHVH in us. Are we going on with Yeshua in the life we are living right now?<br><br>We have the idea that we ought to shield ourselves from some of the things YHVH brings around us. May it never be! It is YHVH who engineers our circumstances, and whatever they may be we must see that we face them while continually abiding with Him in His temptations. They are His temptations, not temptations to us, but temptations to the life of the Son of YHVH in us. Yeshua's honor is at stake in our bodily lives. Are we remaining faithful to the Son of YHVH in everything that attacks His life in us?<br><br>Are you going on with Yeshua? The way goes through Gethsemane, through the city gate, and on "outside the camp" ( Hebrews 13:13 ). The way is lonely and goes on until there is no longer even a trace of a footprint to followÂ— but only the voice saying, "FollowMe" ( Matthew 4:19 )<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Destined To Be Holy<br><br>. . it is written, Â’Be holy, for I am holyÂ’ Â—1 Peter 1:16<br><br>We must continually remind ourselves of the purpose of life. We are not destined to happiness, nor to health, but to holiness. Today we have far too many desires and interests, and our lives are being consumed and wasted by them. Many of them may be right, noble, and good, and may later be fulfilled, but in the meantime YHVH must cause their importance to us to decrease. The only thing that truly matters is whether a person will accept Yahweh who will make him holy. At all costs, a person must have the right relationship with YHVH.<br><br>Do I believe I need to be holy? Do I believe that Yahweh can come into me and make me holy? If through your preaching you convince me that I am unholy, I then resent your preaching. The preaching of the gospel awakens an intense resentment because it is designed to reveal my unholiness, but it also awakens an intense yearning and desire within me. YHVH has only one intended destiny for mankindÂ— holiness. His only goal is to produce saints. YHVH is not some eternal blessing-machine for people to use, and He did not come to save us out of pityÂ— He came to save us because He created us to be holy. Atonement through the Cross of Yeshua means that Yahweh can put me back into perfect oneness with Himself through the death of Yeshua, without a trace of anything coming between us any longer.<br><br>Never tolerate, because of sympathy for yourself or for others, any practice that is not in keeping with a holy YHVH. Holiness means absolute purity of your walk before YHVH, the words coming from your mouth, and every thought in your mindÂ— placing every detail of your life under the scrutiny of YHVH Himself. Holiness is not simply what Yahweh gives me, but what YHVH has given me that is being exhibited in my life.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Beggar and the Bread<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>A beggar came and sat before me. Â“I want bread,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“How wise you are,Â” I assured him. Â“Bread is what you need. And you have come to the right bakery.Â” So I pulled my cookbook down from my shelf and began to tell him all I knew about bread.<br><br>I spoke of flour and wheat, of grain and barley. My knowledge impressed even me as I cited the measurements and recipe. When I looked up, I was surprised to see he wasnÂ’t smiling. Â“I just want bread,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“How wise you are.Â” I applauded his choice. Â“Follow me, and IÂ’ll show you our bakery.Â” Down the hallowed halls I guided him, pausing to point out the rooms where the dough is prepared and the ovens where the bread is baked.<br><br>Â“No one has such facilities. We have bread for every need. But here is the best part,Â” I proclaimed as I pushed open two swinging doors. Â“This is our room of inspiration.Â” I knew he was moved as we stepped into the auditorium full of stained-glass windows.<br><br>The beggar didnÂ’t speak. I understood his silence. With my arm around his shoulder, I whispered, Â“It overwhelms me as well.Â” I then leaped to the podium and struck my favorite pose behind the lectern. Â“People come from miles to hear me speak. Once a week my workers gather, and I read to them the recipe from the cookbook of life.Â”<br><br>By now the beggar had taken a seat on the front row. I knew what he wanted. Â“Would you like to hear me?Â”<br><br>Â“No,Â” he said, Â“but I would like some bread.Â”<br><br>Â“How wise you are,Â” I replied. And I led him to the front door of the bakery. Â“What I have to say next is very important,Â” I told him as we stood outside. Â“Up and down this street you will find many bakeries. But take heed; they donÂ’t serve the true bread. I know of one who adds two spoons of salt rather than one. I know of another whose oven is three degrees too hot. They may call it bread,Â” I warned, Â“but itÂ’s not according to the book.Â”<br><br>The beggar turned and began walking away. Â“DonÂ’t you want bread?Â” I asked him.<br><br>He stopped, looked back at me, and shrugged, Â“I guess I lost my appetite.Â”<br><br>I shook my head and returned to my office. Â“What a shame,Â” I said to myself. Â“The world just isnÂ’t hungry for true bread anymore.Â”<br><br>I donÂ’t know what is more incredible: that God packages the bread of life in the wrapper of a country carpenter or that he gives us the keys to the delivery truck. Both moves seem pretty risky. The carpenter did his part, however. And who knows Â— we may just learn to do ours.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IF YOUR FAITH IS OFF<br>2 Corinthians 5:7<br>We walk by faith, not by sight<br><br>When my son Karl was about eight years old, I introduced him to the game of golf. I gave him a little starter set of clubs and took him out to the course with me. Karl would tee up his ball and whale away at it with his mightiest swing. Usually he sprayed the ball all over the place. But since he could only hit it 60 or 70 yards at best, his direction could be off by 20 degrees and his ball would still be in the fairway.<br><br>As he grew up and got a bigger set of clubs, Karl was able to drive the ball off the tee 150 yards and farther. But if his drive was still 20 degrees off target, his ball no longer stayed in the fairway; it usually went into the rough. Accuracy is even more important for golfers who can blast a golf ball 200 to 250 yards off the tee. The same 20-degree deviation which allowed little Karl's short drive to remain in the fairway will send a longer drive soaring out of bounds.<br><br>This simple illustration pictures an important aspect of the life of faith: Your walk is the direct result of what you believe about YHVH and yourself. If your faith is off, your walk will be off. If your walk is off, you can be sure it's because your faith is off. As a new believer, you needed some time to learn how to "hit the ball straight" in your belief system. You could be off 20 degrees in what you believed and still be on the fairway because you were still growing and had a lot to learn. But the longer you persist in a faulty belief system, the less fulfilling and productive your daily walk of faith will be. As you grow older you will find yourself stumbling through the rough or out of bounds spiritually if the course you have set for your life doesn't agree with Scripture.<br><br>For many adults, a mid-life crisis is the result of basing their concept of success and fulfillment on the world instead of on the Word of YHVH. Tragically, many of our children and teenagers are heading for the same fall because their beliefs are not founded on Scripture. As a result, their lives are often bankrupt before they leave high school.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Father, Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. Teach me Your truth today that I may walk in it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Incisive Questions<br>For reading &amp; meditation - Ecclesiastes 7:21-29<br>""So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom ..."" (v. 25)<br><br>What steps must we take, when broken by failure, to ensure that we become strong at the place of weakness? Keep in mind that the principles we are considering are not only corrective, but also preventative. The first thing we should do, whenever we have failed in anything, is to analyze the reason for the failure. These are some of the questions you should ask yourself: Have I contributed in any way to this failure by such things as inattention to detail, lack of preparation, naivet?, wrong timing, disregard of moral principles, or insensitivity to other people?s feelings? Another question is: What does God want me to learn from this failure? It is difficult, of course, to sit down and question yourself like this when failure strikes; but, as soon as possible after the event, try to assess the lessons that can be learned by honestly facing your emotions - such as hurt, anger, anxiety. Remember, when we stop learning, we stop living. Yet another question to ask yourself is this: Has God allowed this failure so that His purposes for me might be made clear? I know a man, well-known in evangelical circles, who, when he was in his teens, mapped out a career for himself. Although a brilliant student, he failed the entrance examination into his chosen profession. When the news was broken to him, he simply said, ""Lord, I just know You are involved in this: what do You want me to do?"" This was the moment God had been waiting for, and He showed him a new path that has made him Christ's ambassador to millions.<br>Prayer:<br><br>Father, help me to face my failure in the knowledge that some good can be wrested from even the most depressing circumstances. Show me that incisive questions can bring incisive answers. In Jesus' Name. Amen.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking Failure in the Face<br>For reading &amp; meditation - John 13:12-32<br>""... 'Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him.'"" (v. 31)<br><br>The second thing we should do when failure strikes is to face it in the knowledge that with God something can be made out of it. The account before us today tells of Christ's betrayal by Judas. Notice how Jesus first accepted the situation before He went on to make something out of it. The Master said: ""What you are about to do, do quickly."" He made no attempt to ignore the situation, sweep it under the carpet, or pretend it was not there - instead He calmly and deliberately faced reality. Before we go any further, make up your mind to face up to all of life's problems, because if you try to ignore them, you will become inwardly demeaned. The account continues: ""As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night. When he was gone, Jesus said, 'Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him. '"" Not only did Jesus accept the situation, but He moved on to turn it into victory. No self-pity, no egotistical concern - He took charge of the situation and made the betrayal contribute to His victory. Was Jesus hurt by Judas' betrayal? I should think so. But instead of spending the night wallowing in self-pity He looked at the situation from God's point of view and quietly affirmed: ""Now is the Son of Man glorified."" It may take you a little while to be able to respond to difficult situations in the way Jesus did, but remember this - the resources on which the Master drew are yours for the asking.<br>Prayer:<br><br>Father, I see that my life will be made or broken at the place where I acknowledge and deal with my failures. Help me not to run away from them, because in You I am more than a match for anything. Thank You, Father. Amen.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion.--Proverbs 28:1<br><br>If the devil canÂ’t discourage and defeat you by slander or false accusations, heÂ’ll try to bring you down by tempting you to commit outright sin. And it takes incredible, God-given discernment to avoid SatanÂ’s traps.<br><br>ThatÂ’s the situation Nehemiah faced in verses 10-14 of chapter 6. The plot against him was very clever. A false prophet said to Nehemiah, Â“God told me that your enemies are coming to kill you. Quick! Run and hide in the temple.Â”<br><br>But Nehemiah was a discerning man. He knew God had not sent this so-called prophet. Nehemiah also knew if he listened to this man and hid in the inner recesses of the temple, that act would break the commandment of God and expose Nehemiah to all the people as a sinner.<br><br>So Nehemiah replied, Â“Should such a man as I run away?Â” (Nehemiah 6:11). It was a statement of holy boldness, not one of human braggadocio. Sometimes GodÂ’s people are gullible and respond to any so-called message from Him. But Nehemiah knew the Word of God, so he could spot a sin when he saw one. Consequently, he wasnÂ’t fooled.<br><br>The same applies in your life today. Knowing GodÂ’s Word gives you incredible discernment.

            <div class='col-md body'>Echoes from Heaven<br>By Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>This week's portion begins with Moshe's poetic plea, " Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak; and may the earth hear the words of my mouth." (Deuteronomy 32:1)<br><br>The verb tense differs dramatically from the beginning of the sentence to the end. Normally a plea is said in the active tense. It is uttered as a command. "Give ear O heavens." "Listen my people." "Lend me your ear." When it comes to the heavens, Moshe expresses his appeal in an active manner. When it comes to the earth however, the expression becomes passive: "May the earth hear." It is almost as if he is not commanding but submissively acquiescing. "I cannot command the earth to pay attention, rather, may it overhear my pleas."<br><br>The Ohr HaChaim points out this anomaly and wonders why Moshe tells the heavens to listen, but he does not include the earth in that directive. Instead Moshe says that the earth shall hear, almost as if the proverbial earth is listening in the background to the prophecy he directed toward their heavenly counterparts.<br><br>Rabbi Yissachar Frand, Magid Shiur in Yeshiva Ner Israel, Baltimore, and noted author and lecturer, tells a story that he heard from a Rabbi in Dallas, Texas.<br><br>One day a man walked into the office of his orthodox shul in Dallas. The man was obviously not an observant Jew. In fact, the Rabbi never saw him in the synagogue before.<br><br>"Rabbi," he said, "I'd like to make a contribution." . He proceeded to hand over a check for ten thousand dollars.<br><br>The rabbi was flabbergasted. He did not know this man, nor had the man ever seen the Rabbi. Yet, he just handed over a tremendous gift to the synagogue. "Please, " said the rabbi. "There must be a reason. After all, you are giving this donation to a rabbi whom you do not know and to a shul in which you do not participate. Please tell me the reason."<br><br>"The man answered very simply. "Not long ago I was in Israel. I went to the Wall. There I saw a man. He was obviously a very observant Jew. He was praying with such fervor, with unparalleled enthusiasm and feeling. I just stood there and listened. I heard his pleas and supplications, I saw him sway with all his might, I saw his outpouring of faith, love, and devotion all harmoniously blending as an offering to G-d. From the day I saw that man pray, I could not get him out of my mind. If this is Judaism, I want to be part of it. I want to help perpetuate it." Perhaps Moshe is teaching us the significance of an active, forceful, message and its passive ramifications. Effective influence may not only come when talking to a particular individual, rather it may also come when others hear.<br><br>My grandfather, Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetzky of blessed memory, explains that the word for influence in the Hebrew language, hashpa'ah, comes from the same root as the word slant or incline, shipuah. There are two ways to water a garden; one is to douse the vegetation directly. That takes effort and constant wetting. A better way that is more practical is to build a slated roof from which the steady flow of rain will irrigate the vegetation. Moshe teaches us that to the heavens we may have to shout. But we don't have to shout at the earth. Because when we speak to the heavens with fervor and enthusiasm, the earth listens as well.<br><br>Good Shabbos<br><br>This is not to perpetuate Judiasm, but there is much we can learn from this....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Satan has asked to sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you,Simon,<br>that your faith may not fail. (Luke 22:31Â–32)<br><br>Our faith is the center of the target God aims at when He tests<br>us, and if any gift escapes untested, it certainly will not be our<br>faith.There is nothing that pierces faith to its very marrowÂ—<br>to find whether or not it is the faith of those who are immortalÂ—<br>like shooting the arrow of the feeling of being deserted<br>into it. And only genuine faith will escape unharmed from the<br>midst of the battle after having been stripped of its armor of<br>earthly enjoyment and after having endured the circumstances<br>coming against it that the powerful hand of God has allowed.<br>Faith must be tested, and the sense of feeling deserted is "the<br>furnace heated seven times hotter than usual" (Dan. 3:19) into<br>which it may be thrown. Blessed is the person who endures such<br>an ordeal! Charles H. Spurgeon<br><br>Paul said, "I have kept the faith" (2 Tim. 4:7), but his head<br>was removed! They cut it off,but they could not touch his faith.<br>This great apostle to the Gentiles rejoiced in three things: he<br>had "fought the good fight," he had "finished the race," and he<br>had "kept the faith." So what was the value of everything else?<br>The apostle Paul had won the race and gained the ultimate<br>prizeÂ—he had won not only the admiration of those on earth<br>today but also the admiration of heaven. So why do we not live<br>as if it pays to lose "all things . . . that [we] may gain Christ" (Phil.<br>3:8 )? Why are we not as loyal to the truth as Paul was? It is<br>because our math is differentÂ—he counted in a different way<br>than we do.What we count as gain, he counted as loss. If we<br>desire to ultimately wear the same crown,we must have his faith<br>and live it.<br></div>
