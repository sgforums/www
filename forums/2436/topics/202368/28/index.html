            <div class='col-md body'>The Interests of Others<br>Philippians 2:4<br>Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.<br><br>One of the walls of Christianity that has existed for centuries is the attitude of many "full-time" Christian workers and businesspeople. Often pastors, missionaries, and other "full timers" (I put this in quotes since all of us should consider ourselves full time) see businesspeople as a dollar sign. They see them as the instrument to fund their next project or provide the support they need. This wrong view toward businesspeople encourages them to harden their hearts toward legitimate projects. It creates a vicious cycle in which satan robs both servants of God of the blessing of each other's gifts and talents.<br><br>I once attended an international conference in which businesspeople acknowledged having this attitude toward Christian workers. Christian workers asked for forgiveness for viewing those in business as objects for funding. There was a time of repentance and tears for the selfish attitude and callousness of both groups. Christian businesspeople have more to offer the Kingdom than their dollars, but this is often overlooked.<br><br>Paul admonishes us to:<br><br>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus (Philippians 2:3-5).<br><br>If the God of the universe came as a humble servant, we in business must maintain our humble servant attitude toward those who have lesser means and are seeking to serve the Lord. God has entrusted many of us in business with greater resources. The test is to examine whether we are operating in vanity or Christ-like servanthood, looking out for the interests of others.<br><br>Ask the Lord to provide the grace to consider each request that comes to you for assistance and to avoid becoming callous to these requests. This is one test from God that He brings to determine whether you will serve others before yourself. The true test of giving is when it has no benefit to yourself.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Graduate-Level Test: Self-defense<br>Psalms 37:6<br>He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun.<br><br>As a believer grows in trusting obedience and love, God often brings a test that seems uncharacteristically cruel. That test is being wrongfully judged by those close to you. It is not for the reactionary. It cannot be passed over by simply gutting it out. Supernatural grace is the only means of passing this one. It is one of those tests the Savior had to experience Himself when being tried by the court of public opinion, the religious community, and the government of His day. His response to the government was silence. His response to the religious establishment was silence at the final judgment. To the rest of His accusers He remained quiet and left vindication to the Father. He lived the commandment He gave to the disciples:<br><br>"But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked" (Luke 6:35).<br><br>How do you react when you are accused or mistreated for no reason? Do you listen quietly, or do you justify each and every action? Most of us take pride in doing what is right and expect the same from others, especially our brothers and sisters in the faith. Jesus knew that if you were to be a true follower of His, you would enter this test eventually. It is part of the program. The marketplace gives ample opportunity to be wronged, misunderstood, and maligned. When God brings a measured assault against one of His children, it is to find out if he truly believes in the cross. The cross is where each of us is given the opportunity to die to our pride, our reputations, and our ego. When He allows a measured assault upon us, it is to find out if the cross is sufficient. He wants to see if we will seek to rescue ourselves. Jesus said if we die with Him, we will be raised with Him. When God allows satan to bring the measured assault, ask God for the grace to cling to the cross. Let the pride and arrogance that Jesus wants to remove from our lives be crucified. Thank God for the opportunity to be crucified with Christ. Then your righteousness will shine like the noonday sun and the justice of your cause will be in His hands.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Four Attributes of a Life God Blesses<br>Isaiah 28:16<br>So this is what the Sovereign Lord says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed."<br><br>Whenever God calls us into a consecrated life, it is made up of four distinct stages. Christ often compared this process to building a house. First, we must prepare to build by laying a foundation. That foundation is none other than Jesus Christ Himself. Any foundation other than Christ will not stand.<br><br>Second, as we enter a walk of faith with God, He allows each of us to experience trials, testings, miracles, and challenges in life that are designed to provide "faith experiences" that demonstrate tangible evidences of His work in our life: Moses' burning-bush experience, Peter's walk on the water, Joshua's parting of the Jordan River. These experiences built the faith of these people. The depth and width of our calling is directly proportional to the faith experiences He allows in each of our lives. If God plans an international ministry with you, chances are you will experience a higher degree of faith experiences compared to another. The reason is, you will need to look on these to ensure your calling and provide testimony to His work in your life.<br><br>The third stage deals with motives. "All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the Lord" (Prov. 16:2). What is the motive behind my actions? Is it only financial accumulation? Is it to gain control? Is it to create independence? The primary motive must be God's leading you to take such an action-it must be obedience. These other factors must be by-products of the decision.<br><br>Finally, we are prepared to take action. Here we must ask, "Do we have the skill, quality, and ability to enter into this activity?" So often we have not trained ourselves adequately to be successful in our endeavor. You would never want someone working on your teeth who had not been trained and certified as a dentist.<br><br>Before you begin your next project, ask yourself these four questions. What is the foundation this project is based on? What experiences has God demonstrated in my life that indicate His involvement? What is my motive for entering this activity? Do I have the skill, quality, and ability to accomplish the task? Answering these questions will tell you whether God will bless your activity.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Using Satan for God's Purposes<br>1 Corinthians 5:5<br>Hand this man over to satan, so that the sinful nature may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.<br><br>Paul encountered a believer who was involved in an incestuous relationship in the Corinthian church. This man was deluded by Satan and was controlled by immorality. The man was unwilling to change his behavior, so Paul recommended to the church that tough actions be taken. He spiritually handed this man over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh for the benefit of his soul. The idea is that the person will wallow in the pit of sin so long until it becomes detestable to him and he cries out for God's grace. We know this man was a Christian because only a Christian can be subjected to church discipline.<br><br>Have you ever known someone who was walking in disobedience and no matter how much you prayed, he seemed oblivious to his sin? God has given one weapon to counter Satan's schemes against those who fall prey to Satan. That is, let Satan have access to them fully so that their lives become so miserable they cry out to God for mercy. Probably few of us have ever had to pray this prayer. However, you should not be fearful of this prayer for any believer who is willingly walking in disobedience. This is love - tough love. There is a time and place for tough love. I have seen this principle work. God restores His children when His Body takes a stand against sin. It is not comfortable for those who take this action.<br><br>Do you know someone who needs tough love in his or her life right now? Ask God if it is time to pray the prayer that Paul prayed: "So that his spirit might be saved on the day of the Lord."<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Knowledge That is Productive<br>2 Peter 1:8<br>For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Productivity is a term all businesspeople can relate to. It is the by-product of what we desire from our work. Without productivity, we do not make sales, we do not deliver goods, we do not achieve our goals. There are things in our business lives that can creep in making us unproductive. The same is true in our walk with God.<br><br>The apostle Peter tells us that we can become knowledgeable of Jesus but fail to be effective and productive in our relationship with Him. We are a society that has great knowledge, but our comparable scale of productivity from that knowledge is extremely weighted to the knowledge side. The apostle Peter tells us there is a solution to this dilemma.<br><br>For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:5-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>Is your Christian experience filled with knowledge, but little power? Is there a staleness in your walk with God? Is there an unrest in your soul? It may be due to a need to develop character that only the Holy Spirit can develop out of an obedient heart. Ask the Lord today to add these qualities to your faith so that you can be productive as a soldier of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

Yes, is it not an asbestos armor, against which the heat has no power? Let the affliction come--God has chosen me. Poverty, thou mayest stride in at my door; but God is in the house already, and He has chosen me. Sickness, thou mayest intrude; but I have a balsam ready--God has chosen me. Whatever befall me in this vale of tears, I know that He has chosen me.<br>Fear not, Christian; Jesus is with thee. In all thy fiery trials, His presence is both thy comfort and safety. He will never leave one whom He has chosen for His own. "Fear not, for I am with thee," is His sure word of promise to His chosen ones in "the furnace of affliction." --C. H. Spurgeon<br><br>Pain's furnace heat within me quivers, God's breath upon the flame doth blow; And all my heart in anguish shivers And trembles at the fiery glow; And yet I whisper, "As God will!" And in the hottest fire hold still.<br>He comes and lays my heart, all heated, On the hard anvil, minded so Into His own fair shape to beat it With His great hammer, blow on blow; And yet I whisper, "As God will!" And at His heaviest blows hold still.<br><br>He takes my softened heart and beats it; The sparks fly off at every blow; He turns it o'er and o'er and heats it, And lets it cool, and makes it glow; And yet I whisper, "As God will!" And in His mighty hand hold still.<br>Why should I murmur? for the sorrow Thus only longer-lived would be; The end may come, and will tomorrow, When God has done His work in me; So I say trusting, "As God will!"

            <div class='col-md body'>Weights Become Wings<br>"They shall mount up with wings as eagles" (Isa.40:31).<br><br>There is a fable about the way the birds got their wings at the beginning. They were first made without wings. Then God made the wings and put them down before the wingless birds and said to them, "Come, take up these burdens and bear them."<br>The birds had lovely plumage and sweet voices; they could sing, and their feathers gleamed in the sunshine, but they could not soar in the air. They hesitated at first when bidden to take up the burdens that lay at their feet, but soon they obeyed, and taking up the wings in their beaks, laid them on their shoulders to carry them.<br><br>For a little while the load seemed heavy and hard to bear, but presently, as they went on carrying the burdens, folding them over their hearts, the wings grew fast to their little bodies, and soon they discovered how to use them, and were lifted by them up into the air--the weights became wings.<br>It is a parable. We are the wingless birds, and our duties and tasks are the pinions God has made to lift us up and carry us heavenward. We look at our burdens and heavy loads, and shrink from them; but as we lift them and bind them about our hearts, they become wings, and on them we rise and soar toward God.<br><br>There is no burden which, if we lift it cheerfully and bear it with love in our hearts, will not become a blessing to us. God means our tasks to be our helpers; to refuse to bend our shoulders to receive a load, is to decline a new opportunity for growth. --J. R. Miller<br>Blessed is any weight, however overwhelming, which God has been so good as to fasten with His own hand upon our shoulders. F. W. Faber<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Keep Your Hands Off<br>"Neither know we what to do; but our eyes are, upon thee" (2 Chron. 20:12).<br><br>A life was lost in Israel because a pair of human hands were laid unbidden upon the ark of God. They were placed upon it with the best intent, to steady it when trembling and shaking as the oxen drew it along the rough way; but they touched God's work presumptuously, and they fell paralyzed and lifeless. Much of the life of faith consists in letting things alone.<br>If we wholly trust an interest to God, we must keep our hands off it; and He will guard it for us better than we can help Him. "Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass."<br><br>Things may seem to be going all wrong, but He knows as well as we; and He will arise in the right moment if we are really trusting Him so fully as to let Him work in His own way and time. There is nothing so masterly as inactivity in some things, and there is nothing so hurtful as restless working, for God has undertaken to work His sovereign will. --A. B. Simpson<br>"Being perplexed, I say, 'Lord, make it right! Night is as day to Thee, Darkness as light. I am afraid to touch Things that involve so much; My trembling hand may shake, My skilless hand may break; Thine can make no mistake.'<br><br>"Being in doubt I say, 'Lord, make it plain; Which is the true, safe way? Which would be gain? I am not wise to know, Nor sure of foot to go; What is so clear to Thee, Lord, make it clear to me!'"<br>It is such a comfort to drop the tangles of life into God's hands and leave them there.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From Strength To Strength<br><br>"How beloved [are] Your dwelling-places, Adonai Tz'vaot!  My soul desiresÂ—yes, it has also been consumedÂ—for the courts of Adonai.  My heart and my flesh cry aloud to the living God.  O the happiness of those inhabiting Your HouseÂ—ever do they praise You.  Selah.  O the happiness of a man whose might is in YouÂ—highways [to You] are in their heart.  They go from strength to strengthÂ—He appears before God in Tziyon." T'hillim (Psalms) 84:1-7<br><br>To be consumed with desire for the courts of Adonai to cry out in joy with every heartbeat for the living God to live in the House of Adonai and praise Him unceasingly forever.  The thought of such enthrallment can be almost too much to bearÂ—the mere mention of it makes some of us go weak at the knees.  But on the Day that Adonai dwells again in Tziyon, weakness will be the furthest feeling from us.  The burning passion to be in His presence will lead us into nothing but blessing, pure joy and strength.<br><br>As we draw closer to the One who is the aim of all our devotion, a hurricane of happiness and joy within us begins to gather strength.  It relentlessly seeks an outlet through which to release its mounting, mighty power.  No force on earth can withstand it.  And as the powerful storm within us finally bursts forth, all fears and weaknesses are dashed upon the rocks.  We pour out unending praise to the living God of Yis'rael, and in His presence, we are fulfilledÂ—we appear before God and go from strength to strength.<br><br>Fervor and zeal for the presence of Adonai is all-consumingÂ—it fills and completes us in a way that nothing else can.  In Adonai's presence, we grasp the reality of what we were made forÂ—without any verbal explanation, the question of who we are at our very core is answered.  When we desperately desire the consuming fire of Adonai's presence, every area of our lives becomes edified and strengthened.<br><br>O the happiness that awaits us when we find our might in Him alone, relying solely on Him for our provision, growth, and strength.  So let us desire, extol, and cry out for the living God, that we may go from strength to strength, being ever-filled by the power of His praise.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Raise the Baton!<br>In this week's portion, once again, Hashem sent Moshe and Ahron to Pharaoh in a second effort to sway his heart and have him change his mind to let the Hebrews leave Egypt. Unlike the unembellished appeal in last week's portion, this time they were equipped with more than pleas - this time they came with miracles. Standing in front of the ruler, Ahron threw his stick down and it turned into a snake. Pharaoh was not impressed. He countered with a little magic of his own. His sorcerers matched the miraculous stick-to-snake act by having his spooks throw down their sticks and by transforming them into snakes.<br><br>Ahron one-upped the Egyptian magicians as his stick swallowed all of their sticks. But that obviously was not enough. Pharaoh's heart was once again hardened and he refused to let the Jews leave Egypt. And so, Hashem decided that the benign miracles would not be effective with the stubborn king. It was time for the heavy artillery -- the ten plagues.<br><br>Hashem commands Moshe: "Go to Pharaoh in the morning -- behold! He goes out to the water -- and you shall stand opposite him at the river's bank, and the staff that was turned into a snake you shall take in your hand" (Exodus 7:15). A simple question bothers me. Moshe had only one special stick. There are various Midrashic explanations as to its origin, but everyone agrees it was a unique one. It was a special one with special powers. Moshe may have been a leader of many hats, but he only carried one stick. Why did Hashem need to define the stick as the one that turned into a snake? He could have simply asked Moshe to come with his stick. Moshe would surely have known exactly which stick Hashem wanted him to take.<br><br>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson is better known to us as Lewis Carroll, author of the 1865 children's fantasy story, Alice in Wonderland. What most of us do not know about him was that he was also a brilliant mathematician spending more than twenty-five years teaching at Oxford University.<br><br>An apocryphal story relates that Queen Victoria was so delighted after reading his fantasy-laced novel, Alice in Wonderland that she asked him to send her any other works penned by the same quill. Dodgson responded immediately, but the Queen was somewhat taken aback when she received two of his other works, Syllabus of Plane Algebraical Geometry and An Elementary Treatise on Determinants.<br><br>We tend to look at the world and forget that routine natural events are also replete with awe-inspiring miracles and supernatural properties. We become acclimated to the mundane miracles of life so that we also shrug when Hashem turns proverbial sticks into proverbial snakes. We feel we can do that too!<br><br>Therefore, before orchestrating the largest insubordination of natural law in world history, by turning the flowing Nile into a virtual blood bath, Moshe is told to bring with him the stick that Pharaoh only considered to be capable of performing minor miracles. Moshe is told that the same stick that was not able to impress Pharaoh has the ability to shatter the Egyptian economy and with it the haughty attitude that kept the Hebrew nation enslaved.<br><br>Sometimes our marvel of G-d's wonders is dulled by the scoffing of the naysayers. They lead us to forget that the same power behind the minor miracles of life are the generators of great miracles that we can hardly fathom and surely not anticipate! Even the incomprehensible miracle of life itself is blunted by its ongoing regularity. Our emotions become bored and our intellect spoiled with the majestic events that are considered trite by their regular reoccurrence. And when we fail to see the greatness of genius in the wonderland in which we live, we expect G-d to send us a more prominent message. But we must never forget that even the most awe-inspiring message comes from the same Hand and Stick that bring us the simplest benign worms!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sour Milk<br>This week Hashem tells Moshe to inform the B'nai Yisrael, that the good times will soon come. "I shall rescue you, I shall redeem you with an out stretched hand, I shall bring you to the land which I have promised your fathers, Abraham Isaac and Jacob" (cf. Exodus 6:6-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>It did not mean much. "The Children of Israel did not listen to Moshe from shortness of breath and hard work" (ibid v.9).<br><br>Next Hashem tells Moshe to tell Pharaoh to let the Jews out. Moshe responds with a reply filled with deductive reasoning. "Behold the Children of Israel did not listen, so how will Pharaoh listen?" (ibid v.12).<br><br>Our sages explain that this is on of ten "kal v'chomer" instances in the Torah. It is an example of reasoning used to logically come to halachic conclusions. ( eg. If a weightlifter can not lift the stone, surely a child can not!)<br><br>The problem is, that the reasoning seems flawed. "The Children of Israel did not listen to Moshe from shortness of breath and hard work. " Pharaoh did not suffer from either of those shortcomings! If the weightlifter with a broken back, can't lift a stone, it plays no role in telling us whether or not a child can.)<br><br>So what was Moshe's logical refutation to G-d's command?<br><br>Last week, on Thursday 23 Teves, the great Gaon, Rabbi Mordechai Gifter z"l passed away. As a student at the Telshe Yeshiva in Europe he developed a strong relationship with one Europe's foremost scholars of that era, Rav Mordechai Pogramanski z"l. He used to relate on a story Rav Pogramanski would share with his students.<br><br>A disheveled man was touring the Louvre with a group of tourists. As they passed Rembrandt's works the man looked at everyone and yelled, "Sour milk!" Puzzled, everyone thought he was crazy. He repeated it again. "It looks like sour milk!"<br><br>They moved on and passed the Mona Lisa. Again he screamed, Sour milk!" This went on a few more times until a wise man looked at the fellow. "Let me see your glasses."<br><br>The critical man gave them to him. "What did you have for breakfast?" he asked.<br><br>"Why cereal and milk," he answered.<br><br>The wise man laughed. Look at your glasses! They are speckled with milk! No wonder everything you look at appears as sour milk!<br><br>Moshe knew that Jews inherently believe. However the suffering of hard work and the evil treatment of Egyptian masters tainted their faith. But hard work alone does not taint faith. It is only when it is exasperated by the torment of the taskmasters, and their cruel taunts. How much more so, he figured, would Pharaoh be inattentive of the command that Hashem is in charge, and the Jews should be let free. If hard work stains the thought process, blocking the beauty of Hashem's word to filter through, how much more so does the idolatry and heresy of Pharaoh impede them from penetrating!<br><br>We look at Hashem's creation. We go to synagogue. We hear mussar. We read the prophets. But somehow it does not get through. The words are beautiful. Those who hear them can be inspired. But so many impediments block our vision and our hearing. Our lifestyles. Our desires. Even our work.<br><br>If we'd open our eyes we would see so much holiness! But only if their glasses are not tainted with sour milk.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buy Low, Sell High<br><br>In this week's parsha, G-d instructs Moshe and Aharon to go to Pharaoh. G-d tells them how Pharaoh will react, and what will occur step by step.<br><br>"And G-d said to Moshe 'see that I have made you a master over Pharaoh...and (ultimately) he will send The Children of Israel from his land. I will strengthen Pharaoh's heart...and Pharaoh will not listen to you (at first), and I will place My hand on Egypt, and (then) I will bring out My legions, My people, from the land of Egypt...'And Moshe and Aharon did just as G-d commanded them...and Moshe was eighty years old, and Aharon was eighty three years old when they spoke with Pharaoh." (Exodus 7:1-7)<br><br>Everything in these seven short verses seem to make perfect sense together except the last one regarding the ages of Moshe and Aharon. This verse is seemingly out of place.<br><br>Rabbi Shimon Schwab, in his work Mayan Beis HaShoaiva, notes the inconsistency, an offers the following solution.<br><br>If we would stop to think about the era in which Moshe and Aharon were born, we would be reminded of an astounding thing. The decree of "if it is a male child you shall kill it" (Exodus 1:16) which Pharaoh ordered to the Jewish midwives, was at the time that Aharon was born. When Moshe was born, the decree of "every male child born should be thrown into the river." (Exodus 1:22). The root of the name Aharon means "conception," as in conceiving a child. This is most likely because it was so amazing that Aharon managed to see the light of day.<br><br>Rav Schwab says that there is an undercurrent being conveyed here in the Torah. Here are Moshe and Aharon, living and breathing manifestations of Pharaoh's decrees made null and void!<br><br>I find this an encouraging message. "There are many thoughts in the heart of man, but the counsel of G-d, it (alone) sustains." (Proverbs 19:21 ) Pharaoh did everything he could to annul the astrological prediction that the Children of Israel's redeemer would come from a child born in that time of vicious decrees. Nevertheless here stand Moshe and Aharon who somehow managed to make it through. As Rabbi Berel Wein always says "G-d has a sense of humor."<br><br><strong>The message is clear. Things are never as bad as they look. Never despair because out of the darkest of situations came the brightest of lights. </strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Give It Your All<br><br>By Rabbi Elly Broch<br>"Amram took Yocheved his aunt as a wife, and she bore him Aaron and Moshe.This is the Aaron and Moshe to whom G-d said, 'Take the children of Israel out of Egypt according to their legions.' They are the ones who spoke to Pharaoh, King of Egypt, to take the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; this is Moshe and Aaron." (Shemos/Exodus 6:20, 26-27)<br><br>Rashi observes the variation of the order in which Moshe and Aaron are mentioned; there are places where Aaron is mentioned before Moshe and others where it is reversed. Rashi explains that this occurs because the brothers were considered equal in greatness. Although a fascinating sentiment, how is it possible to equate Aaron to Moshe, the greatest leader of the Jewish Nation, whom G-d Himself declared as the supreme prophet and one who surpassed all in humility? Further, Moshe alone was chosen to give over the Torah to the people of Israel.<br><br>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (1) explains that certainly Moshe was objectively greater than Aaron in his spiritual achievements and intensity of closeness to his Creator. However, Aaron fulfilled his potential to the best of his ability and harnessed all his talents in serving G-d. They both fulfilled all they were capable of achieving and were, therefore, equal in the Divine Perspective. Thus, he merited to be compared to his brother Moshe.<br><br>The Talmud (Bava Basra 10b) states that when Rabbi Yosef was soon to leave this world, his father, Rabbi Yehoshua, asked him what he could see. "An upside down world," he answered. "The elevated people are lowly and the lowly are honored." This reveals to us that there are those who in this world enjoy an elevated and respected position who in the next world are not accorded such great honor. In contrast, there are those who are lowly, poor and despised in this world, but achieve great recognition in the next world. The Talmud teaches us that only G-d knows a person's abilities and potential, only He can determine if he is utilizing his talents to the fullest. Therefore, the results and achievements expected from different people are different. There may be individuals who do not seem to generate results or accomplish a great deal, due to some personal constraints, but who invest themselves fully in their lives. There are others who may possess numerous talents and abilities who can achieve great accolades even without fully engaging themselves. They may experience an abundance of rewards, honors and recognition in this world but may be disappointed in the afterlife, when G-d relates to them according to their unrealized potential.<br><br>We live in an externally-oriented world in which only tangible results count, causing us to define achievement in superficial terms. Those who are talented, cunning and visibly productive are respected, whereas those who do not are overlooked. Appreciating another's inherent worth is not an employment situation, where one qualifies only if he can perform the requisite tasks at hand. G-d gives each of His children the tools he needs for life; success in Jewish terms is defined by growth accomplished and effort expended given the tools this individual has at his disposal. Regardless of the quantitative output, a person who sincerely strives and struggles is a spiritual success.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Effort Department<br>by Rabbi Shlomo Jarcaig<br><br>Following the narrative in which G-d elucidated to Moshe (Moses) how he would approach Pharaoh and Pharaoh would ignore him, the Torah states "Moshe was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh." (Shemos/Exodus 7:7) As there are no extraneous letters, no less words or phrases, in the Torah's text, this verse's presence is perplexing. The Torah is very clear about Moshe and Aaron's ages at their death, and that they died in the fortieth year of the travels in the wilderness; why do we need to have their current ages calculated? More so, what is the significance of their age at this time; if Moshe had been sixty-three or seventy-seven, would it change the impact of the narrative? Finally, of all the events at this stage in Jewish history, why does the age need to be told specifically "when they spoke to Pharaoh"?<br><br>Rabbi Shimon Schwab (1) explains that the Torah emphasized their ages because of their significance to Pharaoh's own decrees: eighty three years previous Pharaoh instructed the Jewish midwives that all Jewish male children were to be killed immediately after birth, and three years later the order was revised to demand all Jewish male children be thrown into the Nile. These decrees, executed to prevent the existence of a redeemer who would lead the Jewish people out of Egypt, actually spawned Moshe's elevation to greatness. Without Pharaoh's command, Moshe would never have been hidden in the basket and cast into the Nile, never have been taken in by Pharaoh's daughter, never been raised in Pharaoh's own home and never learned the requisite lessons of leadership. Pharaoh's efforts to the contrary notwithstanding, the Divine will came to fruition, as it always had and always will.<br><br>No matter the lessons to be learned from historical experience - whether one's own experience or the experience of others related by reliable narratives - all human beings, like Pharaoh, want to believe that the events around them are as simple as they appear to one's own perception. Everyone rationally knows that he cannot possibly fathom the entirety of every scenario into which he enters, but now in that situation, he is forced to absorb the reality and make snap decisions. The "Pharaoh"s of the world have nothing to follow but their limited scope of vision and their feeble intellects to navigate this expansive universe of reality; good fortune to them. But the G-d conscious Jew knows that he is not in control; he understands that his Heavenly Parent is in full control and has addressed every perceptible and imperceptible variable. The Divine will will come to fruition, as it always has and always will. The G-d conscious Jew knows that his job is "simple": forge the bond of love and trust with the Divine Parent by following the timeless instruction offered in the Torah as he makes his best effort to attend to the situation. As Rabbi Tarfon taught us (Pirkei Avos/Ethics of Our Fathers 2:20-21), "The day is short, the task is abundant...you are not required to complete the task, yet you are not free to withdraw from it."<br><br>A parable is told of a man who works in the production department of a large manufacturing concern, who is asked about the health of the company's sales. The production worker responds that production is as busy as always, so he does not think about sales. "My job is production. My attention and energy are consumed by my focus on my production objectives. Just as the people in sales trust me to produce the product they are selling, I trust them to sell the product I am manufacturing. I do my job and they do theirs." The G-d conscious Jew knows his production objective is clear: build and strengthen his G-d consciousness by utilizing the direction of the Torah - the manual of Divine "production specifications" - while he expends his best effort to address life's challenges. He does not worry about the end result because he is fully focused on his job in the "effort department". Results? That is G-d's department.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"But they did not listen to Moshe, because of their fallen spirits and the difficult work..." [6:9]<br><br>The Chofetz Chaim, Rabbi Yisrael Meyer Kagan, was once sitting with his family and friends, and he spoke about the terrible situation in the Jewish community of his day. People had truly lost their faith in G-d, and were moving away from religion.<br><br>Reb Naftali was the Rosh Mesivta (high school principal) in the yeshiva in Radin, and he was one of those listening. He responded, "Why is this a great surprise? Even in Egypt, when the Jews still remembered their forefathers, and also knew that the exile would only last 400 years, they were nonetheless so disheartened by the sheer amount of work placed upon them, that they lost hope. In our current situation, our forefathers are long forgotten, and our exile is apparently endless. Why should we be surprised then, if we see people losing their faith?"<br><br>The Chofetz Chaim considered this, and realized that he was right. "You are a good defender for Israel," he said. "Your words should ascend before the Holy Throne."<br><br>No one should tell you that faith is easy. It may be possible to achieve it with logical steps, rather than a "leap." It can be maintained with study and consideration. But it is hardly trivial.<br><br>It is difficult for us to recognize that Hand of G-d in painful events. As Rabbi Zev Leff points out, this is a result of our own limited perspective. The Talmud (Pesachim 50a) asks, how can the prophet write (Zechariah 14:9) "On that day G-d will be One, and His Name, One"? Are G-d and His Name not One, right now?<br><br>The answer is that, in reality, everything that G-d does is good, but in our current circumstances we are unable to recognize this. We distinguish between the blessing ("hatov vehameitiv", Who is good and does good) that we say upon receiving good news, versus the blessing that we say upon bad news ("Dayan haEmes," the True Judge). In the World to Come, and in the Messianic Era, we will recognize that these are one and the same. We will see G-d's Mercy in every event. Today, we do not pronounce the four-letter name of G-d which indicates His transcendence of time, and His Mercy -- then, we will.<br><br>So do not be overly disappointed if, in the midst of trying times, you find yourself with doubts. On the contrary, understand that such trials are hardly new. Just strengthen yourself with the knowledge that those who remained strong were right, and were eventually taken out of Egypt. May we see this exile end soon, as well, and reach the days when "G-d will be One, and His Name, One."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>Guest Contributer: Rabbi Aaron Tendler<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>After Moshe is welcomed by the Elders of Israel and rebuffed by Pharaoh, G-d instructs him to bring the message of imminent salvation to the Children of Israel. How did the children of Israel respond to Moshe's message?<br><br>"And they did not listen to Moshe because of shortness of breath (Kotzer Ruach)<br>and harsh labor (Avoda Kasha)." [Shemos 6:9]<br>This response, or lack of response, is puzzling. If the Children of Israel found themselves in difficult straits, shouldn't the message of salvation have been all the more appealing? Why did the Children of Israel not listen to Moshe?<br><br>Rav Samson Raphael Hirsch translates Kotzer Ruach as "impatience," rather than "shortness of breath" [as Artscroll translates it, following Rashi's commentary]. In other words, it was not the physical panting caused by the harsh labor that prevented them from hearing Moshe's message. They did not listen to Moshe's message because of an emotional inability to achieve a broader perspective of their situation and comprehend that they had a hope, a future, and a destiny as a nation.<br><br>The Ohr Hachaim HaKadosh, sheds light onto this verse with an uncharacteristically succinct one liner: "Perhaps because they were not Bnei Torah [people who were involoved in Torah study], they were unable to hear his [Moshe's] message, because the Torah broadens a person's heart!"<br><br>If they would have had the opportunity to study Torah, they would not have been overwhelmed by their suffering and would have welcomed Moshe's message. Because they did not study Torah, their suffering inflicted on them a Kotzer Ruach, a narrowness of spirit, and they were unable to think beyond day to day survival.<br><br>We find this concept echoed in the very first Psalm in Tehillim. King David says, "Happy is the person who does not go in the way of the sinners... Rather his whole desire is to study the Torah of G-d... And he will be like a tree planted on a fork in the river... Not so the wicked who are as chaff that is battered in the wind."<br><br>What is the analogy between a person who studies Torah and "a tree planted on a fork in the river"? The river flows toward the tree, yet the tree remains secure, steady, and upright as the water passes around it. Chaff in the wind, on the other hand, is beaten and battered and scattered in all different directions by the forces (the wind) that it encounters.<br><br>Similarly, Torah study enables a person to retain perspective on all situations in life. It enables a person to remain open minded, and realize that there is a reason for all that happens, and ultimately all is for the best. If a person does not have the lifeline of Torah to provide support, the person is "as chaff in the wind", and easily despairs of any hope.<br><br>One of the more meaningful secular songs of the 70's contains the refrain: "Dust in the wind... All we are is dust in the wind." King David is telling us that we can be more. By designating a set time each day for Torah study, thus qualifying as Bnei Torah - Children of the Torah, we can elevate ourselves from "Dust in the Wind" to firmly rooted "trees planted on a fork in the river". Whether we are faced with personal, financial, or geopolitical hardships, if we wish to hear the message of hope and redemption, we must connect to the Lifeline of Torah.<br><br></div>

When we begin accumulating wealth, managing people, and becoming known for our workplace expertise, we are most susceptible to falling to the most devious sin in God's eyesÂ—pride. The Bible tells us that God is the reason we are able to produce wealth. It is not of our own making. As soon as we move into the place where we begin to think more highly of ourselves than we ought, God says he will take action.<br><br>You may say to yourself, "My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me."....If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed.

How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to take my life?" - 1 Samuel 20:1<br><br>The cost of being one of God's anointed can be great. Those whom God has anointed for service and influence in His Kingdom go through a special preparation. David was anointed to be the next king over Israel. Shortly after this, while still a young boy, he was brought into King Saul's service to play music in Saul's court. While there, the opportunity to stand up against Goliath elevated David for his next stage of development as future king. As his popularity grew so did Saul's jealousy. However, even Saul's jealousy was God's instrument for molding and shaping David.<br><br>Saul finally decided he could no longer tolerate David's success and popularity among the people, so he tried to kill David. The confused young shepherd boy spent many years hiding in wilderness caves before he was able to see the hand of God in all of this. No doubt David thought that when Samuel anointed him he would be conveniently raised up to be king with all the accompanying benefits of kingship. Not so. God's preparation of David involved much persecution, disloyalty, and hardship. These were the lessons necessary to be a godly king. God brought many tests in David's life, just as He did with Saul. David passed these tests. Saul did not.<br><br>When God anoints us, it often is accompanied by some severe tests. These tests are designed to prepare us for the calling God has on our life. Should we fail these tests God cannot elevate us to the next level. For a workplace believer, these tests often involve money, relationships, and other issues of the heart.<br><br>What if God has chosen you for a specific purpose in His Kingdom? Are you passing the tests He is bringing about in your life? These tests are designed to bring about greater obedience. In most instances, it will involve great adversity. The Bible tells us that the King of kings learned obedience through the things that He suffered (see Heb. 5:8 ). If this is true, why would it be any different for His children? Be aware of the tests God may be bringing before you in order to prepare you for His service.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wrestling With God<br>Os Hillman<br><br>The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip. - Genesis 32:31<br><br>Jacob was a man who was a controller. He connived and manipulated his way to get what he wanted. It was a generational stronghold passed down through his mother, who encouraged her son to play a trick on his father, Isaac, by pretending to be Esau. This trick led Isaac to give the family blessing to Jacob, which meant Jacob would eventually inherit the land God had promised to Abraham's seed. Jacob also learned control from his uncle Laban who caused Jacob to work for 14 years to take Rachel as his lifelong mate. One must ask which was more ugly in God's sight, the self-centered nature and worldliness of Esau, or the control and manipulation of Jacob?<br><br>Control is a problem for men and women. Many women use sex to control their husbands. Many men use power and force to control their wives. Control is at the core of that which is opposite the cross-self-rule. What delivers us from this fleshly nature of control? A crisis. Jacob's crisis came when he was faced with the prospect of meeting a brother who said he would kill him the next time he saw him. Esau had built his own clan and was about to meet Jacob and his clan in the middle of the desert. Jacob was fearful, so he retreated. There he met a messenger from God who wrestled with him. Jacob clung to God and refused to let go of this angel. It is the place where Jacob was given a painful but necessary spiritual heart transplant. From that point on, Jacob would walk with a limp, because God had to dislocate his hip in order to overcome Jacob's strong will.<br><br>For workplace believers, God often has to "dislocate our hip" through failure and disappointment. Sometimes it is the only way He can get our attention. Our nature to control and manipulate is so strong that it takes a catastrophic event to wake us up. Yet God did not reject Jacob for these character traits. In fact, God blessed him greatly because He saw something in Jacob that pleased Him. He saw a humble and contrite heart beneath the cold and manipulative exterior of Jacob's life, and it was that trait that God needed to develop. He did this by bringing about the crisis in Jacob's life that led to total consecration. This event was marked by Jacob getting a new name, Israel. For the first time, Jacob had a nature change, not just a habit change. What will God have to do in our lives to gain our complete consecration to His will and purposes?<br><br>"Beware of the Christian leader who does not walk with a limp."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God-Inspired Delays<br>Os Hillman<br><br>Yet when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was two more days. - John 11:6<br><br>Delays in our life are not always easy to handle or to reconcile in our minds. Often, when God does not answer our prayers in the time that we feel He should, we appoint all sorts of characteristics to God's nature that imply He does not care. Such was the case with Lazarus' sisters when Lazarus became ill and died. Jesus was a close friend to Lazarus and his two sisters, Mary and Martha. (Mary, you may recall, was the woman who came and poured perfume on Jesus' feet.) When Jesus arrived two days later, Martha shamed Him by saying, "If You had come he would not have died." She implied that He didn't care enough to come when sent for. It was a matter of priorities for Jesus, not lack of love.<br><br>God often has to delay His work in us in order to accomplish something for His purposes that can be achieved only in the delay. Jesus had to let Lazarus die in order for the miracle that was about to take place to have its full effect. If Jesus had simply healed a sick man, the impact of the miracle would not have been as newsworthy as resurrecting a man who had been dead for four days. This is Jesus' greatest "public relations act" of His whole ministry. What many do not realize is that the key to the whole story is in the next chapter.<br><br>Many people, because they had heard that He had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet Him. So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after Him!" (John 12:18-19)<br><br>If Jesus had not raised Lazarus from the dead, there would have been no crowds to cheer the Lord when He came into Jerusalem riding on a donkey.<br><br>God often sets the stage so that His glory is revealed through the events that He orchestrates. He did this with Moses and Pharaoh, allowing delay after delay for release of the Israelites from Egypt. He did this with Abraham and Sarah for the promised child, Isaac. God granted Sarah a baby past the age of childbearing in order to demonstrate His power.<br><br>God did this in my own life. He delayed the fulfillment of what I believed He called me to do for several years. But the delays provided the necessary preparation and greater glory that God was to receive. My friend, don't take the delays lightly. Do not faint as God places you in what seems to be a holding pattern. God is at work. God knows the purposes for His delays. Don't give up, for they are for His greater glory; so we need to remain faithful.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Blessing Those Who Curse You<br>Os Hillman<br><br>..."Leave him alone; let him curse, for the Lord has told him to. It may be that the Lord will see my distress and repay me with good for the cursing I am receiving today." - 2 Samuel 16:11-12<br><br>As David's enemies were increasing and he was fleeing the city from his son who was seeking to take his throne, a man named Shimei began heaving rocks and cursing him as he passed by. Cursing the king was against the law, so David had every right to cut off the man's headÂ—as his generals were encouraging him to do. Here we see the difference between Saul and David in their response to those who would seek to do them harm. This is the defining difference between a leader who seeks to lead through a vertical dimension with God versus a horizontal fix-it mode. God knew David as a man after His own heart. Yet, David was a murderer, adulterer, and had failed in many areas of his life. But one thing separated this leader from all the rest: He had a heart that sought to please God and be in His will. When David blew it, he repented.<br><br>What is the purpose God desires to accomplish with the estranged relationship you may have with someone? Has He brought this affront to find out what is in your heart today? Will you seek revenge and solve the problem yourself? Or will you find the grace to allow God to carry out vengeance in His time if it is needed? When I learned this lesson to stay vertical with God and avoid the trap of fixing things in my own energies, it was a day of freedom. No longer was it my problem. We must examine our own heart in these matters. But if we are clean, then this affront is for character building. It is the only way God builds the deepest level of character in His saints. A.W. Tozer tells us, "It is doubtful whether God can bless a man greatly until he has hurt him deeply." God actually rises up storms of conflict in relationships at times in order to accomplish that deeper work in our character. We cannot love our enemies in our own strength. This is graduate-level grace. Are you willing to enter this school? Are you willing to take the test? If you pass, you can expect to be elevated to a new level in the Kingdom. For He brings us through these tests as preparation for greater use in the Kingdom. You must pass the test first.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hitting Pay Dirt<br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>There is a certain sensitivity displayed in this week's portion that serves as a lesson to mankind.<br><br>The first two of the 10 plagues that befell Egypt evolved around water. In the first plague, the waters of Egypt turned into blood. The second plague had frogs emerge from the water. In order to generate those miraculous events Moshe's staff struck the waters. Moshe, however, did not strike the water. He was told that his brother Ahron should do the smiting After all, as a three-month-old child the waters of the Nile were Moshe's refuge as he was hidden in a reed basket from Pharaoh's soldiers who were drowning all Jewish males. It would not be fitting for one who was saved by the water to strike it.<br><br>The next plague, lice, emerged from the earth. After striking the earth with his staff, lice emerged, afflicting all of Egypt. Again Moshe was told not to be the agent of transmutation. After all, he must be grateful to the earth that hid the Egyptian whom he had killed.<br><br>Of course, the great ethicists derive from Moshe's behavior the importance of gratitude. "Imagine," they point out, "Moshe had to refrain from striking inanimate objects because he was saved by them years back! How much more must we show gratitude to living beings who have been our vehicles of good fortune."<br><br>Such morals deserve a homily to themselves, and there are countless stories of gratitude to accompany such essays. However, I am bothered by the simplicity of that message and the derivations that lead to it. Why is striking water or earth a display of ingratitude? Was it not the will of Hashem to have the dust and waters converted? Would it not be a great elevation to those waters or the dust to be transformed to higher components of G-d's glory? That being the case, wouldn't it be most fitting that Moshe be chosen to elevate simple waters or lowly dirt into objects that declare the open presence of an Almighty Creator who shouts together with his humble servant, "Let My people serve Me"?<br><br>Rabbi Nosson Schapira of Krakow (1585-1633) once told of his most difficult case.<br><br>A wealthy businessman from Warsaw would do business each month in the Krakow market. On each visit he noticed an extremely pious widow huddled near her basket of bagels reciting Psalms. She only lifted her eyes from her worn prayer book to sell a bagel or roll. After the sale she'd shower her customer with a myriad of blessings and immediately she'd return to the frayed pages of her prayer book that were varnished with teardrops and devotion.<br><br>Upon observing her each month, the Krakow businessman came to a conclusion. "This pious woman should not have to struggle to earn a living. She should be able to pursue her prayers and piety with no worries."<br><br>He offered to double her monthly earnings on one condition: she would leave the bagel business and spend her time in the service of the L-rd. The woman, tears of joy streaming down her face, accepted the generous offer and thanked the kind man with praise, gratitude and blessing.<br><br>A month later, when the man returned to Krakow, he was shocked to find the woman at her usual place, mixing the sweet smell of bagels with the sweet words of Tehillim. As soon as he approached, the woman handed him an envelope. "Here is your money. I thought it over I can't accept your offer."<br><br>"A deal is a deal," he exclaimed. "We must see Rabbi Schapira!"<br><br>After the businessman presented his case, the woman spoke. "The reason this generous man offered to support me was to help me grow in my spirituality and devotion. From the day I left my bagel business I've only fallen. Let me explain.<br><br>"Every day that it would rain, I would think of the farmers who planted the wheat for my bagels. I would sing praises for the glory of rain as I felt the personal guidance of Hashem with each raindrop. When the sun would shine I would once again thank Hashem from letting the farmers harvest in good weather. When I would grind the flour and then sift it again I'd find countless reasons to thank the Almighty. When the bread would bake golden brown I'd thank Hashem for the beauty of the product and its sweet sell. And when a customer would come I'd thank both Hashem for sending him and then bless my patron, too! Now this is all gone, I want no part of a simple, all-expense-paid life."<br><br>Moshe had a very personal relationship with the water and the dust. Each time he saw the Nile or tread upon the ground, he remembered the vehicles of his good fortune and used them to praise Hashem. Blood, frogs, and lice are surely miraculous, but they were not Moshe's personal salvation. Striking the water or earth may have produced great national miracles, but Moshe would be left without the simple dirt that yielded piles of personal praise. When one forgoes marveling at a lowly speck of dust and chooses to focus instead upon huge mountains, he may never hit pay dirt. He may only bite the dust.<br><br></div>
