            <div class='col-md body'>The Key to the Wind<br><br>"The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all" (Ps. 103:19).<br><br>Some time since, in the early spring, I was going out at my door when round the corner came a blast of east wind--defiant and  pitiless, fierce and withering--sending a cloud of dust before it.<br><br>I was just taking the latchkey from the door as I said, half impatiently, "I wish the wind would"--I was going to say change;  but the word was checked, and the sentence was never finished.<br><br>As I went on my way, the incident became a parable to me. There came an angel holding out a key; and he said:<br><br>"My Master sends thee His love, and bids me give you this."<br><br>"What is it?" I asked, wondering. "The key of the winds," said the angel, and disappeared.<br><br>Now indeed should I be happy. I hurried away up into the heights whence the winds came, and stood amongst the caves. "I will have done with the east wind at any rate--and that shall plague us no more," I cried; and calling in that friendless wind, I closed the door, and heard the echoes ringing in the hollow places. I turned the key triumphantly. "There," I said, now we have done with that."<br><br>"What shall I choose in its place?" I asked myself, looking about me. "The south wind is pleasant"; and I thought of the lambs, and the young life on every hand, and the flowers that had begun to deck the hedgerows. But as I set the key within the door, it began to burn my hand.<br><br>"What am I doing?" I cried; "who knows what mischief I may bring about? How do I know what the fields want! Ten thousand things of ill may come of this foolish wish of mine."<br><br>Bewildered and ashamed, I looked up and prayed that the Lord would send His angel yet again to take the key; and for my part I promised that I would never want to have it any more.<br><br>But lo, the Lord Himself stood by me. He reached His hand to take the key; and as I laid it down, I saw that it rested  against the sacred wound-print.<br><br>It hurt me indeed that I could ever have murmured against anything wrought by Him who bare such sacred tokens of His love. Then He took the key and hung it on His girdle.<br><br>"Dost THOU keep the key of the winds?" I asked.<br><br>"I do, my child," He answered graciously.<br><br>And lo, I looked again and there hung all the keys of all my life. He saw my look of amazement, and asked, "Didst thou not know, my child, that my kingdom ruleth over all?"<br><br>"Over all, my Lord!" I answered; "then it is not safe for me to murmur at anything?" Then did He lay His hand upon me tenderly. "My child," He said, "thy only safety is, in everything, to love and trust and praise." --Mark Guy Pearse<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How to Pray for the Soul<br>John Piper<br><br>For thoughtful people, how they pray for the soul is governed by how they believe God acts. So, for example, if they believe God changes people's souls so that they make new and right choices, then they will ask God to make those soul-changes through evangelism and nurture. But not everybody is thoughtful about the way they pray. They don't think about what view of God is behind their praying.<br><br>So what I suggest is that we learn first to pray for the soul from the way the Bible prays for the soul. If we do that, then our prayers will probably be good prayers, and in the process we will also learn about how God acts. Here is the way I pray for my soul. I use these prayers over and over again-for myself and my children and wife and for the staff and the elders and for all the church. This is the meat and potatoes of my prayer life.<br><br>The first thing my soul needs is an inclination to God and his word. Without that, nothing else will happen of any value in my life. I must want to know God and read his word and draw near to him. Where does that "want to" come from? It comes from God. So Psalm 119:36 teaches us to pray, "Incline my heart to Your testimonies and not to gain."<br><br>Next I need to have the eyes of my heart opened, so that when my inclination leads me to the word I see what is really there and not just my own ideas Who opens the eyes of the heart? God does. So Psalm 119:18 teaches us to pray, "Open my eyes, that I may behold wonderful things from Your law."<br><br>Then I need for my heart to be enlightened with these "wonders." I need to perceive glory in them and not just interesting facts. Who enlightens the heart? God does. So Ephesians 1:18 teaches us to pray "That the eyes of your heart may be enlightened."<br><br>Then I am concerned that my heart is fragmented and that parts of it might remain in the dark while other parts are enlightened. So I long for my heart to be united for God. Where does that wholeness and unity come from? From God. So Psalm 86:11 teaches us to pray, "O Lord, I will walk in Your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name."<br><br>What I really want from all this engagement with the Word of God and the work of his Spirit in answer to my prayers is that my heart will be satisfied with God and not with the world. Where does that satisfaction come from? It comes from God. So Psalm 90:14 teaches us to pray, "O satisfy us in the morning with Your lovingkindness, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days."<br><br>But I don't just want to be happy in my own little private world with God. I want my happiness to be as full as possible for spreading and expanding for others. I want to be strong in joy. This will make me durable in the face of threats or adversity. Where does that strength and durability come from? It comes from God. So Ephesians 3:16 teaches us to pray, "That God would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man."<br><br>Finally, I want my strength in Christ to produce good deeds for others so that the glory of God will be seen in my life. Who produces these good deeds? God does. So Colossians 1:10 teaches us to pray, "That [we] will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord . . . bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God."<br><br>All this I pray "in Jesus' name," because God gives these things to my soul only because Jesus died for me and removed the wrath of God so that the Father might "freely give me all things" (Romans 8:32).<br><br>To remember some of these prayers, I use an acronym-IOUS-almost every day in praying for those I love, asking God to give us an inclination to his Word and not to money or fame or power (Psalm 119:36), and to open our eyes to see wonderful things when we read his Word (Psalm 119:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, and to have hearts united in the fear of God rather than fragmented over a dozen concerns (Psalm 86:11), and to be satisfied in his steadfast love (Psalm 90:14).<br><br>Learning to pray and learning how God acts,<br><br>Pastor John<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Where Was He?<br><br>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. So, when He heard that he was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was.<br><br>Â—John 11:5Â–6<br><br>Jesus spent a lot of time in the town of Bethany with Lazarus and his two sisters, Mary and Martha. They shared many meals and many good times together. Mary, Martha, and Lazarus could rightfully refer to Jesus as their personal friend.<br><br>Thus, when Lazarus became sick, they dispatched a message to the Lord. They knew that Jesus would know what to do. They thought that perhaps He would speak a word, and Lazarus would get better immediately. Or maybe He would stop what He was doing, rush home to Bethany, lay His hands on Lazarus, and take this sickness away.<br><br>But the Bible tells us that upon hearing Lazarus was sick, Jesus stayed where He was for two more days (see John 11:6). The question is, if Jesus loved Lazarus, why did He not rush to His aid? Immediately, we think this is a contradiction. If Jesus really loved this man, then why did He not go and heal Him?<br><br>When tragedy, hardship, or even death strikes our lives, we too might ask the same question: If Jesus really loves me, why did He let this happen? But the point is that although we cannot see how the situation will end or why it has come upon us, we can know that it flows from the love of God and is controlled by Him.<br><br>But let me qualify that statement. This is true only for the Christian. If you are a believer, you can know that everything must first come through GodÂ’s protective screen that He has placed around His children.<br><br>His delays are to be interpreted in the light of His love and not the other way around.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cast Your Cares on Him<br><br>Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.<br><br>Â—1 Peter 5:6Â–7<br><br>God is not only interested in the big things that concern you; He is interested in the little things too.  Sometimes we may think, This problem is too small to bother God with.  God is only interested in big things.  But God really is interested in the little things that trouble us.  The Bible says that He knows about the little sparrow that falls to the ground (see Matthew 10:29).  He knows how many hairs we have on our heads.<br><br>A verse I love from the Book of Psalms is: Â“You number my wanderings; put my tears into Your bottle; are they not in Your book?Â” (Psalm 56:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.  This verse is saying that God knows every tear you shed.  God knows what is troubling you right now.  He cares about the prayers of the smallest children as much as He cares about the prayers of their parents or their grandparents.  That is why the Bible says, Â“Casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for youÂ” (1 Peter 5:7).<br><br>Many times when we are going through times of trial or times of hardship, we canÂ’t see God.  Nor can we feel God.  But God sees us.  And as Proverbs 15:3 reminds us, Â“The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good.Â”  The Bible also tells us that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, lives to make intercession for us (see Hebrews 7:25).  The Scripture is essentially saying that Jesus Christ is pulling for you right now.  He is interceding for you.  You might even say that He is praying for you.  He is paying attention.  He cares for you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Francis Frangipane: "FIRE WALK"</strong><br><br><strong>The Walk of Suffering</strong><br>Jesus' walk was neither painless nor effortless, and yours will not be either. Perhaps our minds cannot envision the Son of God facing any "real problems," such as we face. We know He calmed the sea, but we are also told He "...learned obedience through the things which He suffered" (Hebrews 5:8 ).<br><br>Yes, power surged from Him causing those who came to arrest Him to fall back (John 18:6), but He also had times He was wearied (John 4:6). He indeed promised us peace, but He, too, had times when He was distressed (Luke 12:49-50), angered (Mark 3:5), and troubled (John 12:27). The same beautiful feet that proclaimed the glad tidings, that walked on water, walked the Via Dolorosa--the way of suffering.<br><br>When we consider the Son of God, we should not isolate Him from the extreme spiritual warfare He faced on many occasions, even to the point of sweating blood. We are assured that Christ never failed, but neither was He aloof from temptations. Rather, the Bible tells us that Jesus was "...tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). Remember also, Jesus faced and conquered His battles as a man; He had to pray for strength, and trust His Father for justice on the cross, even when He felt forsaken by all.<br><br><strong>Conforming to the Image of Christ</strong><br>I am utterly positive, the highest percentage of Jesus' life was filled with joy and peace; why else would multitudes be drawn to Him? But it is interesting that some of these very people, when questioned, thought He might be a return of "Elijah or Jeremiah," both of whom were more known as intensely passionate than compassionate (Matthew 16:13-14). And don't forget, the same hands that touched and healed the untouchables, twice fashioned a scourge, and drove money changers out of the temple.<br><br>I am trying to balance our image of Christ. For if we imagine that Jesus was without temptation, or that He never had inner conflicts, such thinking blinds us from seeing the reality of what we all must go through at times. We think God is failing us when, in fact, He is actually conforming us to the real Jesus. Yes, in the crucible of conflict, Jesus chose to do God's will. "...deeply grieved, to the point of death..." (Matthew 26:38 ), He prayed the prayer of surrender, "...not My will, but Thine be done" (Luke 22:42).<br><br>There will be times when, to obey God's will, we must fight our very instincts for survival. Plan on it. There will be seasons when you will hurt terribly or be deeply troubled inside. Perhaps even facing severe depression, yet to fulfill God's will, you cannot excuse yourself because of heart sickness. In utter defiance of your own feelings, you will have to say, "Yes" to God. It is at this juncture, beloved, that true spiritual progress is being made.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fire Walk part2</strong><br><br><strong>Through Fire and Water</strong><br><br>"But now, thus says the LORD, your Creator, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel, do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine! When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, not will the flame burn you" (Isaiah 43:1-2).<br><br>Fire? Rivers? What about Heaven? Yes, you are going to Heaven. In fact, if you are a true Christian, you are in Heaven right now, only you don't know it. But, there are times when life, like a river, is over your head, and you feel like you are drowning. Yet, the water from these very rivers wash away your filth. What the water does not remove, the fire purifies.<br><br>It is one thing to repent of sin; another, to be placed in life's furnace and be forced beyond yourself to trust God. In the first case, God works through our willingness to engage and submit; He deals with what we have done. In the second situation, He goes much deeper and deals with what we actually are. When He deals only with our sin, He requires we humble ourselves; when we are in the fire, He kills what we were, and then humbles our enemies.<br><br>Yes, you will pass through rivers, but the Lord promises that the waters will not overflow us! He leads us into fire, but then appears in the blaze with us, as He did with the three Hebrews (Daniel 3). When our ordeal is over, only the bonds that once enslaved us are consumed; we are unscathed.<br><br><strong>The Holy Spirit and Fire</strong><br><br>As Christians, we are fascinated by the Holy Spirit. He teaches, guides, gives gifts, brings forth fruit, and comforts us on our journey. However, one aspect that is rarely discussed is the baptism of fire. John said that Christ would "baptize...with the Holy Spirit and fire," (Matthew 3:11).<br><br>Peter tells us we should not be "...surprised at the fiery ordeal...which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you" (1 Peter 4:12). Jesus said, "Everyone will be salted with fire" (Mark 9:49).<br><br>The church in America, for too long, has followed Casper the friendly ghost, instead of seeking the fire of the Holy Ghost. We have turned limp at the thought of our own cross; we faint when we think of suffering or sacrifice.<br>Beloved, it is time to embrace the fire of God's presence. It is the fire that purifies our sacrifice.<br><br>Ahead of us are days both great and terrible. Understandably, many Christians are looking to the rapture of the church. Yet, to escape God's judgment is not to escape His fire. Consider Paul who wrote that the "day" of the Lord "is to be revealed with fire." He said that "...the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work" (1 Corinthians 3:13).<br><br>Yet, let us stay encouraged, for our God is a consuming fire. He is coming to baptize His church again in fire, but in the fire is the place of intimacy, of power, and of deliverance.<br><br>Even as the prophet Isaiah wrote, "When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and purged the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning, then the Lord will create over the whole area of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, even smoke, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory will be a canopy. And there will be a shelter to give shade from the heat by day, and refuge and protection from the storm and the rain" (Isaiah 4:4-6).<br><br>Yes, our God is a consuming fire and our walk with Him is a Fire Walk.<br><br>Lord, I repent for wanting Your blessings without desiring Your fire. I ask for the fire that purifies, that burns away my old nature. I ask You to fill me with the fire of Your holiness. Make me one with You in the fire of Your passions.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Victoria Boyson: "THE POWER OF BLESSING--WILL PUT OUT THE FIRES OF HELL"</strong><br>"A part of giving birth to your destiny is bringing life to the destiny of others."<br><br>"A word aptly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver" (Proverbs 25:11).<br><br><strong>A Story of the Power of Our Tongues</strong><br>I once knew a young girl who seemed to have much going for her, but consistently failed in many areas of her life. I could not understand why--she seemed to choose failure over a successful, happy life. She was beautiful, talented, and intelligent, but it was obvious that she did not esteem herself. And she continually made bad choices.<br><br>For years, I could not understand why she did not see her true value as a person--until I met her mother. Her mother saw her as the biggest failure ever born and told her so. She would vomit out her many objections about her daughter to anyone who would listen to her. With her daughter present, she would declare to a roomful of people what a failure she was. It did not take great discernment to see why the girl struggled so. Why should she like herself when the woman who gave birth to her did not see any good in her?<br><br>As soon as she was old enough, this young girl ran away from her mother and began living with an older man. Unfortunately, her life was poisoned by the many seeds of destruction and self-hatred her mother had been planting in her since birth.<br><br>I believe this is what Proverbs 14:1 is talking about when it says, "The wise woman builds her house, but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers down." The physical house of the girl's mother was in excellent condition, but the heritage she passed down to her child was devastating and led to her daughter living a very destructive lifestyle.<br><br>I have counseled with many people over the years who have struggled with terrible feelings of self-hatred. Usually, in the course of speaking with them, I discover that these feelings began when they were a child, and many times originated with words spoken over them by a parent or other people in authority in their life.<br><br><strong>The Tongue of the Wise</strong><br>Years ago, my husband and I attended a church where the pastor thought he could help his people by continually telling them what was wrong with them. He found fault with us, and of course, found fault with his entire congregation. It was no surprise to anyone that membership dwindled down to just a few people, and eventually he had to close the doors of his church entirely.<br><br>When we left that church, we were left with an ominous, oppressive sense of failure. It felt like a dagger had pierced our hearts. We struggled through life for a few years afterward, enduring one failure after another. We felt as if we were living under a curse--and, indeed, we were. The words of that pastor sowed seeds of destruction that acted as a curse over our lives.<br><br>Words are very powerful, especially when they are spoken by someone in authority over you. They can either be words of praise that breathe life into your life, or words of criticism and judgment that erode away your sense of well being. "The tongue has the power of life and death...." (Proverbs 18:21).<br><br>Once we realized that the effect of this pastor's words over our lives was acting as a curse against us, we sought out ways to release ourselves from its grip. We prayed many prayers, but still this feeling of failure hung on.<br><br>It was only when we were led to another man of God who was a true shepherd that the curse was at last broken. Without knowing any of the words that had been spoken over us, he spoke the exact opposite of what had been said. He made us believe in our destiny again. He spoke life into our spirits. And through the anointing that he carried, he broke off the words of failure and planted seeds of life and destiny in their place.<br>The power of blessing brought life to our dreams, setting us free from the power of death and destruction. Satan could no longer keep us from our destiny in God. The power of blessing blasted the power of cursing.<br><br>"Reckless words pierce like a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing" (Proverbs 12:18 ).<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Power of Blessing part2</strong><br><br><strong>When We Choose to Curse</strong><br><br>God has a strange way of working the curses of others to our advantage. He uses them to refine us and shape us, and then He heals us through the power of His blessing.<br><br>Many people in the Bible lived what some would consider cursed lives for a period of time. David, for instance, was chased by King Saul, Joseph lived for fifteen years in prison for something he did not do, and Moses was chased into the desert by Pharaoh after living a life of luxury and ease. These are only a few examples.<br><br>Actually, God used this destructive period in their lives to shape and refine them. He promised them great blessings, but allowed them to go through the process of refining to prepare them for their destiny.<br><br>In order for Christ to fulfill His destiny, He had to suffer betrayal and be given over into the hands of His enemies. But He said in Luke 22:22, "The Son of man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays Him." We may have to endure a period of cursing for a time, but woe to the people who curse us.<br><br>In Psalm 109, David speaks about the man who cursed his life. "He loved to pronounce a curse--may it come on him; he found no pleasure in blessing--may it be far from him. He wore cursing as his garment; it entered into his body like water, into his bones like oil" (verses 17-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>When we choose to curse others and speak negatively of them, we are really only hurting ourselves. A part of birthing our own destiny is bringing life to the destiny of others. God wants to use us, but He wants to use us to bless others. Any jealousy we harbor towards the destiny of others will actually sabotage our own destiny in God.<br><br><strong>Speaking Life</strong><br><br>Our mouth is a very powerful weapon, and we can either use it to bring a blessing or a curse onto others. When we speak negative words about people, those words act as a curse over them. Even if people never actually hear the words we speak about them, our words still have power and can cause them to experience oppressive heaviness. However, words of blessing can lift them up spiritually.<br><br>One day I was feeling exceptionally low. All of a sudden I had this wonderful feeling shoot through me. I felt a tremendous surge of pleasure, and I knew everything would be all right. Later that day, a friend of mine called and said that she and her husband were talking about our family. She went on to tell me all the wonderful things they said about us. I asked her what time it was when they had this conversation and it coincided perfectly with the time I had experienced the surge of pleasure. That, my friends, is the power of blessing!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Power of Blessing Part3</strong><br><br><strong>The Blessings of Heaven</strong><br>One of our greatest weapons against the enemy is the words we speak. There is no question, then, as to why the enemy seeks to gain access to our words. He wants to use our mouths to destroy our own lives and the lives of others.<br><br>"The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell" (James 3:6). We can either use our mouths as a passageway for the fires of hell to gain access to earth, or use them to put out the fires of hell the enemy has lit in the hearts and minds of others.<br><br>You can be God's fire extinguisher. You can put out the flames of hell with the blessings of Heaven. And wherever you go, you will be like a fountain of blessing that brings healing and life to the nations.<br><br>Instead of giving hell's fires access to the earth, you will bring to earth the very river of life that flows from the throne of God. People will be drawn to you like magnets because of the great power of grace and mercy that radiates from your spirit. And with only a few words, you will destroy the curses of generations.<br><br>This is the power of blessing. This is your destiny in God.<br><br>Please pray this with me:<br><br>Dear Father,<br>"I repent of speaking negative words against others, and I ask You to stamp out those words and cause them to be ineffective. I receive Your forgiveness and mercy for my sin. Make me a fire extinguisher with power from Heaven to destroy the seeds of destruction in the lives of those You love. Help me to walk in my own destiny...by blessing the destiny of others."<br>Victoria Boyson<br>Speaking Life Ministries</div>

We begin to pray for a certain thing; we put up our petitions for a day, a week, a month; and then, receiving as yet no definite answer, straightway we faint, and cease altogether from prayer concerning it.<br><br>This is a deadly fault. It is simply the snare of many beginnings with no completions. It is ruinous in all spheres of life.<br><br>The man who forms the habit of beginning without finishing has simply formed the habit of failure. The man who begins to pray about a thing and does not pray it through to a successful issue of answer has formed the same habit in prayer.<br><br>To faint is to fail; then defeat begets disheartenment, and unfaith in the reality of prayer, which is fatal to all success.<br><br>But someone says, "How long shall we pray? Do we not come to a place where we may cease from our petitions and rest the matter in God's hands?"<br><br>There is but one answer. Pray until the thing you pray for has actually been granted, or until you have the assurance in your heart that it will be.<br><br>Only at one of these two places dare we stay our importunity, for prayer is not only a calling upon God, but also a conflict with Satan. And inasmuch as God is using our intercession as a mighty factor of victory in that conflict, He alone, and not we, must decide when we dare cease from our petitioning. So we dare not stay our prayer until the answer itself has come, or until we receive the assurance that it will come.<br><br>In the first case we stop because we see. In the other, we stop because we believe, and the faith of our heart is just as sure as the sight of our eyes; for it is faith from, yes, the faith of God, within us.<br><br>More and more, as we live the prayer life, shall we come to experience and recognize this God-given assurance, and know when to rest quietly in it, or when to continue our petitioning until we receive it.  --The Practice of Prayer<br><br>Tarry at the promise till God meets you there.

            <div class='col-md body'>Time to Hear<br>John 14:21<br>He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I too will love him and show Myself to him.<br><br>We live in a day of 12-step programs for this, four points to success for that, and all forms of programmed means of becoming successful. Have you ever wondered how you can guarantee a greater revelation of Jesus in your life? Jesus tells us how this can be done. It is all tied to obedience. In John, He tells us the following: "Whoever has My commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves Me. He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I too will love him and show Myself to him" (Jn. 14:21). The key here is in the last three words. He will show Himself to us because of our loving Him through our obedience. The more obedient we become, the more revelation of His presence we will feel in our life. Jeremiah tells us, "Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know" (Jer. 33:3).<br><br>Many Christians wonder why they cannot hear or sense God's presence in their life. It is because they do not seek Him with a whole heart, and they are not obedient to the things He has asked. God does not show us the next move until we are obedient to the first thing He has spoken to us. It is a progressive process. He entrusts the small things to us first, then moves us to the larger. I was like many today who are so focused on seeking the activity of God rather than seeking God Himself. Hebrews tells us that God rewards those who diligently seek Him. In the Old Testament we are told, "But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find Him if you look for Him with all your heart and with all your soul" (Deut. 4:29).<br><br>I realized if I was going to hear God's voice, I had to make time to seek Him and hear Him. I had to spend focused time alone reading, studying, and seeking His face only. Jesus set the model for this when He often left the crowds to be alone and seek His heavenly Father. I also had to tune my "radio" to His frequency. Static comes into that frequency when I am disobedient. My level of seeking determines the power of my "radio" to reach Him. The more I seek Him, the more I hear Him. Seek the Lord today so that you may be empowered by His presence.<br><br></div>

In fact, we see the extent of Jonah's willfulness by the amount of time he was willing to hang out in the belly of that fish-three full days. Then, Jonah decides enough is enough! Obedience is better than this fish belly and seaweed.<br><br>From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the Lord his God.<br><br>He said: "In my distress I called to the Lord, and He answered me. From the depths of the grave I called for help, and You listened to my cry. You hurled me into the deep, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all Your waves and breakers swept over me. I said, 'I have been banished from Your sight; yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.' The engulfing waters threatened me, the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But You brought my life up from the pit, O Lord my God. When my life was ebbing away, I remembered You, Lord, and my prayer rose to You, to Your holy temple. Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs. But I, with a song of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You. What I have vowed I will make good. Salvation comes from the Lord." And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land. Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time: "Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you." Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and went to Nineveh (Jonah 2:2-3:3a).<br><br>In the midst of realizing his own calamity, Jonah made a seemingly out-of-context statement: "Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs." Jonah was thinking of the sailors who threw him overboard and how they prayed to worthless idols. In the business world, we rub shoulders with those who cling to worthless idols every day. How tragic.<br><br>But this story's primary message is for every believer. And I can identify with Jonah. There's been many a man placed in the "belly of the fish" to encourage him to fulfill the purposes of God for which He called him. Jonah's situation changed immediately upon his obedience. Obedience is a mysterious thing. Jesus had to learn it through the things He suffered (see Heb. 5:8 ). If Jesus had to learn obedience through suffering, what does that mean for you and me? Sometimes willing obedience requires encouragement.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Becoming a Fool<br>Proverbs 1:7<br>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.<br><br>Marvin Wilson, author of Our Father Abraham, has written incisively about the various meanings for our word fool:<br><br>In Biblical wisdom literature, the pupils of the sages and mentors are the unwise, often termed "fools" (Prov. 1:7) or "simple one" (1:22). In wisdom literature, the different levels of fools-both young and old-are the raw material on which the sages had to work, and they represent the varying degrees of rawness. Perhaps as much as anything else, the term fool is descriptive of an attitude, bent of mind, or direction in life, which needs correcting. The various Hebrew words for fool occur more than a hundred times in the book of Proverbs. [Marvin Wilson, Our Father Abraham (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1989), 284-286.]<br><br>The reference to someone being a fool was not necessarily a negative term. A simple fool, or peti, was a person who made mistakes but quickly righted them and was restored to fellowship with God and with others. King David was a simple fool, one who made mistakes, but kept a repentant heart toward God. This is why God did not turn away from him for his many sins.<br><br>The hardened fool, kesil and ewil, makes mistakes, but never learns from them and will not listen to others. Such people can expect God's reproof to continue and will eat the fruit of their own way (see Prov. 1:31-32). The hardened fool "returns to his own vomit." King Saul was a hardened fool, one who made mistakes and continued in them even after realizing he was wrong. We're going to err in our ways. The question is, once we know we have made a mistake before God, do we make the necessary adjustments that will allow Him to intervene on our behalf? And will we avoid the same course of action in the future? God says that if we do, He will pour out His Spirit on us (see Prov. 1:23). He will make known His words to us.<br><br>The third level of fool mentioned in Proverbs is the mocking fool or letz. The mocking fool mocks the things of God. This word means "scoffer" or "scorner." When you encounter cynical people who disregard the things of God, you know these people are "mocking fools."<br><br>The fourth level of fool is the God-denying fool or nabal. This term relates to the morally wicked person who ignores the disgrace he brings on his family and who despises holiness (see Prov. 17:21). This person says, "There is no God." By failing to acknowledge God for who He is, the nabal declares himself to be a "God-denying" fool.<br><br>I have found that it is helpful to try to understand if people are teachable. Are they simple fools, those who make mistakes but seek to learn from them? I can work with those people. But if I sense I am working with a hardened fool, I know I should not spend much time on that person. Jesus did not spend much time trying to convince the rich young ruler. He presented truth, and let him make his decision. Some people must get broken before they can become simple fools. Sometimes it is simply better to let satan chew on people until the ground is fertile enough to present truth to them.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Precious Deaths<br>Psalms 116:15<br>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.<br><br>The Bible often speaks of death as a requirement of living a life in Christ. This death is not a physical death, but a spiritual death. It is a death of the old so the new can be raised. It is the life of Christ that is raised in us. However, this death can be painful if we do not choose to willingly allow this "circumcision of heart" to have its way. If we are not circumcised of heart, we do not enter into God's promises. Moses was called to deliver a people from slavery. But when he was about to return to Egypt to begin what God called Him to do, God almost killed him. He had failed to take care of the details of obedience. In this case, it was that all the males in his family were to be circumcised. This oversight on Moses' part almost cost him his life. Imagine that-God prepared a man 40 years, and yet, he was almost disqualified because of an oversight. "At a lodging place on the way, the Lord met Moses and was about to kill him. But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses' feet with it..." (Ex. 4:24).<br><br>None of us will ever enter the Promised Land of full blessing with God unless we have this same circumcision of heart. The psalmist above accurately describes the process of circumcising the heart.<br><br>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints. O Lord, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have freed me from my chains (Psalm 116:15-16).<br><br>We cannot be free to be God's servant until this death takes place in each of us. When this death takes place, we become free-free from the chains of sin that held us back from becoming completely His. Oh, what freedom there is when this death takes place. No longer are we held to the sin of materialism, fear, self-effort, or anxiety; for we are dead to these things.<br><br>The Bible speaks of the seed that must die in order for it to spring up and give new life.<br><br>I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life (John 12:24-25).<br><br>Each of us must ask the Lord if our seed has died. Is it in the ground now, yielding the fruit of brokenness before Him? This is the great paradox of a life in Christ-the circumcision of heart and the death process. Ask God to free you to become all that He wants you to be today.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"V'Hoyoh im shamoa tismeu ell mitzvosai "<br><br>"And it will be if listen(ing) you shall listen to my commandments"<br><br>This verse marks the beginning of the Torah's discussion of the concept of accepting upon oneself to fulfill all of HaShem's mitzvos (commandments). In the preceding weekly portion, the concept of accepting the Yoke of the Heavenly Kingship is discussed. It would seem at first that a commitment to fulfill all of the mitzvos is included in the acceptance of HaShem's rulership. After all, if one accepts HaShem's dominion over oneself, it automatically follows that one is obligated to fulfill HaShem's laws - the mitzvos. Why, then, is the idea of accepting the mitzvos discussed as a separate concept?<br><br>There is an important aspect to the concept of accepting the mitzvos that is not included in the idea of accepting HaShem's dominion. This aspect is the importance of fulfilling the mitzvos out of love for HaShem, and not only because HaShem is the Ruler of the Universe. This significant aspect of fulfilling the mitzvos out of love for Hashem is not necessarily included in an acceptance of HaShem's dominion. Consequently, it is appropriate to accept upon oneself the yoke of miktzvos out of love for HaShem, independently of one's acceptance of the dominion of HaShem.<br><br>Darash Moshe<br></div>
