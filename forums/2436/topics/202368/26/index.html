            <div class='col-md body'>I SHALL NOT WANT<br><br>Â“Yahveh is my shepherd I shall not wantÂ”<br><br>In Hebrew it says: Â“I shall not lackÂ”, and that word Â“lackÂ”, (or CHESER) is used to describe any kind of lack- Financial, physical, emotional, relational or spiritual. This portion of this verse is actually the fruit of TRUSTING Yahveh as My Shepherd. It is only TRUE TRUST that will lead me to the place of Â“NO LACKÂ”. Another word that could be used for no lack in any area of our lives is the word- SHALOM. Shalom means to be complete, with nothing lacking, broken or missing. In order to enjoy SHALOM all of our lives, TRUST in YAHVEH as OUR SHEPHERD is mandatory! When we trust Him, we also do what He says. When we trust Him, we do not get bitter when circumstances are hard. When we trust Him, we know that He knows better. When we trust Him, we can also REST. It is in our rest and trust that we can be directed and hear the still small voice and the nudges of His Ruach (Spirit). It is in that rest and trust that we can be confronted with all the ugly attitudes of our hearts and Â“kiss them goodbyeÂ”. We can only be transformed into His image in that rest and trust. No potter can truly give the right shape to Â“restless clayÂ”. We must rest assured that He is a PERFECT POTTER and a PERFECT SHEPHERD. He knows how to lead you and me to the place of SHALOM to the place of NO LACK. If we just rest, trust, listen and do what He says, we will find out that we HAVE NO LACK. That is the end result of the walk of trust with the Shepherd<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WOOL OR NO WOOL THAT IS THE QUESTION<br><br>Sheep some times need to be sheered of their wool.   They walk Â“nakedÂ” for a while, but then new wool grows, which needs to be sheered again. The WOOL is the reward of the Shepherd. In Mexican slang, Wool is LANA and is a way of saying MONEY. We need to understand that all the life of the sheep, all their wool and EARTHLY POSSESSIONS belong to the Shepherd. He can do what He wants with it. We should be willing to give of ourselves to Him knowing that we are born for His Glory and His Glory alone! When we periodically give of ourselves and our Â“woolÂ”, He gives us Â“more woolÂ” for the next season, more provision for the next season! Though the wool will dress us and warm us up for a while, there will be a time when the Shepherd will sheer it and prepare us for another season of fruitfulness, provision and plenty. When sheep resist the sheering they get cuts and bruises as the Shepherd HAS to sheer them, even in spite of themselves. It is only trusting sheep that can be sheered Â“sweetlyÂ” without being hurt. Wise sheep give themselves willingly to the Shepherd to be sheered. If the wool is not taken periodically it becomes matted and attracts maggots and other unfriendly Â“bugsÂ”. Whether with plenty of WOOL or without any WOOL, He knows best and I trust Him. It is in that absolute TRUST that we come to the place of absolutely NO LACK. We are made WHOLE inside.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Coming Out of the Stronghold<br>Os Hillman<br><br>..."Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah"... - 1 Samuel 22:5<br><br>David and his fighting men had been hiding in the cave of Adullam. He was fleeing Saul. Many of life's down-and-out had come and joined David's army. David was content to stay in the stronghold of safety. Then, God's prophet came to David and told him that he must leave the stronghold and go into the land of Judah.<br><br>When life beats down on us and we get to the place where we want to hide in a cave, God often places people around us who prod us into moving in the right direction. He does not want us to remain in the place of discouragement. He wants us to move into the land of "praise." Judah means "praise."<br><br>I recall when I went through a very difficult time. It seemed to drag on and on with no change until finally I wanted to retreat to a cave and forget pressing on. It was a great time of discouragement. A godly man came to me and said, "You must keep moving! There are too many who are depending on you in the Kingdom." I didn't totally understand what he meant at the time. Now I know he was saying that God is preparing each of us to be the vessel He wants to use in the life of another person, but we will never be that vessel if we give up and hide in our cave of discouragement. Not only must we keep moving, we must move into a new realm. Our attitude must move from discouragement to praise. It is when we move past discouragement to praise that we begin living above our problems. Make a decision today to go into the land of Judah.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your Positioning<br>Os Hillman<br><br>Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips. - Proverbs 27:2<br><br>Many years of owning and operating an ad agency taught me that positioning was defined as a place or position that a product, service, or person held in the mind of the audience. We knew that often perception was reality for people, regardless of the truth. For years, I spent time and money seeking to position our company in the minds of our prospective clients. Although it would seem that is a natural and logical marketing function, I later discovered there is a dangerous flaw when we attempt to position ourselves by promoting our own attributes. I discovered that positioning is a by-product of who we are and what we do, not an end in itself.<br><br>King David was my first biblical lesson in coming to understand the difference. Here was a man who had committed adultery and murder, and failed many times in his family life. Yet, God describes David as a "man after God's own heart." Isn't that interesting? Why would God describe someone who had obviously failed in many areas as one who was after God's own heart? Throughout David's life, we find frequent descriptions made by God: "So David's fame spread throughout every land..." (1 Chron. 14:17). Although David did make many mistakes, his heart was soft toward God and sought to praise Him. David wrote the majority of the Psalms. God honored what was in David's heart, not his perfection. I believe that God's strategic placement of David was so that we may learn from and be drawn to the attribute of David that God primarily wanted him known forÂ—a heart bent toward Him. His positioning was a by-product of who he was, not an end in itself. In our business and personal life, our positioning among those who will know us should be a by-product of our life and service, not an end itself.<br><br>What is your "position" today among your peers? I once asked my Bible study group to ask others, "What do you think of when someone mentions my name?" This exercise can bring some interesting revelations. It might motivate us to make some changes, or it might confirm that God is doing a great work in you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seeing the Big Picture<br>Os Hillman<br><br>..."Everything is against me!" - Genesis 42:36<br><br>Eventually, Benjamin along with Jacob's other sons learned that their brother Joseph was second in command in Egypt. Joseph revealed his identity, and Jacob was reunited with his son whom he had not seen for more than 13 years. He had thought Joseph to be dead.<br><br>So often we believe our dreams are dead. There seems to be nothing left in our world to live for. Everything appears to be against us. During these times, God is doing His deepest behind-the-scenes work. During these times, God is performing a deeper work in each of usÂ—a work that cannot be seen.<br><br>When clients began leaving my ad agency and it dried up for no apparent reason, it appeared "everything was against me." I could not see that God was orchestrating a whole new calling on my life. At the moment, it seemed like the worst thing in the world. It seemed that I had been a failure. But God said, "No." All the years before had been preparation for what God's ultimate calling would be. One of God's methods for directing His children's steps is through drying up resources: a job loss, a career change, or a disaster. In these times we are willing to listen more intently, and to seek God in ways we would not normally do. C.S. Lewis once wrote, "God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains; it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world." [C.S.Lewis, The Problem of Pain (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1962), 93.]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dissolving Partnerships<br>Os Hillman<br><br>So Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the Lord. - Genesis 13:18<br><br>Abraham took a totally different approach to solving this problem. He told Lot to choose which land he wanted. Imagine, Abraham could have been dooming himself and his family if he was unable to find adequate land and water for them. He gave up his rights in the matter, and Lot took full advantage. "Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar" (Gen. 13:10). So Lot left and took up residence in the valley later to be known as Sodom and Gomorrah. Sometimes what seems good on the front end turns out to be disastrous later. Such would be the case for Lot and his family.<br><br>As for Abraham, he made a choice. He decided to take life's high roadÂ—a choice that didn't necessarily mean his life circumstances would benefit him. He was willing to leave that outcome to God. He made the decision based on an eternal measuring stick. Interestingly, the place where Abraham moved was called Mamre. In Hebrew, the name Mamre means "strength." How can choosing the weakest position become "strength"? Jesus must have asked the same question of His Father when faced with the proposition of going to the cross. How can the cross be a place of strength? The devil thought he had won, but the cross is what freed the captives for eternity. The Bible tells us that when we are weak, then we are really strong. To willingly choose the way of the cross becomes our strength.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Rhema Word<br>Os Hillman<br><br>For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field. - Job 5:23a<br><br>When I first met my wife, I was impressed to do something rather strange. I decided I would send her a rock in a box with a Scripture verse that describes how God used stones in the Bible. I was going to send it anonymously from a company called Significant Moments. I was going to do this for six months. The final month I planned to send the last rock with a note that said, "The most significant moment was the day I met you." I was going to sign my name on the last mailing. However, before this could happen, the plan was spoiled.<br><br>I was helping my wife (just a friend at the time) move her furniture. We were exchanging stories about our lives. She began to tell me the story of how she got her name. Her father was an orphan in England, and in England they give orphans different names from their given names. They named her father "Staines." Staines means "place of stones." Not only that, he discovered later that his real name was Malcolm Stones. I nearly drove off the road when she told me this story. My plan was foiled! But my faith was advanced light years. I told her my plan since it would be too obvious now. We both looked at each other in amazement.<br><br>A month later, I went on a trip. She sent a little gift package along with me with a card that quoted a Scripture from Job. "For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field" (Job 5:23a). It was a rhema word for both of us. God used these times to confirm our relationship.<br><br>The Bible speaks of the Word of God as living. Rhema is a Greek word meaning "living." Sometimes the Holy Spirit speaks through the living Word regarding a specific situation in which we find ourselves. It is one of those mysteries that God does from time to time.<br><br>As you read your Bible, be aware of the rhema Word of God. He may speak to you in specific ways you never thought possible.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Wonderful Guarantee<br>"I will strengthen thee"   (Isaiah 41:10).<br><br>When called to serve or to suffer, we take stock of our strength, and we find it to be less than we thought and less than we need. But let not our heart sink within us while we have such a word as this to fall back upon, for it guarantees us all that we can possibly need. God has strength omnipotent; that strength He can communicate to us; and His promise is that He will do so. He will be the food of our souls and the health of our hearts; and thus He will give us strength. There is no telling how much power God can put into a man. When divine strength comes, human weakness is no more a hindrance.<br><br>Do we not remember seasons of labor and trial in which we received such special strength that we wondered at ourselves? In the midst of danger we were calm, under bereavement we were resigned, in slander we were self-contained, and in sickness we were patient. The fact is that God gives unexpected strength when unusual trials come upon us, We rise out of our feeble selves. Cowards play the man, foolish ones have wisdom given them, and the silent receive in the self-same hour what they shall speak, My own weakness makes me shrink, but God's promise makes me brave. LORD, strengthen me "according to thy word."<br><br>CH Spurgeon<br></div>

The passage from which this gracious word is taken speaks of peace "with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground." This is peace with earthly enemies, with mysterious evils, and with little annoyances! Any of these might keep us from lying down, but none of them shall do so. The LORD will quite destroy those things which threaten His people: "I will break the bow and the sword, and the battle out of the earth." Peace will be profound indeed when all the instruments of disquiet are broken to pieces.<br><br>With this pace will come rest, "So he giveth his beloved sleep." Fully supplied and divinely quieted, believers lie down in calm repose. This rest will be a safe one. It is one thing to lie down but quite another "to lie down safely." We are brought to the land of promise, the house of the Father, the chamber of love, and the bosom of Christ: surely we may now "lie down safely." It is safer for a believer to lie down in peace than to sit up and worry.<br><br>"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures," We never rest till the Comforter makes us lie down.<br><br>CH Spurgeon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rest on a Promise<br>"The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it"   (Genesis 28:13).<br><br>No promise is of private interpretation: it belongs not to one saint but to all believers. If, my brother, thou canst in faith lie down upon a promise and take thy rest thereon, it is thine. Where Jacob "lighted" and tarried and rested, there he took possession. Stretching his weary length upon the ground, with the stones of that place for his pillows, he little fancied that he was thus entering into ownership of the land; yet so it was. He saw in his dream that wondrous ladder which for all true believers unites earth and heaven, and surely where the foot of the ladder stood he must have a right to the soil, for other wise he could not reach the divine stair- way. All the promises of God are "Yea" and "Amen" in Christ Jesus, and as He is ours, every promise is ours if we will but lie down upon it in restful faith.<br><br>Come, weary one, use thy LORD's words as thy pillows, Lie down in peace. Dream only of Him. Jesus is thy ladder of light. See the angels coming and going upon Him between thy soul and thy God, and be sure that the promise is thine own God-given portion and that it will not be robbery for thee to take it to thyself, as spoken specially to thee.<br><br>CH Spurgeon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br>Know and Take Heed<br><br>And Jacob called to his sons and he said, "Assemble yourselves and I will tell you what will happen to you in "the end of days". Gather yourselves and listen, sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father. Reuven you are my first-born..." (Breishis 49:1-3)<br><br>...and I will tell you: Jacob attempted to reveal "the end". The Divine Presence was removed from him and he started to speak about other things. (Rashi)<br><br>I keep reading these verses over again hoping the missing pieces will suddenly appear and a window will open to the final act of the drama of human history. This was no senior moment and neither was it a bait and switch technique to merely pique our interest. We need to know the benefit of introducing the subject of "the end of days" even if the conversation is abbreviated.<br><br>The theatre is filled with the buzz of excitement. The curtain is about to rise on a wonderful night. We are ready to be taken for a long and drama-filled ride to "who knows where?" The play begins. The acting is superb. The characters are rich. The plot is appropriately complex.<br><br>We are far enough along to begin to figure out the shape and the direction of the play when odd things begin to happen. Parts of the curtain and lighting begin to fall. Actors break ranks with their roles and fight as if they were off stage. Scenes lose their symmetry and sense. The audience begins to rumble. It's too hard to figure out what's planned and what's spontaneous, what is intended and what is mishap?<br><br>Meanwhile the plot thickens like a cholent and is ready to boil over. "Could all this ever be strung together cohesively?" is the question pounding in the minds of many. After a while some look at their watches and calculate, "Soon another hour of parking will have to be paid for and the baby sitter too." One after the other begins to file out.<br><br>The play is assumed to be in the genre of "the absurd -theatrical dadaism." Make your own sense from the chaos and be happy that you're still sane enough to still seek some meaning.<br><br>Only a few remain. Why? Why do they remain? They bothered to peak into the Playbill- the program and noticed the name of the author of the play. Though his imagination is wild and deep, he has a habit of cleverly concluding his works in a genius fashion. The end is the part not to be missed. That's when the all the loose ends are reconciled in an amazing and satisfying way.<br><br>Those who remain, observe with a heightened intensity even as events seem to spin faster and more out of control. No matter how long it takes, they understand that this play will not end in a fizzle and a pop.<br><br>In the unfolding of the story of Joseph and his brothers, all crystallized in an instant when Joseph revealed his true identity. "The Author" gained enormous credibility. So too on a bigger stage, the drama of human history can be made to make perfect sense when some hidden quotient is manifested.<br><br>If one assumes that all of what is happening around is no more than sound and fury signifying nothing, then he is more likely to join the millions who have abandoned the theatre in deep despair.<br><br>If, however, Jacob's tease, if you please, is taken to heart, then every moment is pregnant with hope. There is that burgeoning sense that the best is yet to come, which contributes to the resolve to continue to continue.<br><br>The words of Rabbi Israel Friedman of Rizhyn, from 150 years ago echo eerily this very real and personal drama: "At the end of days, before the coming of the Mashiach, G-d shall take a string, a "string of faith", and stretch around the world. Many a man will attempt to grab that string and to hang on to it. However, G-d will appoint two angels to hold the string at both ends, instructing them to shake violently as the days of Mashiach near.<br><br>It will become increasingly difficult to maintain a grasp on the string. As the years go by many, many will slip and fall. I am telling you this, my brothers, so those living in those times will know and take heed."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TRUST IN G_D<br><br>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"Dan will exact judgment for his people, the Tribes of Israel will be like one. Dan will be like a snake on the path, a viper on the way, which bites the heels of a horse causing the rider to tumble off backwards. For your salvation do I long, HaShem!" [49:16-18]<br><br>Dan is described as a protector of his people, and an extremely dangerous foe to his enemies. But immediately after saying so, Yaakov nonetheless declares -- "For _YOUR_ salvation do I long, HaShem!" Despite all of the protection that Dan or any human can offer, Yaakov always depends ultimately upon HaShem.<br><br>The Ba'al Shem Tov, literally "the Master of the Good Name," was the father of the Chassidic movement. Once, he sent two of his students to a distant country in order to procure wine for Passover. His students were anxious to please their teacher, so they made every effort to do the job right, to return with wine in which was unquestionably Kosher for Passover.<br><br>They went out to the vineyards, helping to select the best grapes. They meticulously supervised the pressing of the grapes to ensure that no grain products were anywhere nearby. They ensured that the wine was sealed in the strongest casks, which they then transported back under their constant supervision.<br><br>Immediately after their return, they unsealed the casks and tasted the wine -- and it was perfect. They briefly left the room to tell others that they had come back with wine which met the highest standards both in taste and in Kashrus supervision.<br><br>When they returned, they were greeted by a non-Jewish worker, chewing on a ham sandwich, who exclaimed, "that's delicious wine you have there!"<br><br>Of course, given the possibility that part of the sandwich had fallen into a cask, all was lost. The Ba'al Shem Tov would unquestionably not be able to use this wine.<br><br>With broken spirits they went into their teacher, to explain how the wine was lost in such a bizarre way. With penetrating insight, the Ba'al Shem Tov told them, "you did everything you could, everything possible, to guard the wine. You were so careful, in fact, that you forgot to ask G-d to watch over _you_. You left no place for His protection!"<br><br>There is a tension, as it were, between the concepts of "hishtadlus" and "bitachon," between our obligation to make an effort on the one hand, and our obligation to rely upon Divine Providence on the other. We must make an effort, and cannot stumble forward blindly. But at the same time, we must be careful to recognize that the ultimate success or failure of those efforts does not lie in our hands.<br><br>A perfect example, of course, is "making a living." We have to make an effort. But a leading Rabbi once commented that people come to him with all sorts of questions regarding how much we must do -- in other areas. How much wine must I drink for Kiddush? How much matzah must I eat at the Seder? How much money do I need to give to charity? And no one asks, "how much effort must I make at providing for my family?"<br><br>Even as we make that effort, we must remember that success is ultimately not ours to achieve -- and we must trust in G-d to give us what we truly need.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shema: The Holy One and Only One<br>The Mitzvah:<br><br>There is a Biblical injunction to recite the passages of Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-9, ibid 11:13-21 &amp; Numbers 15:37-41) twice daily, every day (after awakening) and night (before retiring). The opening statement "Hear O Yisrael Hashem is our G-d, Hashem is [the Only] One" is among the first verses an infant recites and typically, it is the Jew's parting words as the soul departs this world.<br><br>Gathering his twelve sons around his deathbed, Yaakov wanted to disclose what would occur at the End of the Days (Genesis 49:1-2). However his efforts were frustrated as the Divine Presence left him, preventing Yaakov from making this revelation. Suspecting that this was because one of his sons was unrighteous, the Tribes pacified him by stating the verse of "Shema Yisrael". They said "Hear our father Yisrael. Just as your heart is one [with G-d], so too, our hearts are one [with G-d]. We are united in the service of G-d". Appeased, Yaakov recited "Blessed in the Name of his glorious kingdom for all eternity" (Pesachim 56a).<br><br>What was the undercurrent to this episode? And what has the End of Days got to do with the Twelve Tribes of Israel and the recitation of Shema?<br><br>Shema is integral to Jewish belief because this is the basis for Kabbalas oyl Malchus Shomayaim, Acceptance of G-d's Absolute Sovereignty that forms the foundation for all divine service by the Children of Israel.<br><br>The universe was fashioned solely for kavod Hashem, the glorification of G-d (Avos 6:11). The regular recitation of the Shema both day and night, explains the Sefer HaChinuch, combats man's susceptibility to sin. It acts as a perpetual reminder for the Jew to constantly signpost G-d in all his endeavors. The Children of Israel is dedicated to spreading the Name of G-d in the world - even at pain of death such as Rabbi Akiva's heroic Shema just before the Romans murdered him (See Talmud, Brochos 61b).<br><br>Belief in G-d means belief is a G-d who is Unique; a G-d Who is Absolutely One. Despite the plurality of our universe, the Shema stresses that all the forces in nature (denoted by the name Eloykim or Eloykeinu) emanate from a single, Source (Hashem) - "Hashem Eloykeinu Hashem echad". He is the Indivisible One. And accordingly, the Jewish people seek to become one with Him.<br><br>Sadly, there are plenty of people that lead lives without any reference to the Creator and Master of the Universe. This world typically masks the omnipresence of G-d. The Jewish nation's efforts at proclaiming G-d and His Glory are stifled as they are dispersed, persecuted and despised. Only at the End of Days, will the former glory of the Jewish people be restored. Only then, will the Glory of G-d finally be revealed to one and all.<br><br>The basic declaration of faith, not surprising, Shema became the Jewish national credo. No wonder this is so central to Judaism - especially on Yaakov's deathbed as he handed the baton of the Jewish national mission over to his children.<br><br>Yaakov who closed the circle on the three Patriarchs internalized within himself the message of G-d's Oneness. His heart and life were one with G-d. Indeed, Yaakov's image was engraved on G-d's Throne of Glory. But when the Divine Presence left him, he thought that not all of his children were up to the task of glorifying the Name of G-d in the universe.<br><br>The Tribes answered that this was not so. Assembled and joined together with their saintly father Yaakov, the twelve sons had a unified commitment to achieve this same state of unity with G-d. Appropriately, they declared Shema Yisrael with the pronouncement "Hashem Echad, G-d is One". Our hearts are also one with G-d.<br><br>Yaakov, by himself, was able to harmonize all of his powers to embrace the yoke of the Heavenly Kingdom. However it would require the synthesis of all twelve sons of Yaakov, with their very different energies, blessings and personalities, to form a cohesive and united whole, together with their father's legacy, to arrive at the same destination. Yaakov together with his twelve sons comprised of thirteen people - the numerical value of the word "echad, one". The Maharal explains that that this division is precisely reflected in the three letters: aleph=1, cheis=8 and dalet=4 corresponding respectively to Yaakov himself, the eight sons of the Mothers (Rachel and Leah) and to the four sons of the Maidservants (Bilhah and Zilpah).<br><br>Hearing their proclamation of the Shema Yisrael and their affirmation of religious commitment, Yaakov recited "Blessed in the Name of his glorious kingdom for all eternity". He was satisfied that his children would indeed live their lives in the acceptance G-d's Sovereignty; that they would promulgate His Holy Name in the World.<br><br>Only at the final End of Days, would the task be complete: "Then Hashem will be King over all the world, on that day Hashem will be One and His Name will be One" (Zechariah 14:9). We await that day with great anticipation.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Treasure The Moment<br>By Rabbi Moshe Peretz Gilden<br><br>In the closing days of his life, our Patriarch Yaakov (Jacob) commanded Yosef (Joseph) not to inter him in Egypt. He made Yosef swear that he will be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Chevron. He then offered Yosef's two sons and all of his own sons blessings that guide and define the future of each of the Twelve Tribes. After the blessings and Yaakov's subsequent demise, there was a 70 day mourning period, followed by a huge procession that brought Yaakov to his final resting place in the Holy Land.<br><br>At the time of Yaakov's death, "when Yaakov finished instructing his sons, he drew his feet onto the bed, he expired and was gathered to his people." (Beraishis/Genesis 49:33) What is the significance of Yaakov drawing his feet?<br><br>Three weeks ago we read, "Yaakov settled in the land of his father's sojourning." (37:1) Rashi quoted the Midrash which contrasted the settling of Yaakov - which implies permanence - and the sojourn of his father Yitzchak (Isaac) - which appears to be temporary. The Midrash inferred that after his long exile and struggles with Lavan, "Yaakov wished to finally settle down in tranquility, but the anguish of Yosef's kidnapping pounced upon him."<br><br>Rabbi Gedaliah Schorr (1910-1979; Rosh Yeshiva/Dean of Mesivta Torah Vodaath in Brooklyn, New York; described as the first American trained gadol) expounded that Yaakov was being taught the preciousness of life. Every moment of life has its purpose, granted for the sake of accomplishment. Yaakov thought he had done so much in his life - and he had - and he could now "relax" and focus his time on his relationship with the Creator. But G-d had other plans; there was still much to accomplish. Yaakov, as long as he lived, needed to serve as the Father of the Jewish nation, preparing his children to lead the future generations. Yaakov was being taught how a servant of G-d must continue to "plant the seeds" throughout all the days of his life.<br><br>The Talmud (Eruvin 65a) related a similar anecdote. Rav Chisda was asked by his daughter, "You look exhausted, why don't you sleep a little?" to which he responded, "The day will come when I have plenty of opportunity to sleep (after my passing)." <strong>We were put in this world to accomplish, not to relax.</strong><br><br>Our Father, Yaakov, had already inculcated this lesson. Homiletically, we understand he reemphasized it in his final mortal act. Only at that last moment in life did Yaakov "draw his feet onto the bed." Only then, the moment before death, did he lift his feet off the ground and recline.<br><br>Rest and relaxation are tools used toward an end, not ends in themselves. Life is the opportunity to bring oneself and others closer to G-d and every moment must be utilized toward achieving that goal.<br><br>Have a good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God's Judgement of Our Intentions<br>After the death of our father Yakov, the brothers sense a change in Yosef's attitude and behavior towards them. They are fearful that now that Yakov is gone, Yosef will wreak vengeance against them for their treatment of him many decades earlier They therefore tell Yosef that Yakov commanded that he not be vengeful towards them. Yosef knows that this statement is not true He weeps at having now to be forced to reconcile himself once more with his brothers. He comforts them by stating that "you may have thought in evil intent to harm me, but God thought this to be a great good for now I have been unable to sustain in life a great nation." How does this calm the brothers? Is their guilt somehow expunged simply because God arranged for a happy ending to their originally evil intent? We find in the Talmud that if a person intends to eat non-kosher food and accidentally, without knowledge or intent, actually eats kosher food, he is nonetheless obligated to bring a sin offering because of his evil intent. The rule for such a person is the same as for one who actually ate non-kosher food believing it to be kosher food. He too must bring a sin offering. So, what comfort is it to the brothers that their evil intent turned into a great favor for Yosef and themselves and the entire world at large? Are they not held liable for their bad intention just as in the case of the person eating kosher food, which he thought to be non-kosher?<br><br>Rabbi Meir Dan Plotzki (early twentieth century gaon in Warsaw) in his monumental work on Chumash, Kli Chemda, addresses this question. He provides us with the following insight. There is a great difference between sinning directly against God - eating non-kosher food - and sinning directly against a fellow human being (though this is also indirectly a sin against God) - selling a brother into slavery. When dealing with God Who knows our innermost thoughts, Who searches our hearts and minds and from Whom nothing is hidden, there is no difference between intent and actual behavior. We are taught that regarding the sin of avodah zarah - idolatry - even intent is culpable in God's eyes. The prophet said regarding this sin "To capture Israel in its own heart." For in our relationship with God the inside and the outside, the intent and the action are the same in His omniscience. However, when human beings deal one with another, no one knows the true intent of the other person. Human beings can only judge behavior on actuality and result. The Talmud teaches us a person who gives charity and help to others out of base or selfish motives is still considered to be a charitable person. Thus Yosef could correctly say to the brothers that their original intent is now really immaterial for the result has been a greater good. And in this he hoped they would find some comfort and conciliation.<br><br>We should always attempt to have good and holy intentions in all of our actions, both in matters relating directly to God or to human beings. But we should always remember that as far as human beings are concerned actions and results speak louder than words or intent. May all of our actions and intent be for the sake of the advancement of Torah and the sanctification of God's Name.<br><br>Shabat Shalom.<br>Rabbi Berel Wein<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Under the Radar<br><br>By Rabbi Raymond Beyda<br>And Yaakov said to his sons: Â“Why do you make yourselves conspicuous?Â” (Beresheet 42:1)<br><br>When YaakovÂ’s sons were about to leave to purchase food in Egypt he offered his sage advice, Â“Enter Egypt through separate gates. Do not all enter together because you will be noticed.Â” The Gemara (Taaneet 10a) elaborates. Â“DonÂ’t show yourselves as satisfied and healthy in front of Esav and Yishmael for they will become enviousÂ” Rashi adds that Yaakov was fearful of the evil eye that may fall upon them if they were seen together as an impressive group of strong healthy men entering the city together.<br><br>Yaakov taught us the destructive power of jealousy from personal experience. He had given some special amenities to Yosef his son from Rachel and it created jealousies amongst the brothers that lead to the sale of Yosef to a caravan to Egypt. The Gemara says: A person should never treat one child different from another and describes the chain of events that followed YaakovÂ’s special favors to Yosef. (Shabbat 10b) The Rabbis went further and say that one should avoid any behavior that will create jealousy between two people. For example: One should not praise a person in front of another who dislikes him.<br><br>A man was fortunate to be blessed with twin boys. He invited Rav Shach ztÂ’l Â–Rosh Yeshivat Ponovetz - to serve as Sandak (The one upon whose lap an infant is placed for the circumcision ceremony). When twins are circumcised each gets his own berit milah ceremony. Tradition has it that the sandak for each should be a different person. After the first was done Rav Shach remained in his seat and sat for the second boy as well Â– not in keeping with the custom to have someone else sit for the second child. After the circumcision Rav Shach explained his break with tradition. Â“I imagined these boys 15 or 20 years from now and thought perhaps one may taunt the other saying, Â“My sandak was Rav Shach Â– who held you? I did not want to be the vehicle to create jealousy between the brothers.Â”<br><br>A person should try to blend in with the scenery as Yaakov Avinu aÂ’h suggested. In our times too many strive to out do others in dress, automobiles, homes and parties. This competitive spirit can breed envy which can result in being subjected to the dangers of the evil eye.<br><br>One of the greats of the last generation was Rav Yaakov Kanievsky ztÂ’l Â– known as the Steipler. His vast Torah knowledge and his uncanny ability to see beyond what the eye can see are legendary. In his old age he fell ill. A colleague visited and told the Rav, Â“Tomorrow is Rosh Hodesh Â– I intend to go to the graves of tzadikeem Â– the righteous Â– and pray on behalf of your recovery.Â”<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t bother goingÂ” replied the weak patient, Â‘Â’I know why I am ill. You see there is a Rabbi in America who has written several books and he praises me in them. I told him it is better not to write about me but he insists that it will encourage others to go in the ways of our Torah. Even though his intentions are pure Â–THE PUBLICITY IS NOT HEALTHY FOR MEÂ”<br><br>The lesson Yaakov Avinu taught his sons is a timeless one that all should heed. DonÂ’t try to stand out and impress. In fact, the opposite is recommended. Keep a low profile in all that you do. Â“Why make yourself conspicuous?Â” Jealousy is a powerful negative force that can cause great harm. The less publicity Â– the better.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By Rabbi Raymond Beyda<br>"The years of the lives of Sarah" Beresheet 23:1<br><br>Upon returning home from the zenith of his spiritual career, The Akedah -- the Binding of Yitzhak -- Abraham was confronted by yet another test of his faith. The Midrash relates that Satan came to Sarah and revealed to her that Abraham took her son to be offered as a human sacrifice. Upon hearing the news her soul left her and Abraham was now burdened with the task of giving his wife a proper burial. Earlier he had discovered the cave where Adam and Havah were buried and had decided that he would acquire it. Most commentators describe the negotiations between Abraham and Efron the Hitite, through the people called Benei Het, as one of his tests. Here in the land that Hashem promised to him as his heritage, he not only had no place to bury his mate, but he also was forced to negotiate with an unscrupulous, wicked character to boot.<br><br>Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky, zt'l, reveals another way in which Abraham's faith was tested. The verse gives the age of Sarah at her passing in an unnecessarily verbose fashion. "And the lives of Sarah were 100 years and 20 years and 7 years -- the years of the lives of Sarah." Why does the Torah add the phrase "the years of the lives of Sarah?"<br><br>When tragedy strikes people start to talk. Many analyze and explain the event. When Sarah passed away suddenly after hearing the details of her husband's trip with her son, many said: "Were it not for the shock of the Akedah -- she could have lived many more years -- she was still young and healthy!" To negate this idea the Torah testifies "These were the years of her life." -- this was the amount of time she was supposed to live as recorded in Heaven when she was born. The Akedah did not cause her any harm.<br><br>This is a technique that the Yeser Hara -- one's Evil Inclination -- uses to deter misvah performance. He tries to convince us that performance of the good deed will cause a loss. It is difficult to defer his arguments because he fills one's imagination with vivid images of the damage the misvah will cause. The verse comes to teach us that one does not ever lose out because of misvot. What was supposed to happen -- will happen.<br><br>The Hazon Ish was considered the Gadol Hador -- the Torah giant of the generation -- until his passing about 50 years ago. Once he was asked how he could dare involve himself in burying those who died in the streets during a highly contagious plague that ravaged his home of Vilna.<br><br>"Of course I realize that there might be a danger because I am coming into contact with dangerous, contagious organisms -- but I am more fearful of the consequences that will result if I DO NOT bury the dead as required by the Torah." His decision was not based on personal judgment alone -- it was an outgrowth of his perfect faith in the words of our sages. "When a plague strikes it can only harm those that fear it." No doctor would believe it but the Hazon Ish knew that he would not lose by doing a misvah.<br><br>A true story about a much more simple everyday Jew teaches us the other side of the coin. A learned, middle-aged Jew was working on an important business deal. He finally secured the appointment with the other party that would close the deal and yield the bottom line profit. There was one problem. If he wanted to arrive at the meeting on time he would have to cancel one half an hour of his regular learning time with his habrutah [learning partner]. He decided to inform his learning partner that he had to cancel their regular session and proceeded to the agreed time and place.<br><br>As he paced back and forth glancing at his wristwatch every two minutes, his nerves were bombarded by thoughts of failure.<br><br>"Maybe he backed out."<br><br>"Perhaps someone else got to him."<br><br>"What is going to happen when the banks find out that the deal fell through and I will not show the profit projected in my statements.Â”?<br><br>And then at exactly the time he would have arrived had he not cancelled his learning -- the other party walked in apologizing for the delay caused by the unusual traffic on the road.<br><br>The businessman would have spent valuable time learning and also would have avoided the nervous tension he had to suffer had he believed that it NEVER pays to cancel set Torah learning. One never gains from bitul Torah.<br><br>Hashem tested our Patriarchs and Matriarchs in ways we could not survive in perfect faith. He also tests each and every one of us daily to assist our spiritual growth and to add to our reward in the World to Come. His tests are suited to our spiritual ability. We have what it takes to pass. One technique we should invoke and develop is to remember the verse: "The tears of the lives of Sarah." It is all predetermined. Doing what the Torah asks of us wonÂ’t hurt us. Misvot always yield blessing. Do them without fear -- like the Hazon Ish. And like the Hazon Ish -- fear the consequences of NOT DOING what Hashem asks.<br><br>Shabbat Shalom<br><br>Raymond J Beyda<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Under G-d's Wings</strong><br><br>Realizing that their father had died, YosefÂ’s brothers said, Â“Perhaps Yosef will bear hatred towards us, and repay us for all the evil that we did him.Â” They instructed Yosef: Â“Your father gave orders before his death, saying, Â‘Tell Yosef this: Â“Please forgive the spiteful deed of your brothers and their sin, for they have borne you evil.Â”Â’ So now, please forgive [our] spiteful deedÂ…Â” Yosef said to them: Â“Fear not, for am I in G- dÂ’s place? Although you intended to do me bad, G-d intended it for good.Â” (50:16-20)<br><br>We do not find anywhere in Scripture that Yaakov instructed the brothers to issue Yosef such a warning. Rashi writes that it wasnÂ’t true; they made it up out of fear of retribution, and to preserve family ties (see Yevamos 65b that one may alter the truth for the sake of peace). Still, if they feared YosefÂ’s wrath, perhaps they should simply have tried begging his forgiveness on their own accord, without making up the part about their father? YosefÂ’s answer, Â“Am I in G-dÂ’s place?Â” must contain some deeper messageÂ—otherwise a simple, Â“I bear no grudge,Â” would have sufficed.<br><br>Before Yaakov dies, he leaves Yosef with instructions to bury him in Eretz Yisrael, not in Egypt. In his instructions to Yosef, he notes with irony that when YosefÂ’s mother, Rachel, died, Yaakov buried her along the path to Bethlehem, and did not even take her into the city. He apologizes to his son, explaining, Â“I realize this bothers youÂ—especially now that I am asking you to transport me from Egypt to Israel. I want you to know that Hashem told me to bury her there. When the Jewish Children will be lead into captivity by Nebuzaradan, chief general of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, they will pass along that road. The soul of your mother, Rachel, will come out, and weep for them, until Hashem promises her that one day they will return.Â”<br><br>Pardes Yosef explains that the brothers werenÂ’t sure whether it was necessary for them to apologize to Yosef for selling him into slavery. In theory, their act was cruel, and they should ask his forgiveness. In fact, it was only through their selling him that Yosef ascended to the throne, paving the way for YaakovÂ’s family to descend to Egypt, and setting the stage for the seedlings of the Jewish nation to take root. Where the initial deed was ill-intended, yet the final result was beneficial, should one still apologize?<br><br>When they heard their fatherÂ’s final words to Yosef, apologizing to Yosef for burying Rachel on the wayÂ—despite the fact that her burial place would one day become a monument bearing the promise of redemptionÂ—they realized that they too needed to ask for forgiveness. Your father gave orders before his deathÂ—he gave orders to you, to bury him in Eretz Yisrael. In his words, he apologized for the way your mother was buried. SayingÂ—This tells us, Â‘Tell Yosef this: Â“Please forgive the spiteful deed of your brothersÂ”Â’Â—we must also beg your forgiveness, notwithstanding the benefits we all reaped from our having sold you into slavery.<br><br>And this, he writes, explains YosefÂ’s cryptic answer, Â“Am I in G-dÂ’s place?Â” In order to Â‘pay you back,Â’ I would have to do what you did to meÂ— i.e. initiate a cruel act towards you, yet the end result would have to be positive. Now perhaps, Yosef argues, IÂ’m capable of acting vengefully, but how can I guarantee it will work out good in the end? Am I in G-dÂ’s placeÂ— to ensure that what starts off bad will work out for the better?<br><br>The Gemara (Berachos 60a) tells of the time the famous Talmudic sage Hillel entered the city on his way home from a trip, only to hear the sound of anguished screams. Â“I fully trust those are not from my house,Â” he said. Regarding such faith, the Gemara concludes, it is written (Tehillim/Psalms 112:7), Â“He fears not from bad soundsÂ—his heart is firm with faith in Hashem.Â”<br><br>On the surface, this Gemara is difficult to understand. Just because Hillel had great faith in Hashem, how could he be sure the screams werenÂ’t coming from his house? Does this mean that nothing bad ever happens to the man of faith? And would it be any better if the screams were coming from someone elseÂ’s house? Does the man of faith only care about his own loved ones?<br><br>Hillel was renowned for his extreme humility (Shabbos 10b). Chovos Ha- levvavos (ShaÂ’ar Ha-kneiah 7) writes that there are five traits through which one can recognize the truly humble: 1) He controls his anger even when he is treated disrespectfully. 2) If something bad befalls him (RÂ”l), monetarily, or something bad happens to him or a family member, he remains calm and quiet and doesnÂ’t lose his cool, understanding that everything comes from Hashem. 3) He is unaffected by othersÂ’ praise, thinking to himself, Â“Even if what they say is true, were they aware of my sins and shortcomings, they would realize that the little bit of good they praise doesnÂ’t even begin to make up for my lack of true dedication to Hashem.Â” If someone insults him, even if the insult happens not to be true, he thinks to himself, Â“Perhaps he is mistaken, and in fact I am not at fault with regard to what he accuses me of, but IÂ’d better stay quiet lest he find out the far-worse faults he hasnÂ’t yet discovered!Â” 4) If Hashem blesses him with wisdom, wealth, honour, or any other blessings, which usually cause their recipients to become arrogant, he remains simple and humble, realizing that his blessings are the gift of Hashem, and not a result of his own prowess or merit. 5) He constantly rebukes himself and looks for ways to improve his dedication to Torah and mitzvos.<br><br>No doubt, Hillel embodied the traits of the humble, and taught them to his family. When he heard the anguished screams in the street, he knew it couldnÂ’t be from his house, because in HillelÂ’s house, no matter how stressful the situation nor how great the difficulties, they didnÂ’t scream. He taught them to trust that whatever Hashem does is ultimately for our good, so thereÂ’s never a good reason to lose oneÂ’s cool. (Reiach Dudaim) He fears not from bad soundsÂ—the screams of one who has Â‘lost it,Â’ because: his heart is firm with faith in HashemÂ—that no matter what happens, it was how things were meant to be, and thereÂ’s no need to get upset.<br><br>While itÂ’s no easy task to achieve such a level of faith and equanimity, one who strives to live his life after the famous dictum, Â“Everything Hashem does is for our good,Â” lives a life free of stress and anger. He is constantly aware that heÂ’s not running the show, and that thereÂ’s nothing anyone or anything can do to him that wasnÂ’t ordained by the Almighty. Why bother getting angry at so-and-so who did such-and-suchÂ—itÂ’s not him, itÂ’s Hashem!<br><br>Perhaps this is what Yosef meant to say to his brothers: Â“Ha-tachas Elokim AnochiÂ—am I not under HashemÂ’s providence? You fear I harbour anger towards you. That presumes that I view what happened to me as having been perpetrated by you yourselves. Nothing could be further from the truth. I believe with all my heart that HashemÂ’s hand was there guiding you every step of the way. Indeed, what at first seemed so bad, turned out to be such a blessing! But even before I realized how things would work out, I never felt animosity towards you. I am under the guidance of the Almighty, and if in His great wisdom, He saw fit to have me sold, then thatÂ’s how it had to be.<br><br>Life constantly presents us with its ups and downs: Sometimes things go just as planned, and sometimes we have to deal with situations and people we might have done without, given the choice. If we approach each day, each encounter, and each difficulty as a personal gift from the Almighty, we might think twice before lashing out at things beyond our control.<br><br>Have a good Shabbos.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shemos<br>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"And G-d said to him, 'what is in your hand?' And he said, 'a staff.' And He said, 'cast it to the ground,' and he cast it to the ground and it became a snake, and Moshe ran away from it." [4:2-3]<br>The Medrash tells us the following story (Shemos Rabba 3): A Roman matron said to Rebbe Yossi, "my god is greater than your G-d." He asked her why. So she explained, "at the moment that your G-d revealed Himself to Moshe in the bush, Moshe covered his face [but did not move]. But when he saw the snake, which is my god, immediately 'Moshe ran away from it!'"<br><br>Rebbe Yossi replied that she did not understand. "When our G-d was revealed in the bush, there was no place to run. Where would he run -- to the heavens, the sea, or to dry land? What does it say concerning our G-d? 'Behold, I fill the heavens and the earth...' With the snake, which is your god, if a person merely runs two or three steps away he can escape and save himself, and this is why it says 'Moshe ran away from it.'"<br><br>Rabbi Tzvi Elimelech Hertzberg zt"l sees within this conversation a message about leadership. The Roman matron's god was the snake, because that was the type of leadership to which she was accustomed. Her leader was a snake then. Snakes will strike without cause or benefit, and we still find leaders of this variety today: dictators, who punish their people without cause or personal benefit, but only in order to demonstrate how powerful they are.<br><br>He also points out that those who spread gossip are like snakes, because their only "benefit" is malicious -- the sense of superiority which they get from putting down others. The dictator and gossip work together: the power of the dictator depends upon the gossip that people tell about one another, even that ministers tell. No one dares make a misstep, and thus the dictator rules from fear.<br><br>Our teacher Moshe ran away from "leadership" of this nature. He wanted no part of it, for it runs completely contrary to the kindness and generosity of our forebears, the kindness demanded of us by the Torah. The Jewish path towards leadership is built upon humility, mercy and righteousness, not the methods of a snake. The Jewish path is indicated only a few verses later, when G-d says, "in order that they will believe that the G-d of their forebears appeared to you, the G-d of Abraham, the G-d of Isaac, the G-d of Jacob." [4:5]<br><br>Jewish leaders should inspire people to recognize and have faith in the G-d of our forebears, by demonstrating an entirely different -- and sanctified -- style of leadership. The Jewish leader may use his staff, but only out of concern for his land and his people, not for personal reasons, and certainly not out of malice.<br><br>This lesson applies to all of us: when we behave with kindness, consideration, and love for others, we inspire respect for ourselves, for our people, and for our G-d.<br><br>Good Shabbos<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What's In A Name?<br><br>The second book of the Torah, The Book of Shemos (Exodus) begins by recounting the names of the Children of Israel who went down to Egypt. A separate more thorough count is related in The Book of Genesis (46:8-27). Nevertheless, the recount is related in this week's parsha as well.<br><br>Rashi, the medieval French commentary, notes the seeming redundancy of the recount, and he explains as follows: "Even though it (the Torah) counted them during their lives it recounts them in their deaths to convey their dearness (to G-d) as they are analogous to stars which G-d brings out and in by number and by name; as it states in the verse "(G-d) Who brings out their host by number, each He calls by name." (Iasiah 40:26)<br><br>We see from Rashi that the Children of Israel are recounted in order to convey love to them. They enter and leave by number and by name, similar to that of stars.<br><br>What is special about being counted and called by name? When something is counted it takes on a special individual significance. When the stars are brought out it is done by number (known to G-d), to give each one its place as an important part of the bigger picture - individually shining its own unique and intrisic light - but contibuting to the whole panorama of the heavens and its hosts. Each star "counts."<br><br>Each star is also called by name. By attributing names to stars G-d is declaring their essence and purpose. The word in Hebrew for name is "Shem." The word "there" is spelled exactly the same as the Hebrew word for "name." The two words are related. What is "there" in the essence of the thing named is its true name. That essence is the potential in the thing. One's name and his potential are one and the same. In this context realizing one's potential is living up to one's name. That is, utilizing one's latent talents actively, and not leaving them untapped.<br><br>By the same token when one does not use his abilities, and expose his potential talents it is called "shemama," "desolation," also related to the word "Shem," or name, except that in this case it is when one fails to tap the latent abilities.<br><br>One way that G-d conveys His love for us is by comparing us to stars and showing us that we count and have a unique and individual purpose.<br><br>The Book of Exodus begins by recounting our potential as a people. The book ends in our having realized that potential after the exodus from Egypt, and the building of the tabernacle, the sanctuary housing G-d's exalted presence. We are a people who can host the Glory of G-d in our midst.<br><br>One story which illustrates this potential greatness is told about Rabbi Menachem Nachum Kaplan (19th cent.), known as "Reb Nachumke." Reb Nachumke was the sexton in a synagogue of learned men in Grodno in Lithuania. He was extremely kind and generous, and he became the self-appointed guardian of the poor, the needy, and the downtrodden. Once a week he would cover the city of Grodno making collections which he would use toward his many endeavors to help the needy.<br><br>Once he came to the home of a wealthy lawyer who failed to appreciate the value of Reb Nachumke's work. He spoke harshly with Reb Nachumke, basically accusing him of being a parasite, and then slammed the door in his face, nearly hitting him.<br><br>Unfortunately for the lawyer, his fortunes took a downturn. Being that the lawyer had many dealings with many corrupt government officials, suspicion was cast upon him in a particularly dirty deal, and he basically had to spend his fortunes on legal defense for himself. He was given three years in prison and he was forced to leave his wife and family with no means of support. As the man's wife made plans to sell her furniture and take a small apartment, there was a knock at the door. It was Reb Nechumke. He wanted to know how much she needed in order to manage on a monthly basis. She gave him the figures, and he left telling her that she should remain in her home and she would receive the funds she needed. For three years the woman received the amount she needed from Reb Nachumke to cover her expenses and care for her children. When her husband was released, he arrived at home surprised to see everything in order and everyone so well cared-for. When his wife related to him how it came to be that she was able to remain in the house and manage, the lawyer was filled with shame remembering how he had treated Reb Nachumke. He went running to Reb Nachumke, thanked him, and begged him for forgiveness. Subsequently, the man changed his ways, and learned to appreciate Reb Nachumke, Torah observance, and the beauty of being charitable.<br><br>Learning Torah and performing its commandments has the unique ability to challenge us to rise up and excercise our latent potential. Through becoming accustomed to behave as G-d commands us in His Torah, we become a refined, second edition of our real selves. We begin to realize how brightly we can shine, and how special we really are. Just as the stars are unique, exalted, and shining bright, so are we when we work toward getting in touch with, and living up to our name.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br></div>
