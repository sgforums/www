            <div class='col-md body'>HE MAKES ME LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES Part2<br><br>Most people are content with some crumbs from His Word and many times they are actually quite happy eating spiritual gravel and straw. However they fail to bring the reward to the Shepherd, they fail to grow the Â“woolÂ” that is needed by the Shepherd. Their spiritual food has been deficient! For the most part, His Body has been eating quite a lot of gravel and straw when it is divorced from the original Gospel made in Zion and the Jewish Roots of the Faith. So, this year He wants you to both REST and FEAST on GREEN PASTURES. He will not accept His sheep to eat any more gravel! It is time to bear fruit for the Master! Sheep are not created for themselves they are created for the Shepherd. It is time for His sheep to hear the Call to lie down in green pastures!<br><br>There is no better place to get the riches of His Word and to learn His ways than Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the GREEN PASTURES where Yahveh wants His sheep to come to this year.  He wants them to rest and to be restored through eating green grass and refusing the gravel of Replacement Theology and the shallow Western Christian Gospel. Great riches are awaiting His sheep in Zion this year!<br><br>Â“And in that day you will say:  Â“ O Yahveh, I will praise You; Though You were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me. Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust and not be afraid; Â‘ For YAH, Yahveh, is my strength and song; He also has become my salvation.Â’Â”  Therefore with joy you will draw water From the wells of salvation.Â”  Isaiah 12:1-3<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HE MAKES ME LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES Part3<br><br>He makes me to lie down in green pastures:<br><br>Al neot deshe yarbitseni<br><br>This portion of this scripture is amazingly revealing! He makes me to lie down means that He does something FORCEFUL to bring me down, even against my own will. In Hebrew the word YARBITSENI means: Â“He beats me up until I obey Him and I lie down to learn His Torah and His ways!Â” Among the Orthodox Jews to teach Torah, (the laws and Commandments of the Creator,) to little children it is called LEHARBITS TORAH, which means to Â“BEAT THE TORAH INTO YOUÂ”. When you see a shepherd making his sheep to lie down you will see him/her pushing the sheep down forcefully and or beating them with a stick until they LIE DOWN!<br><br>Â“If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not chasten? But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons. Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed best to them, but He for our profit, that we may be partakers of His holiness. Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by itÂ”. Hebrews 12:7-11<br><br>If you feel Â“beat upÂ” and some strange things are happening to stop your plans and agendas; it is probably the Shepherd calling you to lie down in order to learn His ways. Of course Â“lie downÂ” means to humble yourself, stop what you are doing and listen to Him. Give Him your time. No more business as usual this year!<br><br>2007 is a Year of Shabbat, a year of REPENTANCE, REST and RESTORATION. He is calling all of His Bride to be restored to the original Jewish Roots of the Faith.   Are you listening? He is also calling us to be trained in His ways and character as we rest.<br><br>In order to provide you our beloved partners with the best of GREEN PASTURES we have designed by the help of The Holy Spirit some tours and trainings in His Land, in His Garden, His Green Pastures in Jerusalem, in Israel!<br><br>In His word it is written that from Â“Shabbat to ShabbatÂ” all mankind shall come and worship Yahveh in Jerusalem (Isaiah 66:23). This is a SHABBAT YEAR and He is calling all those that have ears to hear to COME UP and worship Him in Jerusalem in order to lie down in green pastures and feed on His Torah and Ruach (Spirit) in Zion. Those that will join the coming MAP Revolution tours and trainings in His Land this year will be made HOLY, and WHOLE, and will grow the fruit it takes for the End Time Move of YAH. They will be able to be used of Him and even lead in His End Time Army!<br><br>Â“As one whom his mother comforts, So I will comfort you; And you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.Â” Isaiah 66:13<br><br>We are waiting for you in His GREEN PASTURES IN ZION. Can you hear the Voice of the Shepherd?<br><br>Feasting in His Land<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Bishop Dominiquae and Rabbi Baruch Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ability Versus Availability<br>Psalms 147:10-11<br>His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor His delight in the legs of a man; the Lord delights in those who fear Him, who put their hope in His unfailing love.<br><br>Do you ever feel so skilled in what you do that you require little help from others? Perhaps you may feel that you are more skilled than any other in your field. Does God need your skills and abilities in order to accomplish His purposes on this earth? The answer is NO.<br><br>One thing God does not need is our skills and abilities. However, He does give us the privilege to exercise our gifts and abilities for His service. That service may be as a computer technician, a secretary, an ironworker, or even a lawyer. God calls each of us to our vocations to work unto Him. To believe that He needs our skills to accomplish His mission on earth would be to lower our understanding of an all-encompassing and all-powerful God. The psalmist tells us that His pleasure is not in our strength and ability, but His pleasure is in the attitude of the heart. It is what we find in the heart that helps determine whether ability is translated into availability. You see, God is looking to and fro throughout the earth for a man or woman who is fully committed to Him. A man or woman who is committed to fearing the Lord and placing his hope in His unfailing love is the person God seeks to support. "For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him" (2 Chron. 16:9a). When our agenda becomes His agenda, we can expect God to fully support all that we do.<br><br>If we want to see our skills and abilities multiplied a hundredfold, then we must make them completely available to His service. Where are the opportunities in which God is calling you to be available to Him? Next time someone asks you to be involved in some activity, before you say yea or nay, make sure you check in with the Master of our decisions to ensure that your gifts and talents are being used as He desires.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NO NEED TO SELL YOURSELF<br><br>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>"It happened that when Pharoah sent the nation out of Egypt, G-d did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although it was close..." [13:17]<br>According to the Chofetz Chaim, Rabbi Yisroel M. Kagan, G-d had two choices, each of which had its good and bad aspects.<br><br>The first choice was to lead the Nation of Israel through the land of the Pelishtim (Philistines), in which food was available, but where the degraded practices of the Pelishtim could be witnessed. The Jewish people had been repeatedly exposed to the Egyptians and their ways during the centuries they spent in that country, and this had influenced them - so much so that our Sages, who explain that there are fifty different "gates" of impurity, also tell us that the people of Israel had descended through forty-nine during the Egyptian exile. Had they gone further, through the fiftieth gate, they would have been "beyond redemption." There was a great danger that the Pelishtim could also influence Israel, and perhaps even draw them down through the fiftieth gate.<br><br>The alternative was the desert, which was entirely pure - but was also bereft of food. How could several million people survive there?<br><br>HaShem's final decision was that it was better to take the people through the desert, avoiding the temptations of the Pelishtim. In order to avoid starvation, he brought them Manna - miraculous food from Heaven. This was preferable to risking further spiritual descent on Israel's part.<br><br>[Obviously, HaShem could also simply have made the Nation of Israel impervious to the effects of the Pelishtim. But as mentioned last week, free will is critical to a Jewish understanding of Creation and our reasons for being here, and thus we might understand why even an open miracle might be preferable to changing human nature, even for a short time.]<br><br>This, says the Chofetz Chaim, is the response to all those who "sell themselves" into inappropriate businesses and business dealings, claiming that their behavior is necessary "to make a living." One who claims to believe that G-d could sustain and support 600,000 men - and thus several million men, women and children - in miraculous fashion, must certainly believe that He can provide bread and sustenance to someone who follows His ways, and engages only in honest business.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Never Forget<br><br>By Rabbi Pinchas Avruch<br>The arrival of the Jewish Nation in Refidim soon after crossing the Sea of Reeds brought the discovery there was no water. The masses failed this test and, instead of praying to G-d for relief, turned on the messenger, Moshe, with the complaint "Is G-d with us or not?" (Shemos/Exodus 17:7) While Moshe miraculously provided the needed water, the subsequent attack by Amalek taught them the lesson they failed to learn from the water. But unlike other lessons learned by our forebears, the heinous crime of Amalek is unique in the mandate that it constantly be remembered throughout time. "G-d said to Moshe, 'Write this as a remembrance in the Book and recite it in the ears of Yehoshua (Joshua) that I shall surely erase the memory of Amalek from under the heavens.'" (ibid v.14) "Remember what Amalek did to you on the way when you were leaving Egypt...It shall be that when G-d your L-rd gives you rest from all your enemies all around, in the Land that G-d your L-rd gives you as an inheritance to possess it, you shall wipe out the memory of Amalek from under the heaven - you shall not forget!" (Devarim/Deuteronomy 25:17,19)<br><br>Rabbi Michel Barenbaum (1) expounds that the purpose of this mitzvah (Divine command) is for the Jew to learn the fundamental truth of G-d's personal engagement in the minutiae of his life. Rashi explains that the attack was borne from the question "Is G-d with us or not?" Throughout the Jewish battle with Amalek, while G-d's presence was hidden, it was evident that His protection was manifest. Indeed, the entire purpose of the war was to answer that question: salvation is exclusively in G-d's hands. Moshe raised his hands to lift the eyes of the warriors heavenward, engendering a focus upon their Father in Heaven. The war itself fostered the recognition that G-d is very much amongst us. Thus, this mitzvah is augmented with the directive to constantly remember: always remember the lesson of the war on Amalek, always remember the answer to that question, remember that G-d's involvement is perpetual.<br><br>The Jewish Exodus from Egypt came through eleven of the most fantastic miracles since Creation itself. The Ten Plagues and the Splitting of the Sea demonstrated unequivocally that nature is simply G-d's routine, daily miracles, wondrous acts that He suspends or reverses at will. And still they had their question of G-d's involvement. We, three millennia later, surrounded only by His daily miracles, must maintain our focus heavenward. The value and importance of constantly remembering Amalek is magnified. <strong>Now, more than ever, the question is not if G-d is with us; rather, we must ask: "Are we with G-d, or not?" </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Manna Gathering Separates The "Men" From the "Boys" </strong><br><br>There is an interesting Medrash which says that when the Manna originally came down, it came down with precious stones and diamonds. The greatest people (Gedolim she'bahem) of the nation went ahead and took these precious stones and diamonds. However, the simple people, the masses, only collected the Manna.<br><br>This is very strange. Everyone appreciates a bargain - especially free diamonds! How was it that only the leaders of the people took advantage of free riches?<br><br>I once heard a very interesting observation from Rav Michel Twerski of Milwaukee. He pointed out the unique economic conditions that existed in the Wilderness. For perhaps the only time in the history of civilization, there existed a society where all of a person's physical needs were met. Food was effortlessly available from Heaven. Water was effortlessly available from the Well. Clothing did not wear out, so it was not necessary to buy new clothing. Shelter was available from the Clouds of Glory. We can probably assume that G-d threw in Health Insurance as a guaranteed benefit as well. This was a society that did not have any needs whatsoever.<br><br>If one does not have any needs, then of what use are precious stones? What would one do with them? There was nothing to buy and no need to buy anything. Therefore, people looked at these precious stones, determined that they had no purpose for them, and considered them worthless.<br><br>However, the great people among them knew that there would come an occasion when there would be a Mishkan [Tabernacle] and Bigday Kehunah [Holy Vestments (of the High Priest)] which required the contribution of precious stones.<br><br>This Medrash teaches us that what differentiates the masses from the leadership, is perspective. A person who only sees in front of his nose, who only considers his requirements for the day, is in the category of a non-leader. The leader recognizes that although certain things might be unnecessary in the current situation, in the future there may come a time when these things will have value.<br><br>It is well known that trees do not grow in deserts. The Jews needed a significant amount of lumber to build the Mishkan. Where did they obtain the lumber? Our Rabbis credit the existence of the trees to the foresight of Yaakov. Our Sages tell us that Yaakov planted cedar trees when he first came down to Egypt so that his descendants would be able to cut them down and take them out with them for the purpose of building the Mishkan. This is the perspective of a great individual. He is not merely caught up in 'today'; he plans for and considers what will be in the future.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Lesson of the Manna: Complaining Reflects An Attitude </strong><br><br>The narration of the Manna gathering, which is first mentioned in this week's reading [Shmos 16:4-27], is repeated again in Parshas BeHa'aloscha [Bamidbar 11:6-9]. There, the Torah tells us that after a while, a certain segment of the people became tired of the Manna. They complained: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner is always Manna. Manna, Manna, and more Manna. Every day was 'Mon'-day. They could not take it anymore!<br><br>The Torah says that the Manna was like coriander seed. (V'HaMan k'zra gad hu). Rashi (1040-1105) says that this pasuk [verse] is telling us that G-d, as it were, was saying, "Look what my children are complaining about. They are complaining about the Manna, which is so outstanding - it is like coriander seed."<br><br>There was nothing better than Manna. It tasted like whatever one wanted. It was spiritual food. It was great for both body and soul. It was the best food that a human being could ever aspire to eat.<br><br>The Torah went out of its way to describe the Manna in order to teach us a lesson. The lesson is that if people will complain about Manna, they will complain about anything.<br><br>A person can have the best situation in life - compared to his neighbors, compared to people in other countries, compared to people in other times in history - and still complain about everything under the sun!<br><br>I recently heard from a Rosh Yeshiva [Dean of a Yeshiva] that a couple came to him for marital counseling. The husband complained that his wife, who was a full-time mother, did not keep a neat house. Whenever he walked in, he was likely to stumble on the children's toys strewn all over the floor. His wife responded that kids will be kids, and that she can't go around every minute picking up after them.<br><br>The Rosh Yeshiva told the fellow as follows: "How many couples in the world would give their right arms to have your problem -- who would like nothing more than a child leaving his toys on the floor? How many couples would give anything to live in a home that was not immaculate, because there were a bunch of kids creating a mess?"<br><br>If people can complain about Manna, they can complain about children... or any other of life's blessings that sometimes go unappreciated. That is what Rashi is emphasizing in this verse about the Manna. "See, oh world, how my children complain about an outstanding gift that I have given them." This is the paradigm for all future complaining.<br><br>It is all a matter of attitude. A person can have nothing and still be happy, and a person can have everything and still complain. When we see all the troubles that exist in the world around us, we can really begin to appreciate how well off we are. Our mantra should be the pasuk "And the Manna is like coriander seed..." The next time we are tempted to complain, we should think of the lesson of the Manna. If a person does not have proper values, if he can not distinguish between what is important in life and what is secondary, he will always find something to complain about.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Passive Battle With Egypt: A Symbolic Prototype </strong><br><br>The Ibn Ezra (1089-1164) points out that there are two wars in Parshas B'Shalach - the war against Egypt at Yam Suf and the war against Amalek. The Ibn Ezra asks, since we see from the war with Amalek that G-d was prepared to allow the Jewish people to fight a real military battle on their own - albeit with Divine Assistance - why was it that in the war against Egypt, G-d insisted that the Jewish people not lift a finger, that the entire battle be waged solely by the Hand of G-d? Why was this necessary? Why were the tactics changed between the battle against Egypt and the battle against Amalek?<br><br>Of course, the battle with Egypt would prove to be the historical exception. In all future wars -- be it the wars of Yehoshua or the wars of King David -- the Jews were obliged to participate in battle. Why was the war with Egypt different?<br><br>Rav Yosef Neiman suggests the following answer: The first time that something happens in the Torah it is instructive. It sets the tone. This is the prototype of how one should behave and how one should act in the future. G-d wanted the Jewish people to know that just as in the very first battle which they fought, where they were not required to do anything because "G-d will fight for you and you shall be silent," so too in all future generations -- even if you will have to participate physically in the battle, never forget the lesson of the first. The lesson is that ultimately Help from Heaven and G-d's Mercies determine our fate. If it is G-d's will, we will be victorious, regardless of what we do or do not do militarily. And if, Heaven forbid, as we find in numerous cases in Tanach, it is not G-d's will, we will lose miserably regardless of our military prowess. The determinant of our fate is not our military prowess; it is our meriting G-d's desire for us to be successful.<br><br>I think that at this particular junction in Jewish history -- when we are living in literally amazing times -- it is vital to never forget the lesson of "G-d will fight for you, and you will be silent".<br><br>It was Thursday night, a week ago, that we were all in this room [at the beginning of the Gulf War in 1991]. We all remember how we felt when we left the radios and the media to come to the class. We literally did not know what was happening. The initial reports were that there had been a chemical attack on Israel (by Iraq). When we came out of this room at 10:00 o'clock last Thursday night we heard that there were 7 minor injuries and no fatalities. I do not want to make light of anyone's injuries or the accompanying fright and terror, Heaven forbid. But we saw miracles from G-d. I do not think it is hyperbole to say that this was an 'Open Miracle.' This was even without American Patriot missiles as a defense system. This was the Chasdei Hashem defense system [G-d's Mercy].<br><br>This does not mean that our approach can be to sit back and not prepare. We are not allowed to rely on miracles. If we have what is currently considered the top of the line defense missiles, we certainly must deploy them and certainly must use them. But, on the other hand we should not rely on benefactors who are not able to save (Al tivtichu b'nedeevim sh'ayin lahem teshua). We should never put our faith in the wizardry of electronic military might. We must put our faith in the Master of the World. We should not allow ourselves to get caught up in the 'Evil Inclination' of "Kochi v'Otzem Yadi" [my strength and the might of my arm have accomplished this valor].<br><br>We must realize that ultimately we rely on the concept that "G-d will fight for you, and you be silent". It must be our prayers, our charity, our learning Torah, and our merit that will ultimately carry the day. Whether the patriots will be effective or not depends on the merits and the spiritual level of the Jewish people.<br><br>I was in Los Angeles on Shabbos. The Rabbi, who is also a principal in a school there, related that he overheard two second graders discussing various strategies and scenarios. They were discussing what President Bush should do and what Saddam Hussein should do and what Israel should do. It was a ludicrous scene. These seven-year-olds were giving opinions about what actions world leaders should take. Upon pondering the matter, he realized that G-d looks down from Heaven and He hears us discussing these matters - For Him, even George Bush and Saddam Hussein and Colin Powell's discussion of these matters are like the conversations of second graders: "What do they know? Everyone has an opinion!"<br><br>That which counts is that we should merit the Salvation of G-d, which can come at the bat of an eyelash.<br><br>Rabbi Frand</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So Much For Miracles!<br>By Rabbi Aron Tendler<br>The Splitting of the Yam Suff was the crowning display of Hashem's judicial mastery over nature and humanity. The Medresh tells us that Hashem's presence at that event was so manifest that the lowliest servant understood G-d's reality more profoundly than the greatest prophets. The aftermath of that event is recorded in the Torah as the moment when the entire nation believed in Hashem's absolute control over the universe and in His unique love for the Jew. They celebrated this awareness of G-d with a spontaneous burst of Shira - song.<br><br>Shira is the language of the angels as they proclaim G-d's mastery over heaven and earth. The children of Yakov, having witnessed the hand of G-d, were catapulted to the level of the angels themselves. As Dovid Hamelech said in Psalm 35:10, "All my being proclaims that there is no one like Hashem!" Every individual present at the parting of the sea had no choice but to declare from the depths of their being the absolute certainty that there is a G-d who cares enough to reward and punish.<br><br>Following the singing of the Shira, something happened. The Torah detailed a series of confrontations between the Bnai Yisroel, Moshe, and Hashem over issues of basic survival. Three days after the Jews witnessed G-d's manifest presence, they came to Marah. They were tired and thirsty and the water was bitter. They complained to Moshe and Moshe, as per Hashem's instructions, made the water sweet.<br><br>They traveled 10 miles into the Sinai Desert and complained that they were starving, and that they had been better off in Mitzrayim! Hashem informed Moshe, who in turn informed Aharon, who told the Jews that they would have meat that night and Manna in the morning! As a sign of their trust in Hashem that He would continue to provide for them, they were not to save Manna from day to day. Some of the people didn't listen and Moshe got angry at their obvious lack of trust in G-d who had taken them out of bondage and sent them food from the skies.<br><br>The Jews traveled to Rephidim, 10 miles west of Mt. Sinai (Jebal Musa), and complained about thirst. The rallying call of "Why did you bring us out of Egypt?" grated harshly on Moshe's expectations that they would be more trusting and appreciative; so he turned to Hashem for help. Hashem instructed Moshe to strike a rock and bring forth water to quench their thirst. Moshe facilitated this miracle and named the place Ma'aseh U'merivah- Testing and Argument, to commemorate the distrust that the people had exhibited.<br><br>Why were the Jews distrusting of Hashem? What happened to that overwhelming moment of absolute clarity when the entire nation stood in awe and wonder at the manifest reality of the creator who rules His universe on the principles of rewarding good and punishing evil? Why didn't the Jews believe that the same G-d who could perform ten plagues and split the sea could also provide them with food and water?<br><br>Trust is a by product of constancy. The more constant and consistent G-d's manifest caring, the greater the trust on the part of the people. When Hashem wistfully reflected back on the Exodus, he does so through the words of Yirmiah (2:2) "I remember the kindness of your youth when you trustingly followed me into a barren land." Hashem recognized that 210 years of slavery are not wiped away with one, or even ten, miracles. In fact, the more the miracles the less realistic our understanding of Hashem. Hashem is far more present in the normal workings of nature than He is in His momentary displays of miraculous intervention. The educated and discerning observer recognizes the true manifest presence of G-d in the every day constancy of the norm. The fact that the Bnai Yisroel demanded constant reassurance demonstrated how tenuous their trust in Hashem was. The performance of miracles generated a need for more and more miraculous demonstrations and proofs of G-d's caring and love.<br><br>At any point in the early history of the Jews, the nation could have made a quantum leap of faith and embraced the reality of Hashem's caring presence. However, it would have required a leap of faith that the Bnai Yisroel weren't prepared to take. We, who have the expanse of history as the foundation of our faith, have been gifted with over 3,000 years of proof of Hashem's loving constancy. If only we would permit ourselves to acknowledge the proof, we too would be able to sing Shira.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Â“MyÂ”<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>Â…This is my G-d and I will glorify HimÂ… (Shemos 15:2)<br><br>His glorious honor was revealed to them and they pointed with a finger. (Shemos Rabbah) A maidservant by the sea saw what was not shown to the prophets. (Mechilta Â– Rashi)<br><br>This verse of actual song sung spontaneously and simultaneously by the entire Jewish Nation reveals the profundity of their collective experience. One operative word is Â“thisÂ”. Â“ThisÂ” implies that something tangible or visible is there to point at. Even simple folk were elevated beyond the vision of the greatest prophets. ThereÂ’s another potent notion here in addition to their having experienced Divinity in such a direct way. We can point ourselves to another operative word that deserves strong emphasis. Which word is it?<br><br>Years back I called a close personal friend on a fast day, the 17th of Tamuz, to tell him that we had been learning Chovos HaLevavos outside by the Yeshiva and the Rebbe was saying how everything we see and hear is a signal from HASHEM, Â“even a little dog or squirrel that gets run over!Â” He repeated it with strong emphasis, Â“Even a little dog or squirrel that gets run overÂ…Â” I was waiting for a bird to fall out of a tree at that moment but instead a fellow walked over to the table where we were sitting and asked in a slight panic mode, Â“What should I do? I just hit a dog!Â” We referred him to someone who might be helpful and we went back to our learning. I was amazed. Why did he come to our table? Why at that time with that piece of information? Wow!<br><br>My friend told me, Â“ThatÂ’s nothing! You wonÂ’t believe what just happened to me!Â” He was in the process of looking for a shidduch - a match. He had been dating a girl that lived in Brooklyn and was commuting more than three hours each way. That Sunday he decided that she was not the one for him.<br><br>He spoke to the matchmaker who proposed another shidduch. My friend thought it inappropriate to end the relationship with just a phone call, and he was ready to make another long distance trip just to conclude things face to face. Only then would he seriously entertain a future prospect. The matchmaker challenged the premise but my friend insisted. The persistent matchmaker requested that my good friend ask one of the great local Rabbanim. Â“Ask Rabbi Miller or the Bubover Rebbe!Â” My friend felt it was too much of an imposition to trouble these big people with his small question and so he set off on the long journey home. Before leaving Brooklyn, though, he stopped off and bought 150 new Rabbi Miller tapes.<br><br>The next day he did as he would regularly do and drive to work 45 minutes each way listening to an audio tape from Rabbi Avigdor Miller. That day he reached into the back and grabbed randomly one the new 150 tapes. As he was arriving at his work place the lecture-portion ended and a question and answer period began as was the customary format. Rabbi Miller asked for Â“questions on any subjectÂ”. The first question, Â“Can a man date more than one woman at a time!Â” My friend almost drove off the road! Of all the questions, of all the tapes, of all the times, why now!? (People like to know the answer to the question. Rabbi Miller answered succinctly, Â“Yes but on two conditions, 1) The man is serious about marriage and 2) those women should know nothing about each other!Â”)<br><br>In the midst of the sea, each individual, in a singular moment, became strongly aware that not only is there Â“aÂ” G-d with an indefinite article, but that G-d is Â“myÂ” personal G-d that knows and cares and interacts with the minutiae of my daily life. If one pays close enough attention to the more than occasional cosmic wink, one may find that the encounter that seemed uniquely historically theirs, may actually be your and my Â“myÂ”.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br>Think Again!<br><br>And Pharaoh drew near and the Children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians were coming after them and they were extremely afraid and the Children of Israel cried out to HASHEM. And they said to Moses, Â“Were there not enough graves in Egypt that that you have taken us to die in the desert?Â” (Shemos 14:10-11)<br><br>Were there not enough graves that you have taken us to die in the desert:: This sharp irony even in moments of deepest anxiety and despair is characteristic of the witty vein which is inherent in the Jewish race from their earliest beginnings. (Rabbi S.R. Hirsch)<br><br>The One Who sits in heaven will laughÂ… (Tehillim 2:4)<br><br>The tension could not have been higher. The entire Nation of Israel finds itself sandwiched between the Army of Pharaoh and the Red Sea. All hope seems lost. TheyÂ’re trapped like rats. There is no real solution and in that darkest of situations the only escape or way of coping seems to be humor. Why? What is there about those pressing moments in life that satire becomes the only sane outlet? What is there in a joke that seems to offer at least some temporary relief in times of major crisis?<br><br>This looks like the earliest record in human history of Â“gallows humorÂ”! WhatÂ’s that? Two Jews find themselves standing before a firing squad and the orders are being given, Â“Ready! AimÂ…Â” At that moment one of those about to be fired-upon begins to make a stir. While bound in chains he shouts, Â“This is not fair! YouÂ’ll pay for this!Â” Then the other one jumps in and attempts to quiet his comrade telling him, Â“SHHHHH! DonÂ’t say any more! YouÂ’ll only make them mad!Â”<br><br>Not only is a joke useful in response to danger but also prior to learning. The Talmud tells us that Rabbah, a master teacher would begin his Torah lessons with a joke. What are the common ingredients that make laughter a useful tool for emotional survival and intellectual growth? A young lady with her little daughter entered the food mart and promptly set her into one of those grocery carts. As they wove up and down the aisles the child started to reach with desperation for the items on the shelf. At each outbreak the mother would pause and exclaim ever so calmly, Â“Chani we only came here for a few items and we are going right home!Â”<br><br>As they passed by the cookie and the candy shelf the struggle became even more pronounced and the mother would again quietly declare, Â“Chani, weÂ’ll be home soon!Â” The final test was the impulse buying section near the checkout counter and here the child was near hysterical and again the motherÂ’s calm prevailed with another soothing speech, Â“Chani, weÂ’re going to the car and then home for dinner!Â”<br><br>In the parking lot, now, by the car a man approached and told the mother that he had been observing carefully all that had transpired in the store and how impressed he was with her parenting skills and how she had she had displayed grace under incredible pressure. He said, Â“Your tone was so soothing and it was just wonderful to see how nicely you spoke to your daughter Chani.Â” At that moment she gave a look of surprise and responded to the kind man, Â“My daughter is not Chani. IÂ’m Chani!Â”<br><br>There is usually an element of surprise in a joke that challenges a set of prior assumptions and forces us to shatter certain categorical boxes. This is a valuable exercise before entering the creative realm of Talmudic thought. Similarly, when we feel trapped and see no way out, the search for a solution and the need to make whole sense of a situation may lead to some outrageously absurd and even humorous conclusions as we desperately reconfigure the prevailing paradigms. And just when you think youÂ’ve figured it out the sea splits and weÂ’re made to think again!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br>Ultimate Victory is Promised<br><br>And Amalek came and battled with Israel in Rephidim. And Moses said to Joshua, "Choose for us people and go do battle with Amalek. I will stand at the head of the hill with the staff of G-d in my hand...It's a war for Hashem with Amalek from generation (to) generation." (Shemos 17:8-9-15)<br><br>Choose for us. For me and for you! He (Moses) equated himself to him (Joshua). From here our sages learn to say, "The honor of your student should be as dear to you as your own.The honor of your friend should be to you as the reverence for your Rebbe...The reverence of your Rebbe should be as the awe of heaven. (Rashi)<br><br>With a careful reading of the text we are treated to such a handsome lesson in human relations. Everybody, starting from the top down is to offer an upgraded measure of honor and reverence for his students, colleagues and teachers. For sure, if carried out consistently and universally this simple maxim would help create a rich and fibrous bond between all of people in an unbreakable way. The only question though is, "Why is this address the one for this poignant point?" Why is it parked here next to the battle with Amalek?<br><br>It must have been clear to Moses from the beginning of the surprise attack that Amalek was not a one-time combatant. Israel had not violated their territory or provoked them in any way. This was an open offensive against what Israel had now come to represent to the entire world. They were as a tall flag, waving in the wind, high above the nations proclaiming the power and presence of The A-lmighty.<br><br>That Amalek was willing to destroy itself in this suicide mission only to stain that flag and diminish its status indicated that they are as passionate to undo the Name of the A-lmighty as we are to declare His Unity! That they found the weakest moment and the most vulnerable ones to attack sent a powerful signal. We need nothing less than eternal vigilance.<br><br>Rabbi Yitzchok Hutner, in his writings Pachad Yitzchok, explains that it is entirely appropriate here to learn the secret to forging unbreakable bonds between parents, children, teachers and colleagues on all levels. In a relay race the most delicate procedure is the point of contact when the baton is being passed from runner to runner. A mishandling and a fumble could make the entire difference between victory and defeat.<br><br>Moses understood what has been confirmed in scripture and subsequently through our bitter historical experience that this is a battle for all time. It's not enough to win in "the now". We must win the war in the farthest future. Moses and his teachings must stand on "the head of the hill" not just today but "tomorrow" as well. How is that long term war to be fought effectively over the course of generations?<br><br>There is a profound need for a powerful web of interconnectedness between each and every caring person and especially at the contact points where generations interface. Therefore, the text may be understood to mean that we are locked in a battle not only in each generation but at that delicate and most vulnerable point of generation to generation.<br><br>It is known that as a young man, Rabbi Aaron Kotler was a beloved disciple of Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, known affectionately as the Alter from Slobodka. He used to engage Reb Aaron in Torah conversations that lasted late into the night. So that his student would not be afraid to walk home at such hours Reb Nosson Tzvi would escort him through the side streets of Slobodka to the main road. There he would stand and call loudly after his student to dispel his fear until he entered his house.<br><br>It's impossible to measure the future impact of that investment of time and caring. How much fear did Reb Aaron dispel in his lifetime? The sainted Chofetz Chaim is reported to have said regarding The Alter, "I write books. Reb Nosson Tzvi creates people." It is in this type of creative activity that ultimate victory is promised.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br>Split-Sea Soup<br><br>Hashem saved on that day Israel from the hand of Egypt and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. And Israel saw the great hand that Hashem inflicted upon Egypt and the people feared Hashem and they had faith in Hashem and Moshe His servant. (Shemos 14:30-31)<br><br>It's certainly great news to hear how inspired the Children of Israel were at having the seen the sea split before their eyes. The common complaint and/or question is "How come Hashem doesn't split the sea for us?" Then we can have the same degree of certainty and commitment that they had. We would also probably spontaneously erupt into an ecstatic song shouting "this is my G-d and I will glorify him!"(Shemos 15:2)<br><br>There are two different things that the Talmud tells us are as "difficult" (for G-d to do) as the splitting of the sea. One is the making of marriage partners and the other is the livelihood of a person. Is anything more or less difficult for The A-lmighty to do? In which ways are they similar? They are both profound human needs. In which way are they different? One is perhaps a once in a lifetime event while the other is a daily happening. Maybe the answer lies in their commonality as well as their distinctiveness.<br><br>Let's imagine the following scenario together. While drinking a coffee at 8:00 AM there's a brief knock and an envelope is seen appearing from underneath the door. A man is spotted running to his car. In the envelope is a hundred dollars cash for you. You wave thanks as the car speeds away. "Who was that stranger?" you wonder, "I wanted to thank him!" The next morning, at the exact time, the same thing happens, and continuously six days a week (on Friday, two hundred) for years.<br><br>Each of the first few times you can't stop waving and thanking till the car is well out of sight. After a while, though, you put a sign on the door not to knock and you remain annoyed when your order is ignored. You begin to wonder why you don't just get a lump sum. What's all this business with only the hundred bucks a day anyway, and the paper wasted on envelopes? One day the envelope is empty and you're ready to sue the man and forcefully demand your money the next time he has the nerve to show up on your doorstep. It sounds absurd! No?<br><br>No! One of my teachers once said very pithily, "Our definition of nature is repeating miracles", pointing out that the numerical value of "nature" (ha-teva) is the same as the name for G-d, E-lokim (86). When something happens once we call it a miracle. When it happens daily we call it nature. If a baby would be born at the end of a tree limb his picture would fill all the papers. We'd all be completely consumed with the miracle of the "tree-baby". However if kids started popping up on trees all over the world, people would become occupied with spraying and pruning the things to prevent crowding and inconvenience.<br><br>I'm afraid that if the sea would split every day and twice on Saturdays (matinee day) many of us would postpone ever taking the trip to see it indefinitely until it would be too late. Those who will have seen the splitting multiple times will also probably become inured to the event in short order and grow weary of it. However if it only happens once we feel excluded for having missed the big event. What do we do?<br><br>There are certain events that happen once in history, which send out great waves of inspiration like the splitting of the sea. There are other monumental happenings like a wedding whose memory echoes good cheer for an entire life long. Not dissimilar are daily occurrences (like getting an orange in the middle of winter, or eating a slice of bread) which may have passed underneath our radar screen unnoticed, if the Talmud had not given us a clue.<br><br>The splitting of the sea is not more amazing than finding your soul mate which is not less miraculous than a bowl of granola for breakfast. They each demonstrate an intense degree of personal catering to the nuances of our needs. The only difference may be in the magnitude of the celebration, which is in direct proportion to the frequency of the event, yet each gets a song!<br><br>The A-lmighty gives us what we need in the right amounts. Air is more abundant than water, which is more available than food. Our appetite for complaining about the infrequency of so called miraculous events would dissipate instantly if the menu called for breakfast only once in history and every day we'd be forced to endure again and again for lunch -split-sea soup.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Chaim Dovid Green<br>Parshas B'Shalach - Rough Beginnings<br><br>This week's parsha takes place when the Children of Israel were finally released from their extended bondage in Egypt. The nation made their way from Egypt to the Sea of Reeds, where each and every one attained prophesy. In the prophetic Song On The Sea, the nation declared in unison "This is my G-d..." (Exodus 15:2). They could point with their finger and prophetically identify G-d. One might think that this is the pinnacle of one's existence, and the top rung of the ladder of success, but a closer look at the parsha reveals a different standard by which to measure true achievement.<br><br>"And G-d was going before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to illuminate for them to go by day and by night" (Exodus 13:21). Rabbi Shalom Noach Brezovsky, the Slonimer Rebbe, of blessed memory, comments on this verse with a Chasidic explanation. He expresses that "by day" refers to the times when everything is bright, and going well. "By night" refers to times when life is filled with difficulties, and darkness characterizes one's life experiences. The main thing in both situations: "To go by day and by night." One must continue seeking G-d's will in either situation; to ask the question: "what does G-d want from me in this situation?" The emphasis is on having an approach, not panicking, not becoming petrified and unable to cope - to keep going.<br><br>Later in the parsha, after the Children of Israel passed through the Sea of Reeds, they went into the wilderness, and they came to a place called Marah, named after the bitter (mar) water which they found there. The Torah states (Exodus 15:25) "...there He (G-d) gave him (the nation) statutes and judgements, and there He tested him." They were thirsty, and they complained inappropriately. G-d's response; give them laws to learn and observe. "And He said: 'if you will surely listen to the voice of Hashem, your G-d, and you will do what is right in His eyes, and you will hearken to His commandments, and you will guard His statutes, all of the disease which I placed upon Egypt I shall not place upon you, for I am G-d your healer.(Ibid. 15:26).<br><br>The message is: What is there to do when things are going bad? Keep going and immerse oneself in performing commandments.<br><br>Subsequently the Children of Israel find themselves hungering for food. G-d gives them the heavenly Manna. But not so fast. There are laws which go along with it. Don't leave it overnight, and don't go out to collect it on Shabbos.<br><br>Lastly, the parsha focuses on the war with the nation Amalek. The preface to this war is the test of thirst on the national level in a place called Refidim. "(Exodus 17:2-3) And the people fought with Moshe, and they said 'give us water'...and the people complained about Moshe, and they said 'why did you bring us up from Egypt to kill me, and my children, and my livestock with thirst?'"<br><br>The sages say that the name Refidim given to the place is a contraction of the words "Rifyon Yadayim" which means "laxity of hands." The sages explain that the Children of Israel were lax at that time in their study of the laws which they received. They questioned G-d's involvement in every aspect of their lives, and as a result, Amalek attacked them.<br><br>Rashi quotes an analogy to this. A man was out walking with his son on his shoulders. "Father would you please get me this, and would you please get me that? The father willingly complied time after time, while his beloved son was getting a "free ride" safe and sound on his shoulders. A while passed. They went past a fellow on the road, and the boy asked "have you seen my father?" When the father heard that, he took him down from his shoulders, and a dog came and bit him.<br><br>The Children of Israel failed in this test because they were questioning G-d's nearness to them in the situation they found themselves in. "Have you seen my father?" is not the question to ask when you're riding on his shoulders. The approach they should have taken was to plow on and do their part while the problem of water was settled calmly, and with presence of mind,<br><br>The greatness we are capable of reaching is not the result of how elevated we can get at the best times, but rather by being consistent through all the situations we find ourselves in. The prophesy attained at the Sea of Reeds was a gift given to the people at that time of the birth of our nation. However, the subsequent lessons which they learned in those critical beginning months of our nationhood, and taught us, is that true greatness begins and ends with knowledge of Torah, and dedication of one's actions to living up to that knowledge "to go by day and by night."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Cry from the Heart<br>Fear is not a rational thing. Even when the mind knows perfectly well that there is absolutely no danger, sinister shadows strike fear into the heart. As the Jewish people emerging from Egypt saw Pharaoh and his army in pursuit, what should have been their logical reaction?<br><br>They had seen the ten plagues demonstrate the utter powerlessness of the Egyptians to withstand the will of Hashem. They had been liberated from centuries of bondage without lifting a finger in their own defense. What danger then did this pursuing army pose? Clearly, there was none.<br><br>And yet, the Jewish people were terrified. As the fearsome Egyptian chariots surged towards them, they may have understood intellectually that Hashem would render their enemies harmless before they could inflict any damage. But they could not stop themselves from being overcome by a terrible fear. They cried out to Hashem in desperation, and they maligned Moses for having taken them out of Egypt to perish violently beside the sea.<br><br>Beleaguered, Moses tried to reassure the panicked people. Â“Do not be afraid,Â” he called out to them. Â“Stand by and watch Hashem save you. Never again shall you have to see these Egyptians.Â”<br><br>Just then, Hashem said the Moses, Â“Why do you cry out to me? Tell the people to get under way.Â”<br><br>The question immediately arises: If Moses was trying to reassure the terrified Jewish people that they were about to witness the climax of the Egyptian downfall, why did he himself cry out to Hashem? HadnÂ’t his reassurances come from a profound inner conviction?<br><br>Moreover, observe the commentators, we only learn that Moses cried out because Hashem reproved him for it. Why is there no explicit mention in the Torah of Moses crying out to Hashem?<br><br>The commentators explain that MosesÂ’s prayer was not the result of a conscious decision to plead with Hashem. He already knew that the salvation of the Jewish people was assured. Rather, it was a reflex reaction, a spontaneous outburst of supplication in response to the very real distress of the people. Because of his intense love for the Jewish people, Moses could not separate himself from their emotional condition. As the quintessential leader, he felt the anguish of his people, and he responded in kind.<br><br>For this reason, the Torah makes no mention of Moses standing in prayer, since it was not something he had intended to do. But he did it nonetheless, and Hashem chided him for praying when he should be taking bold action.<br><br>A man once came to a doctor with a splinter deeply imbedded in his hand. The doctor saw that the hand had become swollen and infected.<br><br>Â“Now listen, my good fellow,Â” said the doctor. Â“This is going to be quite painful, and I need you to sit perfectly still.Â”<br><br>The man nodded, squeezed his eyes shut, gritted his teeth and began to tap compulsively on the floor with his feet.<br><br>The doctor laid out his instruments, swabbed the puncture clean and began to dig for the splinter.<br><br>Suddenly, the doctor jumped back and screamed, Â“Ouch!Â”<br><br>The manÂ’s eyes flew open, and his foot tapping came to an immediate halt. Â“IÂ’m so sorry, doctor,Â” he said. Â“What did I do? Did I step on your foot? IÂ’m so sorry.Â”<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t worry about it,Â” said the doctor. Â“You didnÂ’t do anything at all. When I pulled out the splinter, I knew how much pain it was causing you, and I could stop myself from crying out.Â”<br><br>In our own lives, we very often see the anguish of others, be they family, friends, acquaintances or even people in the news, and our first tendency is to be judgmental. If these tortured souls were responsible for their own anguish through negligence or foolishness, we may sometimes shut them out of our minds and say, Â“They brought it on themselves. They should have known better.Â” Indeed. But the Torah expects a higher degree of sensitivity. The Torah expects us to empathize with people in distress under all circumstances, to feel their pain, to be inspired to help them out of their predicaments. For in HashemÂ’s eyes, all people deserve to be helped.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God Always Hears<br>"My God will hear me"   (Micah 7:7).<br><br>Friends may be unfaithful, but the LORD will not turn away from the gracious soul; on the contrary, He will hear all its desires. The prophet says, "Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. A man's enemies are the men of his own house." This is a wretched state of affairs; but even in such a case the Best Friend remains true, and we may tell Him all our grief.<br><br>Our wisdom is to look unto the LORD and not to quarrel with men or women. If our loving appeals are disregarded by our relatives, let us wait upon the God of our salvation, for He will hear us- He will hear us all the more because of the unkindness and oppression of others, and we shall soon have reason to cry, "Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy!"<br><br>Because God is the living God, He can hear; because He is a loving God, He will hear; because He is our covenant God, He has bound Him- self to hear us. If we can each one speak of Him as "My God," we may with absolute certainty say, "My God will hear me." Come, then, O bleeding heart, and let thy sorrows tell themselves out to the LORD thy God! I will bow the knee in secret and inwardly whisper, "My God will hear me."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heavenly Escort<br>"And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest"   (Genesis 28:15).<br><br>Do we need journeying mercies? Here are choice ones -- God's presence and preservation, In all places we need both of these, and in all places we shall have them if we go at the call of duty, and not merely according to our own fancy. Why should we look upon removal to another country as a sorrowful necessity when it is laid upon us by the divine will? In all lands the believer is equally a pilgrim and a stranger; and yet in every region the LORD is His dwelling place, even as He has been to His saints in all generations. We may miss the protection of an earthly monarch, but when God says, "I will keep thee," we are in no real danger. This is a blessed passport for a traveler and a heavenly escort for an emigrant.<br><br>Jacob had never left his father's room before; he had been a mother's boy and not an adventurer tike his brother. Yet he went abroad, and God went with him. He had little luggage and no attendants; yet no prince ever journeyed with a nobler bodyguard. Even while he slept in the open field, angels watched over him, and the LORD God spoke to him. If the LORD bids us go, let us say with our LORD Jesus, "Arise, let us go hence."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tears Shall Cease<br>"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes"   (Revelation 21:4).<br><br>Yes, we shall carne to this if we are believers. Sorrow shalt cease, and tears shall be wiped away. This is the world of weeping, but it passes away. There shall be a new heaven and a new earth, so says the first verse of this chapter; and therefore there will be nothing to weep over concerning the Fall and its consequent miseries. Read the second verse and note how it speaks of the bride and her marriage. The Lamb's wedding is a time for boundless pleasure, and tears would be out of place. The third verse says that God Himself will dwell among men; and surely at His right hand there are pleasures forevermore, and tears can no longer flow.<br><br>What will our state be when there will be no more sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain? This will be more glorious than we can as yet imagine. O eyes that are red with weeping, cease your scalding flow, for in a little while ye shall know no more tears! None can wipe tears away like the God of love, but He is coming to do it. "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning." Come, LORD, and tarry not; for now both men and women must weep!<br><br></div>

The curses our LORD took away when He was made a curse for us, but no clause of blessing has been abrogated.<br><br>We are to note and listen to the revealed will of the LORD, giving our attention not to portions of it but to "all these words." There must be no picking and choosing but an impartial respect to all that God has commanded. This is the road of blessedness for the Father and for His children. The LORD's blessing is upon His chosen to the third and fourth generation. If they walk uprightly before Him, He will make all men know that they are a seed which the LORD has blessed. No blessing can come to us or ours through dishonesty or double dealing. The ways of worldly conformity and unholiness cannot bring good to us or ours. It will go well with us when we go well before God. If integrity does not make us prosper, knavery will not. That which gives pleasure to God will bring pleasure to us.<br><br></div>

Those whom God blessed, devils cannot curse.<br><br>Ungodly men, like Balaam, may cunningly plot the overthrow of the LORD's Israel; but with all their secrecy and policy they are doomed to fail. Their powder is damp; the edge of their sword is blunted. They gather together; but as the LORD is not with them, they gather together in vain. We may sit still and let them weave their nets, for we shall not be taken in them. Though they call in the aid of Beelzebub and employ all his serpentine craft, it will avail them nothing: the spells will not work, the divination will deceive them. What a blessing this is! How it quiets the heart! God's Jacobs wrestle with God, but none shall wrestle with them and prevail. God's Israels have to prevail against them. We need not fear the fiend himself, nor any of those secret enemies whose words are full of deceit and whose plans are deep and unfathomable. They cannot hurt those who trust in the living God.

We shall thus escape that endless death which is the doom of sin and gain that everlasting life which is the seal of innocence, the outgrowth of immortal principles of Godlike holiness.
