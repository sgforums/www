            <div class='col-md body'>Psalm 113:7<br>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill.<br><br>A woman sat begging alongside a dirt road. Dozens of people passed her by without even affording her a glance. No one even cared to see that she wasn't begging for herself, but for the child she held tightly in her arms. At last, a young boy passed by and saw the woman. He journeyed home, gathered some food and a blanket, and then he returned to the woman and her child.<br><br>Selfless acts of kindness are the true signs of a Spirit-filled life. We can call ourselves Christians, but our actions must verify the claim. Mary and Joseph begged for help once in Bethlehem. How would we have responded if they had come to us to beg? How we treat people who are in need is Yeshua's criterion for judging how much we love Him. In all ways, we should strive to serve the poor and needy.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Remind me that I merely serve Yeshua when I serve others. Let me serve gladly, without expectation of reward. Teach me to give to others as You give to me. Amen.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Psalm 115:1<br>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.<br><br>Max had worked at the mission for over forty years. There had been weeks on end when he hadn't even gotten to go home. He lived to serve the poor and homeless in his area. When he finally decided to retire, the entire city pitched in to pay him tribute. Throughout the proceedings Max seemed uncomfortable, and finally he stood to speak.<br><br>"I don't want to seem ungrateful, but all this really isn't necessary, and besides, I don't really deserve it. Yahweh is the one who needs to be honored. I have just been fortunate enough that He has used me all these years. I really haven't done anything special. I just did what Yahweh wanted me to."<br><br>It is difficult to set aside our own ego in order to serve Yahweh freely. When all is said and done, however, all that we are able to do is made possible by Yahweh's grace. Our triumphs are Yahweh's triumphs. Like Max, we should feel privileged that Yahweh has chosen to work with and through us.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How to Query God<br>John Piper<br><br>Thoughts on Romans 9:20: You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?" But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, "Why have you made me like this?"<br><br>Clearly Paul was displeased with this response to his teaching about God. Does this mean that itÂ’s always wrong to ask questions in response to Biblical teaching? I donÂ’t think so.<br><br>Paul had said some controversial things. Peter admitted that Paul was sometimes hard to understand: "There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures" (2 Peter 3:16). Paul had said that God "has mercy on whom he wills and hardens whom he wills" (Romans 9:18 ). The point was: his will decides finally whether we are hard-hearted or not. "Before they were born or do anything good or evil" God had mercy on Jacob and gave Esau over to hardness (Romans 9:11-13).<br><br>Someone hears this and objects in verse 19, "Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?" To this Paul responds, "You, a mere human being, have no right to answer back to God."<br><br>The word "answer back" (antapokrinomenos) occurs one other time in the New Testament, namely, in Luke 14:5-6. Jesus is showing the lawyers that it is lawful to heal on the Sabbath. He said to them, "Â‘Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?Â’ And they could not answer back (antapokrithenai) to these things."<br><br>In what sense could they not "answer back"? They could not show him wrong. They could not legitimately criticize him. They could not truly contradict what he said. So the word "answer back" probably carries the meaning: "answer back with a view to criticizing or disagreeing or correcting."<br><br>That, I think, is what displeased Paul in Romans 9:20. This leaves open the possibility that a different kind of question would be acceptable, namely, a humble, teachable question that wants to understand more if possible, but not rebuke or condemn or criticize what has been said.<br><br>For example, in Luke 1:31 the angel Gabriel comes to the virgin Mary and says, "Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus." Mary is astounded and baffled. Virgins donÂ’t have sons. She could have scoffed and argued. But instead she said, "How will this be, since I am a virgin?" (Luke 1:34). She did not say it canÂ’t happen; she asked, "How?"<br><br>Contrast this with GabrielÂ’s visit to Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist. The angel comes and tells him, "Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John" (Luke 1:13). But Zechariah knew that "Elizabeth was barren and advanced in years" (Luke 1:7). Different from Mary, his skepticism gave rise to a different question. He said, "How shall I know this?" Not: "How will you do this?" But: "How can I know youÂ’ll do it?"<br><br>Gabriel did not like this answer. He said, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time" (Luke 1:19-20).<br><br>So I conclude that humble, teachable questions about how and why God does what he does are acceptable to God. To Mary God gave a very helpful answer, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you" (Luke 1:35). This did not remove the mystery, but it helped.<br><br>I canÂ’t remove the mystery from Romans 9. But there may be more to understand than we have seen and I do not want to discourage you from pressing further up and further in to the heart and mind of God.<br><br>Wanting to be teachable with you,<br><br>Pastor John<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Encouragement for Today<br><br>Principle 1<br><br>Â“Flak JacketÂ”<br><br>Susanne Scheppmann, P31 Speaker Team Member, Online Devotional Co-Editor<br><br>Key Verse:<br><br>Ephesians 6:10-11, Â“Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. (NIV)<br><br>Devotion:<br><br>I admit I watch professional bull riding.  It amazes me the courage the young cowboys portray on the backs of those huge bulls.  They grit their teeth and climb aboard the stomping beast.  When the cowboy nods his head, the gate opens and the bull charges out into the arena.  They attempt to stay on for eight seconds. Most are thrown off before the timer sounds.<br><br>Bull riding is dangerous. Many times when they show a close-up, I can see the solid hoof come down on the chest of the ejected rider. Fortunately, most cowboys wear a vest. This vest not only absorbs some of the shock, but it also helps dissipate it over a larger area of the chest.  These flak jackets also protect the rider against being gored by the bullÂ’s horns. They are made from the same material as bulletproof jackets, and work as armor against the brutality of the bull.<br><br>As believers, we need protection too.  1 Peter 5:8 states, Â“Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.Â” (NIV)  We do not have to worry about our enemy though, because God has provided us with the availability of a Â“flak jacket.Â”  It is the armor of God.<br><br>Our Key Verse is found in Ephesians 6.  LetÂ’s look at what we can discover from this chapter concerning our protective gear.<br><br>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore, put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. (Ephesians 6:10-17 NIV)<br><br>With this type of protection, we can be as courageous as any daring bull rider.  Plus, we do not have to attempt to hang on for only eight seconds.  We can stand strong for all eternity.  God tells us, Â“Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.Â” James 4:7 (NIV).  Satan will be like the bull heading for the exit gate.    He will hightail it out when he knows you are bold and dressed for battle.<br><br>So letÂ’s strap on our spiritual flak jackets and get ready for victory.<br><br>My Prayer for Today:<br><br>Dear Lord, I need protection from my enemy.  Teach me to stand firm and to put on the armor of God each day. In JesusÂ’ Name. Amen.<br><br>Application Steps:<br><br>Stand in front of mirror. Read Ephesians 6:10-17 and visualize yourself putting on each piece of the armor of God.  Then stand firm in the power of Holy Spirit.<br><br>Reflection Points:<br><br>Do I understand that I have a spiritual enemy?<br><br>Do I feel unprotected in any area of my spiritual life?<br><br>Do I believe that the armor of God can protect me for all eternity?<br><br>Power Verses:<br><br>Deuteronomy 33:29, Â“Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the Lord? He is your shield and helper and your glorious sword. Your enemies will cower before you, and you will trample down their high places." (NIV)<br><br>Psalm 18:2, Â“The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge.   He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.Â” (NIV)<br><br>Psalm 18:30, Â“As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.Â” (NIV)<br><br>Psalm 28:7, Â“The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped.   My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song.Â” (NIV)<br><br></div>

And be<br>thankful (appreciative), [giving praise to God always].<br>COLOSSIANS 3:15<br><br>IN THE DAYS OF the apostle Paul, the Greek games were ruled by umpires whose word and verdict were final. An umpire's declaration of the breaking of a rule or of the victor ended any debate that might be involved in an event. So too, the peace that comes from your relationship with Jesus Christ is to rule your hearts in all matters. This inner peace is an assured quietness of soul, a calmness of spirit that stands up to the turmoil of life. Whenever you make decisions, if you think it is a good idea to go ahead you also need to let your heart speak. If you do not sense an inner peace from Christ you should not move ahead.Always be at peace with Christ in your heart and you will be able to meet life with joy and a quiet trust that overcomes.<br><br>Dave Meyer</div>

No one comes to the Father except through Me.Â”<br><br>Â—John 14:6<br><br>We are often asked, Â“How can you Christians say that Jesus is the only way to heaven?   How can you actually make such a statement?  That is so narrow.  That is so insensitive.Â”<br><br>We live in a pluralistic society, and I am glad that people of different cultures, nations, and even religious beliefs can come to this country and practice their faith as they choose to.  That is one of the great things about the United States of America.<br><br>But this global community says that there really are no differences between us, that we are all one.  And this kind of fuzzy, feel-good thinking sometimes finds its way into the church.  But letÂ’s not get sucked into this vortex in which everything blends together.  LetÂ’s remember the unique claims of Christ and statements of the Bible.<br><br>The Bible asserts that Jesus Christ is the only way to the Father.  Jesus said, Â“I am the way, the truth, and the life.   No one comes to the Father except through MeÂ” (John 14:6). He said what He meant and He meant what He said.  And if I say anything less, then I am not honestly representing the God who forgave me of my sins.<br><br>The Bible teaches that God created man in His own image, loves us, and wants to have a personal relationship with us. The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for our sins, and if we will turn from our sin and follow Him, then we can be forgiven and know that we are going to heaven.<br><br>He has given us His message, and we are not to add to it.

One day, his son was arrested for drunken driving.  The courtroom was filled with people who wanted to see if Hanging Bob would be consistent in the way he meted out justice.  A hush fell across the room as Hanging Bob pounded down his gavel and said, Â“Guilty.Â” Just as he always did, he had given out the harshest penalty.<br><br>But then that same judge laid down his gavel, took off his robe, and descended from the bench.  He turned to the courtroom and said, Â“As a judge, I have done my job and enforced the law.  Now, as a father, I will pay the fine for him.Â”<br><br>God, in His justice, gave us the standard: When we sin, we break GodÂ’s law and have to face the penalty.  But the same God sent His Son to die on the crossÂ—to be tortured and killedÂ—because His righteous requirement had to be dealt with.   God said, Â“Though you are the offender, though you deserve what you would get, I love you so much that I placed the penalty upon My Son.  Now He has paid the price.  If you will turn to Me by faith, realize that My Son died for you, and will follow Him, then you can join Me in heaven.Â”<br><br>Yet if you reject GodÂ’s gracious offer, if you spurn His forgiveness, then you have charted your own course.

            <div class='col-md body'>On Location - Made in the Shade<br>by Ed Young<br><br>Therefore encourage one another and build each other up... (1 Thessalonians 5:11).<br><br>As we begin to understand who we are in God's eyes, to truly see ourselves the way God sees us, he gives us the awesome responsibility of giving that same SIGHT to others.  The Bible tells us that we should build up the self-esteem of others, so that they too can see themselves in the light of God's love for them.  And putting on the right "shades" is the key to really seeing both ourselves and others from God's perspective.  With spiritually-filtered lenses on our minds and hearts, God gives us special S-I-G-H-T to be able to build others up in Christ.<br>S-upport the Uniqueness of Others: Instead of trying to remake others into your mold, encourage their unique personalities, skills, and talents. (1 Corinthians 13:5, NLT)<br>I-nspire Others with Responsibility: When you trust others with responsibility, it will put wind in their sails and give them confidence to accomplish even greater things. (John 20:21)<br>G-ive Correction and Criticism Carefully: "Carefully" is the keyword.  The purpose of correcting someone is for their growth, so criticism should be given in love, to help and not hurt them. (Ephesians 4:29)<br>H-ear the Messages of Others: Listening, really listening, to someone can be one of the biggest boosters to their self-esteem.  Your eye-contact and interest in what they have to say communicates love and respect. (James 1:19)<br>T-ouch their Hearts: When you give integrity-laden, meaningful touch to the significant others in your life, you are communicating just how significant they really are.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stop and Smell the Roses<br>For reading &amp; meditation - Matthew 6:25-34<br>"... Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow ..." (v. 28, RSV)<br><br>Another principle that helps us cope with stress is this: Seek to overcome any rigidity in your personality. You can best understand rigidity by comparing it with its opposite - flexibility. A more formal definition of rigidity is this: "The inability or refusal to change one's actions or attitudes even though objective conditions indicate that a change is desirable." The rigid person clings to certain ways of thinking and acting, even when they are injurious to the personality and burn up their emotional energy. Someone described it as similar to driving a car with the brakes on. Take the housewife who worries herself into a migraine attack because she cannot maintain a scrupulously tidy home while her grandchildren are visiting. Or the businessman who triggers off another gastric ulcer because he falls behind with his schedule when his secretary is away sick. Inflexible goals can be crippling fetters. It's no good saying, "But there are things that have to be done, and if I don't do them, they just won't get done." Perhaps you need to rearrange your priorities, adjust your lifestyle and learn to say Ono." As someone put it, "We must not drive so relentlessly forward that we cannot stop and smell the roses by the wayside." You may be caught up in the midst of one of the busiest weeks of your year, but pause for a moment and ask yourself: am I driving, or am I being driven? Am I in control of my personality, or is it in control of me? Today, decide to take a step away from rigidity by pausing to "smell a rose."<br><br>Selwyn Hughes</div>

The LORD is good and rightÂ” (Ps. 25:7Â–8 ).<br>Â“Taste and see that the LORD is goodÂ” (Ps. 34:8 NIV).<br><br>God is a good God. We must begin here. Though we donÂ’t understand his actions, we can trust his heart.<br><br>God does only what is good. But how can death be good? Some mourners donÂ’t ask this question. When the quantity of years has outstripped the quality of years, we donÂ’t ask how death can be good.<br><br>But the father of the dead teenager does. The thirty-year-old widow does. How could death be good?<br><br>In GodÂ’s plan every life is long enough and every death is timely. And though you and I might wish for a longer life, God knows better.<br><br>AndÂ—this is importantÂ—though you and I may wish a longer life for our loved ones, they donÂ’t. Ironically, the first to accept GodÂ’s decision of death is the one who dies.<br><br>While we are shaking heads in disbelief, they are lifting hands in worship. While we are mourning at a grave, they are marveling at heaven. While we are questioning God, they are praising God.<br><br>But, Max, what of those who die with no faith? My husband never prayed. My grandpa never worshiped. My mother never opened a Bible, much less her heart. What about the one who never believed?<br><br>How do we know he didnÂ’t?<br><br>Who among us is privy to a personÂ’s final thoughts? Who among us knows what transpires in those final moments? Are you sure no prayer was offered? Eternity can bend the proudest knees. Could a person stare into the yawning canyon of death without whispering a plea for mercy? And could our God, who is partial to the humble, resist it?<br><br>He couldnÂ’t on Calvary. The confession of the thief on the cross was both a first and final one. But Christ heard it. Christ received it. Maybe you never heard your loved one confess Christ, but whoÂ’s to say Christ didnÂ’t?<br><br>We donÂ’t know the final thoughts of a dying soul, but we know this. We know our God is a good God. He is Â“not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentanceÂ” (2 Pet. 3:9 NKJV). He wants your loved one in heaven more than you do. And he usually gets what he wants.<br><br></div>

The reason people do not come to the light is that they do not want their darkness, their sin, to be exposed.  Â“For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposedÂ” (John 3:20).<br><br>What is the worst sin you can commit?  Murder?  Adultery?  Stealing?  Lying?  No.  The worst sin you can commit is to say no to GodÂ’s offer of forgiveness.  Because when you stand before God Almighty on that final day, it is not going to be the sin question, it will be the Son question.  By that I mean, God is not going to say, Â“You did a really great job.  I am going to let you in to heaven.Â”   God is not going to say, Â“You went over your sin quota, and because of that, IÂ’m not going to let you in.Â”   ThatÂ’s not it at all.  It is not a sin issue; itÂ’s a Son issue.<br><br>You may have committed sins your entire life and have been a wicked person, but if in the end you were to come to your senses and say, Â“Jesus Christ, come into my heart and forgive me,Â” then God would let you into heaven.  Because the big issue will be what you did with Jesus Christ.<br><br>The only way that we will get into heaven is because of what Jesus Christ did for us.  Think of the greatest men and women of God that you know.  They are not going to go to heaven because of their accomplishments or because of their gifts.  They are going to get there because they accepted what God did for them when His blood was shed at the cross.<br><br>We all go to heaven in the same way.   And it will be the Son issue in that final day.<br><br>Ps Greg Laurie</div>

They who have received most grace from God are able to bear most afflictions from God. Affliction does not hit the saint by chance, but by direction. God does not draw His bow at a venture.

            <div class='col-md body'>Deception of practicing the TM Meditation Program,<br>The TM-Siddhi Techniques &amp; Yoga<br>Testimony of Teri Johnson<br><br>In March of 1976, I began practicing TM or the Transcendental Meditation Program as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.  A few years later I paid $3000 to learn the Yoga Sutras and faithfully practiced the TM-Sidhi Program until November, 1991 when God Almighty out of His Great Love, Power &amp; Mercy pulled me out of the Occult through Benny HinnÂ’s Ministry.<br>As a young girl I would fall asleep in church.  Knowledge without an encounter with God is just plain old yucky Â“religion.Â”  My parents, at the time unsaved, gave me a quigi board and a magic-set for Christmas.  I put them to good use. The demonic realm of the spirit began to open up to me.<br>In my early 20Â’s I attended an introductory lecture on TM. For years I was in a sexual relationship with the local TM leader and for a short time my home was used for the Center of this movement in my city.  I had many friends who were TM Teachers and some of the leaders of this movement were guests in my home. My best-girl friend, Lori, a TM teacher, committed a successful, planned suicide by shooting herself in the head. She believed the lie of Â“reincarnationÂ” that she would get to come back in another body and try it again until she became enlightenedÂ”<br><br>As a young lady I was in a stressful sales job. Some of the Â“benefitsÂ” the TM Technique promised me was clearer thinking, better health, more energy, getting rid of stress, causing the weather to improve, reversing the aging process, increasing my intelligence and brain to its full potential, reduction of crime in my city, and creating world peace.<br><br>At first I was hesitant to start TM because of my religious upbringing.  MaharishiÂ’s appearance as a Hindu monk scared me.  However, after having dinner with the local TM teacher and being given a flyer of a religious leader who taught TM at Notre Dame HS, I thought, surely this must be okay if the these religious leaders are doing TM.  Later, as my involvement with this cult increased, I attended several Â“residence courses.Â”  Some were held at a Christian religious retreat house in California. The Christian leaders would cook our food, and I thought I was so Â“holy.Â”  I did not have a clue at all of what evil I had opened myself to.<br><br>A few years later I paid a fee of $3000 to learn more powerful techniques like Â“yogic-flying.Â”  Some will say, this was just Â“bouncing aroundÂ” but the Lord let me know that demonic-power was lifting my body off the ground. I was also taught other advanced techniques (for a price) of invisibility, changing the weather, and walking through walls.<br><br>I was taught breathing exercises and yoga positions to practice daily which opened my body up to even more demons.  Many innocent people learn these techniques at the local YMCA or local church. They do not have a clue to the evil doors that are being opened up and the demonic contamination of the gateways of our senses.<br><br>According to the official TM website as of today over 6 million people have learned this technique which now has a price tag of $2500.  The price tag is a lot steeper than that.  Personally, I became depressed, suicidal and loaded up with many, many demons.<br><br>The TM movement boasts of over 600 scientific research studies at more than 200 universities including Harvard, UCLA and Stanford.  Today, according to the official TM website, if you are a Veteran &amp; suffering with Â“Post-Traumatic Stress-Disorder,Â” with authorization from your Medical Doctor, the Veterans Benefits Administration will pay the fee for you to start TM. People who get involved in this TM cross all belief systems.  You are told it is not a religion because you do not have to believe anything for the technique to work.<br>TM is Hinduism.<br><br>Maharishi claims to be an instrument to usher in the Â“age of enlightenment.Â” In reality TM is a tool in SatanÂ’s hand to usher in the Â“One World GovernmentÂ” and Â“One World ReligionÂ” preparing the way and pointing to the appearance of the Â“Anti-ChristÂ”.<br><br>Millions of people have entered into this TM Movement with naÃ¯ve and well-meaning intentions. Some just wanted to get rid of stress.<br>I have forgiven all those involved in my deception including the leaders of this movement and even Maharishi himself.<br><br>Because of my experience with TM I have a new understanding of Matthew 24:24. Â“For there shall arise false ChristÂ’s &amp; false prophets &amp; shall show great signs &amp; wonders insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.Â”<br><br>Only by the Amazing Grace of Jesus, the Great Love of Abba Father, and the Power of the Precious Holy Spirit was I set free. God used the ministry of Benny Hinn, his book Â“Good Morning Holy SpiritÂ” for my initial encounter with The Holy Spirit and the start of much needed deliverance prayer. God used Johanna MichaelsenÂ’s book Â“Beautiful Side of EvilÂ” to explain to me how I could be so deceived and blinded by the evil Â“Angel of LightÂ”.<br><br>My heartÂ’s desire is that many will have a powerful encounter with the one and only true God, be saved, healed, and completely set free by The Lord of Lords, The King of Kings, Jesus Christ</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>RIGHTING WRONGS </strong><br>by Neil Anderson<br><br>John 15:8<br>By this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples<br><br>How can you know if you're being led by the Spirit or the flesh? Very simple: Look at your behavior. If you respond to a given situation by exercising love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control, you are following the Spirit's lead (Galatians 5:22, 23). If your reactions and responses reflect the deeds of the flesh listed in Galatians 5:19-21, you are following the flesh.<br><br>What do you do when you discover you are not walking by the Spirit? Acknowledge it for what it is. You have consciously or unconsciously chosen to live independently of God by walking according to the flesh. Walking according to the Spirit is a moment-by-moment, day-by-day experience. Acknowledge your sin to God, seek the forgiveness of anyone you may have offended, receive forgiveness, and be filled with the Spirit.<br><br>Here are a couple of things to consider when you are faced with righting fleshly wrongs.<br><br>First, the scope of your confession should only be as broad as the scope of your offense. If you lashed out at a relative with angry words, you need only confess to God and that relative. If you entertain a secret, lustful thought or proud attitude without any overt, offensive behavior, you need only confess it to God. Confession literally means to agree with God. When you recognize an internal fleshly response, immediately acknowledge it in your mind. That's it; just agree with God and walk in the light.<br><br>Second, the process of restoring a relationship through confession and forgiveness is a step of spiritual growth. Your role as a spouse, parent, friend, coworker, or fellow-Christian is to model growth, not perfection. If you're trying to keep up a front of Christian perfection in order to encourage saints and win sinners, forget it; it will never happen. But when you openly admit and ask forgiveness for your fleshly choices, you model the kind of spiritual growth which will touch saints and sinners alike.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Lord, I sometimes walk according to the flesh. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit so the fruit of the Spirit will be evident in my life today.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE VIEW FROM THE CROSS </strong><br><br>Matthew 16:25, 26<br>Whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake shall find it. For what will a man be profited, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul?<br><br>Three guidelines from these verses summarize the view from the cross, which we must adopt to counteract the self-centered worldview promoted by the god of this world.<br><br>First, we must sacrifice the lower life to gain the higher life. If you want to save your natural life (i.e., find your identity and sense of self-worth in positions, titles, accomplishments and possessions and seek only worldly well-being), you will lose it. At best you can only possess these temporal values for a lifetime, only to lose everything for eternity.<br><br>Furthermore, in all your efforts to possess these earthly treasures, you will fail to gain all that can be yours in Christ. Shoot for this world and that's all you'll get, and eventually you will lose even that. But shoot for the next world and God will throw in the benefits of knowing Him in this present life as well. Paul put it this way: "Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness; for bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come" (1 Timothy 4:7, 8 ).<br><br>Second, sacrifice the pleasure of things to gain the pleasure of life. What would you accept in trade for the fruit of the Spirit in your life? What material possession, what amount of money, what position or title would you exchange for the love, joy, peace and patience that you enjoy in Christ? "Nothing," we all probably agree. Victory over self comes as we learn to love people and use things instead of using people and loving things.<br><br>Third, sacrifice the temporal to gain the eternal. Possibly the greatest sign of spiritual maturity is the ability to postpone rewards. It is far better to know that we are the children of God than to gain anything that the world calls valuable. Even if following Christ results in hardships in this life, He will make it right in eternity.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Heavenly Father, You alone are God. Help me to choose the higher life today instead of seeking the pleasures of this world.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What Is Yahweh Doing in My Life?<br><br>Lean on, trust in, and be confident in the Lord with all your heart and mind and do not rely on your own insight or understanding.<br>Â—Proverbs 3:5<br><br>Do you find yourself saying, "Hashem, what are You doing in my life?"<br><br>Confusion occurs when we try to figure out what we do not understand. As believers, we have a unique privilege, which is to remain in peace even when we do not understand what has happened, what is happening, or what is going to happen in the future. We can be content to know the One Who knows, even if we do not know the answer ourselves. We serve the All-Knowing Yahweh Who keeps one eye on us all the time. Yahweh is never surprised; He knows everything before it happens.<br><br>We should grow in trust not questions. We are generally more concerned with temporal things, and Yahweh is concerned with eternal things. Something may be Yahweh's will for us, but not His perfect timing. We must learn to wait on Him.<br><br>I had to learn early to lean on, trust in, and be confident in the Lord. Through experience, I have learned to say, "Yahweh, I do not know what You are doing, but I am sure You do. I trust You."<br><br>Trust Yahweh and by doing so you will maintain your peace.<br><br>Say This:<br>"Hashem has a good plan for my life. I choose to trust and wait on Him even when I don't understand what He is doing."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>His Temptation and Ours</strong><br><br>We do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin Â—Hebrews 4:15<br><br>Until we are born again, the only kind of temptation we understand is the kind mentioned in James 1:14, "Each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed." But through regeneration we are lifted into another realm where there are other temptations to face, namely, the kind of temptations our Lord faced. The temptations of Jesus had no appeal to us as unbelievers because they were not at home in our human nature. Our LordÂ’s temptations and ours are in different realms until we are born again and become His brothers. The temptations of Jesus are not those of a mere man, but the temptations of God as Man. Through regeneration, the Son of God is formed in us (see Galatians 4:19 ), and in our physical life He has the same setting that He had on earth. Satan does not tempt us just to make us do wrong thingsÂ— he tempts us to make us lose what God has put into us through regeneration, namely, the possibility of being of value to God. He does not come to us on the premise of tempting us to sin, but on the premise of shifting our point of view, and only the Spirit of God can detect this as a temptation of the devil.<br><br>Temptation means a test of the possessions held within the inner, spiritual part of our being by a power outside us and foreign to us. This makes the temptation of our Lord explainable. After JesusÂ’ baptism, having accepted His mission of being the One "who takes away the sin of the world" ( John 1:29 ) He "was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness" ( Matthew 4:1 ) and into the testing devices of the devil. Yet He did not become weary or exhausted. He went through the temptation "without sin," and He retained all the possessions of His spiritual nature completely intact.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is There Good in Temptation?<br><br>No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man . . . Â—1 Corinthians 10:13<br><br>The word temptation has come to mean something bad to us today, but we tend to use the word in the wrong way. Temptation itself is not sin; it is something we are bound to face simply by virtue of being human. Not to be tempted would mean that we were already so shameful that we would be beneath contempt. Yet many of us suffer from temptations we should never have to suffer, simply because we have refused to allow God to lift us to a higher level where we would face temptations of another kind.<br><br>A personÂ’s inner nature, what he possesses in the inner, spiritual part of his being, determines what he is tempted by on the outside. The temptation fits the true nature of the person being tempted and reveals the possibilities of his nature. Every person actually determines or sets the level of his own temptation, because temptation will come to him in accordance with the level of his controlling, inner nature.<br><br>Temptation comes to me, suggesting a possible shortcut to the realization of my highest goalÂ— it does not direct me toward what I understand to be evil, but toward what I understand to be good. Temptation is something that confuses me for a while, and I donÂ’t know whether something is right or wrong. When I yield to it, I have made lust a god, and the temptation itself becomes the proof that it was only my own fear that prevented me from falling into the sin earlier.<br><br>Temptation is not something we can escape; in fact, it is essential to the well-rounded life of a person. Beware of thinking that you are tempted as no one else--what you go through is the common inheritance of the human race, not something that no one has ever before endured. God does not save us from temptations--He sustains us in the midst of them (see Hebrews 2:18 and Hebrews 4:15-16 ).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Praying to Yahweh in Secret<br><br>When you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place . . . Â—Matthew 6:6<br><br>The primary thought in the area of religion isÂ— keep your eyes on Yahweh, not on people. Your motivation should not be the desire to be known as a praying person. Find an inner room in which to pray where no one even knows you are praying, shut the door, and talk to Yahweh in secret. Have no motivation other than to know your Father in heaven. It is impossible to carry on your life as a disciple without definite times of secret prayer.<br><br>"When you pray, do not use vain repetitions . . ." ( Matthew 6:7 ). Yahweh does not hear us because we pray earnestlyÂ— He hears us solely on the basis of redemption. Yahweh is never impressed by our earnestness. Prayer is not simply getting things from YahwehÂ— that is only the most elementary kind of prayer. Prayer is coming into perfect fellowship and oneness with Yahweh. If the Son of Yahweh has been formed in us through regeneration (see Galatians 4:19 ), then He will continue to press on beyond our common sense and will change our attitude about the things for which we pray.<br><br>"Everyone who asks receives . . ." (Matthew 7:8 ). We pray religious nonsense without even involving our will, and then we say that Yahweh did not answerÂ— but in reality we have never asked for anything. Yeshua said, ". . . you will ask what you desire. . ." ( John 15:7 ). Asking means that our will must be involved. Whenever Yeshua talked about prayer, He spoke with wonderful childlike simplicity. Then we respond with our critical attitude, saying, "Yes, but even Yeshua said that we must ask." But remember that we have to ask things of Yahweh that are in keeping with the Yahweh whom Yeshua revealed.<br><br></div>
