            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br><strong>Born Of Clarity </strong><br><br>"I shall give him My covenant, Peace." (Bamidbar 25:12)<br><br>If I hadn't lived through recent history I would think it strange to award a "peace prize" to someone who had just carried out such a punishing act as Pinchas did. His approach to achieving peace was not a passive one. What new angle or definition of peace can we extract from the seemingly cruel way in which Pinchas was able to distinguish himself?<br><br>Commenting on the statement "Talmud scholars bring peace to the world!"(Tractate Brochos), the Maharsha offers a fascinating description of the dynamics of that process. How is it that those, whose hot pursuit of small points and obsession with detail brings them into constant conflict are titled as the princes of peace in the world? Sometimes it may seem just the opposite is more true.<br><br>He explains, that just as the sum of a person's livelihood for an entire year is determined on Rosh HaShana, so are the number of wars to be fought in the world set at that time. Let's say that it was decreed that one hundred thousand battles have to be played out in this world in a given year. That sounds terrible and it is in fact a potentially perilous state of affairs.<br><br>One fine morning two old Talmudic lions arise from their sleep and arrive in the study hall armed with their holy books and alert minds.<br><br>(If you've ever had the honor to witness the process of learning that goes on in a conventional Yeshiva- study hall, the first thing that you notice is the noise. It is nothing like the ubiquitous public library, whose librarian is prepared to revoke your card if your hush puppies squeak too loudly on the newly polished floors.)<br><br>Here, disagreements are constantly erupting. It's hard to hear one's thoughts and yet the thought process is in high gear in that unlikely place.<br><br>Now these two scholars who happen to be facing off roar, snap, and bite away at each other's point of view until some complete conclusion is arrived at, besides lunch. Because of this fearsome fight for the truth, because they were motivated to discover "what" is right and not distracted by the ego concern of "who" is right, one less war on the horrific battlefields of the world needs to be fought. That deduction in the totality of human destruction is a magnificent contribution to the peace of the world.<br><br>Rabbi Samson Rafael Hirsch writes, "Only falsehood is in need of many supporters to win the day; falsehood must have the authority of numbers what it lacks in justification. Truth, by contrast will always prevail, even if it takes time. Noble, courageous, and pure, expressed with all the fiery zeal of conviction and with all the clarity of sure awareness, stated again and again at every opportunity, truth will ultimately gain respect and admiration even of those who do not accept it. The only truth that can be lost beyond recall is that truth whose adherents no longer have the courage to speak up candidly on its behalf. Truth has never gone down to defeat as a result of opposition, it has done so only when its friends are too weak to defend it."<br><br>Commenting on the words of the prophet, "You shall love truth and peace! (Zachariah 8:19) Rabbi Hirsch wrote, "For peace is not a father of truth; peace is a child of truth. Win the people for truth, inalienable truth that can never be sold, not for the price of peace, when sacred causes are involved, and then true everlasting peace will follow by itself."<br><br>Pinchas was not out hunting for a popular prize. He took a lonely path. He acted with uncompromising, even brutal honesty. In the face of confusion and opposition he carried out the hard line of the law. That moment of truth, as cruel as it might seem, because it set the value unmistakably straight, saved more than it destroyed, and is forever to be regarded as a supreme act of peace...born of clarity.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tisha B'Av - A Day of Rebuilding </strong><br><br>Rabbi Label Lam<br>"There is nothing that solidifies and strengthens a nation like the reading of the nation's own history, whether that history is recorded in books or embodied in customs, institutions or monuments." (Joseph Anderson)<br><br>"A generation which ignores history has no past and no future." (Robert A. Henlein)<br><br>"That men do not learn much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons that history has to teach." (Aldus Huxley)<br><br>"A nation that mourns for its temple for more than 1700 years deserves to see it rebuilt." (Napoleon to the Jews of France after inquiring about their practice of mourning on the 9th of Av)<br><br>The 9th of the Hebrew month Av will soon observed. It is a fast day, and a day of mourning for the 1st and 2nd Temples, 2,500 and 2000 years ago respectively, which were located on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, as well as other Jewish tragedies which are connected to this day<br><br>A story stranger than fiction from a few short years ago left me with a feeling of shock and comfort in one moment. A close acquaintance of mine who neither knows or cares much about Jewish history or custom called me a few days after the 9th of Av. He was distraught about a few things and so I lent him my ear.<br><br>He was in the middle of planning a move to the western U.S. for business reasons. He needed to sell his house in the New York area and buy a house "out west". He had already gone to contract on his new home in the new location but the whole deal was hanging on the sale of his house here in New York. He couldn't afford to buy one until he had effectively sold the other.<br><br>On the 9th of Av, he received a call from the lawyer of a hopeful buyer of his N.Y. house. Apparently, they had no real serious intent to buy the house, and were now casually backing out of an imminent closing based on some technical breach.<br><br>My friend was devastated. He elaborated on his righteous indignation at having been misled and the great set back he was now enduring because of this sudden disappointment. Then, after a long tirade at the conclusion of his monologue he calmly apologized for all the venting and excused his hostile attitude by saying the following amazing words, "I feel like I've lost not just one house but two houses, sorry for all the lamentations!"<br><br>He didn't know it was the 9th of Av that this news came to him nor did he know that the book Lamentations is the English Language name for the book Eichah that is read in Synagogue on the 9th of Av. I was amazed by the innocence of his words and comforted by the fact that there is a present reality to the day, and rhythm to history.<br><br>When tragedy or disappointment is manifest, be it on a grandiose or microscopic scale, the biggest part of the pain is the nagging lack of sense. If the bigger picture somehow comes into view, then the stinger of cynicism is removed and the seed of hope begins to take root. Hope, that just as a parent (as the name of the month indicates - Av - Hebrew for "father" ) punishes with love for the purpose of improvement, the same purpose is behind Jewish suffering and tragedy. There is hope for the future.<br><br>When the Jews of Spain saw that their expulsion in 1492 was on the 9th of Av, they were on a certain level able to take great comfort. In the midst of the bad is buried good. Assured that evil is not random and life is not ultimately chaotic, we can even live with unanswered questions. We learn trust and hope through the study and living of Jewish History. Even though on the 9th of Av we lost both Houses of G-d, and suffered unforgettable tragedy, when we lament, we are intimately attached to our history and can honestly hope for a day of rebuilding.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.<br><br>Elijah and Moses were men of great zeal. They were passionate about their causes. Moses sought to free the Hebrews from the tyranny of slavery by killing an Egyptian with his own hand. Elijah, after calling down fire on the evil prophets of Baal, found himself spent physically and emotionally to the point he asked God to take his life.<br><br>Immediately after these two events, 500 years apart from one another, both men were led to the same Mount Horeb, the mountain of God. In Hebrew, Horeb means "desolation." This barren environment mirrored the condition of Moses and Elijah. For Moses, it was 40 years of barrenness. For Elijah, it was 40 days without food. Elijah became tired of standing alone for God.<br><br>As businesspeople we often become so focused on the goal we forget to meet God at our own Mount Horeb. This was the place God met both Moses and Elijah. It was a place of renewal, a place of new beginnings, a place of personal encounter with the living God.<br><br>Perhaps Elijah's greatest virtue was his zeal. Indeed, we shall see that twice in his communication with God, Elijah speaks of having been "very zealous" for the Lord. But zeal, unattended eventually becomes its own God; it compels us toward expectations, which are unrealistic, and outside the timing and anointing of God.<br><br>To remain balanced, zeal must be reined in and harnessed by strategic encounters with the living God. We otherwise become frustrated with people and discouraged with delays. We step outside our place of strength and spiritual protection. Many of us become so consumed with our battles that we are no longer aware of the presence of Jesus. We have been traveling in our own strength.

It takes something to make a mountain sing; and yet the prophet summons quite a choir of them.

May we not also make mountains of difficulty, and trial, and mystery, and labor become occasions for praise unto our God?

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Getting Answers</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Shlomo Jarcaig<br>As a result of Pinchas' standing up for G-d's honor, the Torah testifies to his reward: "And it shall be for him and his offspring after him a covenant of eternal priesthood..." (Bamidbar/Numbers 25:13)<br><br>Rashi explains that even though the priesthood had already been given to the offspring of Aaron, it had only been given to Aaron, his sons, and the progeny they would bear after their anointing. Pinchas, a grandson of Aaron already born at the time of the anointing (thus expressly excluded from those to be anointed at that time), did not become a Kohen (priest) until more than 38 years later, after he sanctified the Divine name by killing Zimri. If G-d wanted Pinchas to be a Kohen, why did he not anoint him with Aaron and his sons? Why did this righteous person have to be put into the circumstance that his entire family - including his younger brothers - were Kohanim who could perform the Divine Service while he could not, even though he was truly deserving of this honor?<br><br>The Shulchan Aruch (Code of Jewish Law) states that a person should accustom himself to saying, "Everything G-d does is for the best." Even though there are many situations and events in life that we do not understand, G-d has precise calculations and reasoning for each event in everyone's life. In fact, the Talmud (Shabbos 105b) compares one who acts out of anger to an idol worshipper because a person only becomes angry as a result of the frustration that the course of life is not as he would like it to be. If he had completely embraced the belief that G-d designed the world in a way that everything is for his best - especially the times of challenge - he would realize that these things should not upset him. His anger is, in a sense, disputing G-d, a quasi-idolatrous practice.<br><br>Rabbi Gedaliah Schorr (1) notes that if a Kohen kills someone, he is not allowed to perform the Divine Service (2). Only because Pinchas was not yet a Kohen when he killed Zimri did he not invalidate himself from the Divine Service. When Pinchas killed Zimri, it was on behalf of and for the good of the Jewish people; nevertheless, it was not a role a Kohen could fulfill. Yet, because Pinchas did this with the purest of intentions - to atone for the sins of the nation - he demonstrated that he possessed the attributes of an ideal Kohen and was rewarded by being given that charge. And only G-d, Who in His timelessness possesses a breadth of perspective no human can fathom, put Pinchas at each stage of his life in the circumstance that was then the best for him. Pinchas, instead of lamenting his lot, appreciated and took advantage of each of the unique opportunities with which he was presented.<br><br>In our own experience, there will be times we will have a glimpse of an answer to one of the "Why?" questions that bother us, sometimes it will take a couple of months, sometimes a couple of years, sometimes - like Pinchas - a half a lifetime...and many times it will not come at all. But our not knowing why does not change the fact that G-d loves us and custom tailors our life's circumstances for our betterment.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Peace Not Pieces</strong><br><br>"Pinchas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aharon the Priest, has turned away My anger from the children of Israel, by being zealous for My vengeance amongst them; and [thus] I did not destroy the children of Israel in My vengeance. Therefore, I say, behold I give to him My Covenant of Peace." [25:11-12]<br><br>Pinchas killed two people while they were committing a sin together, and yet he was given the Covenant of Peace. It seems contradictory to us; why should killing someone be considered an act of peace, or be rewarded with peace?<br><br>Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch answers that peace can only be maintained when we are at peace with G-d. Pinchas restored that Peace. What Pinchas did may not have been peaceful, but it restored Peace.<br><br>Rabbi Zev Leff, Rav of Moshav Matisyahu, goes still further. He says that our conception of peace is very much mistaken. What Pinchas did, fighting evil on G-d's behalf, was itself peaceful. Fighting is not inherently evil; it depends what the fight is about!<br><br>If you have spent time in a university library, then you know it is a quiet place -- very quiet. The silence is strictly enforced, and anyone speaking in a normal voice will be told that he or she is "disturbing the peace."<br><br>If, on the other hand, you have entered a Bais Medrash, a traditional House of Study, then you know the opposite is true. When the windows are open, you can tell the difference from a block away! From the outside you would imagine that everyone was fighting, and, of course, you would be right. But at the same time, you will find inside a level of camaraderie rarely duplicated elsewhere -- certainly far exceeding that found in the average university. War and Peace coexist.<br><br>Rabbi Leff then brings the point home, quite literally. People imagine, he says (and we know), that "Shalom Bayis," peace in the home, refers to a house where people never raise their voices, where bliss and serenity reign. This, he says, is not Shalom Bayis -- this is a cemetery!<br><br>There is harmony and unity, he says, when both partners are thinking about what is best for the home, what is best for the entire unit. There can be strong, even "violent" differences of opinion about what is best, but when everyone is working towards the same goal, then there is peace.<br><br>This is crucial, because we imagine that our neighbors have this sort of peace, and believe that we don't. Not so, says Rabbi Leff. This is crucial, because we may worry and nurse our wounds until we are no longer thinking about the unit, but ourselves alone -- and then peace is truly absent.<br><br>The motivations of Pinchas were entirely pure and holy, to such an extent that he could even kill for peace. We, of course, can never approach that level. But if we are motivated by our concern for the unit -- be it the family, the community, or the Nation of Israel -- then we can argue, and still enjoy true Peace.<br><br>Good Shabbos,<br>Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br></div>

Â“I have to go through all this rigmarole just to get to bed without an argument. I turn off the engine and coast into the driveway; I take off my shoes and tiptoe into the house; I make my way through the darkness and I undress outside the bedroom door.

Six of those covenants were made with Old Testament figures: Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and David. The seventh was made with His own Son, Jesus Christ. God is always the strongest partner in a covenant relationship.<br><br>God made a covenant with Noah in order to preserve the human race. This covenant involved Noah's participation by building an ark. He'd never built an ark before. He'd never had a boat. It was a totally new concept to Noah and the rest of the world. Why would he need a boat in a dry land?<br><br>Noah did not have to invent the ark; God gave him the plans-in specific dimensional detail. He did not have to gather the animals-God led them into the ark. God even closed the door when they all came on board. God made it rain to prove why the ark was needed.<br><br>The covenant provided all Noah needed to complete his mission in life. When God spoke to Noah to do this thing, he needed only to respond to God's call to do it. Noah could rest in knowing the covenant made with God was going to be fulfilled if he fulfilled his part.<br><br>If you have entered into a covenant relationship with God, you too can be assured that God will uphold His part of the covenant relationship. He is committed to fulfilling His covenant with you and to fulfill His purposes in and through your life. It only requires one thing on your part-obedience. He will even provide grace and faith to you to help you fulfill your part of the covenant.<br><br>Each of us has a covenant with God. But we also enter covenants with others in our personal and business lives. How are you doing in fulfilling covenants to others? God has given us the example to follow. Ask God if you have any unfulfilled covenants you need to honor. He has called you and me to be covenant keepers.<br><br>The one who calls you is faithful and He will do it (1 Thessalonians 5:24).<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Learning to Listen </strong><br>by Max Lucado<br><br>Equipped with the right tools, we can learn to listen to God. What are those tools? Here are the ones I have found helpful.<br><br>A regular time and place. Select a slot on your schedule and a corner of your world, and claim it for God. For some it may be best to do this in the morning. Others prefer the evening Others prefer many encounters during the day.<br><br>Some sit under a tree, others in the kitchen. Maybe your commute to work or your lunch break would be appropriate. Find a time and place that seems right for you.<br><br>How much time should you take? As much as you need. Value quality over length. Your time with God should last long enough for you to say what you want and for God to say what he wants. Which leads us to a second tool you needÂ—an open Bible.<br><br>God speaks to us through his Word. The first step in reading the Bible is to ask God to help you understand it.<br><br>Before reading the Bible, pray. DonÂ’t go to Scripture looking for your own idea; go searching for GodÂ’s. Read the Bible prayerfully. Also, read the Bible carefully.<br><br>Here is a practical point. Study the Bible a little at a time. God seems to send messages as he did his manna: one dayÂ’s portion at a time. Choose depth over quantity. Read until a verse Â“hitsÂ” you, then stop and meditate on it. Copy the verse onto a sheet of paper, or write it in your journal, and reflect on it several times.<br><br>Will I learn what God intends? If I listen, I will.<br><br>Understanding comes a little at a time over a lifetime.<br><br>There is a third tool for having a productive time with God. Not only do we need a regular time and an open Bible, we also need a listening heart. DonÂ’t forget the admonition from James: Â“The man who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and makes a habit of so doing, is not the man who hears and forgets. He puts that law into practice and he wins true happinessÂ” (James 1:25 PHILLIPS).<br><br>We know we are listening to God when what we read in the Bible is what others see in our lives.<br><br>Paul urged his readers to put into practice what they had learned from him. Â“What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, doÂ” (Phil. 4:9 RSV).<br><br>If you want to be just like Jesus, let God have you. Spend time listening for him until you receive your lesson for the dayÂ—then apply it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Fresh Look Â– at Life</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br><br>They journeyed from Rephidim and encamped in the Wilderness of Sinai. They journeyed from the Wilderness of Sinai and encamped in Kivros HaTaava. (Bamidbar 33:16-17)<br><br>Why does the Torah bother to tells us, for each of the 42 journeys, where they traveled from? ItÂ’s always the prior destination.<br><br>The Talmud (Shabbos 9A) tells us that Rabbah would begin his Torah lessons with a joke. Part of the reason for this practice was to ready the students to learn something new. To hear a new idea one must be willing to shed some old assumptions. A good joke has that quality of being able to challenge our ordinary perceptions of reality. As we try to make sense out of life or a given scene, we tend to fill in the details with facts based upon our prior experiences. Some of that old baggage may actually run interference with the ability to understand the new. Then we are surprised. Our conceptual boxes are suddenly burst, our paradigms shattered, and in need of adjustment. We are now ready to learn.<br><br>A farmer came to the big city to be fitted for his first suit so he could be in fashion- step at a family wedding. He came to a tailor with a fine reputation who took careful note of the manÂ’s measurements and specifications before selecting a worthy bolt of cloth. The farmer returned on the day of the big family event to pick up his new custom made suit. The tailor confidently handed it him and pointed him to the dressing room.<br><br>The poor farmer was could hardly squeeze his first leg in and then only with great effort again his second leg. He was ready to shout out with frustration when he found himself completely distorting his body only to be able to clasp the suit pants closed. The jacket was equally a disaster. Hardly able to breath, the farmer shouted gruffly to the tailor, Â“What did you do to me? I have nothing to wear to the wedding tonight! You have ruined me!Â” Alarmed at first, the tailor took a good look, chuckled, and replied, Â“Foolish farmer! Before you try on a new suit you must first remove your over-alls!Â”<br><br>Someone coming for a first Shabbos, or going to Israel for the very first time, or encountering a Rebbe has no idea what goodness lies ahead. No amount of words could prepare that person. Similarly, someone transitioning from work to home has to make an astronaut-like adjustment to adapt to an environment with a completely different set of values. He may the big boss there but it wonÂ’t work here. When leaving the parental home for marriage the Torah admonishes early on, Â“Therefore a man should leave his mother and father and cling to his wifeÂ…Â” (Breishis 2:24) He is not expected to literally abandon his parents but rather to rid him-self of his selfish and dependant attitude.<br><br>The best one might do to adjust to the new is to be ready to shed any old and inapplicable assumptions of the past. Then, with the old coat of paint removed, one is more mentally and emotionally available for a new coat, with a fresh look- at life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Medicinal Treatment</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Raymond Beyda<br>As we begin the second phase of communal mourning over the destruction of Jerusalem and of our holy Temple this week -- Rosh Hodesh Av-- our focus should turn to the remedial action expected of us at this time. We are aware that repentance for all of our peoples' transgressions is a prerequisite of redemption, however, we also feel inadequate to meet the task of so many years of spiritual failures building one upon the other. The Hafetz Haim explains a remedial approach with a parable.<br><br>There was once a businessman who fell on hard times. The lack of business caused his debts to pile up and his ability to pay what he owed diminished. His credit standing in the community dropped to where doors were slamming in his face at every turn.<br><br>One day he entered the offices of a wholesaler from whom he bought merchandise on a regular basis. He placed a large order but when he tried to pick up his merchandise and head home the wholesaler said, "I am sorry. I have checked our records and your credit history is nothing but a series of broken promises to pay on time -- yet you never do! I can't deliver the goods on credit."<br><br>The pleading and the crying of the poor merchant cracked through the toughness of the distributor and he was prepared to release the shipment except for the fact that several of his loyal employees objected saying, "We can't allow you to give this man credit--the whole market knows that he is a good man but he still just can't seem to pay his bills."<br><br>The scene heated up between the two -- the merchant pleading for credit and the wholesaler refusing to give in--when another customer entered the office. His suggestion saved the day and made both parties happy.<br><br>"Listen," he said to the begging businessman, "you really don't need all of this merchandise immediately, so why don't you cut your order to a much smaller amount that will get you by and which you will certainly be able to pay for in a timely manner?"<br><br>Then he turned to the wholesaler and said, "I know that it is not efficient for you to take small orders but if you accept this plan you will reduce your exposure and get a misvah by helping this man survive. As time goes on he will probably build his business up to where he will not only be able to order according to your minimum requirements but he will also be able to pay you on time!"<br><br>The deal was made and both left the scene happy with the outcome at the end of the day.<br><br>The comparisons are clear. G-d in His mercy is willing to forgive our transgressions and bring our Redeemer speedily--especially considering all of our pleadings, confessions, and promises to repent and be good in the future. However, the Midat Hadin--power of strict justice -- is blocking our success by pointing out all of our broken past promises. The only solution to end the impasse is for us to do what we can do--in small bites -- to prove that over time we can succeed in our return to the ways of the Torah and reestablish the credibility of our promises.<br><br>The Hafetz Haim suggests that we start with the laws of speech. We must all work on eliminating the negative speech that flows so easily from our lips. Lashon ha-ra [negative or harmful comments], rechiloot [comments that create animosity between people), sheker [lies and dishonest words) and Nivool Peh [talking dirty] are the areas we should work on until we reestablish our credit with Hashem. In this way we all can contribute to communal improvement, unity and love one for another and give Hashem the impetus to send our Redeemer to rebuild Jerusalem and our holy Temple speedily in our days.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tested for Abundance </strong><br>Psalms 66:12<br>We went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance.<br><br>It is nice to hear that God desires to bring us into abundance. In fact, many a preacher has promoted the goodness of the Lord and His ability to prosper His children. Alas, my experience is that this gospel of material abundance has little to do with the gospel of the Kingdom as our Lord works in the realm of the sanctified soul. The passage above tells us that God does in fact bring us into places of abundance. However, upon further study of the entire passage, we learn the route to this abundance.<br><br>For you, O God, tested us; You refined us like silver. You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs. You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but You brought us to a place of abundance (Psalm 66:10-12).<br><br>God's economy of abundance often has little to do with material blessing. In God's economy, abundance is often measured in wisdom and knowledge of Himself. It is then that we are truly blessed. Wisdom cannot be gained through intellectual pursuits. Wisdom comes only through experience. Real wisdom comes from the kinds of experiences that come only through the deepest tests. Lessons of refinement, including prison accompanied by burdens, lead us through the fire and water. This is the territory that must be traveled to reach that place of abundance. It would seem strange that a loving God would use such means with His children. What we often fail to realize is that God's measuring stick is the character and likeness of Jesus Christ Himself in each of us. This cannot be gained through a life of ease and pleasure. Ease and pleasure fail to refine.<br><br>Is God using your marketplace to refine you today? Has He placed you in a prison or laid burdens on your back? Take heart if this is the place you find yourself, and realize that if you are faithful through the tests, you will enter a place of abundance that few will ever attain. The darkest hour is just before daybreak.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia.<br><br>I left at 5:00 a.m. to fly to another city to present some possible joint initiatives in ministry with another organization. I would have only an hour or so to meet with the board. I got into the city and taxied to the hotel. This is great, I thought. No glitches. I am even here an hour early. I asked where the meeting was. There was no record of such a meeting, even though my contact was staying at the hotel. I made several calls, to no avail. What had I missed? I continued trying to reach someone. An hour and a half later I reached my wife. She located a letter that seemed to indicate the meeting might be downtown. I took a cab and arrived at the location. "I am sorry, sir, there are no seventh-floor offices in use yet in this building."<br><br>"That cannot be. My letter says different." After I insisted, she let me go up. I arrived on the seventh floor. Nothing but concrete. Perplexed, I called my wife again. We made contact with yet another person who gave us another number to call. Finally, we located where the meeting was taking place. I got into the cab for another $30 cab ride. Forty-five minutes later the cab driver was lost. We stopped at a dry cleaners and he asked the people there, where the street was located. I was past the point of anger. I was laughing at this situation. A few minutes later, we arrived at our destination, three and a half hours after our scheduled time.<br><br>Plans do not always go as we hope. Sometimes they are hindered for our purposes. Sometimes we are dealing in a spiritual realm in which we realize we are truly in a spiritual battle. And sometimes we are even hindered to protect us. After looking at this situation, I believe I was being hindered from getting to this meeting. However, perseverance and God's grace allowed me to make the meeting. Important initiatives resulted from the brief time I was there.<br><br>The next time your plans are thwarted, begin asking what is at the root of the calamities. Ask God for discernment on what is taking place. Just as He revealed to Daniel, God will show you what is behind such events.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sanctified by God the Father. </strong><br><br>Mark the union of the Three Divine Persons in all their gracious acts. How unwisely do those believers talk who make preferences in the Persons of the Trinity; who think of Jesus as if He were the embodiment of everything lovely and gracious, while the Father they regard as severely just, but destitute of kindness. Equally wrong are those who magnify the decree of the Father, and the atonement of the Son, so as to depreciate the work of the Spirit. In deeds of grace none of the Persons of the Trinity act apart from the rest. They are as united in their deeds as in their essence. In their love towards the chosen they are one, and in the actions which flow from that great central source they are still undivided. Specially notice this in the matter of sanctification. While we may without mistake speak of sanctification as the work of the Spirit, yet we must take heed that we do not view it as if the Father and the Son had no part therein. It is correct to speak of sanctification as the work of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. Still doth Jehovah say, "Let us make man in our own image after our likeness," and thus we are "his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them." See the value which God sets upon real holiness, since the Three Persons in the Trinity are represented as co-working to produce a Church without "spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing." And you, believer, as the follower of Christ, must also set a high value on holiness-upon purity of life and godliness of conversation. Value the blood of Christ as the foundation of your hope, but never speak disparagingly of the work of the Spirit which is your meetness for the inheritance of the saints in light. This day let us so live as to manifest the work of the Triune God in us.<br><br>CH Spurgeon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Spiritual Society<br><br>"Till we all come . . unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."<br><br>Ephesians 4:13<br><br>Rehabilitation means the putting back of the whole human race into the relationship God designed it to be in, and this is what Jesus Christ did in Redemption. The Church ceases to be a spiritual society when it is on the look-out for the development of its own organization. The rehabilitation of the human race on Jesus Christ's plan means the realization of Jesus Christ in corporate life as well as in individual life. Jesus Christ sent apostles and teachers for this purpose - that the corporate Personality might be realized. We are not here to develop a spiritual life of our own, or to enjoy spiritual retirement; we are here so to realize Jesus Christ that the Body of Christ may be built up.<br><br>Am I building up the Body of Christ, or am I looking for my own personal development only? The essential thing is my personal relationship to Jesus Christ - "That I may know Him." To fulfil God's design means entire abandonment to Him. Whenever I want things for myself, the relationship is distorted. It will be a big humiliation to realize that I have not been concerned about realizing Jesus Christ, but only about realizing what He has done for me.<br><br>"My goal is God Himself, not joy nor peace,<br>Nor even blessing, but Himself, my God."<br>Am I measuring my life by this standard or by anything less?<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Oswald Chambers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How Far it Might Travel<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>Moshe said to the children of Gad and the children of Reuven; "Shall your brothers go out to battle while you settle here? Why do you dissuade the heart of the Children of Israel from crossing to the land that HASHEM has given them? This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land." (Bamidbar 32:6-8 )<br><br>The Malbim points out that from here we find out something that was not clearly stated earlier. We had the impression that the main problem of the spies was that they had spoken badly about the land. Now, forty years later, we learn that the more serious crime was that they had spoken words that were discouraging to the Children of Israel. A whole generation later and Moshe is still extremely guarded on this issue. How vulnerable then is the average person to being discouraged. See how important it is to lend encouragement to others and not to do or say anything that might soften their resolve.<br><br>On our way out of town one Erev Simchas Torah we stopped by to visit Rabbi Hershel Mashinsky ztl. He was sitting in his Sukkah. He greeted each of us individually with his usual warmth. As we were speaking one of the young children reached uninvited into a bowl with sugar cubes and grabbed one. I quickly tried to stop him. Rabbi Mashinsky with his sweet softness said to the child, "Nu?! A brocho!?" The child said the appropriate blessing to which we all answered, "Amen!" Then Rabbi Mashinsky chimed in, "That was a smart brocho!" We carry that phrase till today and employ it daily- "A smart brocho!"<br><br>On the flip side, my wife told me that she had taken the time and expense to buy something new for one of our young daughters. The little girl had selected an outfit she liked very much and the first day she was proudly wearing it, another child said to her, "Where did you get that shmata???" She refuses to wear it again!<br><br>A teacher of thousands over the past 29 years told me this week the disheartening words spoken to him by a teacher of his more than three decades ago and how it hurt him so. "You'll never achieve anything." Still, he attends the dinner each year, remembers clearly, but never says a word.<br><br>A woman keeps a framed note on her table from an educator that met her son once, years ago, and took the time to write that he's a fine boy! How simple it is to add zest to another's day or entire life! A husband, with glowing praise, eulogizes his young wife by recalling that he had purchased a van that his wife had advised him strongly not to buy and after it turned out to be a lemon she said nothing at all.<br><br>Rabbi Zelig Plskin writes in Gateways to Happiness, "Be aware of the positive traits and behaviors of the people with whom you come into contact and help them build upon their strengths. Encouragement is a much more powerful tool for change and growth than blaming and condemning. You can bring about miracles in a person's life if you believe in their potential.(P. 388 ) With the casual power of remote control, and in a given moment, one can easily turn someone on or turn them off, and never know how far it might travel.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>His Private Path </strong><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>And Aaron the Cohen went up to the Mountain of Hor according to (Â“Al PiÂ”- literally by the mouth of) HASHEM and he died there in the fortieth year of the Children of Israel having left the Land Egypt on the first day of the fifth month. (Bamidbar 33:39)<br><br>According to (AL Pi) HASHEM: We learn that he died with a kiss! (Rashi)<br><br>What is this Â“kiss of deathÂ” that took Aaron out of the world? Why does it mention here of all places that Aaron was a Cohen? We know that! Why are we told that that his death occurred in the 40th year?<br><br>The Talmud (Brochos 8A) tells us there 930 different types of death. The worst is something called Â“askaraÂ” which is defined as a kind of choking while the lightest is Â“the kissÂ” of death. The harshest is compared to disentangling wool from thorns, while the easiest, Â“the kissÂ” is compared to removing a hair from milk. Since when is the body compared to milk and the soul which is milky white and pure comparable to the body? Hair is reminiscent of the negative inclination and all forms of coarse materialism?Â” The answer is that the hair is the body and the milk is the soul. For the righteous, death is as void of conflict as removing hair from milk. When the overwhelming presence of The Almighty approaches and then withdraws the righteous one cleaves and is drawn lovingly home. With that kiss the shell is removed like a uniform and the soulful individual finds himself where he had always practiced being, in the presence G-d.<br><br>The bad news on the other end of the spectrum is Â“breaking up is hard to doÂ”. The soul which became overly identified with its body now struggles to avoid the inevitable. I once saw on 47th Street that the owner of a delivery van returned to his vehicle only to discover that the Department of Transportation was already towing it away. The poor guy lay on the hood of his car screaming and carrying on until he had to be forcibly removed.<br><br>The Prophet Mica makes the following profound and famous statement, Â“(I) Say to you man what is good and what does-HASHEM expect of you, except that you act justly, love kindliness, and walk privately with your G-d!Â” Giving concrete examples of each the Talmud (Sukkah 49B) explains that Â“walking privately with G-dÂ” to mean escorting the dead and entering a bride to the chupah! The Alter from Slobodka, Reb Nosson Tzvi Finkel ztl. asked, Â“What walking modestly can there be in going out in the street to collect money for dowering brides or burying the dead? Is there any greater publicity than this? The point is, though, that a person must figure out how to walk modestly and privately even when he is in the most public eye!Â”<br><br>Sefer Maoros HaGedolim testifies about the Alter himself how hidden was his true greatness from the eyes of others. Â“Almost nothing is known about him. We know only thorough his work in Torah education, which could not be hidden. He never held any title and he never took credit for any action. Even in Slabodka Yeshiva which he founded, developed, and supported for fifty years, and in which he raised thousands of students he never held a post or a title, He was simply called Â“The AlterÂ”. Out of thousands of letters and documents that came out of the yeshiva over the years, his signature is not to be found. If a historian were to investigate the history of the Slabodka Yeshiva, he would find in its archives no sign that such a person had lived and worked there!Â”<br><br>A local Talmud scholar once told me that the difference between great people and everyone else is that great people are greater in their private life than in their public life. Everyone else is just the opposite.<br><br>Therefore, there can be no greater praise for Aaron who was for forty years the Highest Priest- the most public figure that he yielded in the end effortlessly shedding that giant mantle of honor he was privileged to wear in this world and continued forever more on his private path.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>More Generous Thoughts</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the Children of Israel saying: This is the thing that HASHEM has commanded: If a man takes a vow to HASHEM or swears an oath to establish a prohibition upon himself, he shall not desecrate his word; according to whatever comes from his mouth shall he do. (Bamidbar 30:2-3)<br><br>Amazingly a person can create obligations to act and make restrictions in his own behavior that are as binding as any other explicit commandment in the Torah. A slice of watermelon can become as forbidden as a slice of bacon with one roll of the tongue. ItÂ’s worthwhile taking some time to admire how powerfully invested we are with the gift of speech.<br><br>The wisest of all men, King Solomon writes, Â“Blessings to the head of the righteous but (chamas) violence will cover the mouths of the wicked. (Mishlei 10:6)<br><br>The Vilna Gaon explains that since the righteous person constantly sees goodness in others and blesses them he becomes the object of blessing by The Almighty. The habit of the wicked on the other hand, is to search for and express fault and blame in others. He therefore brings curses upon his own head.<br><br>The Vilna Gaon justifies the word Â“violenceÂ” Â­Â“chamasÂ” based upon its use in the describing the reasons for the Â“great floodÂ”, Â“Because the earth is filled with violence-Â‘chamasÂ’Â”. What was the violence of that time? He explains that society was infested with minor acts of theft but the verbally violent reactions of the ones who were stolen from was the source of the ever so destructive- Â“chamasÂ”.<br><br>Similarly, Rabbi Matisyahu Solomon offers a bluntly sobering explanation of the phenomenon of Â“baseless hatredÂ” which our sages tell us is the underlying reason for the destruction of the 2nd Temple and the length of the subsequent exile. Imagine a teacher is trying to gain the attention of a student in his class. The child is playing with some toy inside his desk and he is warned time and again. Eventually the teacher cuts off the arm of the student. The parents and the principal are mortified. The teacher explains that he was playing with things inside his desk during class time. Everyone would agree in this absurd case that the teacher stepped over all bounds of acceptability, no matter how he may try to explain his behavior. Sure the kid was not innocent but he didnÂ’t deserve to lose a limb.<br><br>So says Rabbi Solomon that sometimes a person has a real claim against another. He was slighted or cheated or damaged in some way but that does not justify hating him in his entirety or frowning at and complaining about his family and wishing them ill. All that would be overkill. It requires a sophisticated and surgical approach not to condemn the whole of a person or his clan because a single albeit legitimate point of contention.<br><br>ThatÂ’s the definition and the dynamic of the debilitating disease called Â“baseless hatredÂ”. Not that it is entirely unwarranted but that that the limited license to complain spills over and floods the arena of the Â“unwarrantedÂ”. Instead of being a source of blessing and goodness for others we are ever tempted to kick and curse inviting further reasons for unhappiness.<br><br>The Vilna Gaon explains why the blessing is to the Â“headÂ” of the righteous, Â“Because of the principle that HASHEM considers a well intended thought as a deed already done, the moment the person thinks to lend his blessings to another, he himself is immediately showered with blessings.Â” When considering what different kinds of worlds we might come to occupy based only upon the organs of speech, our minds are therefore put on serious notice to generate more generous thoughts.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br><strong>Our Universe Small </strong><br><br>If a man takes a vow to HASHEM or swears an oath to establish a prohibition upon himself, he shall not desecrate his word; according to whatever comes out of his mouth shall he do. (Bamidbar 30:3)<br><br>Blessed is He Who Spoke and the world the world came to be. Blessed is He. Blessed is He Who makes the Creation. Blessed is He Who says and does. Blessed is He Who decrees and fulfills... (Baruch SheÂ’amar- Morning Liturgy)<br><br>...and He blew into his nostrils the soul of life; and man became a living being. (Breishis 2:6)<br><br>...and man became a living being: He gave him knowledge and speech. (Rashi)<br><br>Words are the most powerful intoxicants known to mankind. (Rudyard Kipling)<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t talk of love! Show me!Â” (Show Tune from -My Fair Lady)<br><br>Speech is one of those human functions that can all too easily be taken for granted. Yet it is one of our most distinctly human features. It raises us above the common beast. With words alone we can build or destroy. Yet they fly around so cheaply like fall leaves to be bagged and carted away. Why is it that some words remain and have lasting value while others are dismissed?<br><br>The humorous story is told about a couple that attended a fundraising event. After the moving presentation, a request for pledges was made. One fellow, in an emotional state, leapt to his feet and shouted, Â“Twenty Thousand Dollars!Â” His wife immediately elbowed him sharply and reminded him, Â“We havenÂ’t got that kind of money!Â”<br><br>The fellow sheepish approached the hosts of the event and explained that he had been a victim of over exuberance and he would not be able to match his pledge. A lawsuit ensued and the fellow lost and it cost him another five thousand dollars on top of the original twenty for legal fees. He and his wife appropriately made a moratorium on attending fund raising affairs, which they honored religiously for some time. After a good while had lapsed they noticed a sign in the synagogue for a parlor meeting to benefit orphans. They figured that that had learned their lesson well and decided to attend but not before the wife sternly warned her husband. The slide show and the speeches were so moving that when the moment for public pledges arrived the fellow jumped out of this seat and declared, Â“Twenty Thousand Dollars and Five Thousand Dollars in legal fees!Â”<br><br>How important is it that words be matched by action to have value. I heard from a special person a profound explanation for a phrase that is oft repeated in The Chapters of the Fathers, the phrase- Â“He used to sayÂ…Â”. For example: He used to say (Ben Azai), Â“Do not despise any man and do not dismiss any thing, because there is no man that does not have his hour and no thing that does not have its place. (Avos. 4:3)<br><br>The explanation for Â“he used to sayÂ” was taken from a negative example. A fellow who gave a potent presentation about the ills of cigarette smoking was later seen smoking cigarettes. The listeners were disappointed. ThatÂ’s not the example of Â“he used to sayÂ”. Whenever it says, Â“he used to sayÂ” it means that not only did he repeat this statement often but that he lived up to his words. He was a living example of his very own speech. Perhaps thatÂ’s why his words continue to resonate through the ages.<br><br>The value of our words is a function of what we do and who we are in proportion to those words. When a check is returned marked- Â“insufficient fundsÂ” the numbers on it, no matter how big, are rendered meaningless. When we say, Â“Thanks a millionÂ” with half a heart, then two words have just been seriously discounted. As the verse above indicates, the holiness of our words is in direct proportion to our very actions. If they don't mean much to us why should they be valued by anybody else? Just as the entire universe is built and maintained through the power of speech so it is with each of us in our universe small.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br><strong>Our Consolation </strong><br><br>We sing on Friday evening the following poetic words, "Lovers of Hashem, those who long for the building of The Temple, delight and rejoice on the Holy Shabbos, like one who has received an endless inheritance..."<br><br>What does longing for the rebuilding of The Temple to do with the depth of pleasure we experience on Shabbos? The story is told about a sole survivor of a shipwreck who washed up on a dessert island. After having taken care of his most basic needs of food, clothing and shelter he began to forage soon after to satisfy the next level of lacking, the need for human interaction.<br><br>Looking down from a mountain view he espied what seemed to be signs of civilization. His hopes were confirmed when he stumbled upon a fully developed housing and commercial district. People, however were not to be found as he wandered from store, to store, to home calling out unsuccessfully for a human response.<br><br>After six full days, in a moment of lapse, he suddenly felt a hand on his shoulder and noticed the streets bustling with people. The stranger invited him to come to his house for Shabbos. Nobody dare pause to answer his inquiries about where they had been because they all claimed to be too busy "getting ready for Shabbos." On Shabbos they would not speak about weekday matters.<br><br>He decided to wait till after Shabbos and meanwhile enjoy the high-spirited prayer services, divine cuisine, deeply resonant words of Torah, and angelic singing that accompanied the Shabbos there. After Shabbos, with just the light of the flickering havdallah (traditional observance marking the end of Shabbos) candle flashing in the eyes of all, the final blessing was recited and the candle neatly plunged into the awaiting dish of wine. Immediately the man began to ask but found to his surprise that he was alone again.<br><br>The next week after six days the same scene transpired. Nobody uttered a word about the weekday activity and where all had been. Shabbos, another delicious Shabbos passed and after havdallah he was plunged into darkness and isolation again. Enlightened by two previous experiences he waited till next week and at the moment when the great dancing light of havdallah was about to be extinguished he quickly grabbed the Rabbi's hand and refused to yield until his curiosity was satisfied. Where does everyone go? Seeing that he meant business the Rabbi explained, "This town has been here for hundreds of years as a port city even during the times of the Temple. Our greatest joy was the three times of the year when special emissaries were chosen and launched with great ceremony and laden with gifts to represent the community in Jerusalem at The Holy Temple. Upon their return we would live from holiday to holiday on the inspiring stories of open miracles and the tangible holiness present at those splendid events.<br><br>"One time we were awaiting the arrival of our messengers after the holiday. We all stood at the beach at the appointed time. The whole day went by and at the very end when the sun was setting the band started to play as our ship appeared on the horizon. As it moored closer we began to sense something was amiss. The lone figure on the boat sat with his head bowed in silence.<br><br>"We gathered around him riddling him with questions till we grew silent and he spoke unspeakable words. He whispered in barely audible tones this impossible uttering, 'The Temple was destroyed!' We were all so shocked and hurt by the awful news that our hearts burst with grief and we died a simultaneous death because of our loss. In the heaven there was a great stir because we had all arrived before our time and yet we had left the world. A compromise was offered that since we died because of our love for The Temple we were sent back to live out our appointed days on earth, only on Shabbos." That is how the legend goes!<br><br>We once went to visit a blind woman in Jerusalem who was able to tell us volumes of accurate incites about our children just from feeling their faces. We were amazed. When we left one of our little boys said, 'That lady can't see with her eyes but she can see with her heart.'"<br><br>When a person loses their ability to see, we find often, that other senses are more heightened and that sensitivity, although not a complete compensation, allows the person to function till the power of sight is restored. Similarly, without The Temple, The Almighty's Place, where His presence could be visibly perceived, we are like blind in the world. However, if one loves profoundly and wants truly to behold The Almighty's presence, then Shabbos, His time, takes on a richer flavor of joy, and in the meantime that is our consolation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Leave the Floor to the Worms</strong><br><br>"The spider skillfully grasps with its hands, and it is in king's palaces." Proverbs 30:28 Let me add something to that verse. "The worms will find a way to escape the deluge and will visit your palace in the morning." Yes, you read that right. Worms. The wet weather activates them. They have to come out of their little worm runs because of the water. For whatever reason they seek out our kitchen floor and enter under the back door off the deck. Pretty much every morning after a rainy day we have the little beggars on our floor right near that door.<br><br>What's interesting is that they are not there thriving. They may have escaped the waterworld that had become their home but the new home they have sought is not a place of continual living either. By the time we arise in the morning several of them have found shelter in our house only to be lying there on the floor drying out. Very rarely do we awaken to the little vermin writhing actively in a sea of movement on the floor. Most often they are somewhat lifeless and, depending on how long they have been in the house, even a bit crusty.<br><br>What I am trying to figure out is, if they have such wonderful instincts for escaping the soaking death of their burrows, why do they migrate to a place where they still die? That is what absolutely buffaloes me. Granted, it doesn't keep me stone cold awake at night, but it just doesn't make sense. Why would something that thrives on a certain measure of moisture seek a totally dry environment for sanctuary from the rain? The only thing that I can deduce is the cold floor fools them into thinking that there is moisture available. Our floor is vinyl over a concrete slab and can be quite cold to bare feet in the morning.<br><br>In short, I guess the worms got fooled. I don't know if that conclusion would stand the scrutinity of worm specialists the world over, but it seems to be the likely reason to me. I mean, they're worms. I don't think that they are all that high up on the intelligence rankings of the creatures of the world. I would throw off something like, "they eat dirt," but show me a kid that didn't sample a mud pie somewhere along the way. For that matter, show me an adult that hasn't tried the same thing as the worms on my floor. Their world seems to be suffering from a sudden rush of disaster so the first thing they do is run from it and run right to the wrong decision. When all is coming apart, blame God.<br><br>"Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am tempted by God'; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed." James 1:13,14 Life is not a ride in which every turn is a good one. Take that from a man who has lost four family members before their time over a span of eight years. I lost my father to a sudden heart attack, my mother to a genetic deficiency and a 49 year old cousin and 59 year old sister to cancer. God is not at fault. We should not be fooled by the temptation to blame God and run to the safety of our personal emotions.<br><br>Those who run to the seeming safety of their "God is to blame" cold floor run to a life away from the Lord. Their spirit dries out and they become one of those crusty people with no joy in the Lord or life. We are better served to resist such a temptation to blame God, and seek His comfort instead.

Scott said one Saturday in August (2005) on our way home from my sister's house.<br><br>"Not good," I said.<br><br>We had just come out of summer- the first summer I hadn't worked in several years. I had resigned my SermonCentral.com job in Spring, and in May, Scott hired someone to take my place as worship leader for our church plant.<br><br>"The ends aren't going to meet this month."<br><br>"Ughhh." He groaned.<br><br>We had both been enjoying my new freedom, cheerfulness, and the actual potential for all my work to get done. We were holding out hope that I might be able to just be mom for ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>a while. But the checkbook was beginning to argue.<br><br>"We can't worry about it Scott. I'll sub when I can." (Substitute teach, that is.)<br>"We'll catch up."<br><br>Though it wasn't always the case, I was feeling especially optimistic that day about God's ability to provide for our family. He always had in the past. I couldn't imagine things would be any different on this day.<br><br>And then my cell phone rang. It was the computer from our school district that schedules substitute teachers. I was rather surprised to get this call on Saturday at 5:00 p.m.<br><br>"We have a job available for Melissa Mathews. To hear the job description press 1. To decline, press 5."<br><br>How do you decline a job in the middle of a we-need-more-money conversation? So I pressed 1.<br><br>"We have a roving position available at Inderkum High School for Monday, August 22, from 7:55 to 3:15. To accept the position, press one. To hear the job description again, press five."<br><br>August 22? That was the first day of school! And what in the world did roving mean? I pressed five. The machine repeated the assignment. How crazy would it be to sub on the first day of the new school year? I pressed five again. After the third listen, I pressed 1 and got the job number.<br><br>I had been keeping my eye on the job opening website for our school district. Earlier in the summer on a day of desperation, I had actually applied in response to a "Secondary English Teacher" posting, but had stated in my cover letter that I only wanted to work part-time. Fat chance. That position had disappeared from the site, but the week before school started, another English position popped up on the website. WowÂ—how would they fill a job at that late date I wondered? I had sent an email to the principal stating I could help him temporarily if he hadn't filled the position when the school year started. I had also left him a voice mail. It doesn't hurt to make yourself available, I thought.<br><br>So when I showed up Monday morning with the other roving subs prepared to teach an English class, he was more than pleasantly surprised. "You're a life saver!" he said. But my intentions in showing up ready to teach had only been to save my own life. Spending an entire day with high school students and having nothing to occupy their time sounded like a complete and total nightmare.<br><br>"Are you interested in the job?" the principal asked me. "I haven't even had time to start the hiring process yet."<br><br>Surely he didn't just say what I thought he said.<br><br>"The job is only 80% though."<br><br>Now I knew I was dreaming.<br><br>"I'll have to ask my family. I haven't even thought about it," I said feeling pleasantly overwhelmed at the prospect.<br><br>So three weeks later, when I signed my teaching contract that was dated back to the first day of school for a teaching job with the perfect schedule (first hour prep, all ninth grade English) and the perfect hours (I start my day after my boys start school, and finish before they finish) I knew that God was involved. The words of Paul in Philippians 4:19 were ringing in my ear:<br><br>"And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus."<br>And He did. God met me where my ends didn't meet.<br><br>Melissa Mathews<br>I'm a preacher's kid, pastor's wife, and southern belle who married a Southern California boy. Can you say "culture clash?"

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Kohein-in-Waiting</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>There is a fascinating law in this week's portion. The Torah tells us that one who kills accidentally must be banished to a city of refuge. The Torah refers to an accident that is tinged with a bit of negligence, not a total mishap or a death tainted with intent. The cities of refuge were the home of the Levites, whose life's mission was service to others. Thus a lesson in care and concern during the murderer's stay would elevate of his soul.<br><br>The Torah tells us very unique terms of release. The killer was to stay in the city of refuge until the Kohein Gadol (High Priest) died. Of course, the scene among his Levite neighbors, who were the protÃ©gÃ©s of the Kohein Gadol mourning the loss of their beloved leader, would put the murderer's joy of freedom in perspective. It would be almost impossible to be exuberant with his own release amongst the thousands of residents mourning their leader - and that would be another lesson, before his new life in society.<br><br>But the Torah identifies the Kohein Gadol, whose death results in the killer's release, in a strange way. "He (the killer) shall remain (in the city of refuge) until the passing of the Kohein Gadol who he anointed"(Numbers 35:25). The Talmud in Makos is baffled by the words who he anointed. It somewhat implies that the killer had to do with the Kohein's anointing - and that just cannot be. After all wasn't the Kohein anointed way before the accident occurred?<br><br>The Talmud answers. True. This verse implies that if, after the time of the accident but before its judicial resolution, a new Kohein Gadol is anointed, then the killer only is released after the new Kohein's death. The Talmud asks why? This new Kohein Gadol was not around during the accident? True he was appointed before the verdict, but he was appointed after the death occurred. Why is he somehow involved the verdict of the accused? Why is his death the redeeming factor for the accused? Why is he punished? The Talmud answers that if there was a trial during the new Kohein's tenure, he should have prayed for the welfare of the accused. He should have interceded and prayed in order to mitigate a verdict of exile. Therefore, if the verdict came in his tenure, the man is released with his death.<br><br>It is quite difficult to understand. How is an incoming Kohein Gadol, during the most exciting and prestigious period of his career expected to worry about the verdict of a man, he has never heard of, who is accused of manslaughter.<br><br>Rabbi Chaim Kanievski, of B'nei Berak, Israel, the son of the Steipler Gaon of blessed memory, is known for his amazing breadth of Torah Knowledge which is only paralleled by his great diligence in Torah study. With the passing of his father more than a decade ago, people from all walks of life line up in front of his home seeking answers to complex Torah and personal questions.<br><br>But his greatness and wisdom were known to hundreds in the yeshiva world for many years.<br><br>Many years ago, as a student in the Ponovez Yeshiva, I heard an amazing story. A young man came to Reb Chaim with a long list of questions. Reb Chaim seemed a bit preoccupied but the visitor insisted in asking the questions, to which Reb Chaim responded, one by one.<br><br>Suddenly Reb Chaim began tidying himself up and put on a recently pressed kapote and new hat, and asked the young man's indulgence. He had to go somewhere but he allowed the visitor to accompany him. The younger man did, peppering him with questions the entire way.<br><br>They walked a few blocks until they reached a wedding hall. Upon entering, Reb Chaim embraced the groom with a warm hug and kiss and apologized for the delay. Reb Chaim sat himself among the prestigious Rabbonim who graced the dais as they prepared the marriage documents. The persistent questioner was almost oblivious to the scene and continued to ask as more questions and eliciting responses. Reb Chaim tried to juggle the needs of the groom while trying to accommodate the visitor who had besieged him with problems.<br><br>But the persistent questioner received the shock of his life when, as the music began, heralding the march to the badekin, where the groom, flanked by his father and father-in-law, met the bride and covered her face with the veil. The groom rose from his seat and immediately his future father-in-law took hold of his arm. The groom's father took hold of the other arm. But before he did so, the groom's father turned around and apologized to the stranger who he had been talking to for the last hour or so. He said that would be unable to help him until after the ceremony. And then Rabbi Kanievski nodded Mazel Tov to the hundreds of well-wishers and began the procession to his own son's wedding!<br><br>The Torah tells us that the Kohein Gadol-elect, waiting to be anointed to the most spiritual position in Judaism has a responsibility to worry about the welfare of the common man - even those accused of manslaughter. He should worry about his welfare and the verdict on his life. There is no greater inauguration to the responsibilities of priesthood than the concern for every single one of us.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The God of the Valley</strong><br>1 Kings 20:28<br>The man of God came up and told the king of Israel, "This is what the Lord says: 'Because the Arameans think the Lord is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys, I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the Lord'."<br><br>Whenever we stand on the mountain, we are able to see clearly. It is the best vantage point to see what lies ahead. Wouldn't it be great to live on the mountain all the time in order to anticipate what is ahead? God allows us to experience the mountaintop at times. Joseph's first mountaintop experience was as a young man. He had the favor of his father, Jacob. He was given a fine coat and even had a dream about his future. As a young man, Joseph had a sense of destiny about his life. God often gives us a picture of our future so that we will remember this picture when we are being tested to trust Him in the valley. This picture usually does not reveal how God intends to bring about the visions for our life.<br><br>However, none of us really derive the character qualities God desires for our lives while we are on the mountain. It is in the valley where the fruit is planted and harvested. It cannot grow on the mountain; it must grow in the valley. God is a God of the mountain, but he is even more a God of the valley. In the valley, it is more difficult to see ahead; the clouds often cover the valley and limit our sight. Joseph was thrust into a deep valley that left him wondering if the God of his father had forsaken him. Jesus hoped that He might be able to avoid the valley that caused Him to sweat blood. There is a valley that each of us must enter, usually unwillingly, in order to experience the God of the valley-and to experience His faithfulness in the valley. Once we have spent time in this valley, we come out with something we would have never gained if we had not entered it. The valley brings much fruit into our lives so that we might plant seeds into the lives of others. God does not waste valley experiences. If we are faithful in the valley, we will enter a new dimension with God that we never thought possible. There is a harvest of wisdom and virtue that can only be grown in the valley.<br><br>Has God brought you into the valley? Know that the valley is a place of fruitfulness; it is a place of testing. It is where God brings what you know in your head into your heart. The only value of knowledge is when it becomes part of your heart. Look for God in the valley today.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>
