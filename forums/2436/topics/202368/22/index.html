For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth,    And deep darkness the people;   But Yahveh will arise over you,   And His glory will be seen upon you.   The Gentiles shall come to your light, And kings to the brightness of your rising.  Isaiah 60:1-3<br><br>Hanukkah is also called the Feast of Dedication and the Feast of Lights and Miracles. The whole story of Hanukah is connected with the desire of the People of the Covenant (The Jewish People) to pay any price in order to live a consecrated life with the Presence of Yahveh in the CENTER. When we look closely into this historical event called Hanukkah we will see that the main Â“actorsÂ” are a priestly family called the Maccabees that refused to bow down to pagan worship even under death threats! At that time Greece was ruling Israel and they had the power to execute anyone that would not bow down to their gods.<br><br>However Mathityahu and his sons led by Yehudah decided to take the risk of perishing rather than betraying The God of Israel and His Commandments! They were only a few against an entire armed and mean army! However they did not keep this a personal issue but decided to carry the battle to the extent of fighting courageously and dangerously for the redemption of the entire Nation of Israel.  The rest of the story is recounted extensively in the books of the Apocrypha and it talks of a terrible fight between the Jewish Maccabees and the Greeks. The Maccabees won and they took over the Temple from the hands of the pagans and proceeded to consecrate it, cleanse it and purify it from all vestiges of<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>unholiness and pagan worship. After cleansing it, they lit up the Menorah, the sign of YAHÂ’S Presence and Revelation the symbol of His Word and the fullness of His illuminating spirit (Seven fold Spirit-Seven branch Menorah)<br><br>Your word is a lamp to my feet And a light to my path. Psalms 119:105<br><br>However they needed a miracle, they needed more oil in order to keep the Menorah lit. However not any oil would do but only consecrated oil. It took seven days to consecrate Holy Oil and so they had a dilemma. Should we proceed with only ONE little vessel (Kad Katan) of oil or should we wait until more oil is consecrated? They proceeded by faith and YAH followed their trust and zeal for His Word with a miracle of MULTIPLICATION. The little vessel of Holy Oil lasted for 8 days until enough oil was consecrated!<br><br>No doubt many know this beautiful Hanukkah story and of course the excitement is always about the Miracle but we need to understand that this miracle was not a random miracle! It was the answer of YAHVEH to a few important factors. I believe that He is always willing to answer with His miracles when these factors are present:<br><br>1.     Being willing to lose your life for the Truth of His Word and Kingdom.<br><br>2.     Being willing to fight the Â“GoliathsÂ” though you are small and seemingly insignificant.<br><br>3.     Fight until you die or you achieve your goal, never quit!!!<br><br>4.     After you achieve the desired victory CONSECRATE yourself again, let the Light of His Word dwell in you richly and shine. Then watch Him back you up with His Miracles!<br><br>Consecration is always connected with cleansing and purification. Just like the Mishkan (Temple) needed to be purified from pagan influence, so do we who are The Mishkan of His Ruach (Spirit). Consecration through repentance from all that defiles us needs to lead to the infilling of the Light of His Word and Spirit and then watch Him do the Miracles needed for you to complete the task of glorifying His dwelling place!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>VERY IMPORTANT:<br><br>Fight for His cause not for yours. The Maccabees wanted to rededicate the Mishkan (Temple) for the Glory of YAH (God) and not because of selfish ambition for fame or for the desire to build a Â“ministryÂ” for themselves. Too many people are pursuing their own agenda but who is interested in vindicating the Holiness and the Glory of God?<br><br>In these End Times things are shifting and we will begin to see a marked difference between those that live for His Glory and those that do not. The distinguishing marks will be upon the Consecrated and Illuminate ones and you will see Miracles following them wherever they go! YAH wants His Mishkan back from all pagan influence and iniquity; He desires a Bride Pure and Holy! The Battle is raging in Israel and for IsraelÂ’s Redemption. Will you stop your own agenda and join the Battle for His Glory? Will you join His End time Messianic Apostolic Prophetic Team? We, like the Maccabees are only a few compared with the millions in organized religion but the zeal of YAHVEH consumes us for the restoration of His House and of Holy Worship.<br><br>Â“and Yahveh said to him, Â“Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.Â”  To the others He said in my hearing, Â“Go after him through the city and kill; do not let your eye spare, nor have any pity.Â” Ezekiel 9:4-5<br><br>As we end this Hanukkah and prepare to end this Gregorian calendar year, let us pursue after His Presence and His holiness and pure Word like never before in our lives. The Miracles is only the outcome of the Consecration and the Light of His Word in us. Miracles should be the norm for consecrated believers that are full of His Holy Fire and Word. And remember that the fight can be fierce, dangerous and riskyÂ…But if we perish, we perish.<br><br>For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed best to them, but He for our profit, that we may be partakers of His holiness. Hebrews 12:10 Pursue peace without holiness no<br><br>I yearn to see Him, not only in Heaven but right here on earth!

            <div class='col-md body'>Making Adjustments<br>John 21:6<br>..."Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some."<br><br>A former client of mine was the marketing director of a large food brokerage company and told me a story about one of their client grocery stores located in the upper Midwest. It seems that the store could not understand why at a certain time every winter sales plummeted. They studied their product line and interviewed customers. They did everything possible to uncover the mystery. Finally, someone made a remarkable discovery that changed everything.<br><br>It seemed that whenever it was really cold outside, the manager raised the temperature in the store. When customers came into the store it was too warm for them, so they removed their coats and placed them in their shopping carts. This meant less room for food and resulted in reduced sales overall. They lowered the temperature of the store, and as a result, the sales climbed back to the levels they were accustomed to. Their adjustment resulted in restoring sales levels.<br><br>Jesus stood on the shoreline and watched Peter and a few of the disciples fish. Jesus yelled from the shoreline asking if they had caught anything. They had not. He then suggested they cast their line on the other side of the boat. Without knowing the person who was addressing them, they took His advice. They began catching so many fish they could not bring them in.<br><br>Adjusting our lives to God is the first thing that has to happen in order to begin experiencing Him in our daily lives. For some, it is simply following the advice of those above us. For others, it may require a major change in our job situation. Still, for others it could mean making changes in relationships. Whatever the case, you can be sure that until we adjust our lives to God we will not receive His full blessing. Ask Him today where you need to adjust to Him.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Peace-A Weapon Against Satan<br><br>Psalms 23:4<br>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me.<br><br>In the battles of the marketplace, your peace is actually a weapon. The marketplace creates many opportunities to rob us of our peace. Cash flow concerns, deadlines, relationships-all create stress on us. Your confidence in the God of peace declares that you are not falling for the lies of the devil. You see, the first step toward having spiritual authority over the adversary is having peace in spite of our circumstances. When Jesus confronted the devil, he did not confront satan with His emotions or in fear. Knowing that the devil was a liar, He simply refused to be influenced by any voice other than God's. His peace overwhelmed satan; His authority then shattered the lie, which sent demons fleeing.<br><br>There is a place of walking with God where you simply fear no evil. David faced a lion, a bear, and a giant. In this Psalm he stood in the "shadow of death" itself, yet he "feared no evil." David's trust was in the Lord. He said, "...for Thou art with me." Because God is with you, every adversity you face will unfold in victory as you maintain your faith in God! David continued, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies" (Ps. 23:5a). The battle you are in will soon become a meal for you, an experience that will nourish and build you up spiritually. Only God's peace will quell your fleshly reactions in battle. The source of God's peace is God Himself. If fear has been knocking at your door, begin to face that fear with God's peace. It is God's secret weapon to destroy fear.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A CHILD'S BEST DEFENSE<br>Matthew 19:14 NIV<br>Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these<br><br>I am often asked if little children can come under demonic attack. The answer is yes. Three of my seminary students have told me about strange behavior patterns in their respective children. At times each of these kids stepped out of character and misbehaved. No attempts at discipline seemed to work. I encouraged my students to ask their children if they were having thoughts which provoked them to misbehave. In all three cases they answered yes. When these parents dealt with the deception instead of the misbehavior, the discipline problems cleared up.<br><br>One young boy who was caught lying and stealing from his parents said, "Daddy, I had to do it. Satan said he would kill you if I didn't." The boy's father later told me that if he hadn't heard me speak about the battle for the mind, he would have severely disciplined his son for trying to blame the devil for his actions. Instead, he confronted the enemy's lie and hugged his son for trying to save his life. The lying and stealing stopped immediately.<br><br>Proverbs 23:7 says, "For as he thinks within himself, so he is." Unfortunately, we see the behavior and try to change that. We need to find out what is going on inside. No one does anything without first thinking it; whatever controls the mind controls the behavior.<br><br>A child's best defense against demonic attack is his simple, trusting faith. Children are quick to believe, and they usually understand far more than we parents give them credit for. Furthermore, your children have the added protection of being under your authority. As you carefully and prayerfully guard and nurture your freedom in Christ, chances are that your children will walk in freedom also<br><br>Neil Anderson</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE POWER IN THE TRUTH<br>John 3:21<br>He who practices the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God<br><br>Satan's first and foremost strategy is deception. As long as Satan's influence in a person's life remains undetected, he is content to lie low and not show his hand. Like a snake in the grass, he quietly sneaks up on his prey and squeezes the life out of it.<br><br>But when you confront Satan's deception and expose his lies with the truth, his strategy changes from stealth to a pretense of power. He becomes the roaring lion that Peter warned about (1 Peter 5:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. The procedure that most Christian counselors follow in dealing with people in whom demonic strongholds have been exposed is to challenge the spirit to manifest itself, and then to cast it out. Inevitably there is a power struggle which can provoke the victim to either lapse into a catatonic state, become generally disoriented, or run out of the room. I've seen people get physically injured during such confrontations. This procedure can potentially create more harm than help, especially for the novice.<br><br>We must avoid buying into Satan's second strategy of power as much as we avoid swallowing his first strategy of deception. It isn't power per se that sets the captive free; it's truth (John 8:32). The power of the Christian is in the truth; the power of Satan is in the lie. To the Satanist, power is everything, but power is only effective in the darkness. The Christian is to pursue the truth because power and authority are already inherent in him. Truth is what makes an encounter with Satan effective. Satan's demonstration of power (which is also deceptive because his power has actually been broken by the cross) is intended to provoke a fear response. When fear is controlling a believer, the Spirit of God is not, and Satan has the upper hand. Fear of the enemy and faith in God are mutually exclusive.<br><br>Neil Anderson</div>

His love to His chosen is according to His nature; His anger is only according to His office. He loves because He is love; He frowns because it is necessary for our good. He will come back to the place in which His heart rests, namely, His love to His own, and then He will take pity upon our griefs and end them. What a choice promise is this--"He will subdue our iniquities"! He will conquer them. They cry to enslave us, but the LORD will give us victory over them by His own right hand. Like the Canaanites, they shall be beaten, put under the yoke,<br>and ultimately slain. As for the guilt of our sins, how gloriously is that removed! "All their<br>sins"--yes, the whole host of them; "thou wilt cast"--only an almighty arm could perform such a wonder; "into the depths of the sea"--where Pharaoh and his chariots went down. Not into the shallows out of which they might be washed up by the tide, but into the "depths" shall our sins be hurled. They are all gone. They sank into the bottom like a stone. Hallelujah!

(Isaiah 51:12-13).<br><br>Let the text itself be taken as the portion for today. There is no need to enlarge upon it. Trembling one, read it, believe it, feed on it, and plead it before the LORD. He whom you fear is only a man after all; while He who promises to comfort you is God, your Maker, and the creator of heaven and earth. Infinite comfort more than covers a very limited danger.<br><br>"Where is the fury of the oppressor?" It is in the LORD's hand. It is only the fury of a dying creature; fury which will end as soon as the breath is gone from the nostril. Why, then, should we stand in awe of one who is as frail as ourselves? Let us not dishonor our God by making a god of puny man. We can make an idol of a man by rendering to him excessive fear as well as by paying him inordinate love.

We shall be defended and preserved from all evil: the LORD who likens Himself to birds will not be like them in their feebleness, for He is Jehovah of hosts. Let this be our comfort, that almighty love will be swift to succor and sure to cover. The wing of God is more quick and more tender than the wing of a bird, and we will put our trust under its shadow henceforth and forever.<br><br>CH Spurgeon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nearest and Dearest Fellowship<br>"So shall we ever be with the LORD"   (1 Thessalonians 4:17).<br><br>While we are here the LORD is with us, and when we are called away we are with Him. There is no dividing the saint from His Savior. They are one, and they always must be one: Jesus cannot be without His own people, for He would be a Head without a body. Whether caught up into the air, or resting in paradise, or sojourning here, we are with Jesus; and who shall separate us from Him?<br><br>What a joy is this! Our supreme honor, rest, comfort, delight, is to be with the LORD. We cannot conceive of anything which can surpass or even equal this divine society. By holy fellowship we must be with Him in His humiliation, rejection, and travail, and then we shall be with Him in His glory. Before long we shall be with Him in His rest and in His royalty, in His expectation and in His manifestation. We shall fare as He fares and triumph as He triumphs.<br><br>O my LORD, if I am to be forever with Thee, I have a destiny incomparable. I will not envy an archangel. To be forever with the LORD is my idea of heaven at its best. Not the harps of gold, nor the crowns unfading, nor the light unclouded is glory to me; but Jesus, Jesus Himself, and myself forever with Him in nearest and dearest fellowship.<br><br>CH Spurgeon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Embracing the Lean Times<br>Jeremiah 17:7<br>But blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in Him.<br><br>Have you ever considered at what point a test becomes so difficult that you decide you can no longer trust in God and you must take over to solve the problem? The prophet Jeremiah describes a situation in which the temptation to solve a financial problem can become so great that we trust in man's way to solve it.<br><br>This is what the Lord says: "Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who depends on flesh for his strength and whose heart turns away from the Lord. He will be like a bush in the wastelands; he will not see prosperity when it comes. He will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives. But blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in Him. He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit" (Jeremiah 17:5-8 ).<br><br>Jeremiah drew a sharp comparison between the man who trusts in his own effort to solve his problem and the man who trusts in God when he cannot see the outcome. The man who trusts in God bears fruit despite the circumstances in his life. He does not shrivel when the heat comes; in fact, his roots go deeper into God's grace. He continues to bear fruit in spite of his circumstances.<br><br>Recently, a friend from South Africa explained to me that whenever a plant lives in an arid climate, the roots drive deeper and deeper into the soil to get the water they need. This forces the plant to develop a root system that is far beyond the normal plant because it is forced to go deeper to gain the water it needs. Sometimes God forces us to go deeper into the grace of His love in order to build a greater foundation in our own lives. These lean times are designed to accomplish this in us. If you find yourself in this condition, ask the Lord who provides the water for our soul for the grace you need today to continue to bear fruit in the desert.<br><br>Os Hillman<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Understanding Our Own Calling<br>John 21:22<br>..."If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? YYou must follow Me."<br><br>Jesus was talking to Peter after he had just had a very important encounter with Him-one of the last meetings the two would have. This was the third time Jesus had shown Himself to the disciples after His resurrection. It is the famous dialogue between Jesus and Peter in which Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved Him. Jesus followed by commanding, "Feed My sheep." Jesus went on to foretell of Peter's future death. As they were walking together, John was with Peter and Jesus. Peter asked Jesus about John and whether he would die also. Jesus reacted sharply to Peter's comment, telling him not to worry about what John's role or purpose was in life. All Peter had to do was worry about fulfilling his own purpose.<br><br>As businesspeople we tend to measure our success on whether we have achieved a certain position or stature in life. Even as Christians the temptation to believe that someone is blessed if they have achieved prominence is always confronting us. In His discussion with Peter, Jesus was getting at the very heart of the matter of a person's calling. Peter was worried about whether his friend John was going to get the same lot in life as he was. Jesus told him it should not be his concern. He was to concern himself only with one thing: his own calling before God.<br><br>Are you tempted to compare yourself with where others are in their life? Are you dissatisfied with where God has you right now? Be of good cheer-"[be] confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus" (Phil. 1:6).<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Resolving the Ownership Issue<br>Psalms 24:1-2<br>The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it; for He founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.<br><br>As Christian businesspeople, God calls us to view Him as the owner of everything. We are to be stewards of all that He entrusts to us. This is one of the hardest of all commandments to follow for the Christian businessperson because, if we work hard at business, we receive all the benefits of that work. It appears as though all that we have achieved was through our hand. Yet God says that it is by His hand that we are able to make wealth (see Deut. 8 ). He is the source of that ability. As soon as we become owners and not managers, we fall into trouble with God.<br><br>Joseph understood that he was a steward of all the resources of Egypt. God promoted him to affect an entire region of the world. Joseph had more power, prestige, and wealth than any 30-year-old who ever lived before him. The temptation for him in this newfound role in life must have been great. Many a man has not been able to handle material success. Many of God's choicest servants began well in their calling and service to God only to fail at the end. Consider Hezekiah, the great king who achieved many great things but failed to acknowledge God's blessing at the end of his reign. His reign was cut short due to pride. Gideon's fate was similar. Success can lead to pride if we are not careful.<br><br>"Not every man can carry a full cup. Sudden elevation frequently leads to pride and a fall. The most exacting test of all to survive is prosperity" [Oswald Chambers].<br><br>Ask the Lord today if you are living as a steward or an owner. Put whatever skills and resources you possess on His altar. Then you can expect God to do great things through you.<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

It is new ground for me, and I find I am way out of my comfort zone. I am scared to death to trust Him at this level. I had to confess to the Lord I have not been able to accept or believe His love for me in this area." Those were the words I expressed to a friend when I was in a difficult place in my life. That day when I confessed those words, God led me to this passage of Scripture.<br><br>What we perceive as dark periods in our lives are designed to be treasures from God. They are actually riches stored in secret places. We cannot see those times in this light because of the often-accompanying pain or fear that prevents us from accepting these times as treasures. They have a particular purpose from God's viewpoint: "...so that you may know that I am the Lord...who summons you by name."<br><br>You see, unless we are cast into times in which we are completely at God's mercy for breakthroughs in our lives, we will never experience God's faithfulness in those areas. We will never know how personal He is, or that He can be trusted to meet the deepest needs in our lives. God wants each of us to know that we are "summoned by name." Every hair of our head is numbered. He knows every activity we are involved in. His love for you and me knows no bounds, and He will take every opportunity to demonstrate this to us.<br><br>Has God brought you into a place of darkness? Trust Him today to reveal that hidden treasure that can be found in this darkness. Let Him summon you by name.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Living a Life of Conviction<br>1 Thessalonians 1:4-5<br>For we know, brothers loved by God, that He has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction.<br><br>Everyone lives a life of conviction. Whatever we give our greatest time, our greatest energies, and our greatest resources to is a good indication of where our convictions lie. Some live a life of conviction about sports. Some live a life of conviction around pleasure. Still others live a life of conviction about very little that matters at all.<br><br>Whenever God chooses to do a deep work in a life, a strong conviction is born of the Holy Spirit. Conversions in the early Church resulted in changed lives that held to a deep, life-transforming conviction regarding what they believed and how they lived out that belief. Paul explains that the gospel they received came not just in words, but also in power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction.<br><br>In order to impact the marketplace for Jesus Christ, each of us must be reflecting a faith that is demonstrated through deeply held convictions. Are you living a life of deep conviction that spurs you on to reflect the power of Christ in your life and the lives of others? Paul was willing to suffer great persecution for his faith in a living God. God calls each of us to a life that is supernatural, not simply a good, moral life. The early Church understood the role the Holy Spirit played in demonstrating this power of the gospel. It was this deep work that resulted in living the gospel with great conviction. If you are not living the gospel with great conviction, ask the Holy Spirit to so fill your life today that the power of His Spirit is truly reflected in your life so that you may impact others in your marketplace.<br><br>Os Hillman</div>

They too will listen to My voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. - John 10:16<br><br>A friend of mine told me a story about an experience he had in Israel. They were in the country visiting some of the famous biblical sites when they saw a group of sheepherders. A shepherd brought his flock of sheep into a round pen for the night. Then, a few minutes later, another shepherd brought his flock into the pen. Then, a few minutes later, yet another shepherd brought his sheep into the pen. There were three groups of sheep in the pen with no identifying marks among any of them. My friend wondered how in the world they would separate their sheep the next day.<br><br>The next morning, a shepherd came over to the pen and made a comment to his sheep. One by one, the sheep filed out to follow him. Only his sheep followed his voice. My friend said it was an amazing scene to see only that shepherd's sheep follow him and the others remain in the pen. What a picture of Jesus' words spoken centuries earlier.<br><br>Hearing and responding to Jesus' voice is the key to having a two-way relationship with God. It is the difference between having religion and a relationship. Can you recognize God's voice in your life? Are you listening to the Shepherd's voice? Do you respond when He calls? Ask Jesus to help you increase your ability to hear. Give more time to spending quiet moments in His presence to hear His voice. He wants to be your Good Shepherd.</div>

But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend. - Psalm 55:12-13<br><br>"You will always be attacked in the place of your inheritance," said the man sitting across the breakfast table. "God has called you to bring people together and to impact other people's lives as a result of this anointing in your life. You must make sure that you seek to maintain righteousness in all of your relationships." Those words came from someone who had the wisdom and authority to speak them to me.<br><br>I have had a number of close relationships that ended in betrayal. I am very loyal to my friends and those with whom I have covenant relationships. Yet there are times that no matter how righteous you are, when someone means to betray you, he will do it. Loving those who betray you is "graduate-level Christianity." The religious community and one of His closest friends betrayed Jesus. Those who were closest to David betrayed him. Joseph's own family betrayed him. Loving our enemies cannot be accomplished by mustering it up. It can only happen when we have come to a death in ourselves so that Christ can love through us. It is truly one of those acts of identifying with the cross.<br><br>If you are a leader, you can be sure God will allow you to experience betrayal. It is one of those courses in the Kingdom that may not be required until God has seen that you have successfully passed other tests. It is the most difficult and most gut wrenching of all tests. A godly response goes against all that is in us. Our natural response is to protect, retaliate, and retain unforgiveness and bitterness. Our natural response is satan's most powerful weapon; to overcome it requires much grace from God. Ask God to build His nature in you now so that when such attacks come, you will be aware that it is a test and you will respond in righteousness.<br></div>

He was responsible for many noteworthy projects that are described in detail in the Old Testament. We discover from the passage above that King Hezekiah had two major attributes that contributed to his success and prosperity: He sought God, and he worked wholeheartedly upholding God's laws.<br><br>Godly success involves a partnership between you and God. Success in God's economy means achieving the purpose for which God made you. That purpose can never be discovered without seeking Him with a whole heart.

Unless you seek Him, you may find yourself one day climbing to the top of the ladder only to find it leaning against the wrong wall.<br><br>What does it mean to seek God? It means creating time to sit before His throne in quiet places. It means reading His Word in order to know Him more intimately. It means developing an ear to hear His voice so that we know when to turn to the right or to the left. God desires to know you.<br><br>Are you willing to take the time to know Him?
