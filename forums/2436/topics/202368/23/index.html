Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete. - 2 John 12<br><br>It is easy to fire off a letter to someone in this age of electronic communication because of its expediency. In business we call this being efficient. However, there are times when nothing but a face-to-face meeting is the appropriate means of communication. We know that verbal skills are a very small portion of communication. Body language, voice tone, and our expressions make up the majority of our overall communication. This cannot be seen through a letter or electronic medium.<br><br>John knew that being face to face with those he ministered to was important. And for John, it meant some major trouble to get from one place to another. It wasn't as simple as getting into a car or hopping onto an airplane. John's desire and determination to visit and talk face to face reinforces the importance of one-on-one personal communication.<br><br>I once had to confront a businessman about some problems we were having in a business deal. He lived in another town. The negotiations had stalled to some degree. I could have attempted to solve the problem over the phone. But I realized the serious nature of the issues required a face-to-face meeting. I drove two hours to his office and met with him face to face. It meant all the difference. It demonstrated to my friend I was serious enough about solving the problem to take a day to come see him. It also showed I valued him and he was worth the effort. This resulted in him giving greater emphasis to the issue.<br><br>Next time a situation arises that requires more focused communication, consider whether the situation requires a personal visit. You may find this will be the key to resolving issues that otherwise might end in a stalemate.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God Only, You Can Trust "Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of Thee, yet will I never be offended"   (Matthew 26:33).<br><br>Why," cries one, "this is no promise of God." Just so, but it was a promise of man, and therefore it came to nothing. Peter thought that he was saying what he should assuredly carry out; but a promise which has no better foundation than a human resolve will fall to the ground. No sooner did temptations arise than Peter denied his Master and used oaths to confirm his denial. What is man's word? An earthen pot broken with a stroke. What is your own resolve? A blossom, which, with God's care, may come to fruit, but which, left<br>to itself, will fall to the ground with the first wind that moves the bough. On man's word hang only what it will bear. On thine own resolve depend not at all. On the promise of thy God hang time and eternity, this world and the next, thine all and the all of all thy beloved ones. This volume is a checkbook for believers, and this page is meant as a warning as<br>to what bank they draw upon and whose signature they accept. Rely upon Jesus without limit. Trust not thyself nor any horn of woman, beyond due bounds; but trust thou only and wholly in the LORD.<br><br>CH Spurgeon<br></div>

Many are celebrating our LORD's first coming this day; let us turn our thoughts to the promise of His second coming. This is as sure as the first advent and derives a great measure of its certainty from it. He who came as a lowly man to serve will assuredly come to take the reward of His service. He who came to suffer will not be slow in coming to reign. This is our glorious hope, for we shall share His joy. Today we are in our concealment and humiliation, even as He was while here below; but when He cometh it will be our manifestation, even as it will be His  revelation. Dead saints shall live at His appearing. The slandered and despised shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Then shall the saints appear as kings and priests, and the days of their mourning shall be ended. The long rest and inconceivable splendor of the millennial reign will be an  abundant recompense for the ages of witnessing and warring. Oh, that the LORD would come! He is coming! He is on the road and traveling quickly. The sound of His approach should be as music to our hearts! Ring out,<br>ye bells of hope!<br><br>CH SPURGEON</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Over Jordan with Singing "Thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee" (Deuteronomy 33:29). That archenemy, the devil, is a liar from the beginning; but he is so very plausible that, like mother Eve, we are led to believe him. Yet in our experience we shall prove him a liar. He says that we shall fall from grace, dishonor our profession, and perish with the doom of apostates; but, trusting in the LORD Jesus, we shall hold on our way and prove that Jesus loses none whom His Father gave Him. He tells us that our bread will fail, and we shall starve with our children; yet the Feeder of the ravens has not forgotten us yet, and He will never do so, but will prepare us a table in the presence of our enemies. He whispers that the LORD will not deliver us Out of the trial which is looming in the distance, and he threatens that the last ounce will break the camel's back. What a liar he is! For the LORD will never leave us or forsake us. "Let him deliver him now!" cries the false fiend: but the LORD will silence him by coming to our rescue. He takes great delight in telling us that death will prove too much for us. "How wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?"

The anchor which is left at home is of no use to the seaman in the hour of storm; the money which he used to have is of no worth to the debtor when a writ is out against him. Very few earthly helps could be called "very present": they are usually far in the seeking, far in the using, and farther still when once used. But as for the LORD our God, He is present when we seek Him, present when we need Him, and present when we have already enjoyed His aid. He is more than "present," He is very present. More present than the nearest friend can be, for He is in us in our trouble; more present than we are to ourselves, for sometimes we lack presence of mind. He is always present, effectually present, sympathetically present, altogether present. He is present now if this is a gloomy season. Let us rest ourselves upon Him.

His love to His chosen is according to His nature; His anger is only according to His office. He loves because He is love; He frowns because it is necessary for our good. He will come back to the place in which His heart rests, namely, His love to His own, and then He will take pity upon our griefs and end them. What a choice promise is this--"He will subdue our iniquities"! He will conquer them. They cry to enslave us, but the LORD will give us victory over them by His own right hand. Like the Canaanites, they shall be beaten, put under the yoke,<br>and ultimately slain. As for the guilt of our sins, how gloriously is that removed! "All their<br>sins"--yes, the whole host of them; "thou wilt cast"--only an almighty arm could perform such a wonder; "into the depths of the sea"--where Pharaoh and his chariots went down. Not into the shallows out of which they might be washed up by the tide, but into the "depths" shall our sins be hurled. They are all gone. They sank into the bottom like a stone. Hallelujah!

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>An horror of great darkness fell upon him. - Genesis 15:1</strong></span><br>Oswald Chambers<br><br>Whenever God gives a vision to a saint, He puts him, as it were, in the shadow of His hand, and the saintÂ’s duty is to be still and listen. There is a darkness which comes from excess of light, and then is the time to listen. Genesis 16 is an illustration of listening to good advice when it is dark instead of waiting for God to send the light. When God gives a vision and darkness follows, wait. God will make you in accordance with the vision He has given if you will wait His time. Never try and help God fulfil His word. Abraham went through thirteen years of silence, but in those years all self-sufficiency was destroyed; there was no possibility left of relying on common-sense ways. Those years of silence were a time of discipline, not of displeasure. Never pump up joy and confidence, but stay upon God (cf. Isaiah 1:10,11).<br><br>Have I any confidence in the flesh? Or have I got beyond all confidence in myself and in men and women of God; in books and prayers and ecstasies; and is my confidence placed now in God Himself, not in His blessings? Â“I am the Almighty GodÂ” - El-Shaddai, the All-Powerful God. The one thing for which we are all being disciplined is to know that God is real. As soon as God becomes real, other people become shadows. Nothing that other saints do or say can ever perturb the one who is built on God.<br><br>Oswald Chambers, My Utmost for His Highest<br></div>

No matter how much we sow in hope and prayer for God to deliver us from our troubles, eradicate our enemies, and change our lives, Â“what [we] sow [will] not [be] made alive unless it dies.Â” Until we are willing to die daily to who we used to beÂ—even to the parts of our old life that we would really like to keep aroundÂ—a life of fruitfulness in Messiah will be forever beyond our reach.<br><br>To live in Messiah, we must sow ourselves in death. In that grave, we are to leave everythingÂ—good and badÂ—Â“sow[ing] not the body that will be, but bare grain.Â” The Â“body that will beÂ” grows from the seed sown in nakednessÂ—no faÃ§ades, no baggage, and no expectationsÂ… save the expectation that we will have new life, and we will be made alive in Messiah.<br><br>What fruit will we bear, what harvest will we reap, as long as we remain alive to ourselves? Indeed, what kind of life can it beÂ… Â“unless it diesÂ…Â”?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kings and Priests<br><br>by Os Hillman<br><br>And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. - Revelation 5:10 KJV<br><br>The Bible describes two distinct roles in the Old Testament-kings and priests. Kings were the rulers; priests were the religious leaders. The New Testament reveals we all are kings and priests because of the redemptive work of Christ.<br><br>Today, kings are most often represented by business and political leaders, while pastors represent the priestly roles. God calls each of us to fulfill both roles in our lives today. However, our vocational roles often create a division that is misunderstood by both workplace believers and pastors. These misunderstandings have led to a weakened and less effective Church.<br><br>Pastors have been guilty of viewing their workplace believers as dollar signs. They sometimes see them for what they can contribute to their ministries instead of equipping them to use their gifts and talents to impact the workplace believer's mission field-their workplace.<br><br>Workplace believers have tried to get pastors to operate their churches like businesses, and have used their worldly ways for spiritual purposes. They often view the pastor as the primary ministry worker instead of taking on the responsibility themselves to do the work of the ministry.<br><br>This is a grievous sin that exists in the Body of Christ, and it requires repentance from both groups. Unless we recognize this, we will never see the reality of revival that God wants to bring to the business community, and pastors will fail to gain an ally to fully complete the work of the Church in their community.<br><br>Are you a pastor who has failed to see the calling that workplace believers have received to the workplace? If so, ask God to forgive you for viewing your workplace believers as those to be used for your own purposes.<br><br>Are you a workplace believer who sees your church as another business to be run based on worldly measurements? Do you see the pastor's role as one who is primarily responsible for the work of the ministry? If so, you must repent and ask God to forgive you of this unbiblical view. God has called both of you to fulfill His purposes together through your gifts and talents.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><span class="large"><strong>Whole Justice</strong></span><br><br>At the onset of this week's portion, Yehuda pleads with Yoseph, Egypt's viceroy, for mercy. Binyamin was framed for a crime he did not commit. Yoseph's agents had planted a silver goblet in the saddle-pack of Binyamin the youngest of Yaakov's children. Now Yoseph wants to mete justice, holding Binyamin to be his slave forever. And Yehuda will not let that come to pass.<br><br>And so, Yehuda begs for mercy. Even though it would have been the absolute truth, Yehuda's arguments do not utilize the lawyer's ubiquitous, "He did not do it; he was framed!"<br><br>Instead he employs a different approach: he asks for mercy, not for the accused, Binyamin, but rather for his and Binyamin's father, Yaakov.<br><br>"And now, if I come to your servant my father and the youth is not with us -- since his soul is so bound up with his soul: It will happen that when he sees the youth is missing he will die, and your servants will have brought down the hoariness of your servant our father in sorrow to the grave. . . . For how can I go up to my father if the youth is not with me, lest I see the evil that will befall my father!" (Genesis 44)<br><br>In truth, however, we must understand why Yehuda presented a case for Yaakov rather than for Binyamin. In modern terms, Yoseph could have easily answered, "You are the thief. Your father is not my problem."<br><br>More than twenty-five years ago, a particular Rabbi, of blessed memory, Rosh Yeshiva of Telshe Yeshiva, Cleveland, moved to Israel to establish a branch of Telshe Yeshiva there. During his tenure in Israel, he developed an extremely close relationship with the elder Rosh Yeshiva of Ponevez, Rabbi Eliezer Menachem Shach, of blessed memory. He often discussed matters pertaining to Klal Yisrael together with Rabbi Shach.<br><br>Once Rabbi Shach was disturbed by an endorsement that that Rabbi had made regarding a particular cause. Rabbi Shach felt that the Rabbi had made an error in judgment and Rabbi Shach decided to visit him personally to discuss the matter with him.<br><br>Rav Shach made the long trip from B'nai Beraq to that particular Rabbi's apartment in the village of Telshe Stone, (Abu Gush) on the outskirts of Jerusalem. He knocked on the Rabbi's door and was greeted by the Rebbitzin with surprise and with the utmost respect.<br><br>She offered him some tea as he sat down together with the Rabbi in the dining room of the small apartment. With the Rabbi's wife in the background, Rav Shach began his conversation discussing the destroyed world of Lithuanian Jewry. The Rabbi, a student of Telshe Yeshiva in Lithuania, was well acquainted with pre-Holocaust Europe. The Rebbitzin, herself a native of Lithuania, was intrigued as Rav Shach and her husband moved from topic to topic. The talk continued on every important topic - except one. Rav Shach never even brought up the intended topic of his visit.<br><br>After 45 minutes, Rav Shach excused himself and left the the Rabbi's apartment apartment.<br><br>Rav Shach's driver and confidante asked the Rosh Yeshiva how the meeting went, and if that Rabbi was receptive of the criticism.<br><br>Rabbi Shach explained, "I was there for nearly an hour, but I did not even broach the topic. You see, the Rebbitzin was in hearing range. How would I even think of criticizing her husband where his Rebbitzin could hear it? And so, I decided not to bring up the topic at all."<br><br>Every sentence involves many more parties than the accused. Yehuda was trying to give Yoseph a sense of perspective about to the ramifications of his judgment. He was not only going to sentence a young man to slavery, he would sentence his father to death. He pleaded for Yoseph to encompass more than just Binyamin into his decision. He asked him to think of the effect that the sentence would have on his elderly father.<br><br>In our own lives, we are constantly judging. We formulate opinions and we act. Our job, however, is to extend our vision peripherally. . Only the Almighty is the true Judge whose sentences encompass both the culpable party and all those who are in his or her sphere. However, as mortals, in every conclusion we make we must also try to remember that our actions surpass the intended party. In our quest for true justice, we must try to mete comprehensive justice as well.<br><br>Good Shabbos,<br><br>Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>All in a Day's Work</strong><br>Revenge. Though the Torah warns us against acting on our emotions, it's hard to control the desire. In fact, a dogma of modern society preaches to us not to get mad, rather to get even.<br><br>But Yoseph discloses his real identity in this week's portion, and despite a 22-year backdrop filled with excuses for anger, revenge, and retribution, he stays calm and fulfilled. Surely, we should expect to find harsh words of criticism if not acts of payback. But we don't. After Yoseph reveals his identity, and the brothers are shocked, rather than chastising his brothers, Yoseph appeases them! "Come close to me if you please, and they came close." And he said, "I am Joseph your brother -- it is me whom you sold into Egypt. And now, be not distressed, nor reproach yourselves for having sold me here, for it was to be a provider that G-d sent me ahead of youÂ“(Genesis 45:4-5). He explains to them that the entire scenario was not even their doing but part of a Divine plan to contend with the world-hunger. "Thus Hashem has sent me ahead of you to insure your survival in the land and to sustain you for a momentous deliverance. And now -- it was not you who sent me here, but G-d; He has made me father to Pharaoh, master of his entire household, and ruler throughout the entire land of EgyptÂ” (ibid v6-7). What type of man has the capacity not only to ignore horrible injustice totally, but to revel in it, saying that it was all meant to be, without the slightest display of bitterness or animosity? It takes an unique attitude about life.<br><br>Joel Mandel and Julius Rosenzweig have a large electrical supply house in Long Island City, NY. Their vast warehouse occupies over a million cubic feet of space containing thousands of different electrical components, from transformers as large as the average-size garage to tiny cathodes that could dance on the head of a pin.<br><br>It was a couple of years ago when some electrical doo-dad, that seemed to be a vital organ of one of my children's battery-operated what-nots, went on the blink. With zero electrical know-how, I decided to bring the component to my friends at Globe Electrical Supply and maybe they could find me a replacement.<br><br>Weaving my way through a labyrinth of shelves, boxes, and drawers, I climbed some metal steps and made my way to the old office that appeared out of a 1950s Hollywood set. An old wooden desk was the pedestal for a dusty computer that probably strained harder than their human principals to maintain the vast inventory. I showed the part to Joel, who looked at the tiny part and smiled. He called over one of the workers, "Warren," he said, "please get the rabbi aÂ…" I couldn't make out the exact name, but it sounded like flux-capacitator, though I highly doubt that my kid's toy was dying for lack of a lack of a flux-capacitator!<br><br>Like a Tomahawk missile directed toward a predestined mark, Warren took the injured electrical component, weaved through the myriad rooms, the barrage of boxes, and an almost unlimited array of electrical paraphernalia.<br><br>Homing in on the exact location, Warren scaled a ladder that looked as if it could have been used to wash the windows of a Manhattan skyscraper, and about 30 feet off the ground, with amazing agility and precise guidance, he reached for his target -- a small cardboard box. Its edges were yellowed with age, but I knew it had not been touched in five years. He placed his hand into the box and plucked out a component, which exactly matched my broken one.<br><br>As if he had rehearsed this scene from the day he started working, he held the component between his thumb and forefinger, then smiled, opened the human vise, letting the piece drop into my palm. "Here's the sucker!"<br><br>Stunned at both the accuracy and speed of the retrieval, I reacted as if I had just seen a minor miracle. "Warren!" I exclaimed, "how'd you do that?"<br><br>"Do what?" he asked with a shrug.<br><br>"Do what?" I repeated with an air of incredulity. "You just found a microscopic part hidden like a needle in all the hay in Kansas! And you knew exactly where it was."<br><br>Warren just shrugged. "I didn't do nothin' special. That's my job!"<br><br>When a person understands his mission, no portion of its fulfillment merits undue emotion. In Pirkei Avos, 2:9 Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai tells us, "If you have learned much Torah, do not pride yourself in it, for this is the purpose for which you were created." If a person thinks "that's my job" about his every good deed, if his mission is clearly mapped in front of him, then all obstacles become insignificant pittances, easily overcome and able to be ignored because after all, they are in fact all in a day's work.<br><br>In memory of Joseph K.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Uneasy Questions</strong><br><br>In most surprising ending in a Biblical saga, 11 men stood before their youngest brother, Yoseph, humiliated and threatened. Yoseph, in his role as viceroy of Egypt, had incarcerated Binyamin and left his siblings fighting him for his release. Otherwise, they would have to answer an aging father who would certainly die if Binyamin would not come home. They pleaded, begged and cajoled -- then they threatened to go to war over Binyamin. Yoseph is impressed.<br><br>Suddenly he reveals himself as the brother they had sold to slavery 22 years ago.<br><br>"I am Yoseph," he declares. "Is my father still alive?" The brothers stood in shock and disbelief.<br><br>Many commentaries ask why Yoseph asked a question when he knew the answer. His brothers spoke all along about their father and the anguish he would sustain lest Binyamin not be returned to him.<br><br>What message was Yoseph sending?<br><br>A man walked into the office of Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn with tears flowing down his cheeks. "Rebbe," he pleaded, "I need your help. I have no means of supporting my family, and my wife has gone into severe depression as the doctors suspect one of our children may have leukemia. I am at the verge of bankruptcy and only despair looms on the horizon."<br><br>The Rebbe's sympathy was obvious. Quickly he took all the money that he had in his desk and then summoned his sexton. "Have you any cash on you?" the Rebbe asked. "I need whatever you can spare to help a Jew in trouble."<br><br>The gabbai (sexton) responded to his mentor's request and handed the sum of nearly $2,000 to the Rebbe.<br><br>After the indigent man left the house the Gabbai innocently asked the Rebbe, "That was not for the man who just left here -- or was it?"<br><br>"Surely," exclaimed the Rebbe. He has nine children, including one who may be very ill. His wife is on the verge of a breakdown and he is in a state of despair."<br><br>"Despair?" exclaimed the sexton. "Nine children? That man has two kids, a wife who shops nicely on the Avenue and makes a modest living. Things may be a little tight -- but he's not at all desperate!<br><br>"You mean his wife is not ill?"<br><br>"No!"<br><br>"His child is not ill?"<br><br>"No!"<br><br>He is not even going bankrupt?"<br><br>"By no means!"<br><br>"Wonderful," the Rebbe smiled, "I could not bear to hear the pain of such terrible news. How good is it to hear that one less Jew is suffering." The next day the Rebbe called in his Gabbai and returned the $2,000 he had borrowed from him.<br><br>In revealing himself to his brothers, Yoseph had choice words to tell them. He could have chided them, taunted them and called their misdeeds upon them. He didn't. All he wanted to know is, "How is father feeling? Is it really true that he survived the tragedy of my sale? Is he still able to come see me?"<br><br>Often when we are wronged we have opportunities to harp on the conduct of those who harmed us. In his opening revelation Yoseph didn't. He picked up the pieces. He did not choose to discuss the past deeds that were dead and gone. He just wanted to speak about the future, his father, and his destiny.<br><br>Good Shabbos<br>Rabbi Mordecai Kamenetzky<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Eliyahu Hoffmann<br>Ruble Trouble<br><br>Parshas Vayigash begins with the brother's - with Yehuda acting as their spokesman - embittered plea for the release of their brother Binyamin.<br><br>"Therefore," Yehuda pleads, "please allow your servant [Yehuda] to remain instead of the youth [Binyamin] as a slave to my master, and let the lad return with his brothers. For how can I go up to my father if the youth is not with me - lest I witness the adversity that will befall my father! (44:33-34)"<br><br>Yosef, the viceroy of Egypt, who had until this point been going through elaborate machinations in order to conceal his true identity, while at the same time putting his brothers through what must have been one of the most befuddling and troublesome ordeal of their lives, suddenly decided that the time had come to reveal himself to them.<br><br>"'Remove everyone from before me!'" he cried out. "And no one remained present when Yosef revealed himself to his brothers." (45:1)<br><br>As one learns through the Chumash, one can not help questioning Yosef's actions. Mefarshim (commentators) explain that he did not reveal himself immediately to his brothers because he had seen in his prophetic dream that all eleven of his brothers would bow down to him; thus he knew that he must succeed in bringing Binyamin to Egypt before he could divulge his secret. Binyamin had indeed come, bowed down, and been sent off, all without Yosef revealing himself, only to be dragged back to Egypt under false accusations. Now, as his brother Yehuda stands and pleads for his release, Yosef finally relents and reveals his true identity.<br><br>What were Yosef's motives? Why could he not have revealed himself to the brothers earlier? What had suddenly changed that now permitted him to let down his veil?<br><br>Reb Noach, a disciple of the holy Rebbe of Apta (the "Ohev Yisrael"), had once been a wealthy and successful merchant. Now, as he dejectedly stood before his Rebbe, he was broke. "All I have left," he tearfully told the tzaddik, "is one ruble - the last reminder of my better days. And my daughter has reached marriageable age, yet I have nothing with which to marry her off!"<br><br>"Tell me," said the Ohev Yisrael, "how much does a man like you need for a dowry and wedding expenses, so that you can marry-off your daughter respectfully?"<br><br>Reb Noach sighed from the depths of his heart. "One thousand rubles, holy Rebbe."<br><br>"And how much do you have?" asked the tzaddik<br><br>"I already told the Rebbe - I have but one ruble left from all my years of hard work!"<br><br>"Fine," said the tzaddik, "it is enough! Hashem's blessing can rest upon one ruble just as well as a larger amount. Go in peace, and accept the first business offer that comes your way. And remember: Yeshuas Hashem ke-heref ayin, Hashem's salvation comes in the blink of an eye!"<br><br>Not long afterwards, as he travelled home, Reb Noach stopped over in an inn to rest his aching feet. Though the food being served made his mouth water, he could hardly spend his last ruble on it, and preferred instead to partake of the stale bread he carried in his sack. Some well-to-do merchants sat next to him enjoying a sumptuous meal. Noticing the raggedly dressed pauper sitting next to them, they decided to amuse themselves. "Tell me, my fellow Jew," one of them said, "you have the appearance of a merchant. Perhaps you would be interested in a business proposition?!"<br><br>Startled, Reb Noach suddenly remembered the tzaddik's words. "Yes!" he replied enthusiastically.<br><br>"And how much money do you have at your disposal?" they asked. "One ruble!" Reb Noach replied without hesitation.<br><br>"One whole ruble!" they mocked. "Let's see what kind of a deal we can strike with a wealthy merchant who possesses one whole ruble. Reb Yid, I am sure," one of the merchants piped-in, "that for one ruble you could do no better than to purchase my share in the World to Come! Do we have a deal - your one ruble for my Olam Ha-Ba?!"<br><br>'The first business offer,' reb Noach reminded himself of his Rebbe's words. "Yes," he responded, "I will do it." Eager to prolong their amusement, the merchants went about arranging the writing of a legal contract, and the deal was done.<br><br>The wealthy merchants were still basking in their revelry when the wife of the merchant who had made the sale entered the room. Seeing her husband's face red with laughter, she now wished to know what was going on. Priding himself on his cleverness and wit, he related to her exactly what had happened. By the time he finished his story to the laughter of his peers, however, his face had turned ashen white. He could tell by the deathly serious expression of his wife, and by her blazing eyes, that his idea of fun pleased her not the least. Nor could he do as he please, for his wife was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and everything he had was ultimately her's.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ruble Trouble Part2<br><br>A tense silence now came over the once-merry group. All at once, the woman began pouring out her wrath at her husband in front of the entire crowd - the empty-headed yokel who could find nothing better to do than to give-away his insignificant portion in Olam Ha-Ba! "You fool!" she cried, "How does a Jew dare to make sport of the most important thing he possesses! Take me to the Rav immediately - I refuse to be married to an imbecile like you who is so disconnected from Yiddishkeit that he does not even have a share in the World to Come!"<br><br>Overwhelmed with shame, the merchant realized that his only hope was to buy back his portion. Reb Noach was searched for, found, and brought back to their table. "Hey, Reb Yid," called out one of the merchants, "cute joke you played on our friend! Now give him back his share in the World to Come!"<br><br>Noticing the merchant's hysterical wife standing over him, Reb Noach began to grasp what had occurred. Slowly, he spoke up. "Honored gentlemen," he began in a composed voice, "I ask all of you here to bear witness to the fact that the transaction between myself and the merchant was no joke nor prank. Indeed, I have the contract to show for it. That is not to say, however, that for the right price I would not be willing to relinquish my purchase and give him back his share in the World to Come..."<br><br>The merchant pleaded with Reb Noach to sell it back to him; he would even pay him fifty rubles - a five-thousand percent profit - if only he would relent. But Reb Noach was adamant - one thousand rubles was his price, not one ruble less. "Understand, honored merchant," said Reb Noach, "that I was once a highly respected and successful merchant. Then one day, the wheel turned, and I lost all my money. This is how I fell into the state in which you now find me. Just recently, when I could not gather a sum sufficient for a dowry for my daughter, and other wedding expenses, I travelled to the holy tzaddik, the Ohev Yisrael, to ask for his advice. It was he who instructed me to accept the first business offer that came my way. It is clear to me that Hashem has guided my steps and brought me here - and that the money for my daughter's wedding lies with you."<br><br>The couple could not speak. Tears welled up in the merchant's eyes, although ostensibly he had never before experienced such emotions. Without hesitation, he withdrew a fold of bills from his pocket, and counted out one thousand rubles into the hands of Reb Noach. The merchant took the contract from Reb Noach, and tore it into shreds. "Even without this contract," he said, "it is worth investing a thousand rubles for the mitzvah of hachnassas kallah (providing for a bride)!"<br><br>His wife, who had been standing at his side the entire time, glanced at him in amazement. She was prepared to swear that in all his life, this was the first time that such selfless and noble thoughts had ever entered his mind.<br><br>"I wish to meet the tzaddik that blessed you," the merchant's wife said to Reb Noach. "Perhaps we too will merit receiving his blessing." Reb Noach could not refuse, and together they made their way back to the Rebbe. The tzaddik received his visitors with a shining countenance; he had already known of the rich merchant's noble deed, and bestowed the couple with many blessings.<br><br>Before they left, the merchant's wife turned to the tzaddik and said, "Holy Rebbe, there is one thing I would like to know: Is my husband's portion in Olam Ha-Ba really worth the thousand rubles he paid for it?"<br><br>"If the truth be told," he said, "at first, when he sold it, it was not even worth the one ruble he received for it. But now, that he has merited giving one thousand rubles for the mitzvah of hachnassas kallah, its value is so great that it is impossible to estimate!" [Adapted from A Share in the World to Come, Menachem Gerlitz, HaModia Vayechi 5759]<br><br>Sometimes, one doesn't fully grasp the true value of what he has until it is taken from him, and he is forced to fend for it in order to get it back. Only then does he truly appreciate what he has lost. If, in the end, he succeeds in re-acquiring that which he squandered, it takes on greater meaning than it ever would have had he never lost it in the first place.<br><br>Perhaps this can help us understand Yosef's motives. Yosef knew that his brother's had done teshuvah and repented for their having sold him. Yet he knew that in order for them to fully appreciate their sin - having sold their own brother into slavery - they would have to go through the same ordeal again, this time battling to regain that which had been taken from them. When Yosef saw their anguish and burning desire to get Binyamin back, he understood that their teshuvah was now complete, and wasted no time in revealing himself to them.<br></div>

The SifseÂ’ Chachamim offers two different approaches to RashiÂ’s explanation as to why the Egyptians are inclined to abhor shepherds. 1) The Egyptians know that these creatures that they hold in such high esteem and promote as gods are worthless and therefore due to their own shame they tend to hate those who have familiarity with the emptiness of their practice. 2) That the Egyptians would revere the Children of Israel as gods because as shepherds, they exercise control over the creatures they idolize. These seem to be mutually exclusive explanations. Either the Egyptians really believed in those little sheep or they didnÂ’t. Can both be true?<br><br>There is a story about a king that went to investigate if anyone in his kingdom might be happier than he. So he dressed up as a commoner and listened by the windows of his subjects for their complaints. Convinced that he was the most happy he headed home. Along the way he was pulled to the sound of a joyous violin. Peaking into the window he beheld an elderly Jew happy as could be. The king plotted to sabotage the joy of the Jew. He pretended to be a beggar, and learned of the JewÂ’s means of livelihood. The very next day the king outlawed the JewÂ’s profession. The Jew found a new way to earn a living. When the king came out that night to witness the wails of desperation he was surprised to hear that joyous violin and behold the ever radiant countenance Jew. The king repeated his effort again and again only to find out the next night that the Jew found a different way.<br><br>The king was growing more desperate. One night the Jew told him that he had found a secure job in the kingÂ’s army as a guard. He confided in him that in order to get paid on time though he had first to carve a wooden sword to leave in the sheath and then pawn temporarily the real metal one till pay day at the end of the month. Could the king outlaw his own army? What was he to do?<br><br>The next day when the elder Jew went to sign in for his daily assignment he was surprised to find out that he had been ordered to go directly to the kingÂ’s palace. There in the opulent setting he failed to recognize the beggar who had been his guest each night that week dressed in royal robes. There the king presented a disheveled man that the king declared to be a thief and he ordered the now nervous Jew to take out his sword and execute the man according to the law of the land. The Jew hemmed and hawed and questioned the certainty of the verdict whereupon the king ordered him to kill or be killed for disobeying his orders. The Jew knew that if he would expose his sword he would be similarly charged.<br><br>Then with help from heaven in the last instant he asked the king if it would be alright if he first said a prayer. The king impatiently agreed and the old Jew began to recite aloud, Â“G-d Almighty, my earthly king has ordered me to execute this man which I am ready to do, but if he is really innocent and not deserving of this punishment then perform an open miracle before the eyes of all assembled here now and turn my sword into wood. With that he pulled out his wooden sword and all were astonished by the apparent miracle while the king was shamed into silence.<br><br>So Joseph estimated correctly that either way his family would be safe to declare themselves as shepherds. 1) The blind adherents to Egyptian culture would offer extra honor to those who control at will their gods. 2) While those who know in their heart of hearts the real emptiness of their belief system would be quietly abhorrent of those who know.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Number One Priority<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>And he sent Yehuda ahead of him to Yosef (Â“lehorosÂ”) to prepare (or literally to teach) ahead of him in Goshen, and they arrived in the Goshen region. (Breishis 46:2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Â“LehorosÂ” ahead of him: What does Â“lehorosÂ” mean? Rabbi Nechemia says: Â“To prepare for him a house of study where he could instruct Torah and where the Tribes could study the TorahÂ….to teach you that every place that Jacob went he was involved with Torah just as his fathers were. (Breishis Rabba)<br><br>See how much is packed into one word, Â“lehorosÂ”. At first glance it looks like just a nice thing to send Yehuda in advance to establish a learning center but Â“why not just wait till he gets there and set things up later?Â” Why send Yehuda ahead? That place of learning must be pretty important.<br><br>I was involved one winter with a group of Hebrew Day School students that we were hoping would choose to continue past 8th grade and on to Yeshiva High School. We went away together for Shabbos and as the sole chaperone I had to keep these energetic teenagers engaged in productive activities a whole Shabbos long. I wasnÂ’t convinced they had the patience or I had the skills for what we were about to enter. I called a veteran Shabbaton leader and asked for advice. One game/activity/workshop he suggested went like this:<br><br>I had written on each of fifty or so index cards before Shabbos single statements such as, Kosher Pizza Shop, Land of Israel, Jewish Community Center, Torah Learning, Israeli Dancing, Israel Parade, Jewish Cooking Classes, Bar Miztvah Lessons, Yiddish-Culture, Ulpan, Holocaust-Museum etc. The deck of cards was shuffled and dealt out to the students who were divided into three groups. I had also prepared on a large piece of oak-tag an outline of a pyramid of sorts with boxes the size of the index cards. One box was on the top with a #1 written boldly within. The next row had two boxes, #2 and #3 and the third row you guessed had three boxes etc. Each group was instructed to work together as a team that has been put in charge of the survival of the Jewish People. They are asked to place the cards that rank highest as the best strategy to advance the survival of the Jewish People. They are to be ready to defend and debate with the other groups the reasons for their prioritization. I was the moderator. It was surprised to observe the process that unfolded. YouÂ’ll never guess which card found its way to the top spot when the dust of debate has settled. When given that sober responsibility of advancing the cause of the Jewish Nation they all agreed that the most critical feature would have to be establishing Yeshivas. Amazing!<br><br>With the benefit of hindsight looking over the demographics of the American-Jewish landscape one can observe how many Jewish communities and individuals have been lost along the way. In certain places there were hundreds of synagogues but a generation later, a mere turn of the page, and tragically these synagogues and their members are no more.<br><br>Not wishing to diminish the importance of a Schul but it has not proven adequate by itself to promote a second or third generation of devotees. A Schul alone is a like a 10 minute lube job. People stop off for short periods of time to tune up intermittently. ThatÂ’s nice and valuable for spiritual maintenance. If thereÂ’s a Scholarly- Rabbi then itÂ’s like a having a gas station with a sign that reads; Â“Mechanic on PremisesÂ”. If something breaks there is someone there to help fix it. The individual seeking that help can travel a little further. When thereÂ’s a Yeshiva in town then thatÂ’s analogous to living in Detroit Michigan or wherever the next, newest, and current model of cars are rolling off the assembly line. ThereÂ’s the future!<br><br>It can be openly observed that only those communities that established Yeshivas have remained and grow today, while other places have emptied out. Jacob understood this all too well and entering exile this is his number one priority!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Lifesavers<br>By Rabbi Shlomo Jarcaig<br><br>Upon receiving word that Yosef (Joseph) was alive and well in Egypt, Yaakov (Jacob) was initially skeptical. But when "he saw the wagons ("agalos" in Hebrew) that Yosef had sent to transport him, then the spirit of their father Yaakov was revived." (Beraishis/Genesis 45:27) Rashi explains the significance of the wagons was that as Yosef departed from Yaakov's home they were learning about the mitzvah of Egla Arufa (see Devarim/Deuteronomy 21:1-9), the heifer that is decapitated by the Elders of the closest city to a corpse that is found between cities ("egla" and "agalo" share a common spelling). Yosef sent wagons to transmit the message to his father that he had internalized and continued to live by the lessons that he had been taught as a lad.<br><br>Maharal (acronym for Rabbi Yehuda Loewe, 1526-1609, one of the seminal figures in Jewish thought in the last half millennium; Chief Rabbi of Moravia, Posen and Prague; author of works in all fields of Torah) asks the significance of this particular mitzvah being the last thing Yaakov and Yosef had learned together. Surely it could not have been coincidental, for Yosef was so certain that Yaakov would remember that that was the last thing they had learned. Rabbi Loewe explains that part of the mitzvah of Egla Arufa is that, after the animal is axed, the elders of the city wash their hands over the animal and declare that they did not spill the blood of the murdered individual. The Talmud (Sotah 46b) notes the peculiarity of this declaration: would one really think that the elders of the city murdered the stranger? The Talmud explains that the elders are declaring that they were unaware of this man's presence in the city, for had they been aware of his presence, they surely would not let him leave without accompanying him for the beginning of his journey, for no harm will befall one who is accompanied as he leaves a city. Maharal explains that the accompaniment upon departure indicates that he is a recognizable member of the greater society. As one making an impact on the society, he merits a heavenly protection. However, one who is not accompanied is not designated as a significant member of the society at large. If society does not value what he has to offer, they have, in a sense, killed him as they have negated his ability to contribute. Thus, the elders must declare that they did not kill him, because by ignoring his value and allowing him to leave unattended, they would have, in a sense, killed him.<br><br>Maharal concludes that as father and son reached Chevron, Yosef did not want to inconvenience Yaakov any further. Yaakov then taught him the lesson of Egla Arufa, that one who does not escort is compared to a murderer. Twenty two years later, Yosef's wagons stated: "Dear Father, you escorted me. As per your teaching, I merited divine supervision, and I have survived this ordeal unscathed." When Yaakov witnessed Yosef's demonstration of this lesson, his spirit was revived.<br><br>In our life's effort to emulate the Divine, we must appreciate that we, too, have the ability to provide others with the gift of life. We know so many who question their value or import in this world, people who feel alone and downtrodden. When we take the time to demonstrate to them that we value them as people, and what they can contribute to the world around us, we do not simply offer them an emotional boost, we literally give them life.<br><br>Have a Good Shabbos!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><strong>Success by Whose Standards? </strong><br><br>"Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, 'so says your son Yosef, "G-d has placed me as master over all Egypt -- descend to me, do not delay!"'" [45:9]<br><br>Yaakov's son Yosef, after disappearing 22 years earlier, sends a message of consolation to his father. Yosef tells his father that he is now the ruler of Egypt, in power if not name, and invites his family to escape the famine in the Land of Israel by coming down to him.<br><br>Rabbi Yaakov Neiman, author of Darche Mussar, wonders what sort of consolation Yosef is providing when he touts his leading position with the Egyptians.<br><br>Imagine an upper-class American family whose young son disappears from their penthouse apartment in Manhattan. Twenty years later, Western Union delivers a telegram: their son is alive! Their son, Andrew, goes on to say that he now leads the largest Aboriginal tribe in Western Australia, and looks forward to holding a feast in their honor complete with rare iguana meat and a prized kangaroo.<br><br>Is that a consolation? Of course they are happy to know he's alive. But given their own aspirations and vision of what it means to be successful, is the fact that he's a leading Aborigine something that brightens their hearts?<br><br>If we look in Jewish sources, we are taught that our objective in life should be spiritual rather than material greatness. By that standard, why would Yaakov be happy to hear that his son was a viceroy? Why should he be any more delighted knowing his son is a leading Egyptian, than a tony pair of Manhattanites would be to learn their son is an Aboriginal tribal chieftain? On the contrary, if anything his disappointment and heartache should be all the greater.<br><br>So Rabbi Neiman explains: the key here is not the news that Yosef delivered, but rather how he phrased it. "G-d has placed me as master over all Egypt."<br><br>When a person attains a high position, it is normal for him to mention who appointed him, or who elected him, or how he managed to get there. Yosef, however, says nothing about Pharoah. He attributes everything to G-d.<br><br>This being the case, we can understand why this was such good news to Yaakov. After so many years, and after Yosef was tested in so many different ways, having literally experienced both the lowest rank in an Egyptian prison, and the heights of rulership -- still, nothing has shaken the knowlege of G-d that he acquired in his father's house. He remained the holy individual that he had been. That is the news that Yosef knew would come as a tremendous delight to his father.<br><br>We, too, can decide which forms of greatness we care to pursue, and whose influences will rule our lives. Given a much greater choice of influences than Yosef, we should take advantage of every opportunity to choose the good!<br><br>Good Shabbos,<br><br>Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br></div>
