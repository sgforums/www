            <div class='col-md body'>Choose Light<br>What is the worst calamity that can befall a person? What agonies are the most difficult to endure? To find the answer, we need only look at the plagues that afflicted the Egyptians when they refuse to let the Jewish people out of bondage.<br><br>The Ten Plagues were designed to break down the stubborn resistance of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Each successive plague turned up the pressure another notch or two higher, until Pharaoh, no longer bear the pain, finally capitulated. The final and most crushing blow was the death of the firstborn. The runner-up in sheer torture was the ninth plague, which enveloped Egypt in such a dense, palpable darkness that all the people were completely immobilized. The agony of a prisoner in solitary confinement does not compare to the living death that gripped the benighted Egyptians.<br><br>While all the Egyptians were trapped in the darkness, life for the Jewish people continued as usual. As with all the other plagues, they were completely impervious to the effects of the catastrophes to which Egypt was being subjected. And yet, the Torah tells us that during the plague of darkness Â“the Jewish people had light in all their dwelling places.Â” Why was it necessary to tell us that the Jewish people were unaffected by the darkness? Furthermore, what is the significance of their having light in Â“their dwelling placesÂ”? Surely, they enjoyed light wherever they were.<br><br>Earlier in Genesis (28:10), we read that Â“Jacob departed from Beersheba and went to Harran.Â” The Midrash observes that the Torah finds it appropriate to mention his point of departure in addition to his destination point. This teaches us that Â“when a righteous person is in a city he represents its glory, light and beauty, and when he departs, its glory, light and beauty are removed.Â” What is the significance of this redundant language?<br><br>The commentators explain that all too often we do not appreciate what we have until we lose it. When do people realize that the righteous person is the glory of his city? When he departs and the glory is removed.<br><br>In Egypt as well, the Jewish people did not appreciate fully the wonderful gift of light until the plague of darkness struck Egypt. Watching the Egyptians immobilized by the darkness, they were suddenly extremely grateful that they had light to illuminate their lives.<br><br>On a more mystical level, the commentators see darkness and light as metaphors for the Egyptian and Jewish cultures. Egyptian society, steeped in superstition, magic and idolatry, was blind to the Presence of the Creator in the world. It was a place of darkness. The plague of darkness tapped into the Egyptian way of life and produced a physical manifestation of the spiritual darkness. And the severity of the plague was clear proof of the extent to which the spiritual light had been extinguished in Egypt. The absence of spirituality immobilizes a person and prevents him from moving forward.<br><br>When the Jewish people perceived the spiritual blight of the Egyptians, they recognized the Presence of the Creator in every grain of sand, every blade of grass, and this profound faith illuminated their world. The purity of life in Â“the Jewish dwellings,Â” therefore, shone with a transcendent light that reflected the inner spirituality of the Jewish people.<br><br>A young student was sitting in the back of the classroom and daydreaming. At the front of the room, the teacher was explaining the intricacies of a difficult subject, but the student paid no attention. He was lost in the faraway world of his imagination.<br><br>Suddenly, he heard another student speaking louldly and disrupting the class. The teacher asked the troublemaker to be quiet, but to no avail.<br><br>The daydreamerÂ’s interest was piqued. He ears perked up, attuned to every word that transpired in the classroom. He listened to the teacher trying to convey important ideas, and he listened with revulsion as the troublemaker blotted out the teacherÂ’s words with his disrespectful noise.<br><br>How foolish IÂ’ve been, thought the daydreamer. My teacher is telling us such important things, and I wasnÂ’t paying attention. Unfortunately, it took the troublemakerÂ’s antics to make me aware of what I was missing.<br><br>In our own lives, we sometimes become so caught up in the hustlke and bustle of daily life that we lose sight of the deeper truths of life, of a sense of which things that are important and which are not. But then when we see the extreme degradation of the society in which we live, we are snapped back to reality and regain our innate appreciation for Jewish values and ideals. It is better, of course, never to lose sight in the first place, not to wait for the darkness of others to inspire us to choose light.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can A Person Sleep For Seventy Years?<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br><br>How odd it feels to look out at a frozen landscape of trees standing as skeleton-like statues, knowing that it is time to celebrate the Â“New Year for TreesÂ”- Tu BÂ’Shevat. It may make us wonder aloud as we crunch on carobs and down some dates, Â“WhatÂ’s wrong with this picture?Â”<br><br>The appointed season for the Â“New Year for TreesÂ” is, on a practical level, a fiscal cut off point to determine which fruits belong to which year. It occurs at that time when the trees are ready to blossom as winterÂ’s water graduates to become syrup through the xylem and phylum.<br><br>The Talmud relates a famous incident regarding Choni Hamagel. He was troubled by a verse we are all familiar with: Â“Shir HamaalosÂ…When Hashem returns the captivity of Tzion, we will have been like dreamers.Â” Since the time of the exile between the first Beis HaMikdash to the second was seventy years, Choni Hamagel wondered, Â“Can a person sleep for seventy years?Â”<br><br>Choni Hamagel met a young man on the road planting a carob tree. He inquired how long it would take for that tree to bear fruit. The man told him, Â“Seventy years.Â” Choni Hamagel asked him if he thought he would be around to reap the benefits of his labor. The man informed him, Â“When I came into this world, I found a carob tree that others had planted for me. Just as my ancestors planted for me, I plant this tree for my descendants.Â”<br><br>Shortly after that brief encounter, Choni Hamagel fell into a deep slumber. Remarkably, he awoke seventy years later to find the grandchild of that farmer picking carobs from the same tree. Choni Hamagel revisited his own community where he had been presumed dead for many years. He heard his Torah being quoted in the Beis Medrash. He even encountered his very own<br><br>grandchildren, but nobody believed him to be the real Choni Hamagel. He was in a world not his own, so he prayed to taken from that world and, once again, his wish was granted. (Taanis 23A) We imagine that this should have been a dream come true. In fact, it was an intolerable nightmare. Why?<br><br>The first part of the story is perhaps the key to explain the second. The man planting the tree lived with the accepted reality that we are here in this world to plant. Â“Those who sow with tears, reap in joy!Â” In this world of action, we perform tasks whose results are beyond our imagination. Just as we enjoy the benefits and the bounty of sacrifices made by previous generations, we too are receiving and passing on dreams to future worlds. It is not our purpose in this place to reap the results of our investments. We are granted just enough nachas to encourage us to keep on moving and doing. To be a mere spectator in life without an active purpose is an exercise in futility and likely yields a lethal dose of frustration.<br><br>It is told that Rabbi Shlomo Hyman, ztÂ”l, the first Rosh HaYeshiva at Torah VÂ’Daas, was once giving a shiur on a snowy day. Although there were only two students present, he gave the lesson with the same thunderous enthusiasm as if the room was filled with many more. One of the students told the Rebbe, Â“There are only two of us here!Â” Rabbi Hyman answered, Â“IÂ’m teaching you, your children and all your talmidim. I see thousands here.Â” One of the students was inspired at that moment to begin a dedicated career of education. There were thousands in the room that day.<br><br>On Tu BÂ’ Shevat, we honor the vision, the process, and the endless possibility for productive living. Since, as King David says, (Psalms 90:10) Â“The days of our years are seventyÂ” (25,550 days to be exact), we might appreciate that question differently, Â“Can a person sleep for seventy years?Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Out of the Frying Pan and Onto the Fire<br><br>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br>In Exodus, Chapter 12, the Torah elaborates on the observance of Passover and the Passover Sacrifice. There are many laws regarding Passover in general, as well as how its sacrifice should be brought, and how it should be eaten. There are at least 11 laws mentioned. One should not own or eat chametz (leavened bread); one should eat matzah; one should not break the bones of the sacrifice; the sacrifice must be roasted whole on an open fire, and others. All of these are in order to remember the miracles which G-d performed on our behalf in Egypt.<br><br>The Sefer HaChinuch (a medieval work enumerating the 613 commandments of the Torah) asks the following question about the laws of Passover. Couldn't we just observe one law which would remind us of the miracles of Egypt, and that would be enough? The answer he gives really underlies much more than the laws of Passover. It applies to our lives on a daily basis. "People are influenced by their actions, and one's heart and thoughts always follow after the deeds one involves oneself in whether they are positive or negative." This means to say that our character traits are strongly influenced by the things we do. Bad people can change for the good, and good people can become evil, depending on what they regularly involve themselves in. This is a far-reaching statement for our day and age.<br><br>One of the aforementioned laws of the Passover Sacrifice is that it should be roasted whole on an open fire. One reason for this is that the sheep was the god of the Egyptians. The Jews may have chosen to cook the sacrifice in a pot of water to avoid flaunting it in the faces of the Egyptians. To this the Torah states that it should be roasted whole on an open fire. Make it obvious. Perhaps this is to teach us an important lesson at the time of our initiation as a nation of servants of G-d. Don't be embarrassed to be Jewish. Don't hide the fact. Serve G-d proudly and openly. We should let our children and coreligionists see what really matters to us.<br><br>Our actions speak louder than our words. They make an impression on us as well as those around us. The Torah teaches us that they require discretion and care. They have the potential to be an effective tool for personal growth. Let us always remember. "People are influenced by their actions."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiming for the "Good Life"<br><br>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Talmud (Shabbos 147b) recommends that people avoid two places (Progaisa and Dyomeses by name), because they surround the visitor with opportunities for physical pleasures (fine wine, luxurious baths) which the locals use at every opportunity. Thus one can sit back and have a good time - such a good time that he loses himself in the physical world.<br><br>We are further told that this actually happened to one of the great Talmudic sages, Rabbi Elazar ben Arach. He went to these places and "was drawn after them," and as a result, he forgot the Torah he had learned! So complete was his downfall that when they called him up to the Torah to read from our parsha, he attempted to read "HaChodesh Hazeh Lachem" - this month is for you (the first of months) [12:2], and instead read "HaCheresh Hayah Libam" - their heart had become deaf and mute. This was a self-descripition - he had lost himself in enjoying this world, and forgotten his priorities. His heart had "tuned in" on worldly pleasures, and thus had tuned out (become deaf to) the spiritual realms. As a result, he found himself bereft of the Torah he had learned in better times. Only when the Rabbis prayed for him did his Torah learning return.<br><br>It's a scary thought, given that our lives are so comfortable today. Are we using the time our modern comforts provide to seek something more than another vacation, or are we simply aiming for the "good life?" Are we tuning in, or tuning out?<br><br>Rebbe Menachem Mendel of Kotzk has a cryptic comment about this Talmudic passage. He says, "even though 'their heart had become deaf and mute,' even so 'this month is for you (the first of months).'"<br><br>A possible explanation of this statement occurred to me as I read it. We know that this is a commandment - the Jewish courts had a process by which they declared the appearance of the new moon, for Nissan and all the months that follow. We also know that this commandment is the first given to the Jewish people, given to them before the Torah itself. They received it while they were still slaves to the Egyptians, and while they were in their worst spiritual state.<br><br>The ability to declare the months, to specify by ruling of the Jewish courts when the months begin, testifies to the ability of the Jewish people to have an impact in the spiritual realms. We declare when Nissan begins, and thus we declare when Passover (the fifteenth of Nissan) will come to the world.<br><br>"Even though 'their heart had become deaf and mute,' even so 'this month is for you (the first of months).'" Even if we are in the worst spiritual state, this does not mean that we are worthless or ignored by G-d. We may have tuned out, but nonetheless we have an impact. G-d still sees us and cares for us, and waits for us to tune back in.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Really Big<br><br>By Rabbi Raymond Beyda<br>The stubbornness of Par-oh in the face of almost one year of devastating plagues is unparalleled in human history. To simply say he hardened his heart sheds no light on the weakness in his character that would blind him to the path of submission that would have saved his country from disaster.<br><br>The Torah states that when Par-oh entered his palace, he suddenly had a change of heart and would reject the demands of Moshe and Aharon for freedom for the Jews. Â“And he came into his house and did not concern his heart with this [warning] eitherÂ”. Shemot 7:15 Rabenu Bahye adds that the wicked king Nebudhadnezar was also proud of his palace and therefore became haughty.<br><br>The question is: These monarchs had fame, success and power Â– Why did their palace make them conceited when they had so much else of which to be proud? The lesson is that arrogance is not an intellectual response, but instead an emotional one. A beautiful home with its opulent dÃ©cor aroused feelings of ga-avah Â– arrogance Â– more that wealth and power did intellectually.<br><br>We live in a society where exterior trappings define the man. Clothing Â– cars Â– and big-boy toys define a person to friends and neighbors more than the real person does. More dangerous is the fact that these not so meaningful possessions transform the way one looks at oneself as well. A simple man surrounded by lavish trappings sees a distorted self-image that may very well lead to haughty behavior beyond oneÂ’s true worth as a human being and as a member of society. Wrong decisions and poor choices are sure to follow the blindness of conceit.<br><br>The Jewish home has been a paradigm for an environment conducive to spiritual growth and boundless self-improvement through the ages. Even the wicked prophet Bil-am praised, Â“Ma tovu ohalekha Yisrael Â– How goodly are your tents IsraelÂ” as he perused the modest life style of our ancestors. We should all take a close look at our priorities and re-establish our homes as a beautiful environment to nurture ourselves and our children in a life of happiness and contentment steeped in Torah values.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Petter Chamor: Drop the Dead Donkey<br>The Mitzvah: The Torah commands an Israelite to redeem the first issue of his donkey with a lamb or kid. The owner "redeems" his animal by giving a lamb in lieu of his donkey, or the monetary equivalent, to the priest. The owner cannot gain any benefit from this animal. If the donkey is not redeemed, it has to be killed by axing the back of its neck (Exodus 13:13).<br><br>The sanctity of a firstborn relates to the precursor to the Exodus: the Tenth Plague that struck the Egyptians. All the firstborns were killed on that fateful night with the exception of the Jewish firstborns. As a result, the firstborns - both man and kosher animal - were sanctified before G-d.<br><br>Curiously, the only non-kosher animal subject to the laws of a firstborn is the donkey.<br><br>The promiscuous climate of Egypt is synonymous with that of the donkey; in the words of the prophet, "whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys" (Ezekiel 23:20). The word chamor, donkey is symbol of chomor, materialism, of unbridled indulgence in animalistic, physical desires unchecked or governed by the intellect to give it direction, form and purpose.<br><br>The donkey is a non-kosher, lowly animal. And the Jewish nation in Egypt descended to a spiritual low - down to the forty-ninth level of spiritual impurity. Almost at the point of no return, nevertheless they were not "irredeemable". This is in line with the principle that a person should never despair from achieving divine mercy. With repentance, the penitent is able to catapult himself onto a higher echelon than the complete righteous (Talmud, Berachos 34).<br><br>The juxtaposition of this mitzvah to the Exodus recalls the Death of the Firstborn. This mitzvah symbolically captures the transformation of the Jewish people in the run up to their redemption.<br><br>The "Egyptian" donkey is redeemed by the lamb, a kosher animal that is an analogy for Israel tendered by their Heavenly Shepherd (Ezekiel 34:31; ibid 36:37-3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Their sanctity came to the fore in their "redemption" from Egypt wherein they revoked their "materialistic" donkey-like status upon becoming the chosen nation - with a new "form" living with Torah and mitzvos acknowledging "G-d is My Shepherd" (Psalms 23).<br><br>Should the owner refuse to redeem his animal, the donkey is to be axed from the back of the neck, the nape. Noam HaMitzvos explains that this symbolizes the wicked that are "stiff-necked" (see e.g. Exodus 33:3: "you are a stiff-necked people) and their unwillingness to repent from their misdeeds. The wicked are "dead" from a spiritual perspective even when still alive (See Talmud Berachos 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. In the same way that it is forbidden to stare at an evil man (Talmud Megillah 27), accordingly, the irredeemable donkey that will not be transferred into a sheep, is killed from behind making it unnecessary to see its face.<br><br>One cannot just "drop the dead donkey". Every one of us has the ability to draw away from our past sins, to sanctity ourselves as the holy firstborn - the Jewish nation itself called G-d's Firstborn (Exodus 4:22). However low we may have fallen, we are never irredeemable. With repentance and the transition, we sanctify ourselves and await the future impending redemption from our present exile.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Raymond Beyda<br>Always on the Job<br><br>Â“Remember this day that you left from EgyptÂ” [Shemot 13:3]<br><br>The culmination of the plagues with which Hashem devastated the land and the economy of Egypt took place on the 15th of the month of Nissan. Hashem commanded His people to remember this day. In his work, Â“Shem OlamÂ” the Hafetz Haim explains why it is so important that we not only remember the events of the Exodus but also keep the date of those miraculous events on our minds.<br><br>The Gemara explains that Hashem appointed a force called a Â“mazalÂ” for everything in creation. Our sages say, Â“There is no blade of grass below that does not have a Mazal above.Â” Even so, warns the Hafetz Haim, one should not mistakenly believe that G-d has turned over the power and the control to the mazal; there is no power other than G-d and there is no will other than His. All forces are merely messengers of G-d created to do His bidding and should He decide that the Â“naturalÂ” functioning of a creation would not serve His purposes Â­then He will change nature to bring about His desired results.<br><br>The Egyptians worshipped the mazal of the sheep or ram. The power of that sign --Aries -- is at its peak every year in Nissan and the height of its potency is on the 15th day of the lunar cycle, when the moon is full -- at midnight. What did Hashem do in order to show that He alone is the power that controls all creation? He struck down the firstborn of the people of Egypt at the time when the power that they worshipped was at its peak -- the 15th at midnight. Therefore the verse reads Â“remember THIS dayÂ…Â” that even though it is the day for their god to have the most influence possible Â­on that day specifically Â­ Hashem hit with His fury to bring them to submission. Remembering the DATE of the Exodus is an enhancement of our appreciation of the power of Hashem and His demonstration of love for us. Shabbat Shalom.<br><br>TABLE TALK Â­Question from the Parasha<br>Why did Hashem command Moshe to instruct the Jewish people to borrow valuable jewelry and expensive clothing from the Egyptians? It would all come into Jewish possession after the splitting of the sea and the drowning of the Egyptians in any event.<br><br>Answer 1: If the Jews did not leave with the valuables then the Egyptians might not pursue them and the miracle at the sea would not take place as planned. This ploy brought about the spoils recovered at the sea. [Maor Va- Shemesh]<br><br>Answer 2: Since the Jews had run off with the possessions of the Egyptians they would be reluctant to return to Egypt out of fear of reprisals by their creditors. [Otsar Haim]<br><br>DID YOU KNOW THAT Squeezing fruit in order to extract the juice is in general forbidden both on Shabbat and Yom Tob. No fruit may be squeezed into an empty vessel or into a liquid, regardless of whether it is squeezed by hand or with an instrument. [E.g. squeezing lemons, oranges, or the juice out of shredded carrots or chopping fruit to such an extent that it becomes liquefied]. On the other hand a lemon may be sliced and put into a drink, such as tea or cold water, even though some of the juice may come out by itself. It is permissible to squeeze fruit --by hand-- onto non-liquid food on Shabbat and Yom Tob if the food will absorb most of the juice OR if the juice will enhance the flavor of the food.

            <div class='col-md body'>Our Helper in Prayer<br>"Seeing then that we have a great high PriestÂ…Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need" (Heb. 4:14,16).<br>Our great Helper in prayer is the Lord Jesus Christ, our Advocate with the Father, our Great High Priest, whose chief ministry for us these centuries has been intercession and prayer. He it is who takes our imperfect petitions from our hands, cleanses them from their defects, corrects their faults, and then claims their answer from His Father on His own account and through His all-atoning merits and righteousness.<br><br>Brother, are you fainting in prayer? Look up. Your blessed Advocate has already claimed your answer, and you would grieve and disappoint Him if you were to give up the conflict in the very moment when victory is on its way to meet you. He has gone in for you into the inner chamber, and already holds up your name upon the palms of His hands; and the messenger, which is to bring you your blessing, is now on his way, and the Spirit is only waiting your trust to whisper in your heart the echo of the answer from the throne, "It is done." --A. B. Simpson<br>The Spirit has much to do with acceptable prayer, and His work in prayer is too much neglected. He enlightens the mind to see its wants, softens the heart to feel them, quickens our desires after suitable supplies, gives clear views of God's power, wisdom, and grace to relieve us, and stirs up that confidence in His truth which excludes all wavering. Prayer is, therefore, a wonderful thing. In every acceptable prayer the whole Trinity is concerned. --J. Angell James<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>School of Suffering<br>"The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?" (John 18:11).<br><br>This was a greater thing to say and do than to calm the seas or raise the dead. Prophets and apostles could work wondrous miracles, but they could not always do and suffer the will of God. To do and suffer God's will is still the highest form of faith, the most sublime Christian achievement. To have the bright aspirations of a young life forever blasted; to bear a daily burden never congenial and to see no relief; to be pinched by poverty when you only desire a competency for the good and comfort of loved ones; to be fettered by some incurable physical disability; to be stripped bare of loved ones until you stand alone to meet the shocks of life--to be able to say in such a school of discipline, "The cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?'--this is faith at its highest and spiritual success at the crowning point. Great faith is exhibited not so much in ability to do as to suffer. --Dr. Charles Parkhurst<br>To have a sympathizing God we must have a suffering Saviour, and there is no true fellow-feeling with another save in the heart of him who has been afflicted like him.<br><br>We cannot do good to others save at a cost to ourselves, and our afflictions are the price we pay for our ability to sympathize. He who would be a helper, must first be a sufferer. He who would be a saviour must somewhere and somehow have been upon a cross; and we cannot have the highest happiness of life in succoring others without tasting the cup which Jesus drank, and submitting to the baptism wherewith He was baptized.<br>The most comforting of David's psalms were pressed out by suffering; and if Paul had not had his thorn in the flesh we had missed much of that tenderness which quivers in so many of his letters.<br><br>The present circumstance, which presses so hard against you (if surrendered to Christ), is the best shaped tool in the Father's hand to chisel you for eternity. Trust Him, then. Do not push away the instrument lest you lose its work."<br>"Strange and difficult indeed We may find it, But the blessing that we need Is behind it."<br><br>The school of suffering graduates rare scholars.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God is Looking<br>"The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him" (2 Chron. 16:9).<br><br>God is looking for a man, or woman, whose heart will be always set on Him, and who will trust Him for all He desires to do. God is eager to work more mightily now than He ever has through any soul. The clock of the centuries points to the eleventh hour.<br>"The world is waiting yet to see what God can do through a consecrated soul." Not the world alone, but God Himself is waiting for one, who will be more fully devoted to Him than any who have ever lived; who will be willing to be nothing that Christ may be all; who will grasp God's own purposes; and taking His humility and His faith, His love and His power, will, without hindering, continue to let God do exploits. --C. H. P.<br><br>"There is no limit to what God can do with a man, providing he will not touch the glory."<br>In an address given to ministers and workers after his ninetieth birthday, George Mueller spoke thus of himself: "I was converted in November, 1825, but I only came into the full surrender of the heart four years later, in July, 1829. The love of money was gone, the love of place was gone, the love of position was gone, the love of worldly pleasures and engagements was gone. God, God alone became my portion. I found my all in Him; I wanted nothing else. And by the grace of God this has remained, and has made me a happy man, an exceedingly happy man, and it led me to care only about the things of God. I ask affectionately, my beloved brethren, have you fully surrendered the heart to God, or is there this thing or that thing with which you are taken up irrespective of God? I read a little of the Scriptures before, but preferred other books; but since that time the revelation He has made of Himself has become unspeakably blessed to me, and I can say from my heart, God is an infinitely lovely Being. Oh, be not satisfied until in your own inmost soul you can say, God is an infinitely lovely Being!' --Selected<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God is Not Unobservant<br>"I will be still, and I will behold in my dwelling place" (Isa. 18:4, RV).<br><br>Assyria was marching against Ethiopia, the people of which are described as tall and smooth. And as the armies advance, God makes no effort to arrest them; it seems as though they will be allowed to work their will. He is still watching them from His dwelling place, the sun still shines on them; but before the harvest, the whole of the proud army of Assyria is smitten as easily as when sprigs are cut off by the pruning hook of the husbandman.<br>Is not this a marvelous conception of God--being still and watching? His stillness is not acquiescence. His silence is not consent. He is only biding His time, and will arise, in the most opportune moment, and when the designs of the wicked seem on the point of success, to overwhelm them with disaster. As we look out on the evil of the world; as we think of the apparent success of wrong-doing; as we wince beneath the oppression of those that hate us, let us remember these marvelous words about God being still and beholding.<br><br>There is another side to this. Jesus beheld His disciples toiling at the oars through the stormy night; and watched though unseen, the successive steps of the anguish of Bethany, when Lazarus slowly passed through the stages of mortal sickness, until he succumbed and was borne to the rocky tomb. But He was only waiting the moment when He could interpose most effectually. Is He still to thee? He is not unobservant; He is beholding all things; He has His finger on thy pulse, keenly sensitive to all its fluctuations. He will come to save thee when the precise moment has arrived. --Daily Devotional Commentary<br>Whatever His questions or His reticences, we may be absolutely sure of an unperplexed and undismayed Saviour.<br><br>"O troubled soul, beneath the rod, Thy Father speaks, be still, be still; Learn to be silent unto God, And let Him mould thee to His will.<br>"O praying soul, be still, be still, He cannot break His plighted Word; Sink down into His blessed will, And wait in patience on the Lord.<br><br>"O waiting soul, be still, be strong, And though He tarry, trust and wait; Doubt not, He will not wait too long, Fear not, He will not come too late."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Doubtstorms<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>The following is excerpted from Chapter 13 of In the Eye of the Storm.<br>Download the entire chapter.<br><br>On Sundays I stand before a church with a three-point outline in my hand, thirty minutes on the clock, and a prayer on my lips. I do my best to say something that will convince a stranger that an unseen God still hears.<br><br>And I sometimes wonder why so many hearts have to hurt.<br><br>Do you ever get doubtstorms? Some of you donÂ’t, I know. IÂ’ve talked to you.<br><br>I think you are gifted. You are gifted with faith. You can see the rainbow before the clouds part. If you have this gift, then I wonÂ’t say anything you need to hear.<br><br>But others of you wonder...<br><br>You wonder if it is a blessing or a curse to have a mind that never rests. But you would rather be a cynic than a hypocrite, so you continue to pray with one eye open and wonder:<br><br>- about starving children<br>- about the power of prayer<br>- about the depths of grace<br>- about Christians in cancer wards<br>- about who you are to ask such questions anyway.<br><br>Tough questions. Throw-in-the-towel questions. Questions the disciples must have asked in the storm.<br><br>The light came for the disciples. A figure came to them walking on the water. It wasnÂ’t what they expected. Perhaps they were looking for angels to descend or heaven to open. Maybe they were listening for a divine proclamation to still the storm. We donÂ’t know what they were looking for. But one thing is for sure, they werenÂ’t looking for<br>Jesus to come walking on the water.<br><br>Â“Â‘ItÂ’s a ghost,Â’ they said and cried out in fearÂ” (Matt. 14:26).<br><br>And since Jesus came in a way they didnÂ’t expect, they almost missed seeing the answer to their prayers.<br><br>And unless we look and listen closely, we risk making the same mistake. GodÂ’s lights in our dark nights are as numerous as the stars, if only weÂ’ll look for them.<br><br>When the disciples saw Jesus in the middle of their stormy night, they called him a ghost. A phantom. A hallucination. To them, the glow was anything but God.<br><br>When we see gentle lights on the horizon, we often have the same reaction. We dismiss occasional kindness as apparitions, accidents, or anomalies. Anything but God.<br><br>Â“When Jesus comes,Â” the disciples in the boat may have thought, Â“heÂ’ll split the sky. The sea will be calm. The clouds will disperse.Â”<br><br>Â“When God comes,Â” we doubters think, Â“all pain will flee. Life will be tranquil. No questions will remain.Â”<br><br>And because we look for the bonfire, we miss the candle. Because we listen for the shout, we miss the whisper.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Triumph in Tragedy<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>What do you say we have a chat about graveclothes? Sound like fun? Sound like a cheery topic? Hardly. Make a list of depressing subjects, and burial garments is somewhere between IRS audits and long-term dental care.<br><br>No one likes graveclothes. No one discusses graveclothes. Have you ever spiced up dinner-table chat with the question, Â“What are you planning to wear in your casket?Â”<br>Most folks donÂ’t discuss graveclothes.<br><br>The apostle John, however, was an exception. Ask him, and heÂ’ll tell you how he came to see burial garments as a symbol of triumph. He didnÂ’t always see them that way. A tangible reminder of the death of his best friend, Jesus, they used to seem like a symbol of tragedy. But on the first Easter Sunday, God took clothing of death and made it a symbol of life.<br><br>Could he do the same for you?<br><br>Could he take what today is a token of tragedy and turn it into a symbol of triumph?<br><br>We all face tragedy. WhatÂ’s more, weÂ’ve all received the symbols of tragedy. Yours might be a telegram from the war department, an ID bracelet from the hospital, a scar, or a court subpoena. We donÂ’t like these symbols, nor do we want these symbols. Like wrecked cars in a junkyard, they clutter up our hearts with memories of bad days.<br><br>But could God use such things for something good? How far can we go with verses like Romans 8:28 that says, Â“In everything God works for the good of those who love himÂ”? Does Â“everythingÂ” include tumors and tests and tempers and terminations? John would answer yes. John would tell you that God can turn any tragedy into a triumph, if only you will wait and watch.<br><br>Could I challenge you with a little exercise? Remove the word everything from Romans 8:28 and replace it with the symbol of your own tragedy. For the apostle John, the verse would read: Â“In burial clothing God works for the good of those who love him.Â” How would Romans 8:28 read in your life?<br><br>In hospital stays God works for the good.<br>In divorce papers God works for the good.<br>In a prison term God works for the good.<br><br>If God can change JohnÂ’s life through a tragedy, could it be he will use a tragedy to change yours?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Touch of God<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>In Scripture the leper is symbolic of the ultimate outcast: infected by a condition he did not seek, rejected by those he knew, avoided by people he did not know, condemned to a future he could not bear. And in the memory of each outcast must have been the day he was forced to face the truth: life would never be the same.<br><br>The banishing of a leper seems harsh, unnecessary. The Ancient East hasnÂ’t been the only culture to isolate their wounded, however. We may not build colonies or cover our mouths in their presence, but we certainly build walls and duck our eyes. And a person neednÂ’t have leprosy to feel quarantined.<br><br>The divorced know this feeling. So do the handicapped. The unemployed have felt it, as have the less educated. Some shun unmarried moms. We keep our distance from the depressed and avoid the terminally ill. We have neighborhoods for immigrants, convalescent homes for the elderly, schools for the simple, centers for the addicted, and prisons for the criminals.<br><br>The rest simply try to get away from it all. Only God knows how many individuals are living quiet, lonely lives infected by their fear of rejection and their memories of the last time they tried. They choose not to be touched at all rather than risk being hurt again.<br><br>Some of you have the master touch of the Physician himself. You use your hands to pray over the sick and minister to the weak. If you arenÂ’t touching them personally, your hands are writing letters, dialing phones, baking pies. You have learned the power of a touch.<br><br>But others of us tend to forget. Our hearts are good; itÂ’s just that our memories are bad. We forget how significant one touch can be. We fear saying the wrong thing or using the wrong tone or acting the wrong way. So rather than do it incorrectly, we do nothing at all.<br><br>ArenÂ’t we glad Jesus didnÂ’t make the same mistake? If your fear of doing the wrong thing prevents you from doing anything, keep in mind the perspective of the lepers of the world. They arenÂ’t picky. They arenÂ’t finicky. TheyÂ’re just lonely. They are yearning for a godly touch.<br><br>Jesus touched the untouchables of the world. Will you do the same?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God is Waiting Upon Us<br>"And therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you...blessed are all they that wait f or him" (Isa. 30:18 ).<br><br>We must not only think of our waiting upon God, but also of what is more wonderful still, of God's waiting upon us. The vision of Him waiting on us, will give new impulse and inspiration to our waiting upon Him. It will give us unspeakable confidence that our waiting cannot be in vain. Let us seek even now, at this moment, in the spirit of waiting on God, to find out something of what it means. He has inconceivably glorious purposes concerning every one of His children. And you ask, "How is it, if He waits to be gracious, that even after I come and wait upon Him, He does not give the. help I seek, but waits on longer and longer?"<br>God is a wise husbandman, "who waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it." He cannot gather the fruit till it is ripe. He knows when we are spiritually ready to receive the blessing to our profit and His glory. Waiting in the sunshine of His love is what will ripen the soul for His blessing. Waiting under the cloud of trial, that breaks in showers of blessings, is as needful. Be assured that if God waits longer than you could wish, it is only to make the blessing doubly precious. God waited four thousand years, till the fullness of time, ere He sent His Son. Our times are in His hands; He will avenge His elect speedily; He will make haste for our help, and not delay one hour too long. --Andrew Murray<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Degrees of Faith<br>"Let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece" (Judges 6:39).<br><br>There are degrees to faith. At one stage of Christian experience we cannot believe unless we have some sign or some great manifestation of feeling. We feel our fleece, like Gideon, and if it is wet we are willing to trust God. This may be true faith, but it is imperfect. It always looks for feeling or some token besides the Word of God. It marks quite an advance in faith when we trust God without feelings. It is blessed to believe without having any emotion.<br>There is a third stage of faith which even transcends that of Gideon and his fleece. The first phase of faith believes when there are favorable emotions, the second believes when there is the absence of feeling, but this third form of faith believes God and His Word when circumstances, emotions, appearances, people, and human reason all urge to the contrary. Paul exercised this faith in Acts 27:20, 25, "And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away." Notwithstanding all this Paul said, "Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me."<br><br>May God give us faith to fully trust His Word though everything else witness the other way. --C. H. P.<br>When is the time to trust? Is it when all is calm, When waves the victor's palm, And life is one glad psalm Of joy and praise? Nay! but the time to trust Is when the waves beat high, When storm clouds fill the sky, And prayer is one long cry, O help and save!<br><br>When is the time to trust? Is it when friends are true? Is it when comforts woo, And in all we say and do We meet but praise? Nay! but the time to trust Is when we stand alone, And summer birds have flown, And every prop is gone, All else but God.<br>What is the time to trust? Is it some future day, When you have tried your way, And learned to trust and pray By bitter woe? Nay! but the time to trust Is in this moment's need, Poor, broken, bruised reed! Poor, troubled soul, make speed To trust thy God.<br><br>What is the time to trust? Is it when hopes beat high, When sunshine gilds the sky, And joy and ecstasy Fill all the heart? Nay! but the time to trust Is when our joy is fled, When sorrow bows the head, And all is cold and dead, All else but God. --Selected</div>

He who would be a saviour must somewhere and somehow have been upon a cross; and we cannot have the highest happiness of life in succoring others without tasting the cup which Jesus drank, and submitting to the baptism wherewith He was baptized.<br>The most comforting of David's psalms were pressed out by suffering; and if Paul had not had his thorn in the flesh we had missed much of that tenderness which quivers in so many of his letters.<br><br>The present circumstance, which presses so hard against you (if surrendered to Christ), is the best shaped tool in the Father's hand to chisel you for eternity. Trust Him, then. Do not push away the instrument lest you lose its work."<br>"Strange and difficult indeed We may find it, But the blessing that we need Is behind it."<br><br>The school of suffering graduates rare scholars.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Avoiding Self-Based Faith<br>2 Corinthians 5:7<br>We live by faith, not by sight.<br><br>Over the years I have run into many businessmen who make the statement, "Whenever I get things in order in my business, I want to get more involved in ministry." What are these men really saying? They are saying that as soon as they can get the amount of money that creates security, they will trust God. They are saying that what they have been doing to date has not been ministry. This separation of "work and faith" is common among our culture. We fail to understand that life is sacred to God and there is nothing "holy" and nothing "sacred" in itself.<br><br>I would love to hear one businessperson say, "I have spent my life in this business. The Lord has blessed me with great resources. However, now I want to see His faithfulness in this stage of my life. That is why I am giving away my wealth and trusting Him to provide for me through new ways." Wouldn't that be a novel concept? That is exactly what C.T. Studd, the great cricket player in the 1800s, did. He was reared in a wealthy home, but his deep conversion experience led him to take actions that forced him to trust God in ways he never had to before. He became one of the great missionaries of all time.<br><br>Whenever we seek to plan ways of ministry that depend on our ability to manipulate and plan outcome, this is not faith. The ministry that comes from this will be minuscule. Faith that bears fruit is faith that is born from experience with a living God. It is faith that says, "I don't know where the next check is coming from. All I know is that God told me to do this and trust Him for the next step." That is faith that moves mountains and moves God's heart. God rarely allows His servant to see beyond the next faith step. However, those who are willing to take the first step and leave the outcome to Him see His works.<br><br>Others went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the mighty waters. They saw the works of the Lord... (Psalm 107:23-24).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First Fruits<br>Joshua 6:19<br>All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the Lord and must go into His treasury.<br><br>One of the earliest examples of the practice of giving God the first fruits of the increase was when Joshua and the people entered the Promised Land for the first time. When they crossed the Jordan River, their first battle was Jericho. God set a precedent with this battle by instructing them not to take any spoils from it. Unlike future battles, the fruits from this victory were to go into the treasury as a remembrance of their first victory in the Promised Land. In addition, the city of Jericho was to be a lasting monument to God's faithfulness. God instructed Joshua never to rebuild this city. If they or anyone in the future attempted to rebuild the city, the life of the firstborn would be required. Years later, Ahab attempted to rebuild this city and his firstborn died as a result. God never forgets to enforce His Word.<br><br>Is your work a lasting monument to the faithfulness of God in your life? Is it bringing glory to the Father? Are you giving the first fruits from your increase to God? God has encouraged us through this story to give the first fruits of our work to Him so that He will be glorified through our work. This is a tangible way for us to acknowledge that God is the source of all blessing.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tests of the Heart<br>Deuteronomy 8:2<br>Remember how the Lord your God led you all the way in the desert these forty years, to humble you and to test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep His commands.<br><br>Has God performed a heart test on you lately? There are times in our lives when God leads us into the desert in order to let us find out what is in our heart. These times can be very difficult and humbling. They can test our mettle like no other time. Desert times often mean we are living without those things we are normally accustomed to: water, food, limited supplies-and with few comforts. In modern terms, it may mean a different environment. God is performing a very important work during these times. He wants to know if we can be obedient to Him in these times; or will we be obedient only when times are good?<br><br>He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your fathers had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years. Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the Lord your God disciplines you (Deuteronomy 8:3-5).<br><br>These desert times may mean experiencing new ways of provision from the Lord. Like manna from Heaven, it may mean seeing miracles we've never seen before. Like clothing that never wears out, it may mean seeing your normal capabilities expanded. Like walking hundreds of miles without pain, desert experiences provide new lessons and new experiences that only these times can teach us.<br><br>What desert experience has He brought into your life lately? Perhaps it is a lean time in business. Perhaps it is a new environment. Whatever it is, when God decides to bring new disciplines into our lives by bringing us into the desert, do not fear the heat that is sure to come. He is walking beside you in order to test you and find out what is really in your heart. Ask for His grace to pass the test. He wants to bring all of His children into the Promised Land.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unrighteous Acts<br>Nehemiah 5:9<br>..."Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of oour Gentile enemies?"<br><br>Nehemiah was the cupbearer to King Artaxerxes in Babylon. Jerusalem's walls had been destroyed and word had come to Nehemiah that the remnant of his people left in Jerusalem were distressed over the plight of the wall.<br><br>Nehemiah was grieved over this situation. He appealed to his king for permission to rebuild the wall. When he got to the city, he found many problems among his own people due to an economic crisis in the region. Among the classes affected by the economic crisis were (1) the landless, who were short of food; (2) the landowners, who were compelled to mortgage their properties; (3) those forced to borrow money at exorbitant rates and sell their children into slavery. It was unlawful for Hebrews to charge interest to other Hebrews.<br><br>Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our countrymen and though our sons are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others (Nehemiah 5:5).<br><br>Nehemiah stepped forward to admonish his people for this wrongful action on the basis that not only was it wrong, but God would respond to such action by making them susceptible to His judgment through the Gentile enemies.<br><br>Nehemiah was modeling to each of us a spiritual principle regarding sin. Whenever we sin, we give God permission to unleash the enemy into our souls to judge that sin. Nehemiah understood this principle and warned the people of what this action would encourage from God. The people repented and returned the money gained through usury.<br><br>As Christian businesspeople we must make sure that our practices are righteous in God's sight. If not, we can expect the enemy to be released to judge that sin. Ask the Lord today if there is any unrighteousness in your business practices that makes you vulnerable to judgment.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fears That Keep Us From His Presence<br>Luke 8:37<br>Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So He got into the boat and left.<br><br>Jesus did many miracles when He lived on earth. One of those miracles involved the deliverance of a demon-possessed man. The people of the community witnessed this awesome demonstration of God's power when Jesus commanded the demon spirit to come out of the man and go into the herd of nearby pigs. The man was healed and sat at Jesus' feet.<br><br>You would expect the people who witnessed this to embrace Jesus as one performing good deeds and to honor Him. The opposite was true. Instead, they were overcome with fear. Why? Many of us respond the same way to Jesus when He does an out-of-the-ordinary act among His people. We are fearful because we have never personally experienced this before. So, we draw wrong judgments. The result is that Jesus removes Himself from us.<br><br>The Lord is able to do far exceeding above what we think. Jesus does not remain in the places where there is fear of His goodness. It is often subconscious fears that prevent us from going to a deeper level with Him. The people in Gerasenes could not benefit from Jesus' presence because of their fears.<br><br>Have you feared Jesus because of what He might require of you? Have you feared that He might ask of you something you are not prepared to give? Do not let your fears drive Him from your presence. His motive is always love for His children. You can trust Him.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Until We All Arrive<br><br>"...until we may all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the recognition of the Son of God, to become a mature man, to the measure of stature of the fullness of the Messiah." Ephesians 4:13<br><br>We are on a long journey, but the destination is in sight... and its name is Maturity.  For too many of us, however, this is a particularly arduous trip because we are traveling all by ourselves.  What's worse, we think we're the only ones on the path because no one else even knows how to get there!  But Maturity is not a place of privacy and isolation.  On the contrary, it is when we remain in seclusion that Maturity eludes us.  There is only one way that we can hope to reach Maturity, and that is together.<br><br>Being mature is more than just having a good and well-developed characterÂ—in fact, how we behave toward others is a large measure of our maturity.  All too often, we remain at arm's length from one another, believing that maturity directs us to rely only upon ourselves as we navigate the course of life.  But according to the Scriptures, Maturity is not located in the State of IndependenceÂ—it is at the center of the Commonwealth of Unity.<br><br>We are exhorted to "arrive at the unity" not only "of the faith," but also "of the recognition of the Son of God."  If we are to grow toward maturity,we must first be collectively unified both in faith and in Who we believe to be the Son of God.  Who He is, what He came here to do, what He has done on our behalfÂ—we must recognize these simple truths according to the Scriptures if we have any hope of becoming mature.  Many times, we walk alone because we are unable to be unified on these fundamentals.  But Maturity is calling us to arrive at that unity if we ever desire "to become a mature man."<br><br>We will have achieved maturity when we together reach "the measure of stature of the fullness of the Messiah."  If we cannot agree on the facts about Messiah, we have no common goal to which we may aspire.  We must fight for the truth, swallow our pride, perhaps even concede defeatÂ—whatever it takesÂ—but we must be one in order to be like the One who has called us.<br><br>If Maturity is your destination, and you appear to be on the road alone, perhaps it's time to stop for a moment and look around for those who are going the "wrong way."  When you find them, who knows?  Maybe they took a detour for the same reason... and ran into you....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HE MAKES ME TO LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES<br><br>Â“He makes me to lie down in green pasturesÂ” Psalms 23:2<br><br>Shabbat shalom and Shnat Shabbaton dearly beloved:<br><br>This week we shall continue studying Psalms 23 for this Shabbat Year of 2007.<br><br>When I read the above scripture, (and especially in Hebrew,) it becomes very obvious to me that unless He makes us to lie down long enough in order to get our attention; the 21st Century hyperactivity will get the best out of us and we will have no time for Him. But let me explain this verse to you:<br><br>He makes me to lie down in green pastures:<br><br>Al neot deshe yarbitseni.<br><br>I will actually begin the way the Hebrew sentence begins. It begins with the GREEN PASTURES and later on we will see why it begins this way. He first gives us the vision and the purpose for His insistence that we lie down. He desires us to rest and be restored. There is no way that we can be restored, or that we can rest in a field of thorns, or in the midst of gravel. He must get us to a place of GREEN PASTURES for our own good and for the sake of His Kingdom. Sheep eat green grass in order to grow healthy and grow lots of wool. As we said in the previous letter, the sheepÂ’s wool is the reward of the shepherd for his hard work. In the green pastures both the food and the rest will be plentiful. Though this sounds wonderful most sheep do not lie down on their own.  They have to be forced into the resting.  They have to be humbled unto that place! What does green pastures mean to us YÂ’shuaÂ’s disciples? Most of us do not eat grass! The word of YAH says: Â“For man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of YAH (God)Â….Â” In other words though we need physical food to survive, we need His Word even more! Abba brings us to a place where we can feed on His luscious Word, on His Torah instructions, and on His promises, so we can be made whole and we can bear fruit!<br><br></div>
