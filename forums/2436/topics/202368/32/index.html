            <div class='col-md body'>Made Rich by Faith<br>"For the needy shall not always be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever"   (Psalm 9:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>Poverty is a hard heritage; but those who trust in the LORD are made rich by faith. They know that they are not forgotten of God, and though it may seem that they are overlooked in His providential distribution of good things, they look for a time when all this shall be righted. Lazarus will not always lie among the dogs at the rich man's gate, but he will have his recompense in Abraham's bosom. Even now the LORD remembers His poor but precious sons, "I am poor and needy; yet the LORD thinketh upon me," said one of old, and it is even so. The godly poor have great expectations. They expect the LORD to provide them all things necessary for this life and godliness; they expect to see things working for their good; they expect to have all the closer fellowship with their LORD, who had not where to lay His head; they expect His second advent and to share its glory. This expectation cannot perish, for it is laid up in Christ Jesus, who liveth forever, and because He lives, it shall live also. The poor saint singeth many a song which the rich sinner cannot understand. Wherefore, let us, when we have short commons below, think of the royal table above.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Never Cast Out<br>"Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out"   (John 6:37).<br><br>Is there any instance of our LORD's casting out a coming one? If there be so, we would like to know of it; but there has been none, and there never will be. Among the lost souls in hell there is not one that can say, "I went to Jesus, and He refused me." It is not possible that you or I should be the first to whom Jesus shall break His word. Let us not entertain so dark a suspicion.<br><br>Suppose we go to Jesus now about the evils of today. Oh, this we may be sure -- He will not refuse us audience or cast us out. Those of us who have often been and those who have never gone before -- let us go together, and we shall see that He will not shut the door of His grace in the face of any one of us.<br><br>"This man receiveth sinners," but He repulses none. We come to Him in weakness and sin, with trembling faith, and small knowledge, and slender hope; but He does not cast us out. We come by prayer, and that prayer broken; with confession, and that confession faulty; with praise, and that praise far short of His merits; but yet He receives us. We come diseased, polluted, worn out, and worthless; but He doth in no wise cast us out. Let us come again today to Him who never casts us out.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Loved unto the End"<br>"For the LORD will not cast off for ever"   (Lamentations 3:31).<br><br>He may cast away for a season but not forever. A woman may leave off her ornaments for a few days, but she will not forget them or throw them upon the dunghill. It is not like the LORD to cast off those whom He loves, for "having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end." Some talk of our being in grace and out of it, as if we were like rabbits that run in and out of their burrows; but, indeed, it is not so. The LORD's love is a far more serious and abiding matter than this.<br><br>He chose us from eternity, and He will love us throughout eternity. He loved us so as to die for us, and we may therefore be sure that His love will never die. His honor is so wrapped up in the salvation of the believer that He can no more cast him of than He can cast off His own robes of office as King of glory. No, no! The LORD Jesus, as a Head, never casts off His members; as a Husband, He never casts off His bride. Did you think you were cast off? Why did you think so evil of the LORD who has betrothed you to Himself? Cast off such thoughts, and never let them lodge in your soul again. "The LORD hath not cast away his people which he foreknew" (Romans 11:2). "He hateth putting away" (Malachi 2:16).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Purity of Heart and Life<br>"Blessed are the are pure in heart: for they shall see God"   (Matthew 5:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>Purity, even purity of heart, is the main thing to be aimed at. We need to be made clean within through the Spirit and the Word, and then we shall be clean without by consecration and obedience. There is a close connection between the affections and the understanding: if we love evil we cannot understand that which is good. If the heart is foul, the eye will be dim. How can those men see a holy God who love unholy things?<br><br>What a privilege it is to see God here! A glimpse of Him is heaven below! In Christ Jesus the pure in heart behold the Father. We see Him, His truth, His love, His purpose, His sovereignty, His covenant character, yea, we see Himself in Christ. But this is only apprehended as sin is kept out of the heart. Only those who aim at godliness can cry, "Mine eyes are ever towards the LORD." The desire of Moses, "I beseech thee, show me thy glory," can only be fulfilled in us as we purify ourselves from all iniquity. We shall "see him as he is," and "every one that hath this hope in him purifieth himself." The enjoyment of present fellowship and the hope of the beatific vision are urgent motives for purity of heart and life. LORD, make us pure in heart that we may see Thee!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Wonderful Guarantee<br>"I will strengthen thee"   (Isaiah 41:10).<br><br>When called to serve or to suffer, we take stock of our strength, and we find it to be less than we thought and less than we need. But let not our heart sink within us while we have such a word as this to fall back upon, for it guarantees us all that we can possibly need. God has strength omnipotent; that strength He can communicate to us; and His promise is that He will do so. He will be the food of our souls and the health of our hearts; and thus He will give us strength. There is no telling how much power God can put into a man. When divine strength comes, human weakness is no more a hindrance.<br><br>Do we not remember seasons of labor and trial in which we received such special strength that we wondered at ourselves? In the midst of danger we were calm, under bereavement we were resigned, in slander we were self-contained, and in sickness we were patient. The fact is that God gives unexpected strength when unusual trials come upon us, We rise out of our feeble selves. Cowards play the man, foolish ones have wisdom given them, and the silent receive in the self-same hour what they shall speak, My own weakness makes me shrink, but God's promise makes me brave. LORD, strengthen me "according to thy word."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Bible's First Promise<br>"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel"   (Genesis 3:15).<br>This is the first promise to fallen man. It contains the whole gospel and the essence of the covenant of grace. It has been in great measure fulfilled. The seed of the woman, even our LORD Jesus, was bruised in His heel, and a terrible bruising it was. How terrible will be the final bruising of the serpent's head! This was virtually done when Jesus took away sin, vanquished death, and broke the power of Satan; but it awaits a still fuller accomplishment at our LORD's second advent and in the Day of Judgment. To us the promise stands as a prophecy that we shall be afflicted by the powers of evil in our lower nature, and thus bruised in our heel; but we shall triumph in Christ, who sets His foot on the old serpent's head. Through- out this year we may have to learn the first part of this promise by experience, through the temptations of the devil and the unkindness of the ungodly, who are his seed. They may so bruise us that we may limp with our sore heel; but let us grasp the second part of the text, and we shall not be dismayed. By faith let us rejoice that we shall still reign in Christ Jesus, the woman's seed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Loved to Perfection<br>"Having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them unto the end"<br>(John 13:1).<br><br>This fact is essentially a promise; for what our LORD was He is, and what He was to those with whom He lived on earth, He will be to all His beloved so long as the moon endureth. "Having loved": here was the wonder! That He should ever have loved men at all is the marvel. What was there in His poor disciples that He should love them?<br>What is there in me? But when He has once begun to love, it is His nature to continue to do so. Love made the saints "his own"--what a choice title! He purchased them with blood, and they became His treasure. Being His own, He will not lose them. Being His<br>beloved, He will not cease to love them. My soul, He will not cease to love thee!<br><br>The text is well as it stands: "to the end." Even till His death the ruling passion of love to His own reigned in His sacred bosom. It means also to the uttermost. He could not love them more: He gave Himself for them. Some read it, to perfection. Truly He lavished upon them a perfect love, in which there was no flaw nor failure, no unwisdom, no unfaithfulness. Such is the love of Jesus to each one of His people. Let us sing to our<br>Well-beloved a song.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Father's Giving<br>"Prove me now" (Mal. 3:10).<br><br>What is God saying here but this: "My child, I still have windows in Heaven. They are yet in service. The bolts slide as easily as of old. The hinges have not grown rusty. I would rather fling them open, and pour forth, than keep them shut, and hold back. I opened them for Moses, and the sea parted. I opened them for Joshua, and Jordan rolled back. I opened them for Gideon, and hosts fled. I will open them for you--if you will only let Me. On this side of the windows, Heaven is the same rich storehouse as of old. The fountains and streams still overflow. The treasure rooms are still bursting with gifts. The lack is not on my side. It is on yours. I am waiting. Prove Me now. Fulfill the conditions, on your part. Bring in the tithes. Give Me a chance. --Selected<br>I can never forget my mother's very brief paraphrase of Malachi 3:10. The verse begins, "Bring ye the whole tithe in," and it ends up with "I will pour" the blessing out till you'll be embarrassed for space. Her paraphrase was this: Give all He asks; take all He promises." --S. D. Gordon<br><br>The ability of God is beyond our prayers, beyond our largest prayers! I have been thinking of some of the petitions that have entered into my supplication innumerable times. What have I asked for? I have asked for a cupful, and the ocean remains! I have asked for a sunbeam, and the sun abides! My best asking falls immeasurably short of my Father's giving: it is beyond that we can ask. --J. H. Jowett<br>"All the rivers of Thy grace I claim, Over every promise write my name" (Eph. 1:8-19).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Waiting For Hope<br>"For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness" (Gal. 5:5, RV).<br><br>There are times when things look very dark to me--so dark that I have to wait even for hope. It is bad enough to wait in hope. A long-deferred fulfillment carries its own pain, but to wait for hope, to see no glimmer of a prospect and yet refuse to despair; to have nothing but night before the casement and yet to keep the casement open for possible stars; to have a vacant place in my heart and yet to allow that place to be filled by no inferior presence--that is the grandest patience in the universe. It is Job in the tempest; it is Abraham on the road to Moriah; it is Moses in the desert of Midian; it is the Son of man in the Garden of Gethsemane.<br>There is no patience so hard as that which endures, "as seeing him who is invisible"; it is the waiting for hope.<br><br>Thou hast made waiting beautiful; Thou has made patience divine. Thou hast taught us that the Father's will may be received just because it is His will. Thou hast revealed to us that a soul may see nothing but sorrow in the cup and yet may refuse to let it go, convinced that the eye of the Father sees further than its own.<br>Give me this Divine power of Thine, the power of Gethsemane. Give me the power to wait for hope itself, to look out from the casement where there are no stars. Give me the power, when the very joy that was set before me is gone, to stand unconquered amid the night, and say, "To the eye of my Father it is perhaps shining still." I shall reach the climax of strength when I have learned to wait for hope. --George Matheson Strive to be one of those--so few--who walk the earth with ever-present consciousness--all mornings, middays, star-times--that the unknown which men call Heaven is "close behind the visible scene of things."<br><br></div>

They soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel; but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul" (Ps. 106:12-15).<br><br>We read of Moses, that "he endured, as seeing him who is invisible." Exactly the opposite was true of the children of Israel in this record. They endured only when the circumstances were favorable; they were largely governed by the things that appealed to their senses, in place of resting in the invisible and eternal God.<br>In the present day there are those who live intermittent Christian lives because they have become occupied with the outward, and center in circumstances, in place of centering in God. God wants us more and more to see Him in everything, and to call nothing small if it bears us His message.<br><br>Here we read of the children of Israel, "Then they believed his words." They did not believe till after they saw--when they saw Him work, then they believed. They really doubted God when they came to the Red Sea; but when God opened the way and led them across and they saw Pharaoh and his host drowned--"then they believed."<br>They led an up and down life because of this kind of faith; it was a faith that depended upon circumstances. This is not the kind of faith God wants us to have.<br><br>The world says "seeing is believing," but God wants us to believe in order to see. The Psalmist said, "I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living."<br>Do you believe God only when the circumstances are favorable, or do you believe no matter what the circumstances may be?

Therefore you can thank God for everything that comes, not for the sin of it, but for what God will bring out of it and through it. May God make our lives thanksgiving and perpetual praise, then He will make everything a blessing.<br>We once saw a man draw some black dots.

But if we let God come into our lives, and adjust the dots in the proper way, and draw the lines He wants, and separate this from that, and put in the rests at the proper places; out of the black dots and spots in our lives He will make a glorious harmony. Let us not hinder Him in this glorious work! --C. H. P.<br>"Would we know that the major chords were sweet, If there were no minor key? Would the painter's work be fair to our eyes, Without shade on land or sea?<br><br>"Would we know the meaning of happiness, Would we feel that the day was bright, If we'd never known what it was to grieve, Nor gazed on the dark of night?"<br>Many men owe the grandeur of their lives to their tremendous difficulties. --C.

            <div class='col-md body'>Vineyards in the Wilderness<br>"I will allure her, and bring her into the wildernessÂ…And I will give her her vineyards from thence" (Hosea 2:14-15).<br><br>A strange place to find vineyards--in the wilderness! And can it be that the riches which a soul needs can be obtained in the wilderness, which stands for a lonely place, out of which you can seldom find your way? It would seem so, and not only that, but the "Valley of Achor," which means bitterness, is called a door of hope. And she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth!<br>Yes, God knows our need of the wilderness experience. He knows where and how to bring out that which is enduring. The soul has been idolatrous, rebellious; has forgotten God, and with a perfect self-will has said, "I will follow after my lovers." But she did not overtake them. And, when she was hopeless and forsaken, God said, "I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her." What a loving God is ours! --Crumbs<br><br>We never know where God hides His pools. We see a rock, and we cannot guess it is the home of the spring. We see a flinty place, and we cannot tell it is the hiding place of a fountain. God leads me into the hard places, and then I find I have gone into the dwelling place of eternal springs. --Selected</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Polish Comes Through Trouble<br>"He hath made me a polished shaft" (Isa. 49:2).<br><br>There is a very famous "Pebble Beach" at Pescadero, on the California coast. The long line of white surf comes up with its everlasting roar, and rattles and thunders among the stones on the shore. They are caught in the arms of the pitiless waves, and tossed and rolled, and rubbed together, and ground against the sharp-grained cliffs. Day and night forever the ceaseless attrition goes on--never any rest. And the result?<br>Tourists from all the world flock thither to gather the round and beautiful stones. They are laid up in cabinets; they ornament the parlor mantels. But go yonder, around the point of the cliff that breaks off the force of the sea; and up in that quiet cove, sheltered from the storms, and lying ever in the sun, you shall find abundance of pebbles that have never been chosen by the traveler.<br><br>Why are these left all the years through unsought? For the simple reason that they have escaped all the turmoil and attrition of the waves, and the quiet and peace have left them as they found them, rough and angular and devoid of beauty. Polish comes through trouble.<br>Since God knows what niche we are to fill, let us trust Him to shape us to it. Since He knows what work we are to do, let us trust Him to drill us to the proper preparation.<br><br>"O blows that smite! O hurts that pierce This shrinking heart of mine! What are ye but the Master's tools Forming a work Divine?"<br>"Nearly all God's jewels are crystallized tears."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Lord is My Strength<br>"The Lord hath sent strength for thee" (Ps.68.28, PBV).<br>The Lord imparts unto us that primary strength of character which makes everything in life work with intensity and decision. We are "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man." And the strength is continuous; reserves of power come to us which we cannot exhaust.<br>"As thy days, so shall thy strength be"Â—strength of will, strength of affection, strength of judgment, strength of ideals and achievement.<br>"The Lord is my strength" to go on. He gives us power to tread the dead level, to walk the long lane that seems never to have a turning, to go through those long reaches of life which afford no pleasant surprise, and which depress the spirits in the sameness of a terrible drudgery.<br>"The Lord is my strength" to go up. He is to me the power by which I can climb the Hill Difficulty and not be afraid.<br>"The Lord is my strength" to go down. It is when we leave the bracing heights, where the wind and the sun have been about us, and when we begin to come down the hill into closer and more sultry spheres, that the heart is apt to grow faint.<br>I heard a man say the other day concerning his growing physical frailty, "It is the coming down that tires me!"<br>"The Lord is my strength" to sit still. And how difficult is the attainment! Do we not often say to one another, in seasons when we are compelled to be quiet, "If only I could do something!"<br>When the child is ill, and the mother stands by in comparative impotence, how severe is the test! But to do nothing, just to sit still and wait, requires tremendous strength. "The Lord is my strength!" "Our sufficiency is of God." The Silver Lining A Door Opened in Heaven "A door opened in heaven" (Rev. 4:1).<br>You must remember that John was in the Isle of Patmos, a lone, rocky, inhospitable prison, for the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus. And yet to him, under such circumstances, separated from all the loved ones of Ephesus; debarred from the worship of the Church; condemned to the companionship of uncongenial fellow-captives, were vouchsafed these visions. For him, also a door was opened.<br>We are reminded of Jacob, exiled from his father's house, who laid himself down in a desert place to sleep, and in his dreams beheld a ladder which united Heaven with earth, and at the top stood God.<br>Not to these only, but to many more, doors have been opened into Heaven, when, so far as the world was concerned, it seemed as though their circumstances were altogether unlikely for such revelations.<br>To prisoners and captives; to constant sufferers, bound by iron chains of pain to sick couches; to lonely pilgrims and wanderers; to women detained from the Lord's house by the demands of home, how often has the door been opened to Heaven.<br>But there are conditions. You must know what it is to be in the Spirit; you must be pure in heart and obedient in faith; you must be willing to count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ; then when God is all in all to us, when we live, move and have our being in His favor, to us also will the door be opened. --Daily Devotional Commentary<br>"God hath His mountains bleak and bare,<br>Where He doth bid us rest awhile;<br>Crags where we breathe a purer air,<br>Lone peaks that catch the day's first smile.<br>"God hath His deserts broad and brown--<br>A solitude--a sea of sand,<br>Where He doth let heaven's curtain down,<br>Unknit by His Almighty hand."<br>There We Saw the Giants<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I Heard a Still Voice<br>"There was silence, and I heard a still voice" (Job 4:16, margin).<br><br>A score of years ago, a friend placed in my hand a book called True Peace. It was an old mediaeval message, and it had but one thought--that God was waiting in the depths of my being to talk to me if I would only get still enough to hear His voice.<br><br>I thought this would be a very easy matter, and so began to get still. But I had no sooner commenced than a perfect pandemonium of voices reached my ears, a thousand clamoring notes from without and within, until I could hear nothing but their noise and din.<br><br>Some were my own voices, my own questions, some my very prayers. Others were suggestions of the tempter and the voices from the world's turmoil.<br><br>In every direction I was pulled and pushed and greeted with noisy acclamations and unspeakable unrest. It seemed necessary for me to listen to some of them and to answer some of them; but God said,<br><br>"Be still, and know that I am God." Then came the conflict of thoughts for tomorrow, and its duties and cares; but God said, "Be still."<br>And as I listened, and slowly learned to obey, and shut my ears to every sound, I found after a while that when the other voices ceased, or I ceased to hear them, there was a still small voice in the depths of my being that began to speak with an inexpressible tenderness, power and comfort.<br><br>As I listened, it became to me the voice of prayer, the voice of wisdom, the voice of duty, and I did not need to think so hard, or pray so hard, or trust so hard; but that "still small voice" of the Holy Spirit in my heart was God's prayer in my secret soul, was God's answer to all my questions, was God's life and strength for soul and body, and became the substance of all knowledge, and all prayer and all blessing: for it was the living GOD Himself as my life, my all.<br><br>It is thus that our spirit drinks in the life of our risen Lord, and we go forth to life's conflicts and duties like a flower that has drunk in, through the shades of night, the cool and crystal drops of dew. But as dew never falls on a stormy night, go the dews of His grace never come to the restless soul. --A. B. Simpson<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GodÂ’s Pathway to Success<br><br>Joshua 1:7<br><br>Too often, Christians shy away from the whole idea of success. Some are just grateful for whatever the Lord gives them. These misguided believers have confused success with greed and discontent! This happens because of our overwhelming obsession with the worldÂ’s definition of success.<br><br>For most people, success is equivalent to wealth and power. If you asked the average person on the street whether heÂ’s successful, thereÂ’s a good chance he would talk about his career or investments. He may even make a passing reference to his Â“15 minutes of fame.Â” Many people simply cannot view success outside of these terms.<br><br>Yet the heavenly Father calls His children to live triumphantly. If the pursuit of success were sinful, how could God have made the promise of Joshua 1:7? Was He promising money? No. Was He promising fame? No. The Lord was promising success.<br><br>For Joshua, success was defined as military victory, steadfast faith, and the fulfillment of GodÂ’s promise to Moses. Joshua wasnÂ’t concerned with money or fame; rather, he was intensely focused on fulfilling GodÂ’s plan for him. Armed with the power of the Word, Joshua boldly marched ahead and received the LordÂ’s blessings. And for that, God called him a Â“success.Â”<br><br>Do not be confused. The worldÂ’s trappings have nothing to do with spiritual success. Your family, relationships, integrity, faithfulness . . . these are the things that matter in life. When you place your emphasis on these things, youÂ’ll discover the godly way to measure success.<br><br></div>

ItÂ’s not as easy as you might think. Faced with the challenge, most people may tread slow and steady, heads down, focusing intensely at their feet. When someone attempts this task with their eyes cast downward, you can be sure theyÂ’ll fail. The footprints will be crooked.<br><br>When you walk with your eyes on your feet, you have no idea where youÂ’re going. The experience is entirely self-centered. ThereÂ’s no perspective because you cannot see how you fit into the larger landscape. ThereÂ’s no genuine focus, since every step treads over the last stepÂ’s focal point. You havenÂ’t imagined yourself as part of a bigger picture. So for all intents and purposes, you simply plod through the snow aimlessly.<br><br>The only way to make a straight line of footprints is to forget about your feet. The key is to look straight ahead and find a fence post, street sign, or tree off in the distance. Then, with your eyes fixed on that target, just start walking. If youÂ’ve locked your focus on something outside of yourself, your path will be straight every time.<br><br>The same is true in our spiritual lives. If we walk through life concentrating inwardly, weÂ’ll fail to see the bigger picture and veer off course. But when we focus beyond ourselves and fix our thoughts and spiritual eyes on Jesus, we can trust that our paths will be straight and trustworthy every step of the way (Isaiah 26:3 NLT).<br><br></div>

Maybe you were making your way just fine when, all of a sudden, you werenÂ’t sure which way to turn.<br><br>Sometimes, all of us face circumstances when our spiritual sense of direction seems unclear. Fortunately, though, Hebrews 12:1-3 lays out a clear plan for getting back on track after weÂ’ve made some missteps.<br><br>First, weÂ’re to Â“lay aside every encumbrance.Â” Here, encumbrance literally means Â“weight.Â” In other words, we should remove anything from our life that weights us down. Stress, guilt, fear, shame, and regret are just a few of the burdens that can break our backs as we strive to move forward in the Lord. WeÂ’ll simply never go far when weÂ’re dragging around unneeded baggage.<br><br>Second, weÂ’re to lay aside Â“sin which so easily entangles us.Â” Have you ever felt powerless because of your sin? It grows like a wild vine when left unattended. Sin may start small, but unless itÂ’s rooted out early, it can completely overtake you.<br><br>Third, we are to Â“run with endurance the race that is set before us.Â” This means we should stay focused. If we fall, we must stand up and carry on.  With the determination of an Olympic athlete, we press on with our eyes on the goal, despite the obstacles and distractions.<br><br>Even when we feel lost, we can be sure God has a specific plan for our lives. He knows where weÂ’ve been, He knows where we are, and He knows where weÂ’re going.  The course has been set before us, and Jesus stands waiting at the finish line.<br></div>

Of course, the power is not in the praying, but in the release God gives in His perfect answer to our prayers. Paul provides an example of one of the most effective prayers we could utter. He prays that the Colossian church:<br><br>Â• May be filled with the knowledge of GodÂ’s will. What a wonderful gesture to ask God to make clear for family members or friends the precise, exact decisions He wishes them to make in every circumstance.<br><br>Â• May walk in a manner worthy of the Lord. This means asking that someoneÂ’s life will have weightÂ–will count eternally and not temporally.<br><br>Â• May bear fruit in every good work. We should pray for loved ones to remain so Christ-centered that He through them determines their conversation, conduct, and character.<br><br>Â• May increase in the knowledge of God. Can there be a more precious request than that of wanting someone to grow ever closer to our heavenly Father?<br><br>Â• May be strengthened and sustained with the power of God. Within an evil world system, we need the supernatural power of God to help us bear up under the strain.<br><br>Â• May give thanks that we already have qualified as saints of God. There is nothing for which we should be more appreciative.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Too Busy NOT to Pray<br><br>Luke 5:15-16<br><br>Have you ever forgone your daily prayer time because you felt too busy? When we surrender quiet time for something else, weÂ’re making a statement about our priorities. It is a not-so-subtle way of saying, Â“Jesus, my calendar is more important to me than You are today. IÂ’ll catch up with You later.Â”<br><br>We all do this from time to time. ItÂ’s so easy to be pulled out of the prayer closet. We think we can Â“make upÂ” the time later because God will always be there. We seem to have taken GodÂ’s eternal, indwelling presence for granted.<br><br>We fail to realize that our quiet moments with the Lord empower us to face the challenges of each day. Therefore, the busier our day, the more time we should spend in prayer preparing for it! The Bible clearly shows that Jesus Himself protected His private time with the Father. No one had more on his mind, had more things to do, or was in greater demand than Jesus. And yet, His busiest days are the times we see Him pulling away from the crowds in order to pray.<br><br>Is prayer the first thing you remove from your daily agenda when the schedule fills up? Protect that time every day at all cost. Remember that Jesus is God. If He considered prayer necessary to prepare for His busiest days, then it is absolutely essential for the rest of us!<br></div>

YouÂ’re late for your flight, and the wheels just broke on your over-packed suitcase.<br><br>With no other option, youÂ’re forced to carry the luggage and slowly maneuver through the congested lobby toward the ticketing area. Almost immediately, a young gentleman offers to carry your bags, but you pridefully refuse. When you realize the ticket counter is two levels up, you make your way to the stairs.

But you are determined to carry your bags.<br><br>As you finally make it to the top of the steps, your arms feel numb from the pressure of your bags. Your legs are starting to buckle from the weight. Your back is aching from supporting the heavy load. Then, you spot a collection of unused baggage carts. But you ignore them, self-assured that you can handle the bags yourself.<br><br>IsnÂ’t this a silly story? Who would prefer to carry such a heavy burden, ignoring every opportunity to lay it down? And yet, many believers do just that. Our Father has called us to lay our cares at His feet. But when we fail to come to God in prayer, weÂ’re just as foolish as the man staggering with his bags through the airport.<br><br>Are you trying to carry a greater burden than you can bear?

But temptation is a broad subject.<br><br>It has to do with the deeds of the flesh and is most often associated with self-will and self-desires. A cruel, short response to someoneÂ’s question can do temptationÂ’s bidding.

Realize there is a learning process involved in obedience.<br><br>Times of spiritual failure are not wasted when we ask God to teach us how to be strong in our faith. This is how we grow and learn to avoid future temptation.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Result of Not Setting Goals<br><br>1 Corinthians 9:24-27<br><br>Some people believe goal setting undercuts trust in God. Many others refuse to be goal-oriented because they are lazy or fear failure. To be successful in the Christian life, we must accept that we will occasionally fail. Then, we must decide to get to work anyway. The alternative is to let fear or laziness dictate our actions. That would lead to one of three results: waste, drifting, or mediocrity.<br><br>It is extremely important to plan wisely, and then, to follow through on whatever steps that preparation calls for. For instance, we have to build time into our schedule for ourselves and our families. Otherwise, our day can easily be gobbled up by work and wasted time.<br><br>Refusing to set goals means weÂ’ll be acting without purpose. We will have spent time, money, and energy, and lack productivity. What will be, will be is unscriptural thinking that causes a believer to Â“drift.Â” We have the privilege of planning our life according to GodÂ’s guidance.<br><br>Throughout the Bible, the Lord directs His servants in setting goals, and then He provides the strength to achieve them. A life lacking goals is mediocre at best. Without ambitions to work toward, we have no opportunity for success. And if we never experience the thrill of achieving a long sought-after goal, we will be very disappointed with our life.<br><br>No one wants a mediocre existence of waste and apathy. A believer should never settle for less than GodÂ’s best. The indwelling Holy Spirit offers each of us the great potential to be a godly goal setter.<br></div>
