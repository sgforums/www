            <div class='col-md body'>Adjusting to GodÂ’s Plan<br><br>Colossians 3:1-3<br><br>Dr. Stanley has been a Christian for more than 60 years, and in all that time God has never once said to him, Â“What do you want to do?Â” The Lord always tells us what He wants us to do. Also, the Lord never adjusts His plans to suit our purposes. Instead, God always requires that we adjust to His.<br><br>The reason He directs all believers in the way weÂ’re to go is because HeÂ’s GodÂ—perfect in all wisdom and knowledge. He knows whatÂ’s best for us at all times. Since our Father desires to be involved in every aspect of our life, He gives clear direction. That allows us to understand what His will is for every circumstance we encounter.<br><br>By walking in the center of GodÂ’s will, we accomplish what we were created to do. We also experience life at its best. Imperfect humans will not automatically be in GodÂ’s will. So, we must make an effort to seek His way and live according to biblical precepts.<br><br>God is immutable. HeÂ’s not going to change to suit us. That means, we must make whatever adjustments are necessary to obey Him.<br><br>Sadly, by deciding not to get in line with the LordÂ’s will, far too many Christians miss out on His best. He shows them what changes need to be made, but they hesitate. As a result, these believers spend their life wondering why peace and a lasting sense of satisfaction escapes them. They lack contentment no matter how many great things they do or experience. Only obedient livingÂ—according to the FatherÂ’s planÂ—makes it possible to achieve genuine fulfillment.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why We Need Spiritual Discernment<br><br>Philippians 1:8-11<br><br>Things are not always what they seem is the mantra of mystery novels, but itÂ’s also a wise attitude for successful living. Too many people make decisions according to feelings, or they judge situations based only on what appears to be real. The Lord has given every believer a discerning spirit, so we can determine what is best.<br><br>Think about how many decisions a person makes in a dayÂ—choices about family, finances, work, etc. In an ideal world, a decision would have a correct choice and an incorrect one. As a result, it would be easy to make. In reality, however, what seems right is not always whatÂ’s best.<br><br>Some things that are neither wrong nor sinful are still outside of GodÂ’s will. Scripture doesnÂ’t contain specific directives regarding every possible life scenario. Instead, the Bible is filled with principles. At times, theyÂ’re explained through stories and often through direct teaching.<br><br>Believers have the capacity to grow in spiritual maturity. Biblical principles together with guidance from the Holy Spirit become tools for making godly judgments. The question is not whether a certain choice looks good or feels right. ItÂ’s whether or not a particular decision is GodÂ’s will for that point in a personÂ’s life.<br><br>A well-developed spirit of discernment is essential for living in GodÂ’s will. Without this sensitivity to the LordÂ’s plan, a man or woman will take everything at face value. Many choices that look good and feel right are actually contrary to what God desires for a believerÂ’s life. For that reason, we must evaluate situations from a biblical perspective.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Protective Power of Discernment<br><br>2 Peter 3:14-18<br><br>Spiritual discernment protects us from deception. Sin is always dressed up to look tempting. So if we think that what looks good and feels right must be okay, then weÂ’re in danger of being misled. When Satan tempts us, he never mentions consequences or negative impacts.<br><br>Spiritual discernment is our God-given capacity to judge what is right and wrong. It protects us from the suffering that goes along with disobedience. Ignoring anxiety in our spiritÂ—which Dr. Stanley calls Â“spiritual staticÂ”Â—is a step onto the pathway of sin.<br><br>When looking for a radio station, we want clear reception. The same is true in life. We need a clear connection to the Holy Spirit. It will give us a sense of peace and assurance that weÂ’re doing the right thing.<br><br>Sometimes an opportunity might appear harmless or, more likely, very appealing. But if the Holy Spirit inside us sends a signal not to pursue that opportunity, then we shouldnÂ’t. For some reason, God does not want us in the situation. And though we can wonder, we may never know what danger we avoided by being obedient.<br><br>Sin does not initially appear as the ugly, deceitful disobedience it is. Instead, it comes wrapped in a pretty package that can be hard to resist. GodÂ’s children can see past the glitter and false beauty if they choose to look. This spiritual wisdom comes only as the result of a clean heart and discerning spirit. A smart believer makes prayer, repentance, and biblical training a regular part of his or her routine.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Goals and Conscience<br><br>Matthew 6:22-23<br><br>WeÂ’ve spent some time this week on the issue of goal-setting and how to accomplish what God has called us to do. WeÂ’ve also examined how to determine whether or not a goal is from the Lord. Dr. StanleyÂ’s final word on the topic is simply this: a godly goal will never force you to violate your conscience.<br><br>This may seem like an obvious statement, but think about it for a minute. Most likely, thereÂ’s been a time or two when you honestly believed you were working toward the right goal. But in order to get there, you had to act in a way that caused a sting in your conscience. Whenever that happens, you can be sure God is not in that goal.<br><br>As we spend time in prayer and Bible study, the Holy Spirit weaves Himself in and through our conscience. It becomes a type of filter through which we process our behavior and decisions. So, whenever we do something that causes Â“staticÂ” in our conscience, thatÂ’s GodÂ’s way of telling us that we are stepping out of boundsÂ—that we have left His path.<br><br>Our heavenly Father will never place a goal at the end of a godless trail. The only thing you will find there is heartache, disappointment, and regret. If reaching an objective requires you to violate your conscience, then watch out! You are headed where God has not called you, and you can trust that the goal is your ownÂ—not His. Your conscience is a God-given warning system. Learn to appreciate, and obey, the alerts it sends you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Value of Words<br>Matthew 5:36-37<br>And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. Simply let your "Yes" be "Yes," and your "No," "No"; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.<br><br>Imagine for a moment that you are living in Jesus' time. It is before Jesus has begun His public ministry. He is a carpenter in your local town of Nazareth. You have asked Jesus to make a table for you. You're on a deadline and you must have it in a week. You agree on the price of $100 for the table and the date of one week for completion. A week later you arrive to pick up the table. You lay your money down on the table and Jesus says, "Mr. Johnson, I am sorry but the table is not ready. I ran into complications. Also, I can no longer honor the price I gave you. It is now $150 instead of $100."<br><br>Two years later you hear about this same Jesus who is preaching to the local townspeople. How are you going to view this Jesus? You probably won't give much credence to His message because of your personal experience. Our lives have an ability to reinforce the message we stand for, or they can violate it and make it totally ineffective. This literally happens all over the world in different settings with Christian businesspeople. Our message becomes ineffective because we have not done what we said.<br><br>I know people who, when they tell me they plan to do something, I can expect them to follow through about 50 percent of the time. I am sure you have had the same experience. Words and commitments are made with little meaning behind those words. However, I know others who will follow through almost every time. The only time they don't is when something falls outside their control. I quickly learn whose words have substance behind them.<br><br>There are times when we are unable to perform or deliver what we promised due to outside influences. The key to turning these potentially negative circumstances into a witness for Christ is communication. If we are unable to pay a bill on time, we must communicate with those we owe and make a good faith effort to resolve it within our means. In these cases, God's purposes are being performed as well if we seek to do the right thing.<br><br>Do your words mean anything to those who hear them? Do you make commitments and fail to follow through on them? What would others say about how you follow through? Ask the Lord today to show you how you are doing in this area. You might even want to ask three people who are the closest to you how you fare in this area.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Input... Output<br>Volume 3 Issue 16<br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>The sea had split. The enemy was drowned. And now the problems began.<br><br>The newly liberated nation was stranded in a scorching desert facing an unending landscape of uncertainties. Taskmasters no longer responded to their cries -- Hashem did. He responded with protection and shelter on every level. But the Jews were still not satisfied. They were hungry. "If only we had died.. in the land of Egypt. Why did you liberate us to die in the desert? " they cried to Moshe. (Exodus 16:3 )<br><br>Hashem responds with a most miraculous and equally mysterious celestial gift. Food fell from the heavens, but the people accepted it with piqued curiosity. Indeed, the dew-covered matter satiated their hunger, but they were not sure what exactly it was. "Each man said to his friend, manna ! For they did not know what it was." (Exodus 16:14) The commentaries explain that the word manna is a Hebrew-Egyptian form of the word "what."<br><br>At first, the Torah only discusses the physical attributes of the manna : "it was like a thin frost on the earth." The Torah continues to tell us that on Shabbos the manna did not fall. A double portion fell on Friday -- the extra portion was allotted for Shabbos. In referring to the manna of Shabbos the Torah tells us, "the children of Israel named it manna , and it tasted like a cake fried in honey." Later, however, the Torah describes the manna 's taste differently: "it tasted like dough kneaded with oil." (Numbers 11:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Why does the Torah wait to describe the manna 's taste until Shabbos? Also, when did it taste sweet and when did it only taste like oily dough?<br><br>Another question is before Shabbos people asked, "what is it?" On Shabbos they named the miraculous food -- "It is 'what'" (manna ). Why did the Jews wait until Shabbos to describe concretely the miraculous edible with an official title manna -- the 'what' food?<br><br>In the town of Lomza there was a group of woodcutters hired by the townsfolk to cut down trees for firewood. The strong laborers swung their axes and hit the trees all while shouting a great cry HAH with each blow. The timing had to be flawless. If the cry HAH came a split second early or, a second after the blade hit the tree, it would be a worthless shout that would not aid the lumberjacks at all.<br><br>Each year, Zelig the meshugener (crazy), a once-successful businessman who had lost his mind together with the loss of a young daughter, accompanied the woodcutters on their quest. He stood in the background and precisely as the ax hit the tree he, too, shouted on the top of his lungs HAH!<br><br>When it was time to get paid, the deranged Zelig also stood in line. "I deserve some silver coins!" he exclaimed. "After all without the chopping would not be as effective!"<br><br>The case was brought before the Chief Rabbi of Lomza who looked at the five lumberjacks and then at the meshugener. "Listen carefully, Zelig," said the Rabbi. He then took 10 silver pieces in his hand and jingled them loudly. They made a loud clanging noise. Then he gave each woodsman two silver pieces. He turned to Zelig and smiled. "The men who gave the labor get the coins, and, Zelig, you who gave the sound, get the sound of the coins!"<br><br>Hashem in His infinite wisdom began our lessons in living through our daily fare. The Talmud states that the taste of the manna was integrally linked with the taster's thoughts. If one thought of steak the manna tasted like steak: if one thought of borscht, the manna tasted like borscht. In fact, the Chofetz Chaim was once asked, "what happens if you think nothing?" He answered very profoundly: "If one thinks of nothing, then one tastes nothing!"<br><br>During the week the Jews had the manna but did not realize its great potential. The Malbim explains that is why it only tasted like oily dough. But on Shabbos, a day filled with sweet relaxation, heavenly thoughts filled the minds of the nation. And those sweet thoughts produced sweet tastes!<br><br>The Talmud also says that to small children the manna tasted like dough, but to scholars it tasted like honey. For if one thinks of honey, he tastes honey. When one thinks blandly, he has bland taste.<br><br>Perhaps on Shabbos the Jewish People realized the important lesson of life. The questions we face should not be addressed as eternally mysterious. We can not face the unknown with the question, "what is it?" Rather, we can define our destiny and challenge our uncertainties. "It is what!" What you put into it is exactly what you take out! Life presents us many opportunities. We can approach those moments with lofty thoughts and see, smell, and taste its sweetness. Or we can see nothing and taste nothing. We can chop hard and reap the benefits, or we can kvetch and enjoy only the echoes of our emptiness.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wise Water<br><br>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"With the wind from Your nostrils the waters were heaped up, the running water stood like a wall, the depths came together in the heart of the sea." [15:8]<br><br>According to the way we usually read and understand the verse and the story itself, G-d sent a strong wind, and parted the Sea. But the Targum Onkelos, the Aramaic translation of the Torah by Onkelos, says "chakimu maya" -- the water became wise. The water itself acquired intelligence!<br><br>The Gaon of Vilna explains that this happened exactly as it did in the Creation of Man. When Adam was created, he acquired intelligence when "He [G-d] breathed into his nostrils the soul of life." This is what the Targum says in translating the verse "and the man became a living being" -- "a spirit from above." The power of speech and knowledge was given to human beings, which was not given to the rest of Creation. Here as well, the water of the Sea of Reeds received intelligence and knowledge from the "wind from Your nostrils," to the point that it was able to know when to withdraw, and when to return to its place.<br><br>In Jewish thought, everything is equally natural, everything is equally miraculous. Everything is directed by G-d, whether it appears to us to be "natural" or not. Although it may appear to us that water parting is a great miracle, while the birth of an intelligent child is completely natural, both are equally dependent on G-d -- which is to say, entirely.<br><br>In the Siddur Be'er Chayim, a prayer book printed in Vilna in 5639 (1799), the author provides even a further explanation, on the verse "the water was a wall [chomah] for them." [14:22] The Yalkut quotes a Medrash which re-vowels chomah as "cheimah" -- "the water was anger for them."<br><br>Initially, the Accusing Angel came before G-d and said, "Master of the World, didn't Israel serve idols in Egypt? How can you be doing such miracles for them?" And the Ministering Angel over the Sea heard the Accuser and was enraged at Israel, and wanted to drown them.<br><br>Immediately G-d answered the Accusing Angel, "Foolish one! Do you think they made an intelligent decision to serve idols? You see that they only served them because of their enslavement, because they were being driven out of their minds. You are judging an accidental mistake like a deliberate error, a forced act like a chosen act." Since the Angel over the Sea heard this, the same anger which he had at Israel, he turned towards the Egyptians, and drowned them instead. And thus, just as the accuser was called a fool, "chakimu maya" -- the water was called wise.<br><br>G-d clearly recognizes the difference between a deliberate, hateful action, and an error -- whether through lack of awareness of the action itself, or lack of awareness of the gravity of that action. Frequently we feel that our misbehavior holds us back -- we are embarrassed. But we can rely upon this same principle, and recognize that our own acts so frequently depend upon our own lack of awareness of how important they are, of how important it might have been to behave a different way. G-d always allows us to start over, to the point that a person can commit idolatry, and shortly thereafter be worthy of miracles!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Shabbos Remembrance<br>The Mitzvah:<br><br>The majesty of Shabbos, the seventh day of the week has to be experienced to be believed. The sanctified rest day of the Sabbath is a remembrance of the creation process and of the Exodus.<br><br>What is interesting is how yetzias Mitzrayim, the exodus from Egypt is tied up with this holy day.<br><br>- The Friday night Kiddush beckoning in the holy day recalls the Exodus.<br><br>- The national observance of Shabbos began after the Jewish peopleÂ’s redemption, prior to their general acceptance of Torah at Sinai.<br><br>- The Omer offering is to commence Mimochoros HaShabbos, Â“on the morrow of ShabbosÂ” which is actually a reference to 1st day of Pesach, the date of the Exodus.<br><br>- Traditionally, the Shabbos preceding Pesach is called Shabbos HaGadol, the Great Shabbos.<br><br>- The fifty Torah remembrances of the Exodus parallels the fifty weeks in the Jewish lunar year (Sefas Emes, Shabbos HaGadol).<br><br>But what does the celebration of Shabbos, the Â“seventh dayÂ” of the week, the day whereupon G-d rested from His creation of the world, also viewed as zecher lÂ’yetzias Mitzrayim, a remembrance to the departure from Egypt?<br><br>In truth, the two are interrelated.<br><br>The Shabbos Bereishis, the Sabbath of creation marked the point when the Master of the Universe completed crafting His marvelous world. Â“And G-d completed on the seventh day the labor which he madeÂ” (Bereishis 2:2).<br><br>Technically speaking, the material was in place and was Â“finishedÂ”. Then, the rules of the nature realm and how the world was to function became fully operational. And yet, it still lacked absolute completion.<br><br>That Â“completionÂ” would only be attained generations later upon yetzias Mitzrayim commemorating the departure from Egypt.<br><br>Through the Exodus, the nation of Yisrael, the Children of Israel came into being. This small, newly liberated nation would become the ones responsible for spiritually Â“completingÂ” the world Â– providing it with direction and purpose with their acceptance of Torah. This is why Shabbos is bound up with yetzias Mitzrayim (Maharal, Tiferes Yisrael Ch.44).<br><br>The nascent nation went from a physically oppressed group of slaves to a chosen people and a kingly nation. Their redemption charters a journey from the Â“mundaneÂ” and Â“materialÂ”Â– personified in the hedonistic nature of Egypt and the physical labor of the Israelites for Paroh Â– to a pure, Â“formÂ” and Â“spiritualÂ” identity. It is the transformation from the six mundane days of week to the sanctified seventh endpoint: Shabbos<br><br>The observance of Shabbos is the exclusive divine gift given to the Jewish people. The nationÂ’s Â“holinessÂ” corresponds to the holiness of this day called Shabbos Kodosh, the holy Sabbath. The freedom from Egypt was the catalyst to the spiritual freedom. Indeed, the fiftieth day from their escape they embraced the Torah on Shavuos. And on which day was the Torah given? On Shabbos of course!<br><br>It is the Â“completionÂ” of their spiritual form and their Shabbos observance that complements the Â“completionÂ” of G-dÂ’s creation. Hence the remembrance of Shabbos is inclusive of both creation and the Exodus.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mon or Man?</strong><br>Ostensibly, life in the Sinai Desert during the 40 years between leaving Egypt and entering the Holy Land were years of near- paradisiacal comforts. Imagine arising each morning, and shaking open the corner of your tent to find fresh Manna waiting at your doorstep. Your individualized portion came gift-wrapped in a light layer of dew on each side (Yalkut Shimoni, Bamidbar/Numbers 11). Its taste resembled the sweetest honey-cake, although you werenÂ’t limited to consuming it as-is; this versatile delicacy could be baked, cooked and fried (Shemos/Exodus 16:23). Whatever taste you felt like, you could taste it in the Manna (Midrash Tanchuma, Chukas 19). Whether you were in the mood for meat, fish, a snack or desertÂ—it had everything.<br><br>And thatÂ’s only the food. Clothing was a non-issue, as your clothing never wore out (Devarim/Deuteronomy 8:4), and the Clouds of Glory would launder and iron them to keep them looking fresh and clean (Rashi ibid.). The Clouds of Glory also flattened the mountains and filled-in the valleys to make our travels more pleasant (Rashi, Bamidbar 10:34), provided a cushiony walking-surface to ensure orthopaedic comfort (Pesikta Rabasi 13), and regulated the air keeping things cool in the heat and warm in the cold (Yevamos 72a).<br><br>With all our needs taken care of so luxuriously, all that was left to do was to come to MosheÂ’s court to study Torah (Midrash Tanchuma, beginning of Beshalach)! Indeed, Chazal (our Sages) tell us: The Torah was given exclusively to those who ate the Manna (Mechilta, Beshalach).<br><br>How indeed did it feel to wake up every morning to the smell of fresh Mon? And in what way is being counted among the Manna-eaters a pre-requisite to being a student of the Torah?<br><br>Rabbi Shimon bar YochaiÂ’s students asked him: Â“WouldnÂ’t it have been better for the Manna fall once a year?Â”<br><br>Â“Let me give you an analogy,Â” he said. Â“A king had a son. He gave him a yearly allowance. Once a year, the prince would come to greet his father, the king. [Unhappy with this arrangement,] the king decided to give him a daily allowance instead. Now, the prince would come and visit him every day.<br><br>Â“So too the Jews in the desert, if someone had four or five children, he would be worried: Â‘Perhaps the Mon wonÂ’t fall tomorrow, and we will all die of hunger.Â’ This forced them to strengthen their belief in their Heavenly Father.Â” [Yoma 76a]<br><br>This Gemara implies that receiving the Mon as a daily allowance had an element of anxiety: There was no Â‘money in the bank,Â’ and our next meal was never prepared in advance.<br><br>Commenting on the verses in the Tochacha/Admonition (Devarim 28:66), Â“And your lives will hang in the balance; you will fear night and dayÂ…Â” the Talmud (Menachos 103b; Rashi) says, Â“This [curse] refers to the man who has no land, and must rely on a yearly, weekly, or daily allotmentÂ—he never knows what the future will bring.Â”<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mon or Man?</strong><br><br>In this light, and bearing in mind Rabbi ShimonÂ’s answer to his students, we must ask: Was receiving the Manna HashemÂ’s greatest present, or, G-d forbid, a curse?<br><br>To ascertain if the Earth had recovered from the Flood, Noach sent out the dove to see if it could find dry land on which to nest. She returned with an olive branch in her beak; the trees were visible, but the land was not. The Gemara (Eiruvin 18b) explains the significance of the olive branch:<br><br>Said the dove to the Holy One, blessed is He, Â“Master of the Universe, I would rather my sustenance be bitter like this olive branch from Your hand, than to have the sweetest honey from the hands of flesh-and-blood (Noach sustained the animals on the Ark).Â”<br><br>Why does the dove assume that her sustenance from the hand of Hashem will in some way be bitter, while that from the hand of man will be sweet? And donÂ’t we believe that everything we receive ultimately comes from Hashem, even when Â‘the hand of manÂ’ serves as His intermediary?<br><br>Quoting the verse (Mishlei/Proverbs 3:16), Â“Lengthy days on her right side; on her left sideÂ—wealth and honour,Â” the Gemara (Shabbos 63a) explains: This refers to the Torah. The Â‘right sideÂ’ refers to those who study Torah for the Â‘rightÂ’ reasons (li-shema); the Â‘left sideÂ’ refers to those who study Torah, but not for its own sake (she-lo li-shema). The Gemara asks: This seems unfairÂ—those who study Torah for the wrong reasons receive wealth and honour, while the true Torah scholars, who toil in Torah study completely for its own sake, do not? The Gemara answers: All the more so (kal ve-chomer)! They certainly receive wealth and honour, as well as long years in which to enjoy them!<br><br>It emerges from here, explain mefarshim, that the wealth and honour awarded the true Torah scholar are fundamentally different than that given to his contemporaries.<br><br>There are two people who never have to worry about money: The multi- millionaire, and his son. Their lives, however, differ greatly.<br><br>The wealthy magnate doesnÂ’t have to worry about how to pay for his trip to Israel or his kidÂ’s braces, but heÂ’s up at nights wondering what to do with his wealth: How to invest it in order to reap the greatest dividends; and how to protect it from dishonest swindlers, outright thieves, and bad investments.<br><br>In contrast, his son sleeps sweetly at night. He takes little interest in the source of his fatherÂ’s wealth; all thatÂ’s important to him is his signature, with which he signs his cheque book.<br><br>This is the difference between the wealth of the Torah scholar and that of everyone else. To most of us wealth means lots of money in the bank, cars, houses, and possessions. To the Torah scholar, such wealth can be a two- edged sword; he doesnÂ’t want the time spent caring for and protecting that wealth to detract from his toil in Torah.<br><br>Thus, Hashem, generally, doesnÂ’t give the talmid chacham real wealth, ostensibly excluding him from the Â‘wealth and honourÂ’ mentioned by the Prophet. He receives his wealth through a kal ve-chomer argumentÂ—if others get what they need, he certainly must! If he needs money for a wedding or bar mitzvahÂ—itÂ’s there when he needs it. A bigger house for his growing family?Â—A great deal comes up out of nowhere, and he buys it for a fraction of its true value. His wealth, by way of analogy, is like the open-ended cheque bookÂ—take what you need when you need it, and donÂ’t worry about where the moneyÂ’s coming from. After allÂ—heÂ’s got a rich Father. [Toldos Yaakov Yosef]<br><br>To live such a lifestyle, of course, requires tremendous faith. Not everyoneÂ’s cut out to live from day-to-day without worrying about tomorrow, secure in his belief that his wealthy Father in Heaven will take care of him. Most of us need the money in the bank; itÂ’s only those whose lives are completely dedicated to pure Torah study that can function at such a high level of bitachon (faith).<br><br>Perhaps this is the Â‘bitternessÂ’ of which the dove speaks. Those who receive their sustenance by the hand of man, i.e. a weekly pay cheque, experience an element of sweetness in their earnings. They may work hard, but they know they can rely on their cheque being there at monthÂ’s-end to help make ends meet and ensure payments donÂ’t bounce. Those whoÂ—like the Torah scholarÂ—rely directly on Hashem, so to speak, for their living, experience the Â‘bitternessÂ’ of not knowing. Yet it is a bitterness about which the dove fondly reminisces: Better this bitter twig from You, than sweet honey from others!<br><br>And perhaps this helps explain the concept of the Torah being given Â‘exclusively to those who ate the Man.Â’ There was an element of anxiety regarding the Man, to be sure. Yet it is precisely this anxiety that the true Torah scholar must learn to deal with, and appreciate, if he aspires to reach the lofty goal of limud Torah li-shema (Torah study for its own sake).<br><br>Have a good Shabbos.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What to Answer!<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>The Midrash Aggadah records the following exchange: Â“The wicked Tornusrofus asked Rabbi Akiva, Â“For what reason is the name of the Holy One mentioned in the first five of the Ten Commandments and not in the latter five?Â” Rabbi Akiva went to the Palace of Tornusrofus and in particular to the room designated for his weapons of war and there he showed him his entire magazine of armaments. Then he went with him to his bathroom, and Rabbi Akiva asked him, Â“Why do you not put here some of you weaponry?Â” Tornusrofus answered, Â“It would be a disgrace to put them in such a disgusting place!Â” Said Rabbi Akiva, Â“So it is with the first five commandments which is an honorable context but the latter five that speak of murder, adultery, theft, false testimony, and lusting, The Holy One Blessed Be He, did not want His Name to be directly associated with themÂ…Â”<br><br>We can learn not only from the content of Rabbi AkivaÂ’s answer but by the style of his reply. Â“Answer the fool according to his foolishnessÂ…Â” King Solomon, the wisest of all men advises in MishleÂ’. ItÂ’s a daily challenge that comes with the territory for those of us who darn the garb.<br><br>I was entering a prison to visit and a guard asked me, Â“Why do you guys where hats and dress like that?Â” I pointed out to him that the identifiable difference between a prisoner and guard is just a piece of cloth. You have a couple of stripes on your gray khaki shirt and the prisoners wear beige khakis. Everybody wears a uniform of some kind. Even those who think they donÂ’t wear a costume of non-conformity manage to dress alike. Yours uniform says, Â“YouÂ’re a guard!Â” Mine declares, Â“IÂ’m a guard, of a different sort!Â”<br><br>A man I was seated next to, at a local Simcha, started to lecture loudly about evolution. Everyone sat politely, without reacting. Then he turned to me and said, Â“I donÂ’t expect you to agree because you are religious!Â” I told him, Â“IÂ’m not as religious as you!Â” He answered me, Â“IÂ’m not religious!Â” I insisted, Â“Every Jew is religious! You happen to be religious about evolution. I was not preaching to you but you were sure trying hard to convince or convert me and my friends! YouÂ’re even more religious than I am.Â”<br><br>A Russian Bubby went looking for an apartment for her daughter in Russia and had to face an Anti-Semitic Communist party bureaucrat who promptly accused her of having killed his lord. She challenged him, Â“Why didnÂ’t you stop me?Â” He retorted, Â“I wasnÂ’t there!Â” Then she told him pointedly, Â“Neither was I!Â” She got the apartment!<br><br>A Chassidic friend of mine was on a plane to Israel and was eating his kosher meal while carrying on a casual conversation with the secular Israeli gent seated next to him. He offered to share his meal or to try to get him a kosher meal too. The man refused with the reply, Â“IÂ’m a Jew in my heart!Â” As the plane ride and the conversation continued, the topic turned to politics and things got heated. The Israeli asked my friend with full animation, Â“Why donÂ’t you serve in the army?Â” The Chassid insisted he was in the army? The fellow was extremely skeptical and when pressed the Chassid confessed, Â“IÂ’m in the army - Â“in my heart!Â”<br><br>The Mishne insists, Â“Know what to answer to a heretic!Â” We need not always answer but is it important to know Â“what to answerÂ” and to know that there is Â“what to answer!Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Commandments<br><br>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br>In this week's parsha we read about one of the most significant events in the Torah. That is the giving of the Torah by G-d to the Children of Israel at Mount Sinai. The entire nation comprising of millions of people heard G-d's voice at this awesome event. The waves of this event are still rippling in the world and shaping world history in profound ways. It is noteworthy that this event, and not the miracles of the Exodus from Egypt are the basis of our faith. We do not accept miracles as a basis for our religion. We do not accept the word of one enlightened individual claiming connections with G-d as a basis for a religion. It is only because our great great...grandparents stood at Mount Sinai and heard G-d's voice that we committed ourselves to serve G-d by keeping His commandments.<br><br>The Talmud tells us that there are 613 commandments in the Torah that we are obligated to follow. Of these 365 are negative (don't's), and 248 are positive (do's). Many are tied to living in Israel, many are laws regarding sacrifices and the Temple. Many still apply today, although some temporarily don't apply as there is no Temple and no sacrifices. Since the Ten Commandments are in this week's parsha, it's worth while examining what they really demand from us. Briefly, we'll discuss each one.<br><br>1. I am G-d, your L-rd, who brought you out from the land of Egypt from the house of servitude. This is a precept to cultivate one's faith in G-d. Indeed, it is axiomatic to our beliefs that everyone has an innate spark of faith by virtue of the holy soul inside them. We are enjoined by this commandment to fan this spark and make it burn warmly and brightly.<br><br>2.You should not have any gods of others before Me. This commandment demands exclusive worship of The One G-d. One may not even consider the possibility that any other powers exist not under G-d's jurisdiction, or even any powers which share control of the universe with Him. This is one of the three commandments which we are expected to give our lives for rather than transgress. One should not serve other powers in any way, even if the act is an act of disgrace. There was a form of idol worship in ancient times which was performed by throwing stones at the idol. This would still be forbidden.<br><br>3. Do not invoke the name of G-d your L-rd falsely. We may not swear in G-d's name falsely. This can be done in four different ways. a. Swearing that a man is a woman, or that a stone is gold. b. swearing for nothing; i.e. that a stone is a stone. c. swearing not to perform a commandment. d. swearing to do the impossible; i.e. to fly etc.<br><br>4. Remember the Sabbath day to make it holy. This commandment involves verbally sanctifying the beginning and ending of the Sabbath. Rabbinically, this is done by reciting blessings while holding a cup of wine which acknowledge the institution of the Holy Sabbath. Part of making The Sabbath holy is wearing fine clothing, eating fine foods, spending time with family, and setting it aside for enjoyable pursuits. There are also many activities which go into the category of "melacha," loosely translated as "work," to refrain from doing on the Sabbath.<br><br>5. Honor your father and your mother. Honoring is considered a positive act. It involves the "do's" of dealing with parents. Among them are bringing them food and drink, helping them dress (if they need it), and standing up for them when they enter. Elsewhere the Torah commands us to "fear" our parents, dealing with the "don't's". Among them are not contradicting a parents words, and not calling a parent by their first name.<br><br>6.Don't kill. One should not kill unless it is for self-defense. One who unnecessarily kills is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. This is another one of the three precepts for which we must give our lives rather than commit.<br><br>7. Don't commit adultery. We are commanded to control ourselves and not give in to our desires when doing so would be a forbidden act. A man having a marital relationship with another man's wife is forbidden. Similarly, a married woman having an extramarital relationship is forbidden by this same prohibition. This too is one of the three precepts for which we must give our lives rather than commit.<br><br>8. Don't steal. This is a commandment prohibiting kidnapping. Not stealing is mentioned elsewhere in the Torah.<br><br>9. Don't give false testimony. Here the Torah forbids us to use our credibility to establish things as facts which we are not sure of. Needless to say, this includes lying, but it even includes one testifying based on another's word as if he himself was a witness; even if the information is from a reliable source.<br><br>10. Don't covet. One should not desire other people's things. This commandment forbids us to pressure someone to sell us something he really doesn't want to sell. This is even when we are offering a better than fair price. The advice given to avoid desiring someone else's things is to imagine they are on the moon, and completely out of our reach. Something which is not mine is not in my world. It is unavailable, and unattainable, so I will take my mind off of it. Proper fulfillment of this commandment depends a great deal upon one's degree of satisfaction with his portion in life.<br><br>These are the commandments which G-d conveyed to the Children of Israel at the time of the Giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai approximately 3,300 years ago. It is amazing to note how much the noble aspect of societies and civilizations have embraced these as truths. It was all based on this earth-shaking event without which the Jewish Nation would have assimilated and faded away long ago.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>What's News<br>Though the marquee event of this week's portion surrounds the epic event of Matan Torah, the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai, there are still many lessons to be learned from every pasuk of the parsha, even the seemingly innocuous ones. Rabbi Mordechai Rogov , of blessed memory, points out a fascinating insight from the following verses that discuss the naming of Moshe's children.<br><br>"Yisro, the father-in-law of Moses, took Zipporah, the wife of Moses, after she had been sent away, and her two sons - of whom the name of one was Gershom, for he had said, 'I was a sojourner in a strange land.' And the name of the other was Eliezer, for 'the God of my father came to my aid, and He saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.'" (Exodus 18:2-4).<br><br>After Moshe killed the Egyptian taskmaster who had hit the Hebrew slave, Pharaoh put a price on Moshe's head. The Medrash tells us that Moshe's head was actually on the chopping block but he was miraculously saved. He immediately fled from Egypt to Midian. In Midian, he met his wife Zipporah and there had two sons.<br><br>The question posed is simple and straightforward: Moshe was first saved from Pharaoh and only then did he flee to Midian and become a "sojourner in a strange land." Why did he name his first child after the events in exile his second son in honor of the miraculous salvation from Pharaoh's sword?<br><br>Rav Rogov points out a certain human nature about how events, even the most notable ones, are viewed and appreciated through the prospect of time.<br><br>Chris Matthews in his classic book Hardball, An Inside Look at How Politics is Played by one who knows the Game, tells how Senator Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky, who would later serve as Harry Truman's vice president, related a story that is reflective of human nature and memory. In 1938, Barkley had been challenged for reelection to the Senate by Governor A. B. 'Happy" Chandler, who later made his name as Commissioner of Baseball.<br><br>During that campaign, Barkley liked to tell the story of a certain rural constituent on whom he had called in the weeks before the election, only to discover that he was thinking of voting for Governor Chandler. Barkley reminded the man of the many things he had done for him as a prosecuting attorney, as a county judge, and as a congressman and as a senator.<br><br>"I recalled how I had helped get an access road built to his farm, how I had visited him in a military hospital in France when he was wounded in World War I, how I had assisted him in securing his veteran's benefits, how I had arranged his loan from the Farm Credit Administration, and how l had got him a disaster loan when the flood destroyed his home."<br><br>"How can you think of voting for Happy?" Barkley cried. "Surely you remember all these things I have done for you!"<br><br>"Sure," the fellow said, "I remember. But what in the world have you done for me lately?"<br><br>Though this story in no way reflects upon the great personage of Moshe, the lessons we can garner from it as well as they apply to all of us.<br><br>Rabbi Rogov explains that though the Moshe's fleeing Pharaoh was notably miraculous it was still an event of the past. Now he was in Midian. The pressure of exile from his parents, his immediate family, his brother Ahron and sister Miriam, and his people, was a constant test of faith. Therefore, the name of Moshe's first son commemorated his current crisis as opposed to his prior, albeit more miraculous and traumatic one.<br><br>Sometimes appreciating the minor issues of life take precedence over even the most eventful - if that is what is currently sitting on the table.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shabbos Speak<br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>This week we read the Aseres HaDibros, known throughout civilization as the Ten Commandments. Most of the commandments are well known, and even observed, albeit in varying degrees by manifold societies. One command, however, begs for correct observance by the Jewish nation, "Zachor es yom haShabbos l'kadsho -- Remember the Shabbos to keep it holy." This commandment has a sister command stated in the second set of Luchos in Deuteronomy, "Shamor es yom haShabbos l'kadsho, Observe the Shabbos to keep it holy."<br><br>The laws of Shabbos observance fills an entire tractate and myriad pages of commentaries. There are 39 melachos, categories of creative work, that are prohibited on Shabbos. That is observance. But what does "remember the Shabbos to keep it holy" mean? Obviously if one observes the Shabbos, he remembers it!<br><br>Though the Talmud derives from this verse the mitzvah of kiddush, at which we remember the Shabbos with an open declaration of its sanctity, it seems to be telling us something more than declaring its entry over a cup of wine. But how does the command of remembering Shabbos add to the mitzvah of observing it?<br><br>The next verse reads: "Six days shall you work and accomplish all your work: but the seventh day is Shabbos to Hashem" (ibid 20:9)<br><br>Shouldn't the order of the two p'sukim be reversed? First the Torah should tell us to accomplish our work in six days, then tell us that the seventh is Sabbath, and only then tell us to sanctify it by remembering it? After all, we stop work before we say kiddush?<br><br>The prophet Isaiah tells us, "If for Shabbos you restrain your feet (from going) and if you honor it by not doing your ways, or seeking your needs, or speaking the forbidden, then you shall be granted pleasure from Hashem. (Isaiah 58:13-14).<br><br>The Talmud derives that Shabbos talk, like Shabbos action, should be distinguished from weekday actions or speech. Just as one does not perform business on Shabbos, he should not talk about doing business either.<br><br>Thus some Jews who unfortunately are unable to contain themselves from discussing the mundane on Shabbos, preempt their mundane banter with the useless caveat, "nit oif Shabbos geredt," meaning, "this really should not be discussed on Shabbos." Unfortunately some do not heed their own precursory and continue their irreverent discussions.<br><br>A fable I heard years ago, personifies a sad state of spirituality, but, perhaps shines a meaningful explanation for our question.<br><br>It was amazingly quiet, during the laining in the small shul on 43rd Street one Shabbos, when Cohen sauntered over to Finkelstein and in a hushed tone asked, "Nit oif Shabbos g'redt, do you know anybody who has a car for sale? My old clunker died on Thursday."<br><br>Finkelstein was surprised. "You know," he admitted, "Nit oif Shabbos g'redt, I am thinking of selling my '96 Chevy!"<br><br>"Really?, responded Cohen in delight, " Nit oif Shabbos g'redt, how does it run?"<br><br>Nit oif Shabbos g'redt, it runs great! It has only 43,000 miles and I just put in a new transmission!<br><br>Suddenly, they heard a klop on the bimah. They turned to see the icy stares of the gabbai.<br><br>They nuzzled their noses into the chumashim as the Ba'al Koreh continued to read from the Torah.<br><br>A few minutes later, Cohen crept back toward Finkelstein. "Nit oif Shabbos g'redt what color is it?"<br><br>As the stares began anew, Cohen answered in a low whisper, "Nit oif Shabbos g'redt, its blue."<br><br>Cohen realized that he forgot to ask a most pertinent question. "Nit oif Shabbos g'redt, how much do you want for it?"<br><br>Finkelstein responded, "Nit oif Shabbos g'redt, $4,200. Cash."<br><br>A few minutes later Cohen countered, "nit oif Shabbos g'redt, how about 3,500?<br><br>'Finkelstein snapped back. "Nit oif Shabbos g'redt nothing less than 4,000!"<br><br>Cohen was quiet. "I'll think about it."<br><br>Cohen was the first one in shul for Mincha that afternoon. The moment Finkelstein walked in Cohen ran over to him.<br><br>"Nit oif Shabbos g'redt, you know the car you told me about this morning, It's a deal! I'll take it for four thousand!<br><br>Yankel, shrugged. "Too late. Nit oif Shabbos g'redt I sold it during musaf!"<br><br>Perhaps with the words, "remember the Shabbos to keep it holy," the Torah tells us more than just to make kiddush. It qualifies our Shabbos by defining the proper approach to its observance! Shabbos was created for sanctity! Remember it, and speak about it in holy terms. Shabbos should not be a frame of reference in which we set our mundane plans. Rather it should be the central focus of holiness.<br><br>Often we hear people use Shabbos as a reference point for their weekly activities. "After Shabbos we are going to a party." "I have a great stock tip, I'll tell you about it after Shabbos!" "What time is Shabbos over? I have to catch a plane."<br><br>Shabbos, and remembering it should be mentioned and remembered in the context of sanctity and appreciation! It must be associated with all the wonderful benefits we derive from it! That is what the Torah means by the words, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy!" We should cherish the Shabbos, prolong it, savor it, and bask in its holiness. Therefore the Torah follows its charge with the formula, "Six days shall you work and accomplish all your work," When one feels that his work was accomplished during the previous six days, then Shabbos will not be just a stepping stone in planning the next six! He no longer will associate the Shabbos with what he can not do, but rather he will associate Shabbos with the amazing spirituality that it bestows upon Israel.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Return to Sender<br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>Yisro is the portion in which the Children of Israel arrive at their spiritual, intellectual, and moral destination. It is the portion in which the former Hebrew slaves choose to become the Chosen People, choosing the responsibilities of 613 mitzvos and all their accountability. This week the Jews accept the Torah at Mount Sinai.<br><br>It does not come easy. Hashem prefaces the offering with an overpowering charge. He sends Moshe to speak to both the men and women. "You shall be to Me a kingdom of ministers and a holy nation" (Exodus19:6). Accepting the Torah included the responsibilities of a holy nation -- a new moral divining rod for a world fraught with immorality. But they were up to the challenge and they responded as such.<br><br>They did not murmur their response nor did they mumble their acceptance. The Jews affirmed their agreement in unison with words that resound throughout history as the battle cry of Jewish faith. They shouted in unison, "All that Hashem has commanded, we shall do!" (Exodus 19:8 ). The response, declaring total submission to Torah dictates, was proudly noted by the Almighty, handing the Jews a most chosen nation status through all their ordeals.<br><br>But Moshe did not look up to heaven with a content smile, as if he was a proud brother sharing nachas with a father who was watching from the bleachers. The Torah tells us, "and Moshe related the words of the people to Hashem" (Exodus19:9). He returned to the Master of the Universe and reported the good news. He repeated the response, verbatim, to Hashem.<br><br>The question is obvious. Moshe knew, perhaps better than any mortal being, that every action, gesture, and thought of any inhabitant of this planet is duly recorded by the Almighty. Why, then, did he report back the response? Hashem was well aware of the enthusiasm and willing acceptance of the people. Furthermore, by telling us that Moshe went back to Hashem, isn't the Torah opening a Pandora's box? Could one possibly infer that Hashem, needed Moshe to find out the response? Obviously there is a deeper lesson to be learned!<br><br>In New York State when a baby is born, tests are administered to determine if the baby has any genetic diseases. Among them are tests for histidinemia. This condition causes excessive levels of the protein histadine to build up in the blood, which can damage the nervous system and cause retardation. The disease must be attended to immediately. A histadine level of 1 or 2 points is considered normal.<br><br>Ten days after a baby was born to a young couple, the hospital frantically tracked down the parents to tell them that their child had a histadine level -- of 12! The hospital told the young couple to rush back with the baby. The father instantaneously called his Rebbe, Reb Yaakov Kamenetzky who was the sandek at the baby's bris just a few days ago.<br><br>Reb Yaakov said he would pray for the child who appeared fine at the bris. Then he told them to insist that the histadine test be repeated before any treatment is administered. The parents rushed back to Bellevue Hospital where they were greeted by an assortment of doctors, nurses, nutritionists, and therapists. The staff wanted to admit the newborn into the hospital immediately. They warned that if the baby was not admitted, permanent brain damage could result. The parents insisted that the test be re-administered to which the doctors grudgingly replied, "we will re-do the test, but understand," they grumbled, "that these tests are extremely accurate. We never get a false reading."<br><br>They re-administered the procedure and came out with a totally different figure than the first time. The histadine level was a bit over one! After further review, they realized that the first test was not off -- the technician was! He put the decimal in the wrong place. The original reading should not have been 12, but rather 1.2!<br><br>The couple, quite upset about the unnecessary scare and trauma, drove with the baby straight to the home of Rabbi Kamenetzky to inform him that the whole ordeal was a mistake. Reb Yaakov, who was elated at the news, held the young father and kissed him. "Thank you for coming and telling me the news," said the Torah sage. "So many people just tell me their tzorus (problems), they ask me for advice, even prayers, but when things get better, I never find out. I am left bearing the burden of their worries."<br><br>Moshe knew that Hashem heard the answer of the Jewish nation as loud, if not louder, than he did. But he was sent on a mission and he had a responsibility to convey the good news. But he wanted to send the Jewish people a message as well. He taught his people that before one can receive the Torah he must be a good messenger. Everything that we study - everything we do on this earth is but a message that must be accounted to for Hashem. Even if Hashem knows what we are doing, we must return with a report of accomplishment. And Moshe taught us that Derech Eretz must not only precede the learning of the Torah, it must precede the giving of it as well.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No Justice No Place<br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>The Jewish judicial system was brought into existence after Moshe's father-in-law Yisro criticized the system he felt was wrought with confusion and delay. In that system, Moshe bore the brunt of every minor complaint and grievance. He ruled on everything, and it was too much for him. His father-in-law would no longer allow it.<br><br>"What you are doing is no good." cried Yisro. "You and the entire nation will wither from exhaustion." (Exodus 18:17)<br><br>Yisro devised a plan in which judges were appointed on many levels. The simple cases would be presented to the lower judges, and the more difficult cases would work their way up the system until they finally reached Moshe. It was a workable plan that was received enthusiastically by Moshe and the leadership. It was the foundation for every judicial system from that time on.<br><br>Yisro ends his ingenious instruction with a blessing and an assurance. "If you do this thing -- with G-d's consent, then you will endure and the entire nation will arrive at their place in peace." (Exodus 18:23)<br><br>They are very encouraging words. But they are difficult to relate to. What does expedient adjudication have to do with arriving at one's destination or finding one's place? What could Yisro mean by stating that if you mete out justice everyone will arrive at his place in peace? He should have said, "and the entire nation will live together in peace." The words "arrive at his place in peace" seem to have little meaning.<br><br>Rabbi Chaim Kreisworth, the Chief Rabbi of Antwerp, Belgium, tells of a member of his congregation who approached him obviously quite upset.<br><br>"Rabbi," he exclaimed, "I just don't understand." My friend Yankel and I began businesses of the same type at approximately the same time. He is doing remarkably well, while I am just floundering!." "Are you working as hard as he is?" Rabbi Kreisworth asked.<br><br>"I sure am!" came the reply. "My place is right down the block from his, and I never close my shop until I see his car pull away!"<br><br>"Perhaps he has more employees?"<br><br>"Can't be. I checked with his manager, and I have recently added two more than he has!"<br><br>"Perhaps the decor of his store is more attractive to consumers?"<br><br>"It just can't be that, Rabbi. He remodeled last year, I checked the lighting, square footage, display cases -- and on each count I outdid him when I remodeled a month later!"<br><br>At this point Rabbi Kreisworth smiled, "I have it all figured out. The reason Yankel is doing so much better than you is because he is only concerned in running his business. You, my friend, are running two! If you would just stay in your own place, you will also become a success."<br><br>One of the Jewish people's greatest assets is their ability to watch their own place. "How glorious are your tents, Jacob" is a reference to the dessert tents whose doorways did not face each other. When Jews argue and there is no justice, each one looks at the other: "what is he doing with my money?" However, when quick and fair justice is meted, each party can go home satisfied and ready to proceed with their own life. Yisro stated it with an exact certainty "and the entire nation will arrive at their place in peace." If you have justice then everyone will truly arrive at his place in peace. No one will be interested in someone else's place! And in that manner they all can find a place in peace.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We Were There!<br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>This week's parshah sheet is dedicated to the refuah shlaimah of Rafael Avraham ben Orah Yuta.<br><br>The foundation of foundations and the pillar of all wisdom is to know that there is a prime source of realityÂ…The knowing of this matter is a Positive Mitzvah as it says, Â“I am HASHEM your G-d Â…(Shemos 20:2) (Rambam Hilchos YesodeÂ’ HaTorah 1:1-6)<br><br>It is worth noting that the Rambam uses the term - Â“knowledgeÂ” as opposed to -Â“beliefÂ”. We might ask how one achieves the certainty associated with Â“knowledgeÂ” on this most important subject. The Rambam gives a key. Â“I am HASHEM your G-d Who took you out of the land of Egypt. How is Â“knowledgeÂ” implied in that verse?<br><br>The Kuzari asks why The Almighty makes such a small claim!? Â“I am the HASHEM your G-d Who took you out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage!Â” He could have said, Â“I created the heavens and the earth!Â” Why focus on Egypt?<br><br>Imagine if you will, I own the GM building in Mid Town Manhattan. I lock an employee in the 46th Floor wash room over a three day holiday weekend. Monday morning I unlock the door and remind him that I am the one who let him out of that room. He looks at me and wonders aloud, Â“Why did you lock me in there in the first place? And, Â“Since you own the whole building, why do you need to claim control over one small water closet in the entire complex?Â” HeÂ’s right! Why?<br><br>The Kuzari explains the intent of the verse. The knowledge G-d is reinforced by the entire process of the exodus. It was something that we experienced unlike the inception of the world. Who was there, then? In Egypt, we, as a people, witnessed the whole drama of EgyptÂ’s miraculous collapse and our emergence as a nation. It was an historical revelation not a hysterical revolution. Therefore The Almighty commands us to know the reality of His existence and not just to believe abstractly or philosophically. Since that time, way back when, a year has never lapsed without Pesach or a week without Shabbos- Â“In memory of leaving EgyptÂ…Â” Â…Or a day without Tefillin or Tzitsis, both being reminders of having left Egypt. The echo of that experience is captured forever in our continuous loyalty to those observances and many more for more than 3300 years. And so says the prophet about our people- Â“You are my witnesses, so says HASHEM and I am your G-d!Â” (Isaiah 43:12)<br><br>I was on a plane from St. Louis to Seattle and one seat away was a middle aged woman that worked up the courage to ask me about half way into the flight, Â“Are you Amish?Â” (Not Heimishe). I told her, Â“No, I am not! I donÂ’t think Amish people fly on planes.Â” Â“IÂ‘m sorry!Â” she said showing great care and sensitivity. I told her that she need not apologize. I went back to my reading and she returned to her book until she got up the courage again, Â“What are you then?Â” she asked. I told her, Â“IÂ’m a Jew!Â” There was an awkward silence.<br><br>After some moments she inquired again, Â“What do you people believe?Â” I told her, showing the Hebrew Text of the Tanach (The Bible) I held in my hands, Â“We are the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that stood by Mount Sinai with Moses and heard The Almighty declare, Â“I am The Lord your G-d that took you out of the Land of EgyptÂ…ThatÂ’s who I am and thatÂ’s who we are!Â” The conversation ended but I could tell she was overawed by the realization that this fellow who walked onto the plane is part of a living group that stepped right out of the Bible. I too was flying high on the grandness of that fact for the rest of the flight.<br><br>Our presence as a people is a living extension of and active testimony to that national experience when we all heard what we heard. The world might yet accept what we have known not because of what we say but rather because we were there!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br>Positive Pursuits<br><br>When scanning Â“The 10 CommandmentsÂ” it is immediately apparent that 70% of them are voiced in the negative. Of the 613 Mitzvoth 365 are also Â“DonÂ’tsÂ”. ThatÂ’s almost 60%. Why am I mentioning these rather vague statistics? I can still taste the bitterness I felt as a young secular high school student being told by a social studies teacher that the Â“Old TestamentÂ” is filled with negativity as opposed to the other Â“newerÂ” version which is filled only with love and positive precepts.<br><br>I was paralyzed with ignorance. I didnÂ’t know then what to answer. I have since heard this complaint countless times along the way echoed by Jews as well. Â“Rabbi, why are there all these negative Mitzvoth?Â” LetÂ’s try two approaches to begin the discussion!<br><br>A clever colleague once gave the following explanation at the onset of Shabbos at a weekend for the uninitiated. Shabbos is notorious for its multitude of so called Negative Mitzvoth. There are 39 basic prohibitive categories and each one has theoretically 39 subsets, not to mention a host of Rabbinical prohibitions as well. There is this fearful sense that one is entering some kind of prison surrounded by endless rules. Why all the negativity?<br><br>He explained that Â“NegativeÂ” Mitzvoth are really more liberating than positive or activity Mitzvoth. How so? If I have a long Â“to doÂ” list, my day will be consumed with all the things that have to get done. Each one of them requires that I be there to perform the act.<br><br>Since I am required to put on Tefillin at a certain time I have to take the time to do that deed. Matzos on Pesach, Lulav on Sukkos, and Learning Torah: Each demands my presence and anchors me to a given time! IÂ’m happy to live productively but in a world with a finite amount of time, and energy tough choices have to be made.<br><br>This is not so with Â“NegativeÂ” Mitzvoth! As long as I am not doing any of the things on my Â“donÂ’tÂ” list I can be doing almost anything else. As long as I am not lighting a match on Shabbos or writing I can be enjoying a world of endless possibilities. We can eat and take walks and sing and talk and sleep and learn and whatever.<br><br>All the time I am not killing or coveting everything else is potentially available. I am not bound by those Â“NegativeÂ” Mitzvoth I am made free by the discipline of refraining. They are not Â“NegativeÂ” at all! They are only prohibitive. They demand that we desist from those specific behaviors but they do not bind us in the least.<br><br>Secondly, imagine please you are sending your teenage son or daughter away for a year to college or even to Israel. LetÂ’s be honest, now. Before they leave you have a parental sit-down and you give them a laundry list of Â“alwaysÂ” and Â“neverÂ”. Which list will be longer and more emphatic? Huh?<br><br>Write home! Record the balance in your check book! Give charity! Take your passport with you wherever you go etc. Now comes the do not list! If I ever hear that youÂ…DonÂ’t you dare try Â… Violation of any of those might not only undermine your travel experience but some of them may even ruin your life.<br><br>There are more things they dare not do than they ought to do to ensure a wholesome experience. So it is with our visit here! There are more things we should not do than we need to do to approach our potential. So as long as we manage to steer clear of all those potentially destructive encounters we will have plenty more time and energy available to devote to positive pursuits.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Make a Way<br><br>"I will make all my mountains a way" (Isa.49:11).<br><br>God will make obstacles serve His purpose. We all have mountains in our lives. There are people and things that threaten to bar our progress in the Divine life. Those heavy claims, that uncongenial occupation, that thorn in the flesh, that daily cross--we think that if only these were removed we might live purer, tenderer, holier lives; and often we pray for their removal.<br><br>"Oh, fools, and slow of heart!" These are the very conditions of achievement; they have been put into our lives as the means to the very graces and virtues for which we have been praying so long. Thou hast prayed for patience through long years, but there is something that tries thee beyond endurance; thou hast fled from it, evaded it, accounted it an unsurmountable obstacle to the desired attainment, and supposed that its removal would secure thy immediate deliverance and victory.<br><br>Not so! Thou wouldest gain only the cessation of temptations to impatience. But this would not be patience. Patience can be acquired only through just such trials as now seem unbearable. Go back; submit thyself. Claim to be a partaker in the patience of Jesus. Meet thy trials in Him. There is nothing in life which harasses and annoys that may not become subservient to the highest ends. They are His mountains. He puts them there. We know that God will not fail to keep His promise. "God understandeth the way thereof and knoweth the place thereof. For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven"; and when we come to the foot of the mountains, we shall find the way.--Christ in Isaiah, by Meyer<br><br>"The meaning of trial is not only to test worthiness, but to increase it; as the oak is not only tested by the storm, but toughened by them."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Begin With The End In Mind<br><br>This week's parsha contains the account of G-d's giving the Torah to the Children of Israel on Mount Sinai. About that great event the Torah states: "...And all of the people in the encampment trembled.(Exodus 19:16)" At the time that the Torah was given, and the presence of The Creator descended on Mount Sinai, the people who were gathered there trembled from fear. Rabbi Yeruchem Levovitz questioned the fear of the Children of Israel. "G-d was coming to give valuable gifts, and not to punish them. Why then, would they be so filled with fear?<br><br>Reb Yeruchem quotes an analogy to illustrate the answer. Once a wealthy man stood up with a purse filled with gold coins and announced that anyone who wished to borrow money from him was welcome to do so. Upon hearing his announcement, everyone began running in the other direction. No one wished to borrow money from him. Why was everyone running away? The reason is that it was known that when he comes to collect, no one can stand up to him. What would be if, by some chance, they would not have the money at the time the debt was due to be repaid? So too, G-d came down on Mount Sinai to give the Ten Commandments on which the world is founded, and the Children of Israel were trembling - what will be when G-d comes to exact payment from those who transgressed the words of the Torah?<br><br>Reb Yeruchem explains that the Children of Israel didn't just think of the here and now. They understood that G-d may be giving them a valuable gift, but there is a responsibility attached to it. They understood the gravity of accepting G-d's Torah, and it instilled fear in them, and they visibly trembled The Torah is life-giving, and its fulfillment carries with it a great reward, yet the Children of Israel hesitated and trembled because they looked at the whole picture - that there was an expectation from G-d, and consequences for not carrying it out successfully.<br><br>Reb Yeruchem explains that there is another personality trait we find in contradistinction from fear. That is false confidence. There are some people who only see why they have nothing to worry about in any given endeavor. They don't take any possible risks into consideration, and in the end they find themselves in terrible danger and unfortunate predicaments.<br><br>Reb Yeruchem identifies the trait of "fear," taking every possibility into consideration, as positive in other ways as well. He explains that when it comes to compromising one's principles, a person who fears would not make excuses and give in. Someone who does not take possible risks in consideration always finds a reason why "in this case" principles can be compromised. Such a person is always plagued in the end by regrets. Several times in the Torah the positive trait of "fear" is noted in people who could have had good excuses to violate his/her principles, but didn't. For example, Abraham, whom G-d commanded to bring Isaac as an offering to G-d. Abraham did all he could to fulfill G-d's directive, and made no excuses, as valid as they would have been. Abraham is referred to as "someone who fears G-d." Needless to say, the fear we are discussing here is a healthy, positive concern for one's well being which leads to thoughtful action, as opposed to neurotic, baseless fear which leads to being petrified and unable to act.<br><br>We said that the Children of Israel trembled when G-d descended on Mount Sinai to give them the Torah. By extension we should note that on a constant basis G-d gives us life - a miraculous gift. Perhaps we need to tremble when we think about what we will answer when He comes to take it back!? It might be worth our while to apply this trait of "fear" accordingly when we make decisions in our lives, and when we think about living by principles, and being accountable for our actions. Perhaps we need to wonder whether we should rely on the excuses we sometimes make, or if maybe we are better than that. Are we only living for the here and now, or should we invest our energies in the future? Are we using this gift from G-d the way He intended us to? Our forefathers, The Children of Israel, answered these questions for themselves 3300 years ago. Let us take the time as well to give these questions some serious thought.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All or Nothing<br><br>by Rabbi Chaim Dovid Green<br><br>Suppose a person who is not at all observant would come with with the following question. "I would like to begin keeping kosher. I don't want to do anything else, just keep kosher. Does the fact that I don't keep the other commandments affect my keeping kosher detrimentally?" The answer that he should receive is that he should go ahead and keep kosher, because he is obligated in every commandment of the Torah, and this will at least be one that he will fulfill. This is not a hypocritical approach for such a person, because this is a step in a growing process. Even though the commandments of the Torah are a package deal, so to speak, on one level the observance of each commandment is independent as there is a separate obligation to perform each one.<br><br>The truth is that for so many who have little knowledge of what the Torah expects from us, the approach of observing Mitzvos piecemeal is valid, and even recommended.<br><br>There is, however, one exception. That exception regards belief in G-d. The Yalkut Lekach Tov discusses this topic, and he relates the following point. When Rabbi Chaim Soleveitchik attended a rabbinical convention in Peterborg not long after the turn of the century, he spoke about faith in G-d. He related the story which took place with Eliyahu the Prophet when he disproved the power of an idol which many of the Jewish people were worshiping at that time. Eliyahu said to them "Why are you straddling both sides of the fence? If Hashem is G-d, then go after Him, and if the Baal is G-d then go after it." Rabbi Soleveitchik questioned the need to repeat "if Baal is G-d then go after it." It could have been left out, and it would have been understood that if they are not going after Hashem, then they are going after the Baal-idol. From this the Yalkut Lekach Tov concludes that when it comes to faith in G-d there is no room for compromise. If they believe in the Baal, even if they believe in Hashem as well, then that is a belief which destroys the foundations of faith in Hashem. Regarding faith it is "If Hashem is G-d then go after him." All or nothing. Anything less is not considered faith in Hashem at all. G-d's existence precludes the existence of other powers independent of His jurisdiction.<br><br>The Jewish faith is based on the event of the Torah having been given to us on Mount Sinai. At that great event the entire Jewish Nation heard G-d say "You shall have no other gods before Me." The basis of our religion is that G-d is one in the fullest sense of what "one" means. We passionately believe that G-d is the epitome of oneness. Any doctrine which makes claims to the contrary is a distortion of the truth as far as the Torah is concerned. Every Jew must know this as there are many other doctrines contrary to this basic belief. Unfortunately, too many of us have been led to believe in these doctrines which even our recent predecessors have died for rather than accept. Our society and schools are permeated with the subtle perspectives born out of these doctrines, and they are not foreign to us. They have sadly won credibility in our hearts.<br><br>We live in a world where the order of the day is "live and let live." There is certainly great merit to that approach. However, perhaps we place too much emphasis on the "let live" without giving enough thought to the "live" aspect of that saying. Many people today also straddle the fence. I believe this is because every lifestyle has become a valid option. Everything is called acceptable. As a result, no way of life is solidly founded. Nothing is based on truth. All lifestyle choices are based on "what works for you." The Torah teaches us that there is one truth, and it is not based on "what works for you". It is the truth of G-d's existence and G-d's expectations. "You shall have no other gods before me", the second commandment, is the basis for this very important lesson. Not all choices are good choices.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Chaim Dovid Green<br>Divine Computers<br><br>This week's parsha has been following the Jewish People around for over three thousand years. It is probably one of the greatest causes of controversy in history. It is the parsha discussing the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai. According to the Torah, G-d revealed Himself to the entire Jewish nation on the mountain. Every person there heard G-d's voice, and experienced the multi-faceted revelation which occurred there. This experience made an indelible imprint on the soul of the people gathered there, and only because of it do we achieve the miraculous continuity which we have achieved throughout our incredible history.<br><br>Tradition teaches us that G-d taught Moshe the entire Torah, which comprises the first five books of the Bible. In the Torah there are a total of 613 commandments - 248 do's, and 365 don'ts. Not all of these commandments, or mitzvos apply to all Jews. Many can only be performed in Israel. Many apply to Kohanim, the priestly families who descend from the tribe of Levi. Many regard to the offering of sacrifices. Nevertheless, there are quite a few which still do apply to us all.<br><br>Among the ranks of the mitzvah observant we find adherents to different authorities - whom we call rabbis. This was really a concept which has its source in the topic of this week's parsha as well. Initially, the Children of Israel asked G-d (through Moshe) to cease speaking to them directly. The experience was too much for them. At that time the Children of Israel accepted upon themselves to always adhere to the words of their prophets, whom G-d did continue to communicate with. After the cessation of prophecy over a century after the destruction of the first Holy Temple in approx. 424 B.C.E, the people turned to their wise men who had a thorough knowledge and dedication to the observance of Torah and Mitzvos. To this day such an adherence and dedication still exists.<br><br>The question which bothers many people is "is this what G-d wanted from us, that we should be a bunch of robots just following directions, without any feeling or participation in the decision process? Where does individualism fit into all of this?<br><br>The Midrash Tanchuma (Tazria) states "the mitzvos were not given but to refine people through them." This means to say that through learning and observing commandments we achieve refinement. In other words, G-d gave us advice, and standards for our behavior in this world. By making those standards our goals we have a vehicle through which we can live up to our potential. G-d is challenging us to grow. Fulfilling one's potential is the greatest manifestation of individualism which one can express.<br><br>Consequently, instead of being squelched and constrained by the "burden" of all of these commandments and responsibilities, we have "opportunities" through which we can flex our spiritual muscles and live up to and expand our potential. One who accepts the veracity of the tradition, and accepts that these events took place, and that G-d indeed gave us these mitzvos to perform, views other choices of lifestyles as man-made versus G-d-ordained.<br><br>Rabbi Sampson Raphael Hirsch (19th cent. Frankfurt) writes that the word Torah (Tav, Vav, Reish, Hey) comes from the root word which means to conceive (Hey, Reish, Hey), as in conceiving a child. Rav Hirsch explains that this is the goal of the Torah; to plant G-d's thoughts in our minds and hearts, that we should nurture and cultivate them, until they become part of our make-up, manifest in our thoughts and deeds. The teachings of the Torah circumscribe and temper unleashed spontaneity, but maintains it in a refined form. One who embraces the teachings of the Torah in thought and deed, becomes an instrument of G-d's will, and a messenger of G-d. At the same time he engages his feelings and emotions, and his own uniqueness in fulfilling the precepts of the Torah. This is the basis of Rav Hirsch's battle with the ethical humanists of his day, who wished to cast off proscribed behaviors, and cultivate the ethical personality from inside outward.<br><br>v Choosing to observe mitzvos is a choice to make a commitment. Yet it is still a choice in the fullest sense which a person reiterates with each mitzvah he performs. It is not robotic programming, but nurturing and sensitizing one's heart and intellect to interact with life whether it be on a personal, or communal level in a Torah way. And there are, and have been in history many challenges which impede progress in all of these areas, hence constantly bringing choice-making into the fore.<br><br>The Torah was given to the entire Jewish people, applicable to all generations. It is G-d's way of challenging us to make the best of our own unique raw materials. We have risen to the challenge, and that is why with G-d's help, we are still here to talk about it.<br><br></div>
