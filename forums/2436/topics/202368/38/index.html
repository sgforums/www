            <div class='col-md body'>Such a Time as This<br>Esther 5:1<br>On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king's hall.<br><br>Esther was a woman who lived for a cause greater than herself. God used this woman to save the entire Jewish people from extermination. However, before God could use her, she had to come to a place of death in herself. It was not an easy decision. Her uncle Mordecai was the instrument God used to challenge her to measure up to the task.<br><br>Do not think that because you are in the king's house you alone of all the Jews will escape. For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this? (Esther 4:13b-14)<br><br>Mordecai was telling it straight. For her to speak up meant great risks if the king did not receive her. It was automatic death if the king did not extend his scepter, which meant acceptance of her approach to the throne. It was also a time to realize that God may have brought her to this place and time for this specific purpose. However, if she did not respond in faith, God would use another instrument to deliver the people. What would she do?<br><br>Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish (Esther 4:16).<br><br>On the third day of the fast she came and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king's hall. She was like Jesus who stood in the inner court of Heaven on that third, resurrection day. She gave up her life, but God raised it up on that day and delivered an entire people from destruction because of one woman's willingness to give up her life for a greater cause.<br><br>God has called each of us to a purpose greater than ourselves. Know that it will require death before life can be given to this purpose. It must be His life that lives, not ours.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are You a Threat?<br>Acts 19:15<br>One day the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?"<br><br>Are you a threat to the kingdom of darkness? If satan and his demons had a board meeting and your name came before the board, what would they say? Would they say that you are one of their most feared enemies and they needed to keep many demons harassing and opposing you? Or would they say, "Gentlemen, this person poses no threat to our activities. Leave him alone. He needs no help from us." There are millions of church-going believers sitting in pews Sunday after Sunday who pose little threat to the kingdom of darkness.<br><br>If we truly believe that we war against rulers and principalities that cannot be seen, then we must realize that their mandate is to hinder any believer who is seeking to walk in the fullness of God. However, "greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world" (1 Jn. 4:4b KJV).<br><br>If you are seeking to fully follow the Lord, you can expect harassment from the enemy. God permits temptation because it drives us deeper into the soil of God. These times reveal God's power to keep us and walk us through the temptations. Our message becomes fruitful when it is born out of obedience and suffering for His name. Do not consider it strange if you find yourself fighting major battles the more obedient you become to the Master. God desires each of us to become a feared enemy of hell in order to affect satan's domain. When you begin to feel harassed, chances are you are beginning to affect the kingdom of darkness, and satan doesn't like this. So, how many demons do you think are assigned to you?<br><br></div>

Many successful executives can remember the time their father failed to give affirmation to them as a child. The result was either overachievement to prove their worth, or underachievement to prove he was right.<br><br>Many a wife has lost her ability to love because of a critical husband. Many a husband has left a marriage because of words of disrespect and ungratefulness. Stories abound regarding the power of words. There are just as many stories of those who have been encouraged, challenged, and comforted with words that made a difference in their lives.<br><br>Jesus knew the power of words. He used parables to convey His principles of the Kingdom of God. He used words of forgiveness and mercy. He used words to challenge. He used words to inspire His disciples to miraculous faith.<br><br>Do your words give life? Do they inspire and challenge others to greatness? Who does God want you to encourage through your words today? Affirm someone close to you today.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forgiving Ourselves<br>1 John 1:9<br>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.<br><br>The apostle Peter was one of three disciples who walked with Jesus closer than the other nine. He was the most enthusiastic and the one man who was willing to step into territories where others would not dare. He was the first to step out of the boat and walk on water. He wanted to protect Jesus at times when Jesus rebuked him for having a demon influence him. He cut off the ear of the guard who wanted to arrest Jesus in the garden. As Peter matured, the Holy Spirit harnessed his many extreme emotions.<br><br>The greatest trial for Peter was when he denied the Lord just before Jesus was crucified. Three times he denied knowing Jesus. Jesus predicted that the cock would crow after the third time just to reinforce the prophecy to Peter. Peter was crushed when he realized he had failed His Lord so badly.<br><br>The Lord forgave Peter for his denial. However, gaining forgiveness from Jesus was not the most difficult part for Peter. The hard part was forgiving himself. As we mature in the faith, we begin moving in victory after victory with our Lord. Then out of nowhere, an event happens that reveals our true sin nature, and we are confronted face to face with this reality. We cannot believe that we are capable of such sin. There is no good thing in us save the grace of Jesus Christ and His blood that cleanses us. When God looks at us, He looks at the blood of Christ that has covered our sin. He does not look at our sin once we confess it.<br><br>When we have difficulty forgiving ourselves, this is pride at its deepest level. We are making an assumption that we should never have sinned and that we are too mature to sin. This is a trap from the enemy of our souls. People who cannot forgive do not recognize from what they have been forgiven. That includes us.<br></div>

One type enthusiastically teaches their Bible knowledge to others. These people, though they may be genuine in their motive, lack one essential ingredient to being effectively used by God-a testimony. The second type of people I have encountered has a genuine testimony of what God is doing and continues to do in their lives. This was the case in the early Church. Men and women were able to give powerful testimony of events and experiences that could only be explained as a work of God.<br><br>God desires to build a testimony in each of us. Each of us is one of God's chosen vessels to reflect His power in and through us. When others see this power reflected, they are impacted because they cannot explain that power. God desires to frame your life with experiences designed to reflect the character and nature of Christ. Sometimes these events can be very devastating, but they are designed to reveal His power in and through us.<br><br>Every one of us has a testimony. What would others say your testimony is today? Can others see God's work in your life? Is your testimony one of Bible knowledge only? Are things happening in your life that can only be explained as God? These can be problematic questions for each of us. Ask God to build a testimony of His life in and through you today.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prayer for Peace<br>"And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace"   (Jeremiah 29:7).<br><br>The principle involved in this text would suggest to all of us who are the LORD's strangers and foreigners that we should be desirous to promote the peace and prosperity of the people among whom we dwell. Specially should our nation and our city be blest by our constant intercession. An earnest prayer for your country and other countries is well becoming in the mouth of every believer. Eagerly let us pray for the great boon of peace, both at home and abroad. If strife should cause bloodshed in out streets, or if foreign battle should slay our brave soldiers, we should all bewail the calamity; let us therefore pray for peace and diligently promote those principles by which the classes at home and the races abroad may be bound together in bonds of amity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our Substance Blessed<br>"Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store"   (Deuteronomy 28:5).<br><br>Obedience brings a blessing on all the provisions which our industry earns for us. That which comes in and goes out at once, like fruit in the basket which is for immediate use, shall be blest; and that which is laid by with us for a longer season shall equally receive a blessing. Perhaps ours is a hand-basket portion. We have a little for breakfast and a scanty bite for dinner in a basket when we go out to do our work in the morning. This is well, for the blessing of God is promised to the basket. If we live born hand to mouth, getting each day's supply in the day, we are as well off as Israel; for when the LORD entertained His favored people He only gave them a day's manna at a time. What more did they need? What more do we need?<br><br>But if we have a store, how much we need the LORD to bless it! For there is the care of getting, the care of keeping, the care of managing, the care of using; and, unless the LORD bless it, these cares will eat into our hearts till our goods become our gods and our cares prove cankers.<br><br>O LORD, bless our substance. Enable us to use it for Thy glory, Help us to keep worldly things in their proper places, and never may our savings endanger the saving of our souls.<br></div>

Remember Joseph, Israel in Egypt, Manasseh, Jeremiah, Peter, and many others. He can do it still. He breaks the bars of brass with a word and snaps the fetters of iron with a look. He is doing it. In a thousand places troubled ones are coming forth to light and enlargement. Jesus still proclaims the opening of the prison to them that are bound. At this moment doors are flying back and fetters are dropping to the ground.<br><br>He will delight to set you free, dear friend, if at this time you are mourning because of sorrow, doubt, and fear. It will be joy to Jesus to give you liberty. It will give Him as great a pleasure to loose you as it will be a pleasure to you to be loosed. No, you have not to snap the iron hand: the LORD Himself will do it. Only trust Him, and He will be your Emancipator. Believe in Him in spite of the stone walls or the manacles of iron. Satan cannot hold you, sin cannot enchain you, even despair cannot bind you if you will now believe in the LORD Jesus, in the freeness of His grace, and the fullness of His power to save.<br><br>Defy the enemy, and let the word now before you be your song of deliverance; "Jehovah looseth the prisoners."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guardian of the Fatherless<br>"In Thee the fatherless findeth mercy"   (Hosea 14:3).<br><br>This is an excellent reason for casting away all other confidences and relying upon the LORD alone. When a child is left without its natural protector, our God steps in and becomes his guardian: so also when a man has lost every object of dependence, he may cast himself upon the living God and find in Him all that he needs. Orphans are cast upon the fatherhood of God, and He provides for them. The writer of these pages knows what it is to hang on the bare arm of God, and he bears his willing witness that no trust is so well warranted by facts, or so sure to be rewarded by results, as trust in the invisible but ever-living God.<br><br>Some children who have fathers are not much the better off because of them, but the fatherless with God are rich. Better have God and no other friend than all the patrons on the earth and no God. To be bereaved of the creature is painful, but so long as the LORD remains the fountain of mercy to us, we are not truly orphaned. Let fatherless children plead the gracious word for this morning, and let all who have been bereaved of visible support do the same, LORD, let me find mercy in Thee! The more needy and helpless I am, the more confidently do I appeal to Thy loving heart.<br></div>

His home is an abode of love, a school of holy training, and a place of heavenly light. In it there is a family attar where the name of the LORD is daily had in reverence. Therefore the LORD blesses his habitation. It may be a humble cottage or a lordly mansion; but the LORD's blessing comes because of the character of the inhabitant and not because of the size of the dwelling.<br><br>That house is most blest in which the master and mistress are Godfearing people; but a son or daughter or even a servant may bring a blessing on a whole household. The LORD often preserves, prospers, and provides for a family for the sake of one or two in it, who are "just" persons in His esteem, because His grace has made them so. Beloved, let us have Jesus for our constant guest even as the sisters of Bethany had, and then we shall be blessed indeed.<br><br>Let us look to it that in all things we are just -- in our trade, in our judgment of others, in our treatment of neighbors, and in our own personal character.

            <div class='col-md body'>He Remains<br>"Thou remainest" (Heb. 1:11).<br><br>There are always lone hearth-fires; so many! And those who sit beside them, with the empty chair, cannot restrain the tears that will come. One sits alone so much. There is some One unseen, just here within reach. But somehow we don't realize His presence. Realizing is blessed, but--rare. It belongs to the mood, to the feelings. It is dependent on weather conditions and bodily conditions. The rain, the heavy fog outside, the poor sleep, the twinging pain, these make one's mood so much, they seem to blur out the realizing. But there is something a little higher up than realizing. It is yet more blessed. It is independent of these outer conditions, it is something that abides. It is this: recognizing that Presence unseen, so wondrous and quieting, so soothing and calming and warming. Recognize His presence--the Master's own. He is here, close by; His presence is real. Recognizing will help realizing, too, but it never depends on it. Aye, more, immensely more, the Truth is a Presence, not a thing, a fact, a statement. Some One is present, a warm-hearted Friend, an all-powerful Lord. And this is the joyful truth for weeping hearts everywhere, whatever be the hand that has drawn the tears; by whatever stream it be that your weeping willow is planted. --S. D. Gordon<br><br>When from my life the old-time joys have vanished,<br>Treasures once mine, I may no longer claim,<br>This truth may feed my hungry heart, and famished:<br>Lord, THOU REMAINEST THOU art still the same!<br><br>When streams have dried, those streams of glad refreshing--<br>Friendships so blest, so rich, so free;<br>When sun-kissed skies give place to clouds depressing,<br>Lord, THOU REMAINEST! Still my heart hath THEE.<br><br>When strength hath failed, and feet, now worn and weary,<br>On gladsome errands may no longer go,<br>Why should I sigh, or let the days be dreary?<br>Lord, THOU REMAINEST! Could'st Thou more bestow?<br><br>Thus through life's days--whoe'er or what may fail me,<br>Friends, friendships, joys, in small or great degree,<br>Songs may be mine, no sadness need assail me,<br>Lord, THOU REMAINEST!

(Exodus 31:16-17)<br><br>Shabbos is called a sign between G-d and us. What is the function of a sign? The Chofetz Chaim (d. 1933) provides us with an analogy which illustrates the answer to this question.<br><br>A man wishes to open a business. He finds a good location, and prominently hangs a sign for all to see. As long as the sign is hanging we can assume that the man is still in business. Even if the man would need to leave town for some time, and his business is closed for the duration, as long as the sign is hanging, we can assume he is still in business.<br><br>If we notice that the sign has been removed, then we can assume that the business is defunct, assuming that he didn't move his business somewhere else in which case the sign will be hanging there.<br><br>This is what the Torah is telling us about Shabbos and G-d's covenant with us. Shabbos is a sign. As long as the sign is prominent - even if the store is closed for a little while, the connection with G-d is still strong. That means to say that even if a Jew sins - he closes his store - if the sign is still hanging - Shabbos is still on his schedule - it is still clear that his connection is not severed. However, when the sign comes down it appears that the business is closed.<br><br>Shabbos is our way of demonstrating our belief in G-d having created the world. Through observance of Shabbos we actively give testimony that we are believers. We believe in the creation, and we believe that just as G-d can create the world, He can give us the livelihood which we need even if we don't engage in pursuing it on Shabbos. It is a positive statement manifest in our actions. Our actions say "G-d is the boss. I'm not in charge here."<br><br>To the uninitiated, Shabbos seems like a time of great restriction. You can't do anything! To those who observe Shabbos, though, it is very different. Ideally, Shabbos is quality family time, when meals are eaten together at a nicely set table, and we sings songs of Shabbos. We speak about what the children learned regarding the Parsha of the week, we read dvartorah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, and share time together. The restrictions create an environment, a sort of island, when I don't have to drive car pool, and I don't have to answer the phone, and I don't have to deal with monetary matters, or work. It's a time when I can sit back and think about what I'm here for in this world. It is the true essence of our existence.<br><br>Someone once said that more than the Jews have kept Shabbos, Shabbos has kept the Jews. It is our time of recharging and refocusing. It's when we remind ourselves that when we go back out into the world after Shabbos, that we are spiritual beings with a spiritual purpose. We carry that into our workday and we are elevated by that knowledge. It is a great ennobling force. Shabbos is the source which the other days derive blessing from. Let's schedule Shabbos on our calendars, and hang up our signs prominently!<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Moment Too Long<br><br>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Sin of The Golden Calf is a story which really deserves many pages of discussion. There are some obvious questions which must be reconciled in order to have any understanding of what actually happened. We'll begin with the storyline according to the traditional sources.<br><br>In the afternoon of the day that the Torah was given, Moshe went up to Mount Sinai for a forty day period. He spent that time in a completely spiritual existence learning with G-d. On the thirty ninth day the Jewish Nation at the foot of the mountain were mistakenly expecting Moshe. Seeing that he wasn't coming, they came to the conclusion that he was dead. They approached Aaron who was left in charge, and requested a "god that will go before us." Aaron seems to agree, and tells the nation to go home and get the gold rings from their wives and children. Then it states that they removed the gold rings that were in "their" ears and they brought them to Aaron. Aaron melted down the gold, and formed it into a golden calf. Then, "they (in plural) said "this is your god, Israel." The Torah states then, "and Aaron saw, and he set out to build an altar before it. Everything being ready, he declared "a celebration for G-d tomorrow!" The people got up early the next morning, brought sacrifices, and began celebrating.<br><br>Rabbi Eliyahu Ki Tov, in his work "Sefer HaParshios", asks several questions, and dedicates approximately 20 pages in answering them. Here are some of his questions and answers.<br><br>Was Aaron also mistaken about when Moshe was supposed to return? If not, couldn't he have explained to the people to just wait another day?<br>Why did Aaron agree immediately to participate?<br>Why in particular did Aaron ask for the gold rings from the wives and children?<br>When the Jews left Egypt, a mixed multitude of people who were not from the Children of Israel followed along with Moshe's permission. They are often blamed for instigating sinful behavior such as the golden calf. Why are they blamed for being the ones who said "this is your god Israel"? Is it just an easy way to shift the blame from the Children of Israel?<br>Many of these questions are answered by understanding what the sages say about this entire event. The mixed multitude started the whole thing. Aaron's actions are a response to their demands, and were actually designed to stall for time, and prevent the Jews from falling as low as they did. Rabbi Ki Tov explains the nature of the test that the Jews were undergoing. The nation had just recently experienced prophesy on a very high level at the giving of the Torah. Subsequently they were brought back to a relatively mundane reality, and made to wait 40 days for Moshe to return. One can imagine that every moment waiting for Moshe was like an eternity. Their desire to get close to G-d was extremely strong, and Moshe had become the go-between who broadened that connection. This explains why Aaron could not have asked them to continue waiting. Another moment was too long.<br><br>One can imagine that the encampment of the nation was quite large. There were at least three million people there. It was most likely several miles in radius. According to traditional sources, Moshe told them that he would return by midday on the fortieth day. They waited for Moshe until midday. That leaves only one half of a day to prepare the idol and all that they did. Aaron sent everyone home to get the gold rings from their wives and children. Aaron knew the wives would be more objective, and refuse. That would take quite a long time for everyone to arrive home, request the gold rings, and then return. Aaron was correct. Notice that it states that the people removed their own gold rings that were in their ears. That is because they couldn't get the ones from their wives.<br><br>How long must it have taken to actually make the idol? It all took place in one afternoon. Quite a bit happened in a very short time. After it was made people began to call the idol the G-d of Israel. At that point a brave and righteous man named Chur attempted to rebuke the people. He was killed. Aaron "saw", and began to build an altar before the idol. What did Aaron see? He saw that Chur was killed. Does that mean that Aaron did this because he feared for his life? The sages say that he "saw" that the nation was not objective, and he was the only force who could keep total anarchy from breaking loose. He tried to stall the nation in every way possible. That is why the Torah states that Aaron built the altar personally. This way it would take longer. Lastly, when the altar was completed, Aaron declared "A celebration for G-d tomorrow!" He was able to put off the nation serving the idol until the next day. Hopefully by then Moshe will have come. All that we have said so far is implied in the verses if they are read carefully. This certainly paints a very different picture of Aaron. His actions were carefully thought out, and designed to minimize the sin as much as possible. Perhaps this is why Aaron becomes the high priest later. His love and concern for his people are such, that he went out on a limb for them to prevent them from creating a wall between themselves an G-d through idol worship. He and his offspring became the representatives to G-d for our own atonement forever.<br><br>Why are the mixed multitude blamed? The reason is that they, in contrast to the Children of Israel, were not accustomed to difficulties. They lived in relative comfort in Egypt. They were great people though, and their hearts moved them to follow the Jewish Nation into the wilderness to an unknown destination and fate. G-d tested the Jewish People many times in the wilderness with hunger, thirst, and other troubles, and the Jews who were accustomed to difficulties in Egypt were better prepared to handle these new ones. The mixed multitude did not fare as well, and when they were put through trying experiences, their commitment wavered. Old habits began to set in. This is the reason why these people are continually cited by the sages as the instigators. Many of the Children of Israel fell prey to the provocations of the mixed multitude in times of pressure.<br><br>One of the great lessons learned from this entire episode is the ability for us to repent en masse. When Moshe indeed returned, he destroyed the idol, judged the worshipers, and returned to the mountain to achieve atonement for the nation. Moshe returned on Yom Kippur, The Day of Atonement, with the second tablets. The nation was given the commandment to build the tabernacle. Now they can give their gold in the service of G-d to show that they have repented. An entire nation sinned, and an entire nation was forgiven. Just as Moshe heard "Solachti", "I've forgiven you", may we all merit the same, speedily, in our days.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Living To the Highest Standard<br><br>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It would take many pages to properly do justice to the topic of the Sin of the Golden Calf which is contained in this week's parsha. Although that is impossible in such a forum as this, I would still like to touch on this topic, and provide food for thought, and perhaps a deeper understanding of this grievious sin and its repercussions.<br><br>To begin with, a brief synopsis. The Jewish Nation received the Torah on Mount Sinai on the morning of the sixth of the month of Sivan. Thirty nine days later, on the seventeenth of the month of Tamuz, after this incredible and earth-shaking experience, The Jews were worshipping the golden calf. G-d, Who had been teaching Moshe the Torah on Mount Sinai, tells him that he must go down from the mountain for "his" people have become corrupt. They are worshipping graven images. Moshe pleads with G-d not to destroy the nation, and goes down to the camp. Upon seeing the idol and the goings on, he casts down the tablets of the ten commandments, and smashes them to pieces. He then destroys the idol and punishes the perpetrators. The next morning, after admonishing the people, Moshe makes his way back up Mount Sinai to try to achieve forgiveness on behalf of the Jewish people. Approximately eighty days later, Moshe does just that, and a new agreement is made with G-d, and two new tablets are given.<br><br>The sages of the Talmud liken this sin to a bride who commits adultery while still under the wedding canopy. As they say, "Disgraced is the bride who acts immorally (even while) inside her wedding canopy." It is in these extreme terms that they criticize that generation. The paradox is that immediately after in the next breath they write "The Rabbis taught: those who bear insult, and don't insult in kind, who listen to their disgrace, and don't answer back, about them the verse states (Judges 5) and those who love Him (G-d) are like the rising of the sun in its strength."<br><br>These words are also referring to the generation who "comitted adultery while still under her wedding canopy." However, in this statement the generation is praised in the highest terms, and called those who love G-d! It seems to imply that they had an answer had they chosen to speak up. Furthermore, this generation is praised for its level of fear of G-d (Deuteronomy 5). The sages state that no generation would have been able to receive the Torah besides this one.<br><br>To reconcile these apparent contradictions, the sages make an incredible statment. "This act was not befitting such a great generation, the only reason they made the golden calf was to give an opening for those who sin to repent." This means to say that they were put in that dangerous situation to teach the subsequent generations that no matter how bad they might be, they can change for the better, even an entire generation, and be viewed by G-d with extreme favor.<br><br>Was it all worth it? A resounding YES! This is why. We live in such a world of grey areas. We are constantly forced to make decisions. We all make our share of regrettable decisions. We all experience guilt. Let me quote Rabbi Avraham J. Twersky from his book Let Us Make Man. "Guilt is an important sensation which can function or malfunction. When functioning properly guilt is constructive...Healthy guilt, like physical pain, is a warning signal that there is a threat of something dangerous happening to the person, or that something has already happened, and needs correction. Guilt is to improper behavior what pain is to physical injury...Similarly, guilt is a distressful feeling which deters people from violating their values, or serves as an indicator that one has transgressed a value and needs to do something to bring the system back to proper functioning."<br><br>What the Torah teaches us regarding transgression is that we can do something to bring the system back to proper functioning. The generation that sinned with the golden calf was able to set things straight. Even though they fell from the most elevated plain, they returned to their exalted spiritual state through soul searching, understanding what brought them to their low state of behavior, and a sincere desire to correct it. This is relevant and valuable to all of us. Anyone who wishes sincerely to do so can reach the highest of heights no matter how far he/she has fallen. We should never give up on living up to the highest standards.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You Have the Power<br>Rabbi Pinchas Avruch<br><br>This week's parsha contains the one of the more infamous moments in Jewish history, the sin of the Golden Calf. The calamitous construction of this molten image at the foot of Mount Sinai occurred not six weeks after the thunderous display of the giving of the Ten Commandments. Moshe, witnessing the revelry surrounding the calf while descending the Mount, threw down the two tablets containing the Ten Commandments, smashing them to rubble. After beseeching G-d for their forgiveness, Moshe prepared to return to the top of Mount Sinai for a new set of tablets. But unlike the original pair, which not only had the text etched by G-d Himself but had also been carved by G-d Himself, the new set which G-d would inscribe was to be hewn by Moshe. "G-d said to Moshe, 'Carve for yourself two stone tablets like the first ones, and I shall inscribe on the tablets the words which were on the first tablets which you shattered.'" (Shemos/Exodus 34:1) Why did the second set need to be formed by Moshe rather than G-d?<br><br>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (1895-1986; Rosh Yeshiva/Dean of Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem in New York City; the leading Halachic/Jewish legal decisor and foremost leader of Jewry of his time) explains that reason is found in the rationale behind the sin of the Golden Calf itself. The Golden Calf did not start as an idolatrous exercise. The Jewish People miscalculated Moshe's return date and understood his delay as a sign that he had died. They knew that the Ten Commandments were exclusively divine in their construction and interpreted this to mean that mere mortals could not fully comprehend these commandments in all their depth. They knew that they needed assistance from celestial sources. Had Moshe been alive, they reasoned, he would entreaty these forces to assist them. But with his feared demise, they needed an alternative approach. Knowing the heavenly nature of the image of an ox (indeed, one of the images seen by Yechezkel/Ezekiel in his vision of the Divine Chariot (1:10)), they chose to create a likeness of an ox to which they could appeal for celestial assistance in spiritual growth. Through these means they believed they would connect with G-d and understand His holy Torah.<br><br>But the maxim they did not appreciate was that Torah is accessible to all and we all have the ability to reach the highest spiritual plains to gain a profound understanding of Torah. Thus, concludes Rabbi Feinstein, Moshe was instructed to sculpt the second set of tablets, to serve as an eternal reminder that Moshe, a man of flesh and blood, was a part of their construction, and, as such, all people have the ability to access the heavenly help needed for spiritual achievement and acquisition of Torah wisdom.<br><br>Have a good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong>Follow the Leader</strong><br>By Rabbi Shlomo Jarcaig<br><br>At the time Moshe came down from Mount Sinai with the Tablets of the Decalogue, the Torah records a conversation with his student, Yehoshua (Joshua). Yehoshua had been separated from the rest of the Jewish people while he awaited Moshe's return at the bottom of the mountain, and was, therefore, unaware of the events of the Golden Calf. As Moshe finished his descent and they both heard the commotion in the camp, "Yehoshua heard the sound of the people in its shouting and he said to Moshe, 'The sound of battle is in the camp!'" (Shemos/Exodus 32:17) Moshe corrected him that the noise emanated from the sinful activity in which they were engaged. The Torah does not contain extraneous information. Why was it necessary for the Torah to record Yehoshua's innocent mistake? What message is the Torah conveying by bringing it to our attention?<br><br>Yehoshua was destined to succeed Moshe as leader of the Jewish people. The Talmud in Tractate Bava Basra contrasts Moshe and Yehoshua, comparing Moshe's face to the face of the sun, versus Yehoshua's face, which was like the face of the moon. Netziv (acronym of Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Berlin, 1817-1893, Rosh Yeshiva/Dean of the famed Yeshiva of Volozhin and author of the biblical commentary Haamek Davar) explains that the sun's shine is so magnificent that as long as it is present, the moon's light is effectively non-existent. Similarly, as long as Moshe served as the Divine messenger to radiate G-d's light upon the world, Yehoshua could not. Thus, concludes Rabbi Berlin, the verse indicates that for all of Yehoshua's inborn talents, he could not succeed as a leader during Moshe's lifetime.<br><br>But Yehoshua's equation to the moon goes further still.<br><br>The teachings of Moshe - the quintessential leader of the Children of Israel who delivered G-d's Torah to G-d's people - are the light that forever bestows light on this world, like the sun. The light of Yehoshua was the moon - a reflected light. True, Yehoshua was a born leader with all of the necessary talents and abilities. But the Torah teaches us here that Jewish leaders do not simply step forward and lead. A future Jewish leader first cleaves to today's leader, learning from his actions and admonitions. After years, even decades, of tutelage he will come to understand what is expected of him, enabling him to brilliantly reflect the radiance of his mentor. Even then, it is merely a reflection; the student is always the "moon" to his mentor's "sun". The timeless lesson the Torah teaches in this verse is that a capable Jewish leader must first be a capable Jewish follower.<br><br>Have a Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ceding Control</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Pinchas Avruch<br>As Moshe beseeched G-d to restore His closeness and intimacy with the Children of Israel after the Sin of the Golden Calf, he appealed for a greater insight into the G-d's ways. "And now, if I have indeed found favor in your eyes, make your ways known to me that I may know you..." (Shemos/Exodus 33:13)<br><br>The Talmud (Tractate Yevamos 7) expounds that Moshe sought to answer the question that has been asked throughout the generations: Why does bad befall the righteous and why do the evil experience good fortune? In general, we find ourselves looking at others and wondering why one businessman succeeds and another - by all appearances equally astute, equally kind, and equally righteous - fails. We are even more unnerved when the one who fails is more virtuous. We are frustrated, even angered, by the apparent injustice of it all.<br><br>The Chofetz Chaim (1) pondered the visit of a traveler at a guesthouse. In the morning, as the guest prepares to leave and return to his travels, he berates the proprietor for the furniture arrangements around the residence: the heat is too close to the beds, the closet and dresser are on the wrong walls and numerous other such criticisms of planning decisions. The owner replies, "My dear guest, you have never been here before and you came to spend one evening. You expect to be able to intuitively understand all the rationales for the decisions I have made in establishing this inn, and to then submit the requisite corrections for all that you believe I have done wrong? Your limited experience does not equip you with the breadth of view to make substantive recommendations that I should implement."<br><br>Rabbi Kagan explains that we in our lifetimes are travelers. In the spectrum of history we are here for a few fleeting moments, yet we insist on having all the answers. Were we to live for a span of centuries with an awareness of every event, conversation and experience in people's lives we might begin to understand the sequence of events. We would see the family blessed with generations of wealth - funds they used so selflessly for chesed (kindnesses), tzedaka (charity) and beautification of mitzvah observances - lose it as an opportunity to strengthen their G-d consciousness. Meanwhile, the family that lived so faithfully through generations of poverty finds itself grappling with the reality of an unexpected windfall. But without the generations of perspective and the knowledge of the minutiae of the lives of all the involved parties, there is no way for us to even begin to contemplate why G-d presents each person with his lot in life.<br><br>This reality is not only relevant to viewing other people's lives, but is germane to appreciating the travails of one's own existence. Rabbi Avrohom Pam (2) related the story of a Jew who, in spite of having lived his entire life in dire poverty, remained steadfast in his faith, and prayed with intense concentration. Someone once overheard this man reciting the morning blessing, "Blessed are You...who has provided me my every need," with great joy. Asked the passerby, "Can you really say that your every need has been provided for? You are among the poorest of the poor!" The man replied, "Can one really know, on his own, what his particular needs are? If G-d has made me poor, then obviously this condition is necessary for me to fulfill my purpose in life. Poverty is what my soul needs, and I have been granted this in full measure!"<br><br>Man has immense difficulty relinquishing control over aspects of his own life, no less conceding a complete lack of control of the circumstances of his life and those around him. But there is one facet over which we DO have complete and absolute control: our response to those circumstances. Every person's affairs are personally tailored by the Master of the Universe to facilitate the growth he needs to maximize his spiritual potential; our responses determine the growth we glean from each of these experiential opportunities. The more we focus on our charge and trust G-d to manage His realm, the greater we will grow and the happier we will be.<br><br>Have a Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Money is Like Fire<br><br>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>"Each person who passes to be numbered, from age twenty, shall give a half-shekel, from a shekel of the Temple,... a donation to HaShem." [30:13]<br>The Medrash says, "Rabbi Meir said, the Holy One, Blessed be He, brought out from beneath his throne of Glory a coin of fire, and showed it to Moshe, and said to him, like this shall they give."<br><br>The Noam Elimelech explains why HaShem showed Moshe a coin of fire. When handling money, he explains, one should remember that a coin is very much like fire. Just as fire can burn and destroy, but can also warm, and cook, and serve in other valuable ways, so too a coin. If one gives a coin for a good purpose, for charity or kindness, then it is very valuable and helpful to a person; but if a person uses his money improperly, then the same coin can burn and cause serious harm.<br><br>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein zt"l, the leading Jewish legal authority of our generation, passed away on the thirteenth of Adar II, 1986 - meaning his tenth Yahrtzeit has just passed. He also comments on this Medrash.<br><br>He asks the following question: why did G-d have to show Moshe a coin at all? Why was it so difficult for Moshe to understand the size of a half-shekel? The verse says that a shekel was 20 geirah, a known amount, so it should have been easy to determine a half-shekel.<br><br>Rabbi Feinstein explains that Moshe could not understand how people living in a materialistic world could involve themselves with spiritual pursuits. HaShem showed him a half-shekel to show him that a person should divide his time: only half of a person's efforts can be devoted to material gain; the spiritual side must be cared for as well. The division also shows a middle ground -- a person living in this world also cannot be so overwhelmed with spirituality that he ignores his material needs. It is crucial to find a balance.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Faith Based Initiative<br><br>By Rabbi Pinchas Avruch<br>"The people saw that Moshe had delayed in descending the mountain, and the people gathered around Aaron and said to him, 'Rise up, make for us oracles that will go before us, for this man Moshe who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what became of him!'" (Shemos/Exodus 32:1) The Jewish Nation miscalculated when Moshe's forty-day sojourn on Sinai was scheduled to be complete; they anticipated his return a day earlier than he was actually due. Concerned that he had perished, they begged that Aaron intervene to find a new leader for the nation. How did this evolve into the great act of betrayal that was the heathenish service of the golden calf?<br><br>"The wicked one watches for the righteous and seeks to kill him; but G-d will not forsake him to his hand, nor let him be condemned when he is judged." (Tehillim/Psalms 37:32-33) Rabbi Yisrael Salanter (1) explains that the Yetzer Hara (2) is "the wicked one" who possesses great strength to rule over all people if not for G-d's intervention to restrict him. But consistent with the teaching in Pirkei Avos (Ethics of the Fathers) that one sin leads to further sin (3), when a person takes the initiative to sin, G-d removes the Yetzer Hara's restrictions, allowing him to lead the sinner further astray.<br><br>Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler (4) expounds that when the Children of Israel started to worry about Moshe's delay, despite their knowledge that G-d had told Moshe that his stay on the mountain would be forty days and that he was in G-d's care throughout, they failed spiritually. They should have realized that Moshe's delay was due to a miscalculation on their part and, scared and perplexed as they were, should have reacted with an inward focus to realize that mere humans do not possess all the answers. Since they did not second guess their own presumptions, rather they allowed worry to enter their hearts, the Yetzer Hara gained license to challenge them further. Thus, he created darkness and a sense of gloom and confusion, to which the people responded that Moshe must certainly have died. That conclusion allowed the Yetzer to go a step further: he created an image in the heavens of a deceased Moshe being carried away. The Talmud (Shabbos 89a) explains that it was because of this vision of Moshe in the firmament that the people did not simply say "We do not know what happened to Moshe," rather they said "THIS man Moshe..." pointing to the image in heaven. Panicked by the thought of being leaderless, and firmly in the grip of the Yetzer, they were at the cusp of their horrific transgression when they approached Aaron and demanded new leadership.<br><br>Although the Yetzer Hara is now a few millennia older, his strength has not waned an iota and he has not lost an ounce of his passion. He pursues the subversion of our G-d consciousness and connectedness with great fervor. Judaism does not believe in leaps of faith. The Hebrew for "faith" is "emunah", which comes from the root "emun" meaning training; a solid belief in G-d and his Torah comes from diligently toiling to understand, not from a moment of inspiration. Our forebears at Sinai proclaimed "We will do and we will listen." (24:7) Listening means expending the effort to study and inquire and understand how the Torah fills our lives with holiness; doing means that even before we achieve an understanding, we have the emunah to know that G-d loves us, gave us His holy Torah for our benefit and gave us Sages who do understand to counsel us. Throughout our life's journey of acquiring this understanding, the Yetzer Hara unceasingly bombards us with darkness and gloom and confusion. He capitalizes on every opportunity to create false images that will fill us with panic and despair about our future, about G-d, about the Torah. We must resolve to learn, to train, to understand, to listen and to do.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>This Night</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br><br>As for the one who does not know to ask, you should open him up, as it is written Â“And you should relate to your child on that day saying because of this HASHEM did for me with my exiting from Egypt.Â” (Shemos 13:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> (From the Four Sons at the Seder)<br><br>How can we make the Seder more relevant for the one whom, for whatever reason, does not know to ask? In general education we can teach to the middle of the class and ignore those beyond 2 and Â½ standard deviations to the left and the right. On Pesach night, though, we have a sacred obligation to reach each child according to his interest, mood, and attitude. Perhaps the meaning of the Seder can be synthesized and encapsulated in a simple story that has a concrete message no one still awake could fail to appreciate. Here is a story I would tell my young Hebrew Day School kids:<br><br>A young boy grew up blind from birth. Never had he seen the light of day. He tried with all his might to compensate for his lack. He learned to read and right in Braille. He managed with little assistance to maneuver through local streets. His childhood was a misery, mostly because of the cruelty of some neighborhood bullies that tormented and teased him daily. If he wasnÂ’t being tripped they were calling him names and the genius of their methodologies grew in sophistication. This poor boy, weÂ’ll call him Ben, would cry himself to sleep each night after writing about his suffering in his Braille diary. On day he hit the very lowest of ebbs. A practical joke they played on him humiliated him to the core and left his spirits mortally wounded. He wrote in his Braille diary that night, with tears flowing from his broken eyes, wondering aloud and crying to G- d, Â“Why do I need to live like this? When can it end? Enough!Â”<br><br>Just then his parents entered his room. They had exciting news. They had been talking to a doctor that believes he can cure his blindness. Ten days later he was in the hospital. After four days of careful preparation the operation was performed.<br><br>The night of the fifteenth with his family gathered around and with the Doctor himself, soft candles were lit. The magic moment arrived. Two huge round patches were removed and he beheld the face of his loving parents for the very first time. He shared glances with the Doctor and then ran excitedly to the window to drink thirstily all the sights the entire night.<br><br>As the weeks and months passed he became like the other children, free from his former oppressors who ran from his gaze now with fright. One morning he looked out the window and noticed rain. His first response was, Â“ItÂ’s a bad day today!Â” When he heard his own grumbling he became disgusted with himself. He realized that he had lost his appreciation for the new gift. He thought, Â“What would I have paid just for the ability to see rain running down the pane just a few months earlier and now IÂ’m just a bundle of complaints.Â”<br><br>He was so deeply disappointed with himself that he went back to the Doctor and asked him to reverse the procedure. The Doctor looked at him with incredulity. However when he explained himself the wise Doctor understood well and offered a wondrous piece of advice.<br><br>Since the anniversary of the operation was close at hand he instructed him to make preparations for the event by inviting his close family and the Doctor himself would come. They should set up the room with soft candle lights and fine decorations. That night he was to put those big round patches on again and to begin to read excerpts from his old Braille diary to the point where the tears began to flow and all the terrible emotions of the past were awakened, then the news of the Doctor and the operation etc. Then the patches were to be removed. They sang together happily deep into the night. The wise Doctor told him, Â“Ben, be sure to do every detail of this procedure each year and itÂ’s likely youÂ’ll never lose your feelings of abundant appreciation. Just remember, my son, never lose touch with this night!Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Passover Never Passes Over </strong><br><br>Passover never really passes over. The truth is that we are really meant to pack it up and take it with us. Passover is the Holiday of Faith. It is the time that we made our first national connection with G-d. He let us know that He didn't just create the world and leave it up to random events of history. He is involved. He even took the time out of His busy schedule to make that known to Pharaoh, Egypt, and of course, to us. G-d's intervention into history is the exception which proves the rule. That is that He is always involved behind the scenes, and He is very interested in us.<br><br>Those who participated in a Pesach seder may remember that the Hagada (the Passover night liturgy), states in it that even if we were seasoned veteran Torah scholars, we would still have a commandmant to relate the events of leaving Egypt. Rabbi Sholom Noach Bresovsky, of blessed memory, explains the reason for this. Recounting the events of the Exodus from Egypt is the basis of our faith in G-d. Just as G-d is unlimited, faith in G-d too has no limits - it can always rise to new levels. The knowledge of the events one may have, but the growth in our faith that we draw from this knowledge continues indefinetely. So even a well versed Torah scholar has much faith to gain from participating in a seder (a reading of the Passover liturgy) and all of its observances.<br><br>Passover teaches us that there is a G-d who is interested in us and involved in our lives. The natural conclusion then, is that we should show interest in Him.<br><br>The classical work "Chovos HaLevavos" dedicates a chapter of his work to the topic of serving G-d. His basic premise is that since we can discern so many favors which G-d constantly bestows to us in so many ways, it is only natural that we try to show our appreciation in some measure. Even though we would never be able to repay a minute fraction of the favors we receive, one would certainly be ingratious not to try. Consequently, any little bit we can do is a pleasure, as it is an opportunity for us to show our gratitude. If G-d would give me something specific to do, here's my opportunity - let me jump at the chance. That is the basis of all Torah and Mitzvah (commandment) performance. It is also notable that the Hebrew word "mitzvah" meaning "commandment" is related to the Aramaic derivation "tzavsa," meaning "togetherness." Performing commandments brings us close to G-d.<br><br>This brings us to this week's parsha. When the Tabernacle was completed, the only thing left was for G-d to bring His presence to dwell in it. On the first day of the Hebrew month of Nissan, G-d did just that. With the entire Hebrew nation witnessing, G-d's heavenly fire consumed the offerings which had been placed on the altar.<br><br>Upon witnessing this, two very great sons of Aharon the High Priest, Nadav, and Avihu, longed for closeness with G-d. As the event is recounted by the Torah, they took some of the sacrificial spices and burned them in the Holy of Holies, the most restricted and sanctified area in the Tabernacle. There G-d took their souls, and they died. Their actions are criticized by the Torah, and they died doing a sinful deed. However, the commentaries note that it was their unbridled desire to come close to G-d that got them in trouble. Their souls were drawn like magnets to G-d's presence, and they were not protected, since their deed was not the performance of any commandment given to them. As a result, they perished. Still, their desire to be close to G-d was correct and worthy of emulation.<br><br>Now we are living in times when it is hard to take one's mind off of Jews and Jewishness. Bombs are exploding almost daily in Israel killing innocents, and making widows, widowers, orphans, and bereft parents. Synogagues are being torched in European communities. The whole world is preoccupied with Jews! We really need to take stock of where we come in to this seemingly chaotic situation. Let us start by internalizing the message of Passover. G-d runs the world. No one can hurt another person without His permission. That means that He is giving permission. Why? He's trying to tell us something. My feeling is that He wants us to develop our awareness of Him. Some One Who does so much for us should not go on being ignored. He's calling us, and the time to answer is now. Let us strenghthen our awareness and desire to get close to G-d. All good things can only come from that. My personal feeling is that alot depends on us now. Let's rise to the challenge. Prayer, performance of mitzvos, and keeping G-d in our thoughts has the potential to go a long way now. Let's do our best.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Break Free!</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br>The Shem MiShmuel, a Chassidic Rebbe and scholar, offers a beautiful insight into an apparent contradiction in the Haggadah. The Haggadah says, "Had the Holy One, Blessed be He, not taken our forefathers out of Egypt, then we and our children and our children's children would remain subservient to Pharaoh in Egypt."<br><br>First of all, the Pharaohs are long gone, so it is unlikely that the Jewish people would have remained as servants in Egypt even had the Exodus never occurred. But in addition, if we do not wish to set this passage aside as simple hyperbole, then it appears to contradict a central element of traditional Jewish thought: that the entire world was created for Torah, to permit us to pursue spirituality and to come close to G-d.<br><br>Without Torah, the world would lack all purpose. So according to the Midrash, G-d created the world with a condition in mind: "if Israel does not accept my Torah, then I will return [all of creation] to 'tohu vavohu,'" referring to the initial state ("without form and void") mentioned at the beginning of Genesis. So had He never removed us from Egypt, then the Torah would never have been given, and the world would have quite literally come to an end!<br><br>If so, then both Pharaoh and Egypt would have ceased to exist, along with the Jews.<br><br>So the Shem MiShmuel offers an answer based (quite appropriately) on Chassidic thought. He explains that 'tohu vavohu' is not simply the absence of anything, but is rather is a creation of its own, a pre-developed state. Had Israel not accepted the Torah, then the world would have returned to 'tohu vavohu' in order to emerge again, but not as a place for Torah.<br><br>That world, explains the Shem MiShmuel, would be a "bad" world, as it were, dominated by the physical, without opportunities for spiritual development, or approaches to the ultimate good found in G-d and Torah. So although human souls would exist in that world, they would have no opportunity for growth or self-perfection.<br><br>This is precisely the environment that Pharaoh sought to create for the Jews in Egypt, oppressing them with physical work and leaving them no time for other pursuits. So although those forces might appear in different garb, they would still dominate the Jews today had we not left Egypt. This is what the Haggadah means, that "we and our children and our children's children would remain subservient to Pharaoh in Egypt."<br><br>Besides the fascinating outlook on the Haggadah and our world, the Shem MiShmuel's explanation should help us to appreciate and focus upon the opportunities that we have. We do not live in a "bad world," so overwhelmed with physical work that we have no time for the spiritual. We can and must find opportunities to pursue the eternal, even in our busy lives.<br><br>Pesach is an especially good time for growth and change. "In each generation, every person is obligated to see himself as if he went out from Egypt, as it says [in the Torah], 'you shall tell it to your sons on that day, saying "because of what HaShem did for me during my departure from Egypt."' Not only our forefathers did the Holy One, Blessed be He, redeem from Egypt, but even us He redeemed with them." Our Sages taught: Pesach offers us the opportunity to break free of whatever bonds have held us until now, and to grow beyond all limitations.<br><br>May we all take advantage of opportunities for growth, those that we find on Pesach, and those offered every day of the year!<br><br>A Happy and Kosher Passover,<br><br>Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br><strong>What is the Question? </strong><br><br>Why is this night different from all other nights? (Haggadah of Pesach)<br><br>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when contemplating the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity. (Albert Einstein)<br><br>The Haggadah of Pesach is one of the greatest and most successful lesson plans of all time. It's a good thing that we have such an exceptional educational tool available. How else could we be confident in fulfilling our sacred obligation of relaying to next generation the experience of the exodus from Egypt?<br><br>We might be left fumbling for words and facts and even worse the children would be forced to endure that most terrible of all fates- a lecture. Children and adults detest lectures. I know! I I'm a "Lecturer".<br><br>Every kid at some time heard the old, "when we were kids..." lecture. The harshness of the living conditions "back then" are always made to sound more severe year after year as time passes. "When we were young we had to walk to school up hill both ways, 15 miles in the snow. Do you think we each had our own coat?" Somebody once asked, "What will the next generation tell their kids? When we were young we had to get up and change the channel!" They will get that same blank stare of disbelief. The lecture is an oft abused didactic discipline.<br><br>The Pesach Seder is organized to avoid this pitfall. It violates its very name-"seder" which means order. It goes out of sequence by design only to accomplish one task initially and that is, to prompt a question. As one great philosopher once said, "There is nothing more irrelevant than the answer to a question that was never asked!" Without a question the most fascinating subject is reduced to a meaningless lecture. Life is the answer to what question? Once a question is asked, however, the search engine is ignited everything becomes relevant and all things potentially become our teacher.<br><br>Try any one of these on for size. What is the meaning of life? Why did Hashem choose us? Why and how have we survived? Is our history unique? Are there discernable patterns in our history? What is the message to us? Why are we gathering as a people again on this night? Who could have orchestrated these events? How will this drama end? Will all the suffering of exile be justifiably compensated in the end? Are we in exile now? What am I living for? What am I willing to die for? Do I appreciate what I have? Do I know what I have? To Whom is gratitude owed? How should I express gratitude? What does it mean to be free? Am I truly free? Etc.<br><br>Not just the success of the Pesach Seder but the whole of existence hinges on a question. To the extent that a question is asked the world becomes lit up with significance. To the degree there is no question in the mind all the facts and information adds up to not more than an accumulation of "sound and fury signifying nothing". Perhaps that's why on Pesach night we are highlighting the importance of the question.<br><br>Jewish parents are often more impressed with a good question than a good grade. One of my principles told me, "The question is more important than the answer! Get them to feel the question!" We are less interested in teaching them "what" to think as we are in teaching them "how" to think.<br><br>A wealthy man was looking for a match for his beautiful daughter. He went to the Yeshiva and presented a difficult question in the Talmud. He offered his daughter's hand in marriage to the one who could solve the deep riddle. Not one student was able to present the correct answer so the wealthy man got into his carriage and swiftly rode to edge of town.<br><br>When he reached the city limits he heard the cries of young man who had apparently been chasing him for some time. Sweaty and covered with dust, exhausted and out of breath the student asked, "Nu?! So what's the answer to the question?" The wealthy man replied, "You're the one I want for my daughter!"<br><br>One question amongst many remains: "What is the question?"<br><br></div>
