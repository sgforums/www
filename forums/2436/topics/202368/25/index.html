            <div class='col-md body'>God's Judgement of Our Intentions<br>After the death of our father Yakov, the brothers sense a change in Yosef's attitude and behavior towards them. They are fearful that now that Yakov is gone, Yosef will wreak vengeance against them for their treatment of him many decades earlier They therefore tell Yosef that Yakov commanded that he not be vengeful towards them. Yosef knows that this statement is not true He weeps at having now to be forced to reconcile himself once more with his brothers. He comforts them by stating that "you may have thought in evil intent to harm me, but God thought this to be a great good for now I have been unable to sustain in life a great nation." How does this calm the brothers? Is their guilt somehow expunged simply because God arranged for a happy ending to their originally evil intent? We find in the Talmud that if a person intends to eat non-kosher food and accidentally, without knowledge or intent, actually eats kosher food, he is nonetheless obligated to bring a sin offering because of his evil intent. The rule for such a person is the same as for one who actually ate non-kosher food believing it to be kosher food. He too must bring a sin offering. So, what comfort is it to the brothers that their evil intent turned into a great favor for Yosef and themselves and the entire world at large? Are they not held liable for their bad intention just as in the case of the person eating kosher food, which he thought to be non-kosher?<br><br>Rabbi Meir Dan Plotzki (early twentieth century gaon in Warsaw) in his monumental work on Chumash, Kli Chemda, addresses this question. He provides us with the following insight. There is a great difference between sinning directly against God - eating non-kosher food - and sinning directly against a fellow human being (though this is also indirectly a sin against God) - selling a brother into slavery. When dealing with God Who knows our innermost thoughts, Who searches our hearts and minds and from Whom nothing is hidden, there is no difference between intent and actual behavior. We are taught that regarding the sin of avodah zarah - idolatry - even intent is culpable in God's eyes. The prophet said regarding this sin "To capture Israel in its own heart." For in our relationship with God the inside and the outside, the intent and the action are the same in His omniscience. However, when human beings deal one with another, no one knows the true intent of the other person. Human beings can only judge behavior on actuality and result. The Talmud teaches us a person who gives charity and help to others out of base or selfish motives is still considered to be a charitable person. Thus Yosef could correctly say to the brothers that their original intent is now really immaterial for the result has been a greater good. And in this he hoped they would find some comfort and conciliation.<br><br>We should always attempt to have good and holy intentions in all of our actions, both in matters relating directly to God or to human beings. But we should always remember that as far as human beings are concerned actions and results speak louder than words or intent. May all of our actions and intent be for the sake of the advancement of Torah and the sanctification of God's Name.<br><br>Rabbi Berel Wein<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The last seventeen years of the life of our father, Yaakov, are years of contentment and serenity. His family has been reunited, albeit in the foreign land of Egypt, and the rift between Yosef and his brothers has somehow been repaired. Yaakov studies Torah with his grandsons, even those who were born in Egyptian exile, far from the holy home of Yaakov in the Land of Israel. He basks in the glory of the achievements of his beloved son Yosef and in the accomplishments and students of the school of Torah established by Yehuda in the land of Goshen. He is finally at peace after his long and difficult life of struggle, enemies and heartbreak. As the Lord had promised Yaakov, "Yosef will place his hands over your eyes." The triumph and success of Yosef soothes Yaakov's later years.<br><br>But Yaakov is aware that the success and prosperity of his family is illusory and temporary. He sees in his prophetic vision the exile of Egypt unfolding and how it will become progressively more bitter. The baleful scene that his grandfather Avraham witnessed in his dream of his "descendants being strangers in a land that is not theirs, and that they will be enslaved and tortured there" until God redeems them, is a living reminder to Yaakov of what the future of Egypt will hold for his descendants. Yaakov knows that difficult times are coming and that his dream of the creation of the people of Israel will be contested by the very Egyptian nation that has proved so kind and hospitable to him and his family in his lifetime. Yaakov's concern therefore is how can he help prepare his descendants for the ordeal that awaits them. What are the weapons of inner strength that he can bequeath to them that will enable them to withstand the centuries of physical and psychological degradation that face them? The nature of a father and/or grandfather is to protect and support his progeny. Yaakov is therefore undoubtedly determined to help his children. But how?<br><br>I think that the answer lies in the final blessings that Yaakov grants to his children before his death. Yaakov addresses each one of his children individually. Each one has his merits and talents. Yaakov is not reticent to point out shortcomings of personality in his sons as well. But it is apparent that Yaakov's intention is that each one of the sons develops, in fact, concentrate, on their inner strengths and particular individuality. It is as if the salvation of Israel lies in its diversity, its individual independence and human differences, rather than in a sense of conformity and unnatural sameness. Yehuda is the lion, Zevulun the sailor, Yisachar the great-boned donkey who bears the burden of Torah scholarship, Naftali is the swift gazelle and Binyamin is the prowling wolf. Our teacher, Moshe, in his final blessing to the then nation of Israel, also follows the pattern of Yaakov. He does not bless the people as a whole, nor does he blur the differences of outlook, professions, and personalities within the nation. Rather he blesses and strengthens the particular talents and ways of each of the individual tribes, thereby guaranteeing a healthy, balanced and strong Jewish people. Yaakov knows that without the individual strengths of each of his sons separately being reinforced and put to constant use, the Egyptian exile could very well overwhelm the Jews. Therefore the Psalmist phrases the redemption of Israel from Egyptian slavery as being the moment "When Israel left Egypt, the House of Jacob [departed] from an alien society." Israel, as a united nation and people left Egypt. But it was only able to do so because it remained "the House of Jacob," individual personalities and distinct individuals. This insight into the blessings of Jacob remains valid today. It was the great Rebbe of Kotzk who said it perhaps best: "If I am I because I am you, and you are you because you are me, then I am not I and you are not you. But if I am I because I am I and you are you because you are you, then I am I and you are you!"<br><br>Rabbi Berel Wein<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by guest author: Dovid Hoffman<br><br>"He [Yosef] comforted them [his brothers] and spoke to their hearts." [50:21]<br>After the burial of Yaakov, Yosef's brothers became afraid. They feared that perhaps Yosef still bore a grudge against them because of what they had done to him. The brothers turned to Yosef, pleading for forgiveness.<br><br>As he had done when first identifying himself, Yosef reassured his brothers that G-d meant it all for good. This time, however, Yosef used a new rationale to reassure the brothers that he would not kill or oppress them.<br><br>Rash"i, explaining the verse "He comforted them and spoke to their hearts," relates Yosef's convincing words:<br><br>Yosef explained, "Before you [the brothers] came down to Egypt, the Egyptians slandered me, saying that I am a slave. Through you it became known that I am a free man. If I would kill you, what would people say? 'Yosef saw a group of men. He elevated himself through them, by claiming that they were his brothers. But in the end, he killed them! Is there a brother who would kill his brothers? [So clearly he is a liar, and these were not his brothers at all. He really is a slave.]'"<br><br>On one hand, Yosef's words are logical and may have convinced the brothers that Yosef will not kill them. On the other hand, if we examine what Yosef told his brothers, his words are little comfort! Yosef was telling them that even the Egyptians would not believe that a man would kill his own brother. But his brothers did want to kill their brother - Yosef! These are painful, hurtful words!<br><br>Rav Yosef Salant explains that Yosef was indeed comforting his brothers. Yosef was proving to them that the entire incident must have been influenced from above - from G-d, and that it was not from their own hearts and desires that they did it. Yosef explained to them that when they plotted to kill him, it was against nature. It was - quite literally - unnatural behavior. Even the Egyptians know that brothers don't kill brothers! It was clearly impossible that the righteous sons of Yaakov would even contemplate such a horrible thing.<br><br>So how could it happen? It could only happen through the hand of G-d, acting to fulfill His will, to provide salvation during the hunger and to cause the family to move to Egypt. So these are true words of comfort!<br><br>We need to constantly remind ourselves that G-d controls His world. Most of the time, however, He hides His influence. We are unable to see the hashgacha - that G-d is really controlling His world. We often don't understand why things happen. We don't have answers.<br><br>It is only rarely that G-d does allow us to see and understand a small aspect of His influence. Shidduchim, the coming together of young men and women to marry, are specifically known as an area where G-d's influence is present. In my own case, I can trace a series of events that date back two full years, that in one small way, led to this particular shidduch.<br><br>It is only a tiny glimpse. It was not visible in advance and it only relates to one small aspect of the shidduch. But there are so many aspects of hashgacha, of Divine Guidance, of which we never become aware.<br><br>We must strive to utilize the small hints of hashgacha that G-d allows us to see, to help us endure during times when G-d completely hides His presence - when we see His hand, it must strengthen us during those times when we don't see and don't understand...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"Zevulun will settle by the seashore... Yissocher is a bony donkey, lying between the borders." [49:13-14]<br>Rashi explains that Zevulun will live near shipping ports, engaging in business and providing sustenance to Yissocher - for the latter will be studying Torah. "This is what Moshe said, 'Zevulun, be happy as you go out, and Yissocher, in your tents.' [Dev. 33:18] Zevulun goes out and does business, while Yissocher studies Torah in the tents."<br><br>What sort of study is involved? Rashi says, "'A bony donkey' - A donkey with prominent bones. He carries the yoke of Torah like a strong donkey which is carrying a heavy load."<br><br>The yoke of Torah is just that - a heavy responsibility and obligation. Those who truly study it not merely full-time, but "day and night," are recognized by the Torah as deserving of our support.<br><br>The Chofetz Chaim, Rabbi Yisrael Kagan, explains that HaShem created the world knowing that it was impossible for the entire nation to be engaged only in Torah study, and that it would also be necessary to engage in "the ways of the world." Therefore, when dividing the land of Israel among the tribes, He suggested to us the necessary partnership between Yissocher and Zevulun.<br><br>Each one fills a unique and necessary purpose: Yissocher loved Torah study, so much so that the tribe produced 200 heads of the Sanhedrin, the nation of Israel's Supreme Court, and they taught Torah to all of Israel. Zevulun was heavily involved with business, so they could not dedicate themselves to Torah in this fashion - but they supported and sustained their brothers in the tribe of Yissocher, giving them whatever they needed.<br><br>In Jewish thought, we know that our primary purpose is the pursuit of our spirituality and the study of Torah. But one person cannot do everything alone. Yissocher and Zevulun _together_ are considered "the pillars of the world." And this even has ramifications within Jewish law: the Shulchan Aruch, the Code of Jewish law, says [Yoreh Deah 246] that "one who does not know how to learn himself, or is very involved with business and finds it difficult to learn, is obligated to support those who study Torah. And it will be considered for him as if he studied Torah himself."<br><br>Imagine! If someone is involved in business, but helps support Torah study, it is "considered for him as if he studied Torah himself!" By law!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"Dan will exact judgment for his people, the Tribes of Israel will be like one. Dan will be like a snake on the path, a viper on the way, which bites the heels of a horse causing the rider to tumble off backwards. For your salvation do I long, HaShem!" [49:16-18]<br><br>Dan is described as a protector of his people, and an extremely dangerous foe to his enemies. But immediately after saying so, Yaakov nonetheless declares -- "For _YOUR_ salvation do I long, HaShem!" Despite all of the protection that Dan or any human can offer, Yaakov always depends ultimately upon HaShem.<br><br>The Ba'al Shem Tov, literally "the Master of the Good Name," was the father of the Chassidic movement. Once, he sent two of his students to a distant country in order to procure wine for Passover. His students were anxious to please their teacher, so they made every effort to do the job right, to return with wine in which was unquestionably Kosher for Passover.<br><br>They went out to the vineyards, helping to select the best grapes. They meticulously supervised the pressing of the grapes to ensure that no grain products were anywhere nearby. They ensured that the wine was sealed in the strongest casks, which they then transported back under their constant supervision.<br><br>Immediately after their return, they unsealed the casks and tasted the wine -- and it was perfect. They briefly left the room to tell others that they had come back with wine which met the highest standards both in taste and in Kashrus supervision.<br><br>When they returned, they were greeted by a non-Jewish worker, chewing on a ham sandwich, who exclaimed, "that's delicious wine you have there!"<br><br>Of course, given the possibility that part of the sandwich had fallen into a cask, all was lost. The Ba'al Shem Tov would unquestionably not be able to use this wine.<br><br>With broken spirits they went into their teacher, to explain how the wine was lost in such a bizarre way. With penetrating insight, the Ba'al Shem Tov told them, "you did everything you could, everything possible, to guard the wine. You were so careful, in fact, that you forgot to ask G-d to watch over _you_. You left no place for His protection!"<br><br>There is a tension, as it were, between the concepts of "hishtadlus" and "bitachon," between our obligation to make an effort on the one hand, and our obligation to rely upon Divine Providence on the other. We must make an effort, and cannot stumble forward blindly. But at the same time, we must be careful to recognize that the ultimate success or failure of those efforts does not lie in our hands.<br><br>A perfect example, of course, is "making a living." We have to make an effort. But a leading Rabbi once commented that people come to him with all sorts of questions regarding how much we must do -- in other areas. How much wine must I drink for Kiddush? How much matzah must I eat at the Seder? How much money do I need to give to charity? And no one asks, "how much effort must I make at providing for my family?"<br><br>Even as we make that effort, we must remember that success is ultimately not ours to achieve -- and we must trust in G-d to give us what we truly need.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Treasure The Moment<br>By Rabbi Moshe Peretz Gilden<br><br>In the closing days of his life, our Patriarch Yaakov (Jacob) commanded Yosef (Joseph) not to inter him in Egypt. He made Yosef swear that he will be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Chevron. He then offered Yosef's two sons and all of his own sons blessings that guide and define the future of each of the Twelve Tribes. After the blessings and Yaakov's subsequent demise, there was a 70 day mourning period, followed by a huge procession that brought Yaakov to his final resting place in the Holy Land.<br><br>At the time of Yaakov's death, "when Yaakov finished instructing his sons, he drew his feet onto the bed, he expired and was gathered to his people." (Beraishis/Genesis 49:33) What is the significance of Yaakov drawing his feet?<br><br>Three weeks ago we read, "Yaakov settled in the land of his father's sojourning." (37:1) Rashi quoted the Midrash which contrasted the settling of Yaakov - which implies permanence - and the sojourn of his father Yitzchak (Isaac) - which appears to be temporary. The Midrash inferred that after his long exile and struggles with Lavan, "Yaakov wished to finally settle down in tranquility, but the anguish of Yosef's kidnapping pounced upon him."<br><br>Rabbi Gedaliah Schorr (1910-1979; Rosh Yeshiva/Dean of Mesivta Torah Vodaath in Brooklyn, New York; described as the first American trained gadol) expounded that Yaakov was being taught the preciousness of life. Every moment of life has its purpose, granted for the sake of accomplishment. Yaakov thought he had done so much in his life - and he had - and he could now "relax" and focus his time on his relationship with the Creator. But G-d had other plans; there was still much to accomplish. Yaakov, as long as he lived, needed to serve as the Father of the Jewish nation, preparing his children to lead the future generations. Yaakov was being taught how a servant of G-d must continue to "plant the seeds" throughout all the days of his life.<br><br>The Talmud (Eruvin 65a) related a similar anecdote. Rav Chisda was asked by his daughter, "You look exhausted, why don't you sleep a little?" to which he responded, "The day will come when I have plenty of opportunity to sleep (after my passing)." We were put in this world to accomplish, not to relax.<br><br>Our Father, Yaakov, had already inculcated this lesson. Homiletically, we understand he reemphasized it in his final mortal act. Only at that last moment in life did Yaakov "draw his feet onto the bed." Only then, the moment before death, did he lift his feet off the ground and recline.<br><br>Rest and relaxation are tools used toward an end, not ends in themselves. Life is the opportunity to bring oneself and others closer to G-d and every moment must be utilized toward achieving that goal.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hope in a Box<br><br>By Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br>"And Yoseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years and they put him in a coffin in Egypt." (Genesis 50:26) Thus ends the Book of Genesis. With those words the entire congregation rises in unison and shouts, "Chazak! Chazak! V'nischazek!" Be strong! Be strong! And may we all be strengthened!<br><br>It is troubling. First, Sefer Bereishis (Genesis) ends in a state of limbo. Yoseph is not even buried; he lies dormant in a box through the entire ensuing exile. He asks his children to remember him and eventually bury his bones with them upon their exodus. Why does he not seek immediate burial in Canaan like his father Yaakov?<br><br>Second, the entire juxtaposition seems inappropriate. After we end Sefer Bereishis and declare that "Yoseph was put in a box in Egypt," we all shout almost as in a cheer, "Be Strong and be strengthened." Are those somber words a proper lead-in to the shouts of Chazak?<br><br>Would it not have been more fitting to end the book of Genesis with the passing of Jacob, his burial in Israel, and the reconciliation of Yoseph and his brothers? That would have been a morally uplifting ending and would have left the congregation with a sense of closure.<br><br>Yet, it seems that there is a definitive purpose in ending Genesis with Yoseph's state of limbo. What is it?<br><br>Alexander the Great (356-322 B.C.E.), king of Macedonia, and ruler of most of the civilized world, died at a young age. Before he embarked on his conquest of Asia, he inquired into the welfare and stability of his loyal followers, lest their dependents fall destitute during the long battle. After assessing their needs he disbursed nearly all his royal resources amongst hs faithful.. His friend General Perdiccas was surprised.<br><br>"What have you reserved for yourself?" he asked the mighty ruler.<br><br>"Hope," answered the king. "There is always hope."<br><br>"In that case," replied his followers, "we who share in your labor shall share in your hope."<br><br>With that they refused the wealth that Alexander allotted them.<br><br>Perhaps there is great meaning behind the Torah's abrupt conclusion leaving a congregation to ponder as they hear the words "and he was put in a box in Egypt" juxtaposed with shouts of rejuvenation.<br><br>Yoseph's quest was to leave this world with more than memories. He wanted to declare to his survivors that he, too, would not find his final rest during their tenure of suffering. Yoseph, the first of the sons of Yaakov to die in a foreign land, understood that with his passing, the long exile would slowly emerge. The children of Jacob would slowly and painfully transform from saviors to visitors, and then from visitors to strangers. Finally they would be considered by their hosts as intruders worthy of enslavement. But Yoseph also knew that one day the exile would end and that his people would once again be free. By remaining in a box, Yoseph concurrently declared his message of hope and solidarity to the multitudes that simultaneously awaited his final burial and their redemption. Silently, in an unburied box, he waited with them as the echoes of his pact rang in their memories. "When G-d will indeed remember you, then you must bring my bones up with you."<br><br>It is a message for all generations. It is a message for all times. When we see the bones of Yoseph, unburied and in a box -- "we must not see a box of bones -- see the hope that lies therein. " We see the hope and faith that the patriarch declared to his children. "Do not bury me now, as you surely will be remembered one day. My hope is your hope."<br><br>And as the congregation finishes the Bereishis on that unfinished note, they stand up and shout in unison, "Chazak! Chazak! V'nischazek!" Be strong! Be strong! May we all be strengthened!" For one day we will all be free<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br>The End of Days<br><br>Then Jacob called for his sons and said, Â“Assemble yourselves and I will tell you what will befall you in Â“The End of DaysÂ”. Gather yourselves and listen, O sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father. (Breishis 49:1)<br><br>When they had assembled they thought they would hear a litany of blessings and consolations. Jacob our father answered and said to them, Â“Abraham my fatherÂ’s father had blemished children that came out from him, Ishmael and all the children of Ketura. From my father Isaac issued, my brother Esau who was disqualified. I am afraid that that there might be amongst you a person whose heart is divided from his brothers and goes to serve other godsÂ”. All twelve tribes responded simultaneously and said, Â“Listen (our father) Israel HASHEM is OUR G-D HASHEM is the ONE and ONLY.Â” At that moment Jacob our father answered, Â“Blessed is the Name of His glorious kingdom for all eternity!Â” (Talmud- Yerushalmi)<br><br>Maimonodies writes in The Laws of Â“ShemaÂ” that this homiletic is the source of our inserting those whispered words after the first line of Â“ShemaÂ”, although it is not part of the verse- Â“Blessed is the Name of His glorious Kingdom for eternity!Â” With that as the punctuation to their discussion, it seems that JacobÂ’s worries were quieted by the brotherÂ’s unanimous pledge. Why was their declaration of faith at that moment taken as a Â“guaranteeÂ” of future loyalty?<br><br>ItÂ’s written in his, Â“Guide for GroomsÂ” that Rabbi Shlomo Wolbe asked a group of young men preparing to stand under the wedding canopy, Â“On what will you base your marriage?Â” All expressed the same tender sentiment- Â“On love and understanding!Â” The Rabbi explained to them that however well- meaning their intent they cannot possibly base their new marriages on love and understanding. They neither love nor understand each other quite yet! That is what they need to strive for. With effort they could hope to love more and understand more of each other over time. What they experience now is a desire to understand and to love. It is the goal initially and not the means. Communication is the vehicle that helps deliver that result.<br><br>When looking for a life partner an important factor, all can agree on, is Â“compatibilityÂ”. ItÂ’s valid to ask, Â“Is there enough commonality to create a shared existence?Â” However, there is an even more pressing question. Compatibility may assist in the area of communication but more importantly one might need to ask, Â“What is our ultimate goal in being together?Â”<br><br>To illustrate, imagine two people meet in the train station and start a dynamic conversation. They soon happily discover that they are both going to the airport and the very same airline terminal. When they arrive they are saddened realize one has a ticket to Hawaii and the other to Jerusalem. All the communication skills in the world wonÂ’t help them at this point.<br><br>However, when two people are committed to and hold in their hands tickets to the same final destination a host of difficulties will melt away effortlessly. The ego of both is trumped by the compelling power of a shared vision. Obstacles built by questions of Â“WhoÂ’s right?Â” will yield naturally to the answers to- Â“WhatÂ’s right?Â” How important is it to have not just a common history but a common destiny?!<br><br>Â“Shema YisraelÂ” can be called the Â“mission statementÂ” of the Jewish Nation. Properly understood from its primal origin, The Â“ShemaÂ” declares not only our point of departure but our final destination, as well, as we say daily: Â“On that day HASHEM will be ONE and His Name will be ONE!Â” (Zechariah 14:9) With the end in sight and all his children unified in purpose around him, Jacob sought to and was successful at offering us a glimpse of that which paves our way to Â“The End of DaysÂ”.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Chaim Dovid Green<br><br>We would all agree that the way to accomplish anything worthwhile is at a time when life is peaceful, and there is enough of everything, and needs are taken care of. Then we can totally dedicate ourselves to the important things in life which contribute to personal growth.<br><br>The question is then, why wasn't the Torah given to the Jewish people after they entered Israel, when they were settled and secure, and all of their needs were provided for? Why was the Torah given to the Jewish people when they were in the wilderness, unsettled and unstable?<br><br>Rabbi Yeruchem Levovitz answers that just as the Torah itself teaches us, so does the way it was given teach us something about the way we should accept and pursue it.<br><br>Indeed, there is a great need for stability and peace of mind to absorb Torah learning. The question is what is the nature of the peace of mind which we need? People generally think that the peace of mind which we need is the result of having sufficient creature comforts. Rabbi Yeruchem explains that it is really just the opposite. When people get used to total comfort, any little thing missing causes havoc in the person's stability, and that thing becomes the priority to the exclusion of spiritual goals. It's like trying to quench one's thirst with salt water. It seems that it is quenching one's thirst in the short run, but it actually makes it worse. One thinks that now that his creature comforts are provided for, then one can dedicate oneself to more important matters. However, it just takes one further away from spirituality.<br><br>True peace of mind only comes through having the strength to live independently of superfluous creature comforts. That doesn't mean stoicism; one should not live in deprivation, but rather a self imposed independence from things which drag him away from spirituality. In other words, the body is a servant, not a master. The servant gets its needs, but the needs are not an end in themselves. That lends itself to true stability and peace of mind. That is the backdrop for success in spiritual endeavors.<br><br>How do we arrive at such a level? It comes through focusing on one purpose. That is to clarify what our obligations are in this world, and what we need to make our primary goal. Clarity and focus is the key. Many people who lack peace of mind do so because so many things around them are influencing them. Their priorities are torn between many, often contradictory things. They end up living a mixed-up, unfocused existence. On the other hand, someone who doesn't live for every creature comfort, and is not in pursuit of them for their own sake, just the way our forefathers lived in the wilderness, will not easily be knocked off track.<br><br>This is what Yaakov's blessing was to Yisachar in this week's parsha. And he saw peace of mind, that it is good, and he bent his back to carry (Genesis 49:15). He bends his back to carry so that he will not habituate himself to an easy existence. As a result, nothing will distract him from pursuing his goals. He is like a soldier in training who must be placed in situations which simulate the situations of high-tension which he may encounter in battle. If he would train in an easy and pleasant environment, it's guaranteed he would not know hold up in a real combat situation.<br><br>Yisachar recognized that the way to find true peace of mind is through a focused approach. He bent his back to carry. He didn't mortgage himself to creature comforts. He kept his mind on his goals, and uncompromisingly pursued them. This is true peace of mind, and this is what the Torah is teaching us by its having been given to us in the wilderness, and not in Israel.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br>Practiced-for Eternity<br><br>And Yaakov ceased from commanding his children and he gathered his feet upon his bed, he expired and was gathered up to his people. (Breishis 49:3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>All those sit-ups for nothing! (Jacqueline Kennedy Onasis' last utterance)<br><br>Yaakov was productive right up till the end of his long life. Even in the last moments of his life he was giving guidance to his children and all future generations. Why are the last words of Yaakov so important that the entire text of that address is recorded in detail for all time? Why is his last act of his life linked in verse with his being "gathered up to his people"?<br><br>There is obviously something more intensely profound about the final moments of a person's life that reveals something of his essence. In the face of any test, Rabbi Dessler, points out, the true nature of a person is made manifest.<br><br>Rabeinu Yona asks a question and remains without an answer in a state of wonder. Why don't people begin to repent by the age of 35? If the years of a person's life are 70, then after the fuel tank on the plane has passed the Â½ mark, one should begin to consider learning how to gracefully conclude this flight.<br><br>This type of thinking is not necessarily morbid. It can be rather refreshing to the soul. King Solomon, the wisest of all men, says in Koheles, "It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a drinking party." The Talmud tells us on the verse, "And G-d saw all that he had created and it was very good", that the ingredient that turned the world from "good" to "very good" was the introduction of death. What could possibly be so very good about death?<br><br>Rabbi Yisrael Salanter met Rabbi Yosef Yozzel Horowitz, who at the time was a merchant. Rabbi Yisrael remembered the young man as a great scholar and asked how he had come to abandon his youthful idealism. Reb Yosef Yozzel answered rhetorically, "How am I to live!?" Reb Yisrael Salanter retorted, "How are you going to die?" The words went through him like a knife. In time, because of that encounter, he was to become the father a vast yeshiva school system with thousands of students leaving a rich legacy of personal teachings.<br><br>A clever man once asked, "When is the best time to buy an umbrella?" The answer, "Before it starts raining." Once the rain begins, one may become drenched and the price of umbrellas rises significantly. Battles and tests are won and passed in times of preparation. Athletes and actors rehearse plays and performances in their minds thousands of times before the actual execution. When the event arrives and the action is successful, it is because it is not nearly the first.<br><br>Rabbi Akiva rehearsed in his mind his finale' thousands of times and was ready for a torturous death when the moment arrived. His dying words speak volumes about how he lived. Remarkably, Rabbi Yisrael Salanter spent the last hours of his precious and productive life, anticipating his own death, in conversation with a lone attendant about the unfounded fears people have in the presence of a dead body. Even in his final moments he was concerned about the feelings of others. Where does one get such presence of mind?<br><br>When asked about the "after life" a great Rebbe once said, "There is no "after-life". There is only continuation of life as it was lived here in another dimension." If one believes they are a body, and they are fully invested in physical life alone, then death is the seeming conclusion of everything absolutely and finally and this is a too terribly morbid discussion.<br><br>However, if life is understood to be essentially a spiritual adventure, and one is living life with a constant awareness of what lies beyond, then the end of life is like a birth and the last state is a concentrated summary of prior to transition.<br><br>What one really believes determines how one chooses to live here, and forever more. Yaakov continued to work on his speech right up until the time he was called to the other room to deliver what he had practiced-for eternity<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Failure That Leads to Godliness</strong><br><br>by Os Hillman<br><br>All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader.... - 1 Samuel 22:2<br><br>God uses broken things to accomplish His greatest work. When David was anointed to be the next king, he was just a boy, the youngest among all his brothers. Little did he know that the next several years would be years of fleeing from Saul whose successes turned into obsessions as a leader who had fallen from God's anointing. Perhaps David thought, "Why am I living a life as a fugitive?Â” I am the next king of Israel. Yet, his life was filled with adversity after adversity before he ever fulfilled the ultimate calling God had for him. Others began to hear of David's successes and identify with his plight. But, it wasn't the successful and polished who came to join him. It was "those who were in distress or in debt or discontented" who would be part of his armyÂ—and an army it was! His army would become known throughout the world as the greatest ever assembled, not because of their skill, but because of the God behind the army. God turned David's men into "mighty men of valor" (see 1 Chron. 11:10).<br><br>God often uses failure to make us useful. When Jesus called the disciples, He did not go out and find the most qualified and successful people. He found the most willing, and He found them in the workplace. He found a fisherman, a tax collector, a farmer, and a doctor.<br><br>The Hebrews knew that failure was a part of maturing in God. The Greeks used failure as a reason for disqualification. Sadly, in the Church, we often treat one another in this way. This is not God's way. We need to understand that failing does not make us failures. It makes us experienced. It makes us more prepared to be useful in God's KingdomÂ—if we have learned from it. And that is the most important ingredient for what God wants in His children.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>YAHVEH IS MY SHEPHERD #1</strong><br><br>Shabbat shalom and Shnat Shabaton (Shabbat Year) dearly beloved:<br><br>I began this Shabbat Year of 2007 with a fast and a retreat. As I was resting in prayer, The Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) began to open before me the mysteries of Psalms 23, the favorite of many! This year He desires that we see Him as a Shepherd, a Hebrew Shepherd.<br><br>It is therefore no surprise that this Eternal Psalm begins with a statement of PROVISION!<br><br>Â“Yahveh is my shepherd I shall not wantÂ” Psalms 23:1<br><br>With us humans, the most important thing in life is that we are well provided for. In fact, if you ask anyone what is the source of most worries and anxieties, it is always about provision. People are willing to steal and even kill to satisfy their inner cravings and wants. Most marriages stick together very well when provision is plentiful, but when provision is lacking then strife begins and of course the famous Â“pointing of the fingerÂ”. It is your fault, my fault, their fault. Single mothers break their backs trying to provide alone for their children.   In most households both parents work in order Â“to have enoughÂ” for the needs of the family. If you ask pastors what is the number one need of their congregations they will undoubtedly say Â“financesÂ”.  We are lacking for the building fund, the Sunday school fund, the widowÂ’s fund, the missions program, etcÂ…When you ask young people what they want to study or follow as a career, they will surely say that they want something that will bring in Â“enough moneyÂ”  They want a profitable career. In fact, most people choose their career according to how well it will provide. Is it a mistake that so many young people have fluctuated into Â“Business AdministrationÂ” and the like? No, they want to be financially solvent. In some circles your ability to Â“make moneyÂ” is equated with spirituality. The more money you are able to Â“makeÂ”, the more spiritual and close to God you are. But what is the opinion of YAH (God) in this matter?<br><br>Yahveh is<br><br>Â“Yahveh is my shepherd I shall not wantÂ”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The first thing that we must internalize is that YAHVEH IS. In other words He is an ever PRESENT Shepherd. He is in our present circumstances. The very name YAHVEH means I AM, not I was or I will be! The revelation of this fact is of paramount importance if we are to walk with Him and trust Him as our Shepherd. Most people in this 21st century society have lost all trust in the ability and availability of their parents to provide for their needs. Our needs are not only financial, but they are also emotional and spiritual. Most parents of the 21st century are ABSENT in one way or another. They are physically absent because the financial demands causes both parents to work. Little babies are left in the care of strangers.  From a very early age they learn that you canÂ’t trust your parents as they may leave you at any given time. In a worst case scenario, many parents are even more ABSENT because of divorce or because of addictions. Many fathers, and even mothers, have left their homes to pursue a career or a Â“nicerÂ” woman or man. Many fathers and mothers are victims of alcohol, drug addictions and of course depressions. The children of the 21st century must learn to Â“fight for themselvesÂ”, Â“provide for themselvesÂ” and Â“take care of themselvesÂ”. Of course this is not only a 21st century plague, it is also a 20th century plague.   Most of us of any age have been raised with ABSENT parents in one way or another. In some cases because of wars, disease and even suicide, parents die and children are orphaned. Orphan-hood is the deepest problem of our time. Most people have experience some sort of Orphan-hood, and not only family orphan-hood but spiritual as well. Even among believers, most people have had no real pastors-shepherds or spiritual mentors. Even Â“going to churchÂ” does not help because there is no real relationship with a mentor.   Most believers have received no real guidance, nurturing or the much needed discipline and correction.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with orphans is that it is very hard for them to trust authorities, parents or pastors.  Their own mistrust causes them to shipwreck their lives. Even when a true parent or shepherd shows up in the scene of an orphanÂ’s life, (whether spiritual or physical orphan,) it is hard for them to honor, submit and surrender to being cared for, nurtured and even disciplined for their own good. For the most part orphans tend to be either CO-DEPENDANT or INDEPENDENT. The co-dependant orphans are always needy and they will Â“suck you dryÂ”.  You can never give them enough or care for them enough. It is very frustrating and depleting to care for someone with an Â“orphan spiritÂ”. Those that are independent look better because they Â“mind their own businessÂ” and want you to Â“mind yoursÂ”; unless they can get something out of you through manipulation. The problem with the Â“independent orphansÂ” is that they trust no one.  They tend to escape from any relationship that seems to be too close. They are for the most part in correctible!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only solution is to KNOW THAT YAHVEH IS! He is never absent. He is always present and you can always turn to Him. However, because of the orphan mentality, most people will judge YAH as absent if He does not do what they want, in the way they want and at the time they want. In that case, they will get bitter with Him and will begin to vent all the anger that they have bottled up against their absent parents or spiritual leaders on Him. When I say that Yahveh IS, I mean He ALWAYS IS in your PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE. It takes faith, trust and above all HUMILITY to enjoy His Presence. He will not be manipulated or coerced, He freely gives of Himself to those that hunger and thirst for Him and for His Presence. He gladly gives GRACE to the humble and needy that leans on Him. He is ALWAYS PRESENT.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MY SHEPHERD</strong><br><br>Â“Yahveh is my shepherd I shall not wantÂ”<br><br>The second thing that we need to know in order to walk with Him is that He is MY SHEPHERD! In other words though He may have one million sheep, He is still my VERY PERSONAL Shepherd. He knows me by name.  He knows all about me.  He is always watching my life and He knows what is BEST for me! In other words His guidance, His nurturing and correction are totally personal and impartial. He is never too busy to help me and or discipline me. It is as if I am His only child. His mentoring is Â“tailor madeÂ” to who He created me to be.  He knows how to get the best out of me. I cannot fool him by pretending.  I cannot hide. He is my shepherd and He knows me from afar. He is able to recognize me among millions of others and He will not mistake me for someone else. He has a plan for me that is for no one else.  He loves to spend time with me as if there is no one else. He is MY SHEPHERD. That is a very intimate position!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Most people are truly afraid of such intimacy, because most people have a lot to hide and true intimacy is very exposing. </strong>Truly a relationship with My Shepherd is s very exposing relationship.  There is no use to hide.  He knows all about me and He knows how to remedy every sick condition inside of me. He knows how to untwist me, unwind me, untangle me, correct me and make me whole. He knows when I need a kiss, a hug or the rod of correction. For those with an orphan spirit, intimacy with YAH can be very scary and very demanding.  Such a relationship demands ABSOLUTE TRUST. It demands our following and obeying Him against our better judgment. Everything might say- Â“RUN and ESCAPEÂ”.  Yet He will be motioning us to follow. If we are to walk with the Shepherd, we are to trust Him when He leads us to the desert or the land flowing with milk and honey. We are to trust Him when He leads us to bitter waters or when He leads us to an oasis full of sweet water and seventy palm trees. He knows if I need the bitter waters to purge some old ungodly attitude or if I need the sweet dates to refresh my soul and be encouraged. He is My Shepherd, My Mentor, My doctor, My ALL. He knows BEST!<br><br></div>
