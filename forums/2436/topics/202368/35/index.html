            <div class='col-md body'>You Deal with God<br>"I will not execute the fierceness of Mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man"   (Hosea 11:9).<br><br>The LORD thus makes known His sparing mercies. It may be that the reader is now under heavy displeasure, and everything threatens his speedy doom. Let the text hold him up from despair. The LORD now invites you to consider your ways and confess your sins. If He had been man, He would long ago have cut you off. If He were now to act after the manner of men, it would be a word and a blow and then there would be an end of you: but it is not so, for "as high as the heavens are above the earth, so high are his ways above your ways."<br><br>You rightly judge that He is angry, but He keepeth not His anger forever: if you turn from sin to Jesus, God will turn from wrath. Because God is God, and not man, there is still forgiveness for you, even though you may be steeped up to your throat in iniquity. You have a God to deal with and not a hard man, or even a merely just man. No human being could have patience with you. You would have wearied out an angel, as you have wearied your sorrowing Father; but God is longsuffering. Come and try Him at once. Confess, believe, and turn from your evil way, and you shall be saved.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ever Mindful<br>"The LORD hath been mindful of us: He will bless us"   (Psalm 115:12).<br><br>I can set my seal to that first sentence. Cannot you? Yes, Jehovah has thought of us, provided for us, comforted us, delivered us, and guided us. In all the movements of His providence He has been mindful of us, never overlooking our mean affairs. His mind has been full of us -- that is the other form of the word mindfull. This has been the case all along and without a single break. At special times, however, we have more distinctly seen this mindfulness, and we would recall them at this hour with overflowing gratitude. Yes, yes, "the LORD hath been mindful of us."<br><br>The next sentence is a logical inference from the former one. Since God is unchangeable, He will continue to be mindful of us in the future as He has been in the past; and His mindfulness is tantamount to blessing us. But we have here not only the conclusion of reason but the declaration of inspiration; we have it on the Holy Ghost's authority -- "He will bless us." This means great things and unsearchable. The very indistinctness of the promise indicates its infinite reach. He will bless us after His own divine manner, and that forever and ever, Therefore, let us each say, "Bless the LORD, O my soul!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mercy to the Undeserving<br><br>"He that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about"<br>(Psalm 32:10).<br>O fair reward of trust! My LORD, grant it me to the full! The truster above all men feels himself to be a sinner; and lo, mercy is prepared for him: he knows himself to have no deservings, but mercy comes in and keeps house for him on a liberal scale. O LORD, give me this mercy, even as I trust in Thee!<br><br>Observe, my soul, what a bodyguard thou hast! As a prince is compassed about with soldiery, so art thou compassed about with mercy. Before and behind, and on all sides, ride these mounted guards of grace. We dwell in the center of the system of mercy, for we dwell in Christ Jesus.<br><br>O my soul, what an atmosphere dost thou breathe! As the air surrounds thee, even so does the mercy of thy LORD. To the wicked there are many sorrows, but to thee there are so many mercies that thy sorrows are not worth mentioning. David says, "Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous; and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart." In obedience to this precept my heart shall triumph in God, and I will tell out my gladness. As Thou hast compassed me with mercy, I will also compass Thine altars, O my God, with songs of thanksgiving!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honesty is More than a Policy<br><br>by Rabbi Chaim Dovid Green<br><br>The end of last week's parsha deals with laws regarding the altar which G-d wishes us to use in His service. The beginning of next week's parsha is about the building of the Mishkan, or Tabernacle, which was the focal point of Jewish service of G-d for hundreds of years, and which the Altar was part of. The Tabernacle was replaced by the Holy Temple in Jerusalem which stood on the Temple Mount beyond the Western Wall.<br><br>Rabbi Zalman Sorotzkin notes the seemingly unnecessary insertion of this week's parsha in between last week's and next week's parshios. Mishpatim (the name of this week's parsha) means "laws". Many laws, primarily civil in nature, are discussed in Parshas Mishpatim. It is logical that it follows the portion of Torah in which the Torah was given to the Jewish People. Observance of its laws are its core. Many laws in Mishpatim deal with possession of property, and rights of individuals. Rabbi Sorotzkin remarks that this portion is deliberately placed here to convey the following directive. Whatever a person dedicates to the service of G-d, he must be sure to dedicate through honesty and integrity. Ill-gotten gains are not laundered by offering them to charity. They are despised and unwanted by G-d. This parsha is not an interruption between the description of the altar and the building of the Tabernacle. It is a stipulation that whatever we give - it must be from that which is gained with G-d's blessing and approval.<br><br>What is Torah?<br><br>While we are on the topic of Torah, it is worth while to delineate what Torah is. The source of the 248 positive commandments (do's), and the 365 negative commandments (don't's), is the Pentateuch as it is commonly known. They are known as the Torah in written form (as opposed to oral teachings). The subsequent books of the Scriptures consist of the books of the Prophets, and the Writings. We only derive Torah Commandments from the Pentateuch. The subsequent books are sometimes used as sources which reveal to us how Torah laws were observed, and sources for customs as well, but we don't derive laws from them. There are many other ethical lessons which we derive from the subsequent scriptures. Most importantly, the subsequent scriptures do not come to change or contradict anything which is stated in the Pentateuch. The books which are called "The New Testament" are not part of the Jewish Scriptures, and contradict Jewish tradition.<br><br>In addition to the "Written Torah," is a large body of legal and anecdotal writings know as the Talmud. The Talmud is known as the Oral or Memorized Law. The reason is that it was studied and transmitted orally for over a thousand years until Roman oppression forced the Sages to record it lest it be forgotten. This was initially recorded as the Six Orders of Mishnah. Much of the body of Oral Law was still transmitted orally in the form of explanations of the Mishnah. However, in the subsequent 300 years even the explanations were recorded in the Talmud. Even though Roman oppression made life for the Jews unpredictable and full of suffering, scholarship in Torah study continued. Nevertheless, the difficulties the Jews lived through left their impressions in the form of many interpretational disputes between the students of Torah, as the Romans took away the prerequisite stability which would enable them to transmit and receive the teachings as they had in more peaceful generations.<br><br>The chain of the transmission of Torah has never been broken since the time of Moses. In Yeshivahs spanning the globe students study the texts which have representation from The Scriptures, Post-Biblical scholars, Medieval scholars, and continuing and flourishing until this very day. The codification of the Talmud took place throughout medieval times. The Shulchan Oruch, the work of Rabbi Yosef Karo (16th cent.) deals with laws of everyday life from the blessings we make each day, to the detailed laws of ownership, family purity, and thousands of others. Each generation is blessed with people who continue to become experts in the challenging application of Torah Law in the ever-changing milieu of the generations in which they live. Torah study and publication in all languages is growing by leaps and bounds, and is more and more available to all who wish to take part. It is truly a miracle in the context of the events of this century, and indeed, the events of the diaspora we have found ourselves in for the past 2,000 years.<br><br>We'll end with the words of the prayer which we say at the end of the silent meditation. "May it be Your will (G-d) that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and give our portion in Your Torah." We all have a portion in Torah learning. May we all relate to and find satisfaction in Torah!<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God Delights to Give<br>"And the LORD said unto Abraham, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward, for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever"   (Genesis 13:14-15).<br><br>A special blessing for a memorable occasion. Abram had settled a family dispute. He had said, "Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between thee and me, for we be brethren"; and hence he received the blessing which belongs to peacemakers. The LORD and giver of peace delights to manifest His grace to those who seek peace and pursue it. If we desire closer communion with God, we must keep closer to the ways of peace.<br><br>Abram had behaved very generously to his kinsman, giving him his choice of the land. If we deny ourselves for peace's sake, the LORD will more than make it up to us. As far as the patriarch can see, he can claim, and we may do the like by faith. Abram had to wait for the actual possession, but the LORD entailed the land upon him and his posterity. Boundless blessings belong to us by covenant gift. All things are ours. When we please the LORD, He makes us to look everywhere and see all things our own, whether things present or things to come, all are ours, and we are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Becoming Aware of God<br>Genesis 28:16<br>..."Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it."<br><br>Jacob was forced to flee his family after receiving the blessing of God from his father, Isaac. He ran as a result of his broken relationship with his brother, Esau, who threatened to kill him. He was alone after leaving his family and was sleeping in the wilderness area at Bethel. It is here that Jacob encountered God personally for the very first time. He had a dream in which Heaven was opened up to him. The Lord spoke to him there and gave him a promise to give him the very land on which he was lying.<br><br>This encounter with God made him realize that God was in this place, even though he had not been aware of it. God had to remove Jacob from all that was of comfort to him in order to reveal Himself to Jacob. What began as a crisis that forced him to be removed from his family and friends led to an encounter with the living God and a fresh vision of God's purposes for his life.<br><br>How often we go about our daily routine and fail to recognize that God is in the place where we are. God had to bring Jacob to a place of separation from his old life and remove all his worldly possessions. He was alone with God at Bethel; nothing else could distract him from an encounter that would change his life.<br><br>God often must do radical things in the life of the servant in whom He has special plans: separation from family, removal of physical and emotional resources, an encounter with God. These are often the hallmarks of ownership by God that build a vision into a life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are We Men, Or Are We Angels?<br><br>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br>Does the Torah demand more than a person can deliver? Is it out of touch with human nature? Are we incapable of truly living up to its lofty ideals?<br><br>This week's parsha addresses this question. "Holy people You shall be unto Me etc.," says G-d (Exodus 22:30). Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk (19th cent.) commented on these words as follows. G-d is not lacking administering angels, (And He doesn't expect us to be like them). Rather, G-d wants the holiness of mankind.<br><br>What is mankind's holiness? In one sense it means uniqueness. Being uplifted. How? It's by being in control of one's life. Enjoy life; but don't become a slave to enjoyment. Don't go to the other extreme either. The Torah doesn't require us to reject the material world. Pleasures and possessions can bring us closer to G-d if we are in control of our consumption. Conversely, once we are dedicated to the material world for its sake alone, then we lower ourselves, and we relinquish control. If we are dedicated to a higher ideal, then to the degree that we utilize our physical existence as a means to that end, we have achieved holiness.<br><br>This week's parsha is replete with the many Torah laws governing society. Lending money, responsibilities toward the poor, responsibilities of renters and borrowers, damages, personal injury, and many more can be found.<br><br>The message is: live as a physical being in a physical world, but approach life with an ideal and a goal; with a seriousness. Use physical existence for its intended purpose. That is, as a vehicle; a means to an end, a ladder which is grounded on earth, but climbs aloft into the heavens.<br><br>How does one begin to climb? Our sages give us the prescription. "Torah learning is great, for it is a catalyst for action". Torah study opens the eyes to new perspectives. Torah study shapes attitudes and encourages elevated behavior one rung of the ladder at a time.<br><br>So, is Torah observance beyond humankind? Maybe if we had to be like angels; but that is not the goal. The goal is to live like people - holy people. Through learning with a sincere and serious attitude, we can indeed begin to fulfill the words in this week's reading, "Holy people you shall be unto Me."<br><br>Good Shabbos.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Becoming a Mighty Man<br>1 Samuel 22:2<br>All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.<br><br>Have you ever felt that you could accomplish a whole lot more if you had more talented people around you? Perhaps you are in an office and think that some of your fellow workers don't quite measure up. Imagine what David must have thought in the years following his anointing by the prophet Samuel as the next king of Israel. He spent the next many years running from King Saul. Now God was beginning to bring men to support David. But what kind of men? The down-and-out. God gave David not the elite or the sophisticated; He gave him those who were in debt and discontented with life. David turned those men into the best fighting men of their day. In fact, David never lost a battle during his entire reign as king of Israel-quite a feat for a bunch of no-name, lowlifes! Some of those men became an elite group known as David's Mighty Men. These were the elite of the elite, the Navy Seals, the Few Good Men, the Green Berets. Whatever you call them, they were exceptional warriors.<br><br>Jesus took a few men who weren't exactly the cream of the crop either. He built His life into these men, which resulted in 12 men who turned the world upside down. Are you one of God's mighty men or women? Are you investing your life to build other mighty men or women? David and Jesus set the example of what can be done when we invest in others. God does extraordinary things through men who have an extraordinary God. Ask God to use your life to be a mighty man or woman for a cause greater than yourself. He delights in such prayers.<br><br></div>

So Esau despised his birthright.<br><br>Esau was brother to Jacob. One day he came back from hunting in the fields. He was hungry and tired. His brother Jacob was preparing some stew and Esau asked Jacob for a bowl. Jacob used this time to negotiate for what seems unimaginable-the family birthright.<br><br>Why would Esau take his birthright so lightly? Because he did not understand its value. Every business day countless men and women exchange their birthrights for worldly goods, because they see what the world has to offer as more valuable than what God might offer.<br><br>This is not all their fault. Satan has blinded the minds and hearts of men and women for centuries. He does not want them to know the tremendous gold mine that awaits the child of God. Their inheritance is filled with meaning, purpose, and rewards that await them both here and in Heaven. Satan keeps men and women from seeing the real value of their own godly inheritance.<br><br>Your role as a marketplace Christian is to be the key that unlocks this prison that keeps so many in captivity. You may be the one to reveal the truth that allows them to enter into the inheritance God desires for them.

"When you see the donkey of someone you hate lying under its burden...you must make every effort to help him" (Exodus 23:5). The great Chofetz Chaim, of blessed memory, writes that even though the owner of the donkey is a person of evil deeds who gives us a very good reason to hate him, we are nevertheless commanded to help him. The Chofetz Chaim writes that this applies even if the donkey is carrying something not particularly crucial. Building on this, if the owner was a friend whose donkey was carrying relief packages to a war-torn city, how much more so we would have to help.<br><br>Taking the next step, what if the donkey was carrying badly needed life-saving medicines or oxygen? How great would the obligation be to help? What if the "beast of burden" lying under the load of life-saving medical suppies was a person, and not an animal? Certainly we would not question the need to help in every way possible.<br><br>The Chofetz Chaim concludes that it is certain, then, that when the person "laying under his load" is someone whose responsibility is to provide for people who learn Torah, how great the obligation is to help in every way. The Torah states "because it (The Torah) is your life." Torah is the spiritual sustenance for our souls. Without it we have no life. We must view those who learn it as those who are bringing life, blessing, and favor to the world. May we merit life, blessing, and favor through our support of Torah.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being a Person Under Authority<br>Matthew 8:10<br>..."I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."<br><br>The centurion came to Jesus and told Him of his servant who was paralyzed and in terrible suffering. He came to Jesus because he believed He could heal him. He told Jesus of the matter, and Jesus was willing to come with the centurion. But the centurion would not have it. He knew that Jesus, being under the authority of Heaven itself, did not have to see the servant to help him. The centurion understood authority. He understood that he himself had certain rights that his position granted him to have power over situations and people. He also was a man under authority. The centurion understood Jesus' position and what power that position held in Heaven-the power to heal his servant if He chose to exercise that authority.<br><br>When Jesus saw that the centurion understood this principle of authority and that He did not have to visit the servant to heal him, He acknowledged the centurion's faith. Jesus knew it took great faith to understand authority and whether He had the authority to do what was being asked.<br><br>God has placed a system of authority in our world that requires faith to operate under its boundaries: fathers over sons and daughters, employers over employees, government leaders over the people, church leaders over church members. These are authority structures God has placed in our lives to protect and guide us to His will. Some confuse position with worthiness or qualifications of that position. It is the position that God works through. The fact that an authority may not be a Christian may have no bearing on whether God can work through him as your authority. It is only when that authority counsels against a biblical mandate that we should not follow that person's guidance. The hand of the king is in the hand of God.<br><br>Today, we find few who understand this system of authority God has ordained. It requires great faith to operate in this realm. Yet Jesus said that when we understand this, we demonstrate the kind of faith that He rarely sees. Be a person of rare faith. See the authorities placed in your life as those God is using to protect you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Beyond the Letter of the Law<br>There is a concept in Jewish law and life that is called "lifnim meshurat hadin" - to enter an area beyond the letter of the law. In old English Common Law, there was a parallel legal system to the English courts known as "equity." It was meant to correct the sometimes-unavoidable moral injustices that could be caused by the strict application and narrow construction of the rules of traditional law and justice. In the Torah reading of Mishpatim we are told the laws and the legal system of Israel. But in 'Parshat Yitro' we were first commanded to do "observe the laws and the teachings (of the Torah) and to be taught the path upon which to walk and the behavior that they should follow." The Midrash states that the phrase "the behavior that they should follow" refers to this concept of "lifnim meshurat hadin" - doing more than what one may be held strictly, legally, liable to do. Even though, at first glance, this concept appears to be one of super-righteousness, the Talmud defines this concept as one of legal and societal necessity and not solely one of piety and saintliness.<br><br>The Talmud relates to us an instance when a well-known rabbi and scholar hired day laborers to move barrels for him. The workers were apparently not up to the task, for many of the barrels fell from their hands and shattered in the process of being moved from one place to another. The rabbi was justly disturbed by this turn of events and in order to protect himself in his claim for monetary damages against the workers, he confiscated their coats and cloaks. The workers objected to this seizure of their personal property and they, together with the rabbi/employer, appeared before the rabbinic judge of the town to have the matter adjudicated. The judge ordered the employer to return the seized clothing to the laborers. The rabbi/employer asked the judge, "Is that the law?" The judge replied, "Yes, that is the law!" The workers, heartened by this initial victory, then asked the judge to order the rabbi/employer to pay them their wages - to pay them for their time spent during the day in his employ. The judge did as they requested and ordered the employer to pay them the wage agreed upon. The rabbi/employer complained again, "Is that the law?" The judge reiterated his decision and said firmly, "Yes, that is the law. It is the law of "lifnim meshurat hadin" - of doing what is moral, even if the technicalities of the law do not require it."<br><br>The commentators to the Talmud explain that the employer was held to the standard of "lifnim meshurat hadin" being that he was a well-known Torah scholar and public figure. As far as he was concerned, "lifnim meshurat hadin" had become the actual din, the law itself!<br><br>There is another concept in Torah, enunciated by Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman - Ramban - of sanctifying one's self by refraining from acts which are legally permissible to one but do not engender a sense of holiness and Godly service. Thus, there is room to legitimately follow a higher and stricter sense of kashrut than the basic one that renders the food kosher. One can refrain from physical pleasures that the Torah allows, if one feels that those pleasures will interfere with the quest for greater spiritual growth and that they will weaken eventual adherence to Torah discipline. If this concept of self-sanctification is true, as it is, in the realm of the observance of commandments and personal behavior, the concept of "lifnim meshurat hadin" is its natural companion in the realm of business and inter-personal relationships. It is the means of self-sanctification in the mundane and everyday world of commerce, labor, traffic and shopping. The Rabbis of the Talmud warned us that society could not long exist and prosper in an atmosphere where everyone insists on one's rights to the letter of the law. Courtesy, sensitivity to the feelings and needs of others, the ability to be non-judgmental about others and their apparent behavior, are all aspects of this great concept of "lifnim meshurat hadin."<br><br>This is especially relevant to our current Jewish world (and to the general world that we live in as well) where there is an acute shortage of this necessary Torah attitude. In our democratic societies, where we pride ourselves on the strength of the rule of law, we would be wise to realize that there always is a higher rule of law that is demanded of us. It is only that higher rule of law - "lifnim meshurat hadin" - that guarantees the social harmony of society and allows for a full vision of the peaceful human society that the Torah envisions for humankind.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Beyond the letter of the law...<br><br>Parshas Shekalim<br>The Talmud tells us that in Temple times the collection of the half-shekel "tax" for the support of the Temple services began with the entrance of the month of Adar. Therefore, this coming Shabat is called Shabat Shekalim in remembrance of that fact of ancient Jewish history. The half-shekel was to be assessed "b'shekel hakodesh," by the standard of the holy shekel. The Talmud describes to us in great detail the actual amount of silver required in coin to meet the standard value of the holy shekel. But the Talmud indirectly reminds us that part of the task of Judaism and therefore of necessity of its adherents, the Jews, is to somehow invest a sense of holiness into the shekel - into otherwise grubby money. According to Midrash, Moshe was shown a holy shekel of fire on Sinai. The Jewish understanding of the symbolism of fire has always been that fire is ambivalent - it can burn and destroy or it can light and warm. So too with money. Money can accomplish great good and it also is able to bring about great evil. It can build hospitals and schools and help the needy or it can wreck personal character and corrupt society, government and industry. It finances war and causes violence and cultivates crime and yet it can just as well succor the widow and orphan and save the helpless from disaster. Thus the idea of "shekel hakodesh" exists in our world as strongly as it did in the times of the Temples in Jerusalem. To take the ordinary shekel and transform it into the "shekel hakodesh" is the mission of Torah and Israel.<br><br>There is an entire section of Shulchan Aruch (the Code of Jewish Law) devoted to money and the task of transforming it into the "shekel hakodesh." There are many volumes of Talmud devoted to this issue as well. Judaism sets a minimum standard of human behavior regarding monetary matters that is recorded in these legal tomes. But it also sets a standard of moral behavior that though legally unenforceable is nevertheless necessary in order to attempt to create a more just society - in short, in order to raise money to the level of "shekel hakodesh." This moral standard regarding money is called "lifnim meshurat hadin" - above the minimum face of the law itself. The Talmud saw that one of the spiritual causes of the destruction of the Temples was the lack of willingness to behave "lifnim meshurat hadin." People insisted on their legal rights and were not willing to accommodate others even when morally obligated to do so. A society that does not allow for a moral code of law to accompany the strictly legal code of law eventually turns corrupt and rotten and dooms itself to destruction. The Talmud is replete with examples of "lifnim meshurat hadin" in monetary matters. Money is a great test in life. The rabbis of the Talmud held monetary probity in such high and necessary esteem that groups of people (such as shepherds, for example, who usually grazed their herds on other people's property) who had bad reputations as far as money was concerned were held to be unacceptable as witnesses in Jewish courts of law. A great rabbi once told me that it is far easier to have glatt kosher meat on one's plate than to have glatt kosher money in one's pocket. Sadly, he was right in that assessment. Shabat Shkalim comes to remind us about glatt kosher money.<br><br>Judaism has always stressed the importance of imparting knowledge to its children. But it has stressed even more the teaching of values. In current world society, we speak of the value of money in purely economic and social terms. But there is a value of money in spiritual and holy terms as well. And it is that value of money - the "shekel hakodesh" value - that needs to be addressed in the education of our children and in our own personal and national life. Throughout Jewish history, movements arose to help cleanse the money of the House of Israel from immorality and cupidity. The Mussar movement that originated in Jewish Lithuania in the nineteenth century did wonders in developing a "shekel hakodesh" attitude amongst its adherents. The influence of the Mussar movement was widely felt throughout Jewish society. To a certain extent, even the secular Jewish labor organizations of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also were trying to achieve a "shekel hakodesh" attitude and society, being still based upon the Torah rules and attitudes regarding money that were part of the Jewish psyche and soul over the ages. Improving our attitude towards money is a vital step in rebuilding ourselves spiritually and morally and refocusing our attention towards creating a more just society.<br><br>Shabat Shalom.<br>Rabbi Berel Wein<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sowing in Tears<br>Psalms 126:5<br>Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy.<br><br>The most difficult place to keep moving in faith is the place of extreme pain. Extreme pain, especially emotional pain, can become immobilizing to the human spirit if it is allowed to overcome us. The psalmist tells us there is only one remedy for overcoming painful circumstances that will result in joy. We are to sow in the midst of these times. You cannot do this if you live by feelings alone. It is an act of the will. This act requires that we go outside ourselves in pure faith.<br><br>I learned this principle during one of the deepest periods of my life. I had lost much that was dear to me. A mature man in the faith admonished me to reach out to others in spite of my own pain. "Invest in someone else," he said. I did not realize what a place of healing and comfort that would become.<br><br>"He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with him" (Ps. 126:6). Pain can become a source of joy if we take the first step by planting seed. There is a harvest that will come if we sow in the midst of tears.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Halacha Brings Holiness<br>Judaism is primarily a society of laws and not of men. It is possibly the first society in human history that stressed the primacy of law over the rule of humans, no matter how righteous and benign that rule may be. In Jewish life, law reigns supreme. Judaism is a religion of halacha. Within that field of halacha there is room for opinion and innovation, but there is no possibility to leave that field and decide matters on the basis of personal whim or set agenda.<br><br>The parsha of Mishpatim follows immediately after the parsha that described the giving of the Torah to Israel on Mount Sinai. This juxtaposition is to reinforce this idea of the supremacy of the law in a Torah society. There is no absolute freedom for leaders and rulers to do as they wish, to institute norms that are contrary to the laws and values of the Torah itself. The law of the Torah reigns supreme in Jewish life. There may unfortunately be lawbreakers in Jewish life, just as there are in all societies. But that in no way diminishes the supremacy of Torah law and its discipline on Jews.<br><br>It has been this adherence to law instead of to charismatic and even scholastic human leaders, over the ages, that has kept Judaism rooted in its eternal values and able to weather all of the changing vagaries of fashion and current "political correctness." The halacha in all of its divinity from Sinai is the framework for all Jewish existence and survival. Stepping outside the framework of halacha and attempting thereby to create new norms in Jewish life has always led to disappointment and eventually disappearance and disaster, both on a personal and national level.<br><br>Mishpatim also teaches us, through the wide variety of subject mater covered in the parsha, that there is no area of human life or society that is not governed and shaped by halacha. Judaism is not restricted to the confines of the synagogue or the study hall. It is rather all-pervasive, touching on all aspects of the human condition, physical moral, societal and spiritual. There is no place in life that is empty of Torah, its laws, wisdom and guidance. Its presence therefore in every nook and cranny of our lives is itself what enables us to enjoy and live a truly Jewish life.<br><br>The Torah guarantees our right to privacy and our absolute freedom of choice at any given moment and circumstance in our life. Yet the realization that Torah has something to say about this particular circumstance and situation facing us now, itself serves as a background enabling us to make wise and holy choices. God commanded us to "choose life." In that statement is the implicit instruction to follow halacha and to be truly a people of the book -- the law book that halacha represents.<br><br>In our Torah blessing we state that the Torah plants within us eternal life. Anyone who follows its precepts and lives a life in accordance with Torah values and practices will certainly sense that serene sense of eternity present in halacha and Jewish law. Law brings stability to Sinai. Halacha (Jewish law) brings holiness on its wings.<br><br>Shabat shalom.<br>Rabbi Berel Wein<br><br></div>

Children of alcoholics, orphans who never have parents, loss of parents to a fatal crash, childhood disease-all difficult circumstances to overcome.<br><br>Jephthah was a man who overcame his obstacles and refused to allow his circumstances to prevent him from becoming great in God's sight. He was born to Gilead, a result of his father's adulterous encounter with a prostitute. Gilead's wife bore more sons, decided to reject Jephthah, and drove him away from their home saying, "You are not going to get any inheritance in our family because you are the son of another woman." Imagine the rejection this young man felt as he was cast away from his own family.<br><br>This experience taught Jephthah to become a hardened warrior. Today he probably would have been part of a street gang. As he got older, his reputation as a warrior became known to those in his country-so much so that when the Ammonites made war on Israel, the elders of Gilead went to Jephthah and asked him to be their commander. Jephthah had to fight off those feelings of rejection from previous years.<br><br>"Didn't you hate me and drive me from my father's house?" he responded. He overcame his hurt and pain, and responded to the call God had on his life.<br><br>It is said that if we were to help the butterfly remove itself from the cocoon, the butterfly would not be strong enough to survive. It is the struggle that prepares the butterfly to become strong enough to fly. Without the struggle in the cocoon, it could not survive as a butterfly.<br><br>The Lord prepares each of us in similar ways. Some of our childhoods seem to have been harsh and born from a seemingly unloving God. However, the Lord knows our struggle and will make our life an instrument in His hand if we will follow Him with an upright heart. He does make all things beautiful in His time if we are willing to be patient.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Two-way Relationship<br>Isaiah 50:4<br>He wakens me morning by morning, wakens my ear to listen like one being taught.<br><br>The prophet Isaiah describes his relationship to God as a relationship that has two-way communication. Have you ever felt that your communication with God was only one way-you to Him only? Isaiah tells us, "The Sovereign Lord has given me an instructed tongue, to know the word that sustains the weary....The Sovereign Lord has opened my ears, and I have not been rebellious; I have not drawn back" (Is. 50:4-5).<br><br>The key to Isaiah's relationship with God lies in four important principles:<br><br>He had an instructed tongue. Isaiah had given over rule of his life completely to God's purposes.<br>He knew the word of the Lord, which allowed him to sustain and encourage others.<br>He took time to listen.<br>He did not flee from the tough assignments. He didn't shrink back.<br>If we are to be able to listen to God, we must follow the same principles. Knowing and spending time studying God's Word allows the Holy Spirit to bring to mind His instructions for what He wants for us. Recently, I became very busy in my work and other activities. It wasn't long before I felt distance between God and me. I had to make a conscious decision to carve out more time alone to listen, study, and meditate on His Word. This is the lifeline for the follower of Jesus. When we begin to lose the relationship, we are susceptible to becoming rebellious, going our own way. Invest your life in this relationship so that you may continue to hear His voice and sustain the weary ones around you.<br><br></div>

He began to focus on different priorities and people when he viewed life in these terms.<br><br>James gives us a perspective on viewing tomorrow.<br><br>Now listen, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money." Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, "If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that" (James 4:13-15).<br><br>Life is fragile. Consider where you are investing your time and energies. Someone once said they had never heard anyone on his deathbed say that he wished he had made more money in his lifetime or he wished he had made a certain deal. Usually it is something like, "I wish I had spent more time with my kids."Ask the Lord to give you His priorities for your life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You Have Captured God's Heart<br>by Max Lucado<br><br>Just look at the gifts he has given you: He has sent his angels to care for you, his Holy Spirit to dwell in you, his church to encourage you, and his word to guide you. You have privileges only a fiancÃ©e could have. Anytime you speak, he listens; make a request and he responds. He will never let you be tempted too much or stumble too far. Let a tear appear on your cheek, and he is there to wipe it. Let a love sonnet appear on your lips, and he is there to hear it. As much as you want to see him, he wants to see you more.<br><br>He is building a house for you. And with every swing of the hammer and cut of the saw, heÂ’s dreaming of the day he carries you over the threshold. Â“There are many rooms in my FatherÂ’s house; I would not tell you this if it were not true. I am going there to prepare a place for you. After I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me so that you may be where I amÂ” (John 14:2Â–3).<br><br>You have been chosen by Christ. You are released from your old life in your old house, and he has claimed you as his beloved. Â“Then where is he?Â” you might ask. Â“Why hasnÂ’t he come?Â”<br><br>There is only one answer. His bride is not ready. She is still being prepared.<br><br>Engaged people are obsessed with preparation. The right dress. The right weight. The right hair and the right tux. They want everything to be right. Why? So their fiancÃ©e will marry them? No. Just the opposite. They want to look their best because their fiancÃ©e is marrying them.<br><br>The same is true for us. We want to look our best for Christ. We want our hearts to be pure and our thoughts to be clean. We want our faces to shine with grace and our eyes to sparkle with love. We want to be prepared.<br><br>Why? In hopes that he will love us? No. Just the opposite. Because he already does.<br><br>You are spoken for. You are engaged, set apart, called out, a holy bride. Forbidden waters hold nothing for you. You have been chosen for his castle. DonÂ’t settle for one-night stands in the arms of a stranger.<br><br>Be obsessed with your wedding date. Guard against forgetfulness. Be intolerant of memory lapses. Write yourself notes. Memorize verses. Do whatever you need to do to remember. Â“Aim at what is in heaven . . . Think only about the things in heavenÂ” (Col. 3:1Â–2). You are engaged to royalty, and your Prince is coming to take you home.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Love Based on Nothing<br><br>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"And G-d Spoke to Moses saying: Speak to the Israelites and have them bring me an offering. (Parshas Terumah 25:1,2)<br>The Medrash Tanchuma says: "And have them bring me an offering". That is what the Posuk (Passage) says: "I love you says G-d..... and I love Yaakov, (However) I hate Aisov...." (Malachi 1:2,3)<br><br>Turnus Rufus (A Roman nobleman) once asked Rabbi Akiva; "Why does your G-D hate us, as the Posuk (Passage) says, "And I hate Aisov"?<br><br>Rabbi Akiva asked him to allow him time to answer him until the next day. In the morning Turnus Rufus snidely asked Rabbi Akiva, "What did you dream about and what did you see?" (A sarcastic remark meaning, did you dream up an answer to my question yet?) Rabbi Akiva told him he dreamed he had two dogs, one was names Rufus and the other was called Rufina. Turnus Rufus became incensed and yelled "You called your two dogs by my name and the name of my wife? You are certainly deserving to die for such insolence!" Rabbi Akiva replied; "What difference is there between you and them? You eat and drink and they eat and drink. You procreate and they procreate. You will die and they will die! Do you want to kill me just because I called them by your name! Just imagine G-d's anger with you. G-d has created the heavens and the earth and you take a stick or a stone and you call it "God" Isn't it a valid reason for him to hate you? That is why the Posuk (passage) says And Aisov I hate."<br><br>As with any Medrash we must understand what the Posuk (Passage) in Malachi has to do with our Parsha. What does the love for Yaakov versus the hate for Aisov have do with Parshas Terumah and the taking of money, jewelry etc for the building of the Mishkon/Tabernacle?<br><br>Rabbi Yehuda Aszoud (He was a Rabbi in Seredhell, Hungary, in the 1800's) explains this Medrash by quoting another Medrash that explains the Posuk (Passage) in Malachi. The Medrash says: "I Love Yaakov and I hate Aisov" Aisov said to G-d Why do you love Yaakov? He married two sisters? (Rachel and Leah were sisters and they were both married to Yaakov at the same time. This is considered a forbidden relationship) Aisov continues by saying "Do you want to say *I* am at fault? Then why do you protect him under the shade of your Succah?"<br><br>This set of questions posed by Aisov to G-D need explaining. What does Yaakov's seemingly illegal marriage have to do with anything? What did Aisov mean "Am I at fault?" and to what is he referring when he says to G-d "why protect him under the shade of your Succah". Finally what "Succah" is Aisov referring to?<br><br>There are two kinds of love, explains Reb Yehuda. One is when a person loves another for no reason other than an intrinsic love. There is no objective reason for it. He just loves him. The other kind is when a person loves someone because of some other situation. For example, when everybody else in a community lacks in Middos, good character. However one person, although not of sterling character himself is so much better than anyone else that he is befriended by a good person. However, If the former were to get worse than that, the relationship would end. This person is not loved for who he is, rather he is loved because of the comparison to everyone else around him.<br><br>The love G-d has for Yaakov is baseless, not relative. G-d just loves Yaakov and the Jews for who they are, *not* for what they do. This is in in contrast to the hate G-d has for Aisov. The explanation for this could be, G-d saw our forefathers and saw the purity of their devotion for him and to what extent they were committed to serving him. Because of the commitment shown by Avrohom, G-d made a bris, a "treaty" with him choosing his children as his own chosen people for eternity. This commitment was continued by Yitzchok and G-d renewed his Bris with him. Again Yaakov demonstrated his continued commitment and because of that G-d extended the Bris of Avrohom and Yitzchok to Yaakov's family only. By the power of three generations of commitment to G-d, our national character has been formed into one that is committed to serve G-d. Even when the Jews veer away from the "straight and Narrow" path it is just an aberrance, it is not a character fault in the Jewish character. By virtue of the Middos, the character instilled in us by our forefathers, we are good.<br><br>Aisov on the other hand had rejected the good character displayed by his parents. He abandoned the ways of his fathers and he began his own path and national character. That character however is one that is not intrinsically good. The "personality" of a nation as is ingrained in it by it's forefathers is also demonstrated by the different mitzvos that G-d offered Aisov, Yishmoel and Moav, and their subsequent refusal of Torah. When offering the Torah to the Jews G-d offered it to the other nations. The Medrash specifically tells us about the offer to nations of Aisov, Yishmoel and Moav. G-d asked Aisov, "Will you accept the Torah?" Aisov asked, "What does it say?" "You shall not Murder" G-d answered. Aisov said "our entire existence is based on killing" The same dialogue went on with Yishmoel, The difference being G-d Told he "You shall not steal" and to Moav "You shall not commit adultery". Their answer was the same, "We cannot accept that it goes against our very being" (Moav was born from an incestuous relationship. The angel informed Hagar about Yishmoel's future "On the face of his brothers will he dwell" ). What stopped the nations from accepting the Torah was: accepting the Torah would mean a commitment to change it's personality to keep G-d's bidding. Each nation refused. The Jews, on the other hand were willing to accept anything G-d requested from them.<br><br>Getting back to the explanation of the Medrash. The love for Yaakov is baseless, That is proven by the hatred that G-d has for Aisov. Why does G-d hate Aisov? That is very clear from the story of Rabbi Akiva and Turnus Rufus, we quoted earlier, because Aisov and his children are Idol worshipers. They deny G-d's existence and his authority over everything. However, even though the Jews also had worshipped idols, as they did by the sin of the Golden Calf, G-d still loves them and he forgives their transgressions. (Because as we explained earlier the idol worship was just an aberration. *not* a national character) This we see from the Medrash Tanchuma later in the Parsha that says "Have them bring an offering of *gold* for me to cause forgiveness for the gold they gave towards creating the golden calf." We see G-d gave the Jews a way to attain forgiveness for idol Worship. Historically, during the times of the first Bais Hamikdosh (Holy Temple), the Jews did sin by worshipping idols. However , G-d did not destroy the Jews, he took out his wrath upon the wood and stones of the Bais Hamikdosh, The Holy Temple. That is why the Mishkon/Bais Hamikdosh (The Holy Temple) is called the Mishkon because it was taken for the debt of the Jews. (Note: A mashkon is a item taken to guarantee repayment of a loan. The letters for Mishkon and Mashkon are the same)<br><br>That is what Aisov was complaining to G-d about. Why do you love Yaakov in spite of his transgressions in marrying two sisters? Is it a love only in comparison to me, (Hence the words, "am I the cause?" ) that you love him? However, it is not an intrinsic love? If that is the case then why protect him in the shadow of your Succah, i.e. Why do you grant them forgiveness for the sins of Idol Worship by giving them the protection of the Bais Hamikdosh, the Holy Temple ? Therefore it must be that the love that G-d has for the Jews is an intrinsic love. This love is not based on what we do, rather on who we are.<br><br>Now we can understand the connection between the Posuk (Passage) of: "And have them bring me an offering" and the Posuk (passage) where G-d Contrasts his love for the Jews versus his hate for Aisov. His Love for the Jews is measured by G-d's desire to forgive the Jews for the sin of Idol worship by building the Mishkon.<br><br>May we all merit to see the rebuilding of the Bais Hamikdosh soon.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br>From Without to Within<br><br>They shall make for Me a sanctuary and I will dwell amongst them. (Shemos 25:8 )<br><br>Intersecting the same time zone within these next few weeks we have the holiday of Purim and the building of the Tabernacle. Is there any commonality between these two subjects or are they merely coincidentally occupying the same space if even temporarily? There is an oft repeated question that might help jumpstart the discussion. The verse should have read; I shall dwell in Â“itÂ”. Why does is say, I shall dwell Â“amongst themÂ”?<br><br>I recently heard a moving story about a certain Rebbe that had many followers that came to him for advice and blessings. His personal attendant was a particularly devoted servant who gave selflessly to the Rebbe all his days and nights. This servant suffered from a leg problem that caused him to limp noticeably and only with great effort was he able to move about. In spite of his obvious handicap his heroic dedication was unyielding.<br><br>One day the Rebbe approached this servant and launched a complaint. He told him, Â“I donÂ’t think you believe that I am a truly effective Rebbe!Â” The attendant was shocked and inquired as to where he had fallen short in his service. The Rebbe explained that many people come to ask advice and receive blessings for all kinds of personal and practical matters and that his loyal attendant had never asked him what to do about his own personal health issue. Obviously he didnÂ’t really believe that the Rebbe can be of any help.<br><br>The attendant realized the truth of his RebbeÂ’s words and asked what he should do. The Rebbe invited him to join in the meal to be eaten immediately after Shabbos. At that meal, where it is customary to tell stories of great people the Rebbe called on his loyal servant and asked him to tell a story.<br><br>The servant looked at the Rebbe reluctantly and declared, Â“IÂ’m no story teller! I only know one story that my father told me about how the Baal Shem Tov danced.Â” The Rebbe insisted he tell the story. In the telling of the episode the servant became very animated and started to dance. By-the time he had finished the telling of the story he was walking and moving about normally!<br><br>The point here is not to tell about Â“faith healingÂ” or anything nearly miraculous. What made this man better? He merely emulated, however superficially, the actions of a great person. In doing so he became improved. The Â“Path of the JustÂ” states an important psychological principle, Â“Outward movements awaken a corresponding internality!Â”<br><br>Similarly the Â“Duties of the HeartÂ” declares, Â“Thoughts are shaped by speech!Â” As one speaks or acts so the corresponding inner world is created. These are potent tools for shaping our very beings. Although, it may seem at first inauthentic or disingenuous, results are guaranteed. Also what might be authentic to the external part of our being may be incongruous with our deepest and truest inner yearning.<br><br>Therefore, we need not be surprised that the process of building a Sanctuary actually builds the inner world of its builders. With regard to Purim as well, although the name of The Almighty is conspicuously absent His presence is palpable in deed. Through the animated reading of the Megillah, by describing actions of greatness in the story of all stories, lifeÂ’s most powerful lessons are imbibed like an extra-fine wine and we are all automatically improved from without to within.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terumah<br>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"And G-d spoke to Moshe, saying: Speak to the Children of Israel, that they should take a gift for Me, from every person whose heart moves him you should take My gift... And let them build Me a Sanctuary, and I will dwell in their midst." [25:1-2,8]<br>The Torah obligates us to do many things. Parshas Mishpatim, which we read last week, describes 53 of those obligations (according to the Sefer HaChinuch) - only three other readings contain more Mitzvos than Parshas Mishpatim.<br><br>This week, on the other hand, the call goes out to those of a generous heart, to go beyond their obligations. The first Mitzvah in our parsha concerns the result of the donations - to build the Sanctuary. There was no commandment to give. The beginning of our parsha does not say "Speak to the Children of Israel, that they shall give..." - rather, the Abarbanel says that the verse is speaking to the Gabbai, the collector, who was to take the gifts of those whose hearts moved them. The gifts themselves were completely voluntary.<br><br>The verse uses the expression "asher yidvenu libo," which we translated as "whose heart moves him." Rav Shimshon Raphael Hirsch says that the word "yidvenu" means to inspire, or even to prod (actually, the translator from German used the word "incite," but its connotations are usually negative). This, according to Rabbi Hirsch, denotes the highest level of free will and choice.<br><br>The Ohr HaChaim says that when we know a person is a "Nediv Lev," that he (or she) has a generous heart which moves him to give, we cannot argue with him or try to determine the amount which we will be given. On the contrary, when we know a person is generous, we know that he will do what he can. G-d Himself testifies that this is "My gift" - this is what the personcan do.<br><br>According to the Ohr HaChaim, the verse is also telling us that something can only be called a "Trumasi," My - G-d's - gift, if it comes from the heart - from the internal motivation of the heart to give. And the Bais HaLevi tells us that no one profits from the giving, more than the giver himself or herself. The Bais HaLevi says the verse uses "take" rather than "give" because the donor is the one who benefits. All the money and the worldly possessions which we gather for ourselves, we pass on to others - while the money which we give to charity, to support the poor and needy, to support Torah learning and Jewish growth, this is money which we invest in ourselves. The Tzror HaMor says the same thing - and this, he says, is why the verse says to "take," because the donor is really receiving as much as he or she is giving.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Give &amp; Take<br>Volume 2 Issue 19<br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>After an entire portion filled with commandments regarding man's obligation toward his fellow man, the Torah focuses on a very spiritual aspect of our existence. Hashem commands His nation to build a Tabernacle in which He would figuratively dwell. Thus the Torah begins this week's portion with a mainstay of Jewish life -- the appeal.<br><br>The Torah instructs the Jewish nation to contribute gold, silver, and an array of other materials to the great cause of erecting and furnishing a Mishkan (Tabernacle). However the appeal is worded very strangely. Hashem does not ask the people to give; he asks them to take. Exodus 25:2: "Speak to the children of Israel and let them take a portion for me." The question is obvious. Why does the Torah tell the people to take a portion when in essence they are giving a portion? What is the message behind the semantic anomaly?<br><br>Max and Irving went fishing on an overcast afternoon. About two hours into their expedition a fierce storm developed. Their small rowboat tossed and tossed and finally flipped over into the middle of the lake. Max, a strong swimmer, called to save Irving, but to no avail. Irving did not respond to any plea and unfortunately drowned. Max swam to shore to break the terrible news to Irving's poor wife.<br><br>"What happened?" she screamed. "Tell me the whole story!"<br><br>Max recounted the entire episode in full detail.<br><br>"But what did you do to try to save my Irving?" she shrieked. Max explained once again. "I kept screaming to your husband, 'Irving, give me your hand -- give me your hand -- Give me your hand! But Irving just gave me a blank stare and drifted away."<br><br>"You fool!" shouted the widow. "You said the wrong thing. You should have said, 'take my hand.' Irving never gave anything to anybody!".<br><br>We often make the same mistake that Irving made. When we hear the word "give" we recoil. In its first solicitation, the Torah is teaching us a lesson. When you give with true heart, you are not giving anything away. You are taking a share for yourself. Materialistic pleasures in which many people indulge are eventually digested and forgotten. The new cars become old ones, the glorious homes fall to disrepair, and the newest gizmos become outdated. The only items that remain are those that we give. They remain in a storehouse of merits and eventually will repay us and our descendants. The Montefiores and the Rothschilds are not forever cherished for opulence and indulgence. They are remembered for their great benevolence and charity. They not only gave for eternity. They received for eternity as well<br><br></div>
