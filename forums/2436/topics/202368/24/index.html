            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Potentially</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Raymond Beyda<br>They were unable to answer him because they were frightened of him (Beresheet 45:3)<br><br>The climactic revelation of Yosef to his brothers shocked them into a speechless stupor. They feared repercussions for the heartlessness they showed on the day they sold him to a caravan headed for Egypt. Â“What would the Viceroy of Egypt do to them now?Â” was the question that filled their hearts with fear. That is the surface explanation of their concern. However, the Midrash reveals to us a more perceptive perspective on the moment that highlights the multi-week Torah portion tale of Yosef and his brothers.<br><br>Abba Cohen Bardela said: Â“Woe is to us from the day of judgment! Woe is to us from the day of reproof! Yosef was the youngest of the tribes and they were not able to withstand his reproof. When The Holy One Blessed Be He will reprove each and every one according to who he is- how much more frightening it will be!Â” ( Beresheet Rabbah 33:17)<br><br>What does the Midrash mean to convey by the superfluous phrase Â”According to who he is?Â” Would we expect the perfect judgment of Hashem to be based on something other than who the person is? Of course Hashem judges an individual according to his actions and not the behavior of his friend.<br><br>Many people fail in life because they see the talents and the success of others around them and lose their self-esteem. Sometimes they will justify a lack of achievement by stating, Â“I donÂ’t have the quick mind of Jack or the organizational skills of Sarah.Â” The flaw with this excuse is that they began by measuring their own ability to succeed against someone elseÂ’s G-d-given talents. The correct road to success is to measure against oneself Â– Â“according to who he isÂ” not someone else.<br><br>There was a great Rabbi named Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Berlin ztÂ’l, better know as the Netziv. When he published his first work Ha-amek She-elah he made a big celebration. His face was beaming and his ecstasy apparent to all attendees. Someone inquired, Â“Why are you so happy?Â”<br><br>Â“When I was 11 years oldÂ”, he replied Â“I was a failing student. My father told my mother that he thought it would be best if he took me to learn a trade as an apprentice for a shoemaker or a tailor. Fortunately I lay awake I in my bed that night and I overheard their conversation. I jumped out of bed and pleaded for a chance to prove that I could succeed in Torah studies. My father agreed and from that night forward I worked hard, applied myself and have been blessed with great success.<br><br>Â“ImagineÂ”, he continued, Â“if I had not overheard my fatherÂ’s plan. I would have been an upstanding observant tradesman. I would pray with a minyan, attend certain classes and do my share of hesed and mitzvot. After 120 years I would go before the Heavenly court and proudly defend my simple performance of Torah law. Then they would ask ,Â’and where is the Ha-amek She-elah?Â’.<br><br>Â‘What is that?Â’, I would reply.<br><br>Â‘The book you were sent to Earth to writeÂ’.<br><br>Â‘Write? I am a simple shoemaker. I canÂ’t write a sefer on Torah.Â’<br><br>Â‘Who says so? What did you do with your potential? What did you do with your life?Â’<br><br>Â‘Now that I have written the book I know I will be able to answer that all- important question. That is why I am so happy todayÂ’<br><br>Every person will be judged based on his or her individual mission. Each is given the tools and equipment to successfully do their custom made job in life. Those that maximize their potential are considered successes and those who fall short will be held accountable. You will be called a success if you do more than your friend. You will not fail the test if you do not accomplish quantitatively as much as your neighbor. You will be judged according to who you are. At the end of the day everyone is judged by their score in maximizing their potential.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>YOUR success will be measured against how well you fulfilled YOUR potential. </strong></span><br><br>Shabbat Shalom<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"And Yosef said to his brothers: 'I am Yosef! Is my father still alive?' And his brothers could not answer him, because they were stunned before him." [45:3]<br><br>When we look at the readings of the last two weeks, leading to this one, says Rabbi Asher Rubenstein, we see an underlying theme of these readings: "G-d runs the world." People make plans, but what actually happens is controlled from above.<br><br>Why did Yosef's brothers plot to kill him, and then decide to sell him into slavery? "Let's see what becomes of his dreams!" [37:20]<br><br>What action set the process in motion -- the process through which the dreams came to reality? Selling Yosef into slavery! They tried to fight the Divine Plan, and instead caused its fulfillment.<br><br>Then, when they came down to Egypt during the years of famine, Yosef recognized them -- and saw that they did not recognize him. "And Yosef remembered the dreams which he had dreamed to them, and he said to them 'you are spies, who have come to see the vulnerability of the land!'" [42:9]<br><br>Now, why did the dreams cause Yosef to accuse them of spying? Very simple: the dreams told him that all 11 brothers would bow to him -- and Benyamin was not with them. Yosef realized that he should not fight The Plan, but go in accordance with it. And that meant causing Benyamin to come down to Egypt as well.<br><br>So he accuses them of spying, and they respond -- no, we are not spies, we are all brothers -- "the youngest brother is with our father today, and one is missing." And Yosef responds, "exactly as I said, you are spies!" And then he gives them an opportunity to prove that they are not: "your youngest brother must come here." Of course, this makes perfect sense. This will prove that they are not spies -- after all, everyone knows that spies don't have little brothers! "If you are Canaanites, one brother will stay in prison here, and you go bring your little brother to me, and prove your words..." [42:19-20] This is exactly what it says!<br><br>It is ridiculous -- and the brothers recognize it. They see that this could not be a random event. They recognize that it has something to do with their guilt because of their brother. But they still do not understand why these events are happening...<br><br>...until "I AM YOSEF!"<br><br>Suddenly, what had been an impenetrable fog is brilliantly clear. Everything that had happened was all part of The Plan. This is what Yosef tells them: "You did not send me here. G-D sent me here! When you thought that you were fighting The Plan, you were fulfilling it!"<br><br>In our lives, we so often do not understand The Plan. We don't recognize what is happening, or why. But we need to know Who is ultimately in charge, and recognize that He has our best interests in mind.<br><br>There is a terrific story that Rabbi Hanoch Teller recounts in one of his books, about a businessman returning to New York from a trip to Chicago. This person was always very punctual, so he was in the waiting area well in advance of his flight. There was also a Rabbi there, obviously from a school in Israel.<br><br>Suddenly the Rabbi jumped to his feet, his face ashen. "What is wrong?" asked the businessman, who we'll call Moshe.<br><br>"My case! I've been here fundraising for my yeshiva, and my case has over $20,000 in it -- and I left it in my room!"<br><br>Moshe was very familiar with the city, and knew that if he would help they might be able to pick up the case and get back in time for the flight -- without him, the Rabbi (who had never been to Chicago before) was unlikely to succeed. So, anxious as he was to return to New York on time, he ran out with the Rabbi. "In the merit of this mitzvah I am doing, G-d will help me," he said to himself.<br><br>Yet when they grabbed a taxi, zoomed across town, grabbed the case, and raced back to the plane -- they found themselves stopped at the gate. The plane was already pulling away, without them!<br><br>Moshe was obviously disappointed -- not simply because he had missed the flight, but because he really thought he would merit HaShem's help. After all, he had left only in order to do a mitzvah.<br><br>Before leaving the airport, he stopped to call home. He couldn't get through -- the line was busy. Five minutes later, he finally heard a ring at the other end.<br><br>"Honey, I'm so sorry -- I missed the flight, and won't be ho..."<br><br>"MOSHE! Moshe, you're ALIVE! The plane... it crashed..."<br><br>Good Shabbos,<br><br>Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by Rabbi Yaakov Menken<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"Then Yehudah approached him..." [44:18]<br><br>The Alshich asks, why is Yehudah arguing with Yosef all of a sudden, at the beginning of our parsha? Just moments earlier, Yehudah had said, "we will be servants to my master, all of us, including he in whose hand the goblet was found." [44:16] To which Pharoah's viceroy, Yosef, responded: "the man in whose hand the goblet was found, he will be my servant, and you will go up in peace to your father."<br><br>It should be obvious that Yehudah has nothing to say. He offered to have all the brothers become slaves, to which Yosef responded that he only wanted the guilty party! How can Yehudah suddenly jump up now, and oppose this arrangement?<br><br>The Alshich answers that we have this question because we look at matters only in physical terms. Yehudah, however, lived his life on a more spiritual plane. The brothers had come to the realization that they had wronged Yosef, and that they deserved a punishment. They had examined their actions, and concluded that the bizarre treatment that they were receiving from the viceroy could only be for this reason. "Then they said to one another, 'it is because we are guilty for our brother, because we saw his heartfelt pain when he begged us, and we did not listen -- this is why this pain has come upon us.'" [42:21] And thus they were prepared to accept their punishment for the sale of Yosef, and become slaves.<br><br>This is why Yehudah said, "what can we say, and how can we justify ourselves -- G-d has found the sin of your servants." [44:16] He was not talking about the stolen goblet, because he knew that they were "framed," and of course G-d had found no such crime. It was because of their brother, whom they sold.<br><br>If Benyamin were included when they were all made slaves to Pharoad, they understood that it might be punishment for something else, or afford him some benefit. All of this, however, would not explain Benyamin -- the one brother who was in no way involved with the sale of Yosef -- going into slavery, alone. That made no sense. Yehudah immediately realized that this was not a punishment for the sale of Yosef, after all. It was just a run-of-the-mill false accusation! And this is why he reversed himself and argued with Yosef in strong language.<br><br>Yehudah realized that no one can have any power against us unless G-d makes it so. And therefore he knew to look for the spiritual roots of problems first, and face the _real_ problem, not the "cover" which faced him<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Parshas Vayigash - Family Values<br><br>by Rabbi Dovid Green<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This week's parsha is the dramatic climax of the story of Yoseif and his brothers. First, they sell him as a slave to Egypt. Afterwards, Yoseif achieves phenomenal success in his position, only to end up in prison for 12 years, accused of a crime he didn't commit. Then again he goes from the despair of prison to become Prime Minister of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh. Now Yoseif's brothers are standing before him, and they don't even know he is Yoseif. They reluctantly brought Binyomin as he requested, and now Binyomin is accused of stealing Yoseif's silver cup, and the punishment is that he must remain in Egypt as his slave.<br><br>Yehudah committed himself to bring Binyomin back to his father Yaakov, and as a result, he enters into a dialogue with Yoseif with the goal of convincing Yoseif to take him in exchange for Binyomin.<br><br>At the end of Yehudah's request, Yoseif is moved. He can no longer conceal his identity. He sends everyone else out, and only he and his brothers remain. "I am Yoseif, is my father still alive?" "And his brothers could not answer him, because they were devastated before him."<br><br>The Talmud in Tractate Chagiga (4b) states as follows. "When Rabbi Elazar came to this passage he cried...'if the rebuke of people is such (that Yoseif's brothers were so devastated by his rebuke), the rebuke of G-d, how much more so'."<br><br>Rabbi Avraham Pam, the Rosh Yeshiva of Torah Vodaas, asks, what was Yoseif's rebuke to his brothers? Didn't he just say "I am Yoseif"? Rav Pam quotes the Maharsha's answer that the brothers were devastated by the thought of what they expected to come next, namely his rebuke for what they did to him. They were embarrassed that they could not bear his rebuke.<br><br>Rav Pam also quotes the Bais HaLevi who answers that Yoseif's subsequent words were his rebuke. "Is my father still alive?" That is to say: is it possible that after all of the pain you caused my father by selling me to Egypt, that he is still alive?<br><br>Rav Pam offers his own explanation of what Yoseif's rebuke was. "I am Yoseif." I'm the Yoseif that you hated and denigrated. You didn't consider who I really might be. You didn't think that my dreams would be completely fulfilled. You never imagined that I would end up being the Prime Minister of Egypt! In your wildest dreams you never thought that I would be G-d's messenger to save the entire land with food during these years of famine!! Can you imagine that you sold such a person as a slave, with such a mission in life!!<br><br>Rav Pam quotes the Talmud (Tractate Bava Basra 10b) which states that Yoseif, son of Rabbi Yehoshua, saw the next world, and said "I saw a reverse world, the higher-ups were low, and the low were high." It means that the things we place value on in this world are the opposite of what has true value according to the view in the world of truth.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rav Pam concludes that the lesson to us is that in our view of others, and in our view of ourselves, we need to understand that we often attribute much less worth than what is truly there. We often treat others with much less respect than what is due them. Imagine how we will feel when we see how special these people really are! </span><br><br>When we stop to think about Rav Pam's insightful words, and consider who we most need to apply them to, many will agree that it is to those we are closest to. We should take to heart that our family members; our parents, our spouses, our siblings, and our children often bear the brunt of an under-evaluation of their true worth. Let us take these words to heart. In the future when we will see their true worth in terms of the bigger picture, we will be glad we made our efforts to treat them as they truly deserve.<br><br>Good Shabbos.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Label Lam<br><strong>Is He Still my Father? </strong><br>When I was a child I remember having heard a few hundred times a story book about a little bird who fell from the nest and was asking every creature large and small, "Are you my mother?" I think that was the title too. Years later, I think I have a deeper insight into the childlike plot.<br><br>A grade school teacher in Israel asked his class a question from this week's Torah portion and received and unusual answer from an unlikely source. Why did Yosef ask his brothers after revealing his true identity, "Is my father still alive?" Yehuda was pleading for mercy on Binyamin on the basis that their father's health would be in grave jeopardy if anything happened to the boy. Yosef could not have been told more directly about his father's status. Why had he made that his question after years of personal silence?<br><br>The class was silent. Nobody could conjure a reasonable explanation till little Shimon in the back of the class raised his hand confidently. Everybody was amazed. Shimon was usually quiet and despondent. He never volunteered an answer or asked any questions. His grandparents had deposited him there after they had gained custody of the boy. His father had abandoned home and his mother was not in a position to care for the child. No wonder little Shimon was usually mentally absent while others were actively participating in the give and take of the classroom.<br><br>This time was different, as everyone else sat quietly and Shimon, to the amazement of all, was waving his hand with enthusiasm. The Rebbe called on him and he answered, "Maybe what Yosef meant to ask was not if Yaakov was alive but rather is my father still alive? Does he still think about me? Is he still my father?"<br><br>Yosef in Egypt was at the end of his personal exile. He understood with great clarity that Yaakov was still alive but was he still "his father". At the climax of the complete Egypt experience, two hundred and ten years later, The A-lmighty thundered into the ears of the entire nation, "I Am Hashem your G-d who took you out of the land of Egypt." As much as these words carry the mandate of knowing that G-d is a reality, the greater message, perhaps, is concretizing the idea of a personal G-d. Hashem is your G-d. He took you out of Egypt. He cares about you.<br><br>The bigger pain to the Jew in the dark period of our history called the Holocaust was felt after the German planted his boot in the Jew's stomach and then asked him, "Where is your G-d Jew?"<br><br>There are many amongst our people who if asked point blank, "Do you believe in G-d?" would likely say, "Yes!" Just as Yosef, at the end of his torment, evidence abounded about the existence of "a father", but the question of his heart, as little Shimon was able to explain from his unique perspective was "Is he still my father? Does he care about me?"<br><br>Now I understand a little better that old book my mother read me hundreds of times. The bird knows he must have a mother, he just doesn't know who it is. He's out of his element on the jungle floor. He's dislocated from his precious nest.<br><br>Shortly after Yosef gives articulation to the question that had troubled his heart for twenty-two years, he was reunited with his father. The verse describes how Yosef fell on his father's shoulder and cried. What was Yaakov doing? The sages tell us he was saying Shema Yisrael, Listen Israel Hashem is our G-d, Hashem is One!<br><br>Why was he doing that particular mitzvah at that time? Perhaps, as Yaakov felt the overwhelming emotion of being finally reunited with his estranged son Yosef, he could begin to approximate the feeling, so to speak, of the A-lmighty when one of his lost children returns to Him. Leaning on the cosmic shoulder as the bird, returning to his nest or as the child who has found the caring parent is still a caring parent.<br><br>Good Shabbos!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is Anything Too Hard for God?<br>Genesis 18:12<br>So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, "After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?"<br><br>God had promised Abraham and Sarah a son who would be the seed of a whole nation. Sarah was now beyond childbearing years. So when some angels from God paid Abraham and Sarah a visit to inform them that Sarah was going to have a child, she happened to be listening outside the tent and erupted with laughter. The thought seemed preposterous to her. The angels reminded her that nothing is impossible with God. "Is anything too hard for the Lord? I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son" (Gen. 18:14). Sarah gave birth to Isaac as foretold.<br><br>Recently, I was considering putting on another marketplace-leader summit for ministry leaders who minister to those in the workplace. I had been involved in such an event a year earlier. My friend Gunnar Olson, who is the founder of the International Christian Chamber of Commerce of Sweden, had been involved with me in putting on the first event, so I inquired whether he would be willing to participate in the second event. He wrote me an e-mail letter informing me that an international gathering of Christian marketplace leaders would be taking place on the island of Cyprus in March and asked if I could postpone my event and instead participate in an event in Cyprus and invite other leaders. My initial response was laughter due to my current financial condition. In fact, I had to go to a map to see just where this place was.<br><br>The following day I received a call from a man I had met only 30 days earlier. We had not discussed this event in March. "What are you doing tomorrow? I would like you to go to the airport with me to pick up a missionary whom I want you to meet. We'd like to propose an idea to you. Can you come?"<br><br>"Sure," I said.<br><br>The next day he picked me up and informed me that we were picking up a missionary who was flying in from Cyprus. "We are planning to take 25 businesspeople to Cyprus for an event that Gunnar Olson is involved in and would like you to come and teach your Esau-to-Joseph workshop the day before. We will cover your expenses. Would you be interested in doing this?" Again, I had to laugh as I saw the hand of God orchestrate in such a miraculous way and in such a timely manner to assure me of His involvement in the new directions in my life.<br><br>Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God" (Mark 10:27).<br><br>Are there things that make you laugh when you think of the miracle that would be required for it to take place? Ask God for the miracle you need today.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong>Supply Side Diplomatics</strong><br>After Yaakov's passing the brothers were worried. After all, Yoseph was the ruler of Egypt and their father Yaakov was now gone. And so the Torah tells us at the end of this week's portion, "Yoseph's brothers perceived that their father was dead, and they said, 'Perhaps Joseph will nurse hatred against us and then he will surely repay us all the evil that we did him.' So they instructed that Joseph be told, 'Your father gave orders before his death, saying: 'Thus shall you say to Joseph - 'O please, kindly forgive the spiteful deed of your brothers and their sin for they have done you evil; so now. please forgive the spiteful deed of the servants of your father's G-d."<br><br>The Torah continues by telling us that "Yoseph wept when they spoke to him. His brothers themselves also went and flung themselves before him and said, "We are ready to be your slaves. But Joseph said to them, "Fear not, for am I instead of G-d? Although you intended me harm, G-d intended it for good - in order to accomplish -- it is as clear as this day -- which a vast people be kept alive. So now, fear not -- I will sustain you and your young ones.' Thus he comforted them and spoke to their heart." (See Genesis 50 15-21)<br><br>Yoseph seems very benevolent. He committed himself to sustain his brothers, despite their having sold him into a life of slavery. Yet, maybe they truly wanted some form of retribution. After all it is quite hard to bear the burden of guilt for the rest of your life, and if that is the case, perhaps Yoseph's benevolence may have defeated the purpose of their request.<br><br>An old yarn that I heard as I was still unmarried has the wealthy father of the prospective bride interviewing her suitors before they got a chance to meet her.<br><br>Each one of the young men who discussed their anticipated financial plans was rebuffed.<br><br>One said that he would be going to medical school another was going to law school, and yet a third was waiting for an inheritance that would come any day. Each eager beau was barraged with a series of questions about the details of his future life and none had the proper answer.<br><br>Finally, a young Yeshiva fellow came to see the tycoon's daughter. After talking to the young man for twenty minutes, the man was beaming. He proudly introduced the prospective groom to his daughter with the highest recommendation.<br><br>His wife and assistants were all astounded. What had this young man said that the others had not?<br><br>The man was still beaming when he repeated the conversation. "When I asked him where he plans to live when he first gets married he replied, 'G-d will provide!' When I asked him how he plans to feed a family if he is sitting and studying he looked at me and declared, 'G-d will provide!' When I asked when there are children, how does he plan to pay for their education and welfare, he beamed once again and exclaimed, 'G-d will provide!'"<br><br>The man's entire household was baffled. "Why do those responses please you so much?"<br><br>The man smiled as he puffed out his chest, "He thinks I'm G-d!"<br><br>It is said that Yoseph Dov HaLevi Soleveitchik of Brisk once remarked in wit that Yoseph was telling the brothers, "If you are afraid of retribution, I will provide you with the sweetest revenge. I will be your sole source of support and you will have to rely upon me for your sustenance."<br><br>The Talmud in Beitzah 32 states, "R. Natan ben Abba also said in the name of Rav: If someone is dependent on someone else's table, the world looks dark to him, for it says, "He wanders about for food-where is it?- he realizes that the day of darkness is ready, at hand" (Job 15:23). The Rabbis taught: One of three whose life is no life, is a person who is dependent on someone else for his meals."<br><br>And so, Yoseph was telling his brothers, perhaps I will not employ physical retribution but perhaps your greatest punishment will be that your livelihood will be dependent on the little brother you thought was only worthy of a place in a pit. In the Grace After Meals we beseech the Almighty, "Please do have us rely upon the gifts of flesh and blood, but rather sustain us from Your hand." To live a life dependent upon others is no blessing. So according to this insight, Yoseph gave them something the brothers may really have asked for - the sweetest and most benevolent punishment they could have desired.<br><br>Good Shabbos,<br><br>Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Stand &amp; Deliver</strong><br><br>by Rabbi Mordechai Kamenetzky<br>This week the Book of Braishis ends. Yaakov (Jacob) summoned his son Yoseph (Joseph) and discussed final arrangements with him. He asked to be transported to Chevron and to be interred in the same cave as his father, mother, and grandparents. Yoseph returned home and an unprecedented event occurred. Yaakov took ill. He is the first human that the Torah records as getting sick. Yoseph was informed and quickly hurried to his father's bedside. The Torah tells us that when Yoseph was announced, "Israel (Jacob) exerted himself and sat up on the bed" (Genesis 48:2). Yoseph enters the room and Yaakov proceeded to recount major events of his life to him. Yaakov talked about his divine revelations and the blessings that the Almighty bestowed upon him. He discussed the death of Rachel and explained why he buried her in Bethlehem and not Hebron. Then Yaakov proceeded to bless his beloved son Yoseph's children in a unique manner. He designates Yoseph's children as shevatim (tribes) with equal rights and inheritance as his other sons.<br><br>One portion of the episode needs clarification. The Torah is usually short on detail. Why then does the Torah tell us that when Yoseph walked in Yaakov exerted himself and sat up in bed? Why is that significant? Who cares if he sat up or lay down? If he was able to sit, why should he not? And if it was very difficult for him to sit up, why did he? And isn't what Yaakov said more relevant than how he said it?<br><br>Rashi explains that the seemingly supplementary detail teaches us a lesson. A father whose son has risen to power must show respect. It may have been quite difficult for Yaakov to sit, however it was important. One must show respect for royalty, even if it is his own child who has risen to power. I'd like to analyze the incident from another angle.<br><br>American historian Paul F. Boller Jr. relates the following story: At noon on January 1st 1863, the final draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was placed in front of Abraham Lincoln. He stared intensely at it as it lay before him on his desk. He picked up his pen to sign it, and was about to dip the quill into the ink when he hesitated and put his arm down. He paused, closed his eyes, and began the process again. Determinedly he picked up the quill, dipped it in the ink, and put it down. With a grim face he turned to Secretary of State William N. Seward and said, "My hands have been shaking since nine o'clock this morning. My right hand is almost paralyzed. If I am ever to go down into history, it will be for this act. My whole self is in it. However, if my hand trembles when I sign this proclamation, whoever examines it will say hereafter, 'he hesitated'".<br><br>With that, the President mustered his strength, dipped the quill into the ink, and slowly but resolutely signed in perfect form -- Abraham Lincoln.<br><br>As he lay on his deathbed, Yaakov Avinu was about to perform an unprecedented act. He was about to bestow the title of shevatim, tribes, to his grandchildren Ephraim and Menashe. This was an honor only relegated to his own children. Then he blessed them with words that were destined to become the hallmark of paternal blessings for generations to come. "By you shall (the children of) Israel bless their children - May G-d shall make you like Ephraim and Menashe. Thus shall be your children."<br><br>Those were not blessings that could be endowed in a prone position. As weak as Yaakov was, he knew that the future of two young tribes lay in the strength of his blessing. He wouldn't give it lying down. Yaakov Avinu knew that any sign of weakness that he would convey in transferring that most important message would be recognized for eternity. He mustered his strength and sat up to give that blessing that would wax eternal. Execution of great actions needs great strength and fortitude. Our forefather Yaakov knew that just as there are things you can't take lying down, there are also many things, namely greatness and blessing, that you cannot give lying down.<br><br></div>

"Having loved": here was the wonder! That He should ever have loved men at all is the marvel. What was there in His poor disciples that He should love them?<br>What is there in me? But when He has once begun to love, it is His nature to continue to do so. Love made the saints "his own"--what a choice title! He purchased them with blood, and they became His treasure. Being His own, He will not lose them. Being His<br>beloved, He will not cease to love them. My soul, He will not cease to love thee!<br><br>The text is well as it stands: "to the end." Even till His death the ruling passion of love to His own reigned in His sacred bosom. It means also to the uttermost. He could not love them more: He gave Himself for them. Some read it, to perfection. Truly He lavished upon them a perfect love, in which there was no flaw nor failure, no unwisdom, no unfaithfulness. Such is the love of Jesus to each one of His people.

The year is very old, and here is a promise for our aged friends; yes, and for us all, as age creeps over us. Let us live long enough, and we shall all have hoar hairs; therefore we may as well enjoy this promise by the foresight of faith. When we grow old our God will still be the I AM, abiding evermore the same. Hoar hairs tell of our decay, but He decayeth not. When we cannot carry a burden and can hardly carry ourselves, the LORD will carry us. Even as in our young days He carried us like lambs in His bosom, so will He in our years of infirmity. He made us, and He will care for us. When we become a burden to our friends and a burden to ourselves, the LORD will not shake us off, but the rather He will<br>take us up and carry and deliver us more fully than ever.

            <div class='col-md body'>John 7:37<br>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, if any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink.<br><br>Patience had her perfect work in the Lord Jesus, and until the last day of the feast He pleaded with the Jews, even as on this last day of the year He pleads with us, and waits to be gracious to us. Admirable indeed is the longsuffering of the Saviour in bearing with some of us year after year, notwithstanding our provocations, rebellions, and resistance of His Holy Spirit. Wonder of wonders that we are still in the land of mercy! Pity expressed herself most plainly, for Jesus cried, which implies not only the loudness of His voice, but the tenderness of His tones. He entreats us to be reconciled. "We pray you," says the Apostle, "as though God did beseech you by us." What earnest, pathetic terms are these! How deep must be the love which makes the Lord weep over sinners, and like a mother woo His children to His bosom! Surely at the call of such a cry our willing hearts will come. Provision is made most plenteously; all is provided that man can need to quench his soul's thirst. To his conscience the atonement brings peace; to his understanding the gospel brings the richest instruction; to his heart the person of Jesus is the noblest object of affection; to the whole man the truth as it is in Jesus supplies the purest nutriment. Thirst is terrible, but Jesus can remove it. Though the soul were utterly famished, Jesus could restore it. Proclamation is made most freely, that every thirsty one is welcome. No other distinction is made but that of thirst. Whether it be the thirst of avarice, ambition, pleasure, knowledge, or rest, he who suffers from it is invited. The thirst may be bad in itself, and be no sign of grace, but rather a mark of inordinate sin longing to be gratified with deeper draughts of lust; but it is not goodness in the creature which brings him the invitation, the Lord Jesus sends it freely, and without respect of persons. Personality is declared most fully. The sinner must come to Jesus, not to works, ordinances, or doctrines, but to a personal Redeemer, who His own self bare our sins in His own body on the tree. The bleeding, dying, rising Saviour, is the only star of hope to a sinner. Oh for grace to come now and drink, ere the sun sets upon the year's last day! No waiting or preparation is so much as hinted at. Drinking represents a reception for which no fitness is required. A fool, a thief, a harlot can drink; and so sinfulness of character is no bar to the invitation to believe in Jesus. We want no golden cup, no bejewelled chalice, in which to convey the water to the thirsty; the mouth of poverty is welcome to stoop down and quaff the flowing flood. Blistered, leprous, filthy lips may touch the stream of divine love; they cannot pollute it, but shall themselves be purified. Jesus is the fount of hope. Dear reader, hear the dear Redeemer's loving voice as He cries to each of us, "If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink."<br><br>Charles Suprgeon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2 Samuel 2:26<br>Knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?<br><br>If, O my reader! thou art merely a professor, and not a possessor of the faith that is in Christ Jesus, the following lines are a true ketch of thine end. You are a respectable attendant at a place of worship; you go because others go, not because your heart is right with God. This is your beginning. I will suppose that for the next twenty or thirty years you will be spared to go on as you do now, professing religion by an outward attendance upon the means of grace, but having no heart in the matter. Tread softly, for I must show you the deathbed of such a one as yourself. Let us gaze upon him gently. A clammy sweat is on his brow, and he wakes up crying, "O God, it is hard to die. Did you send for my minister?" "Yes, he is coming." The minister comes. "Sir, I fear that I am dying!" "Have you any hope?" "I cannot say that I have. I fear to stand before my God; oh! pray for me." The prayer is offered for him with sincere earnestness, and the way of salvation is for the ten-thousandth time put before him, but before he has grasped the rope, I see him sink. I may put my finger upon those cold eyelids, for they will never see anything here again. But where is the man, and where are the man's true eyes? It is written, "In hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torment." Ah! why did he not lift up his eyes before? Because he was so accustomed to hear the gospel that his soul slept under it. Alas! if you should lift up your eyes there, how bitter will be your wailings. Let the Saviour's own words reveal the woe: "Father Abraham, send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame." There is a frightful meaning in those words. May you never have to spell it out by the red light of Jehovah's wrath!<br><br>Charles Spurgeon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Dangers of Overcontrol<br>1 Samuel 15:23<br>For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He has rejected you as king.<br><br>A friend of mine who is a jet pilot once told me that whenever a jet goes out of control and begins to spin, the only thing to do is totally take your hands off the controls and the plane will right itself. This goes against our natural inclination to control and manipulate in order to bring things back under control. It is scary to be out of control. Or is it?<br><br>Saul was a man out of control. He was losing control of his kingdom to David. He was losing the favor of God and the people. It began as compromises. Eventually he was given a final test to obey the voice of God fully. He was instructed to kill the Amalekites completely; but he failed to follow through. The prophet Samuel delivered a hard word to King Saul, "Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He has rejected you as king" (see 1 Sam. 15:26). Saul obeyed partially, but not fully. It was partial obedience that led to his removal as king of Israel and his calling from God. But why did Saul do such a thing? "I was afraid of the people and so I gave in to them" (1 Sam. 15:24b). Saul's fear and insecurity made him more afraid of the people and what they thought than of God. At the core of Saul's disobedience was fear of losing control. That fear of losing control led to partial obedience and the loss of his reign as king.<br><br>How many of us are in danger of losing God's blessing due to partial obedience? How many of us have such a need to control people and circumstances that we fail to fully walk in obedience to God's voice in our lives? Saul provides a great lesson for us as businesspeople. The need to overcontrol things around us can prevent us from receiving all that God has for us. Today, take an inventory of your control quotient.<br><br>Ask God if you are being fully obedient to what He has called you to do this day, and avoid being put on the shelf for disobedience. "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams" (1 Sam. 15:22b).<br><br>OS Hillman</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Psalm 150:6<br>Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.<br><br>God looked down upon His creation and saw that it was good. In time, God's creation looked back and saw that God was good. Together they formed a unity of love and devotion. Through their covenant, all creation was brought into harmony. The Lord loves His children, and many of His children love Him back. Praise the lord with all of your being. With each breath you take, remember that the Lord is God. Nothing you do is done apart from Him. Wherever you go, God is there. He will never leave those who love Him. He gives us new years and new challenges, and he helps us to grow and learn. As we approach the new year, we can enter it confident that God goes forth with us. Praise the Lord, one and all. The Lord has been very good to His children.</div>
