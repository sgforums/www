When they saw their chance, they separated from the rest of their class and headed down a corridor that was roped off. They walked on through twisting and turning shafts until they were no longer sure how to get back. They stood in total darkness, feeling the cavern close in around them. Just as they verged on panic, Davy looked down and noticed a fine, dim glow. Phosphorescent stone was embedded in the cave floor, and it cast off a dull shine. By following the path of light, the boys made it back to the safety of the well-lit shafts.<br>Darkness can close in around us quickly in this world today. It seems to be getting darker all the time.

They are not dead; they have skimmed the purple sea, and gone to a far-off land; but they will be back again by and by.<br><br>Child of God, say not the flowers are dead; say not the winter has killed them, and they are gone. Ah, no! though winter hath coated them with the ermine of its snow; they will put up their heads again, and will be alive very soon. Say not, child of God, that the sun is quenched, because the cloud hath hidden it. Ah, no; he is behind there, brewing summer for thee; for when he cometh out again, he will have made the clouds fit to drop in April showers, all of them mothers of the sweet May flowers. And oh! above all, when thy God hides His face, say not that He hath forgotten thee. He is but tarrying a little while to make thee love Him better; and when He cometh, thou shalt have joy in the Lord, and shalt rejoice with joy unspeakable. Waiting exercises our grace; waiting tries our faith; therefore, wait on in hope; for though the promise tarry, it can never come too late. --C. H.

            <div class='col-md body'>by Neil Anderson<br><br>BEING EMOTIONALLY HONEST<br>Ephesians 4:15<br>Speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him, who is the head, even Christ<br><br>You can guard your intimate relationships by monitoring how you verbally express your emotions to them. For example, you're having a terrible day at the office, so you call home and say to your wife, "Honey, I'm having a bear of a day. I won't be home until about 6:00 p.m. and I have a meeting at church at 7:00. Could you have dinner ready when I get home?"<br><br>When you hit the front door you discover that your wife doesn't have dinner ready as you'd hoped. "For crying out loud," you blaze at her, "I wanted dinner ready at six o'clock! That's why I called you!" Is your wife really the cause of your emotional outburst? Not really. You had a terrible day and you're tired, hungry and stressed out. It's not her fault. Anything could have set you off. You could have just as easily kicked the dog.<br><br>Rather than level your wife, why not be emotionally honest? When it comes to acknowledging emotions with your inner circle, honesty is the best policy. But be sure to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15).<br><br>Another important guideline for acknowledging and expressing your emotions is to know your limitations. Be aware that if you're on the edge emotionally--angry, tense, anxious, depressed--it's not a good time to make decisions on important issues. Your emotions may push you to resolve what you're struggling with, but you may regret your resolution if you push too hard. You're going to say things you'll later regret. Somebody's going to get hurt. You're far better off to recognize your emotional limits and say, "If we keep talking I'm going to get angry. May we continue this discussion at another time?"<br><br>Being emotionally honest lets others off the hook. When you honestly convey how you feel, others know you are not primarily mad at them and that the problem is not their fault. They can also love you better by meeting the needs you express.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Heavenly Father, enable me to be an honest and real person today, speaking the truth in love in all my relationships.<br></div>

DonÂ’t blame othersÂ—not your parents, society, or even God, for your problems. Just say Â“Lord, IÂ’m guilty and I need Your forgiveness.Â”<br><br>This is exactly the formula the Israelites used to seek GodÂ’s forgiveness in the story of Nehemiah. They looked back over their actions, owned their sins, and admitted they deserved GodÂ’s judgment, not forgiveness.<br><br>But when they came to God in humility and confession, He forgave them!<br><br>Even though we also deserve GodÂ’s judgment, we also can receive His forgiveness. God is both just and merciful, which is why we receive grace and forgiveness, not what we deserve. ThatÂ’s why John says that if we confess our sins and take responsibility for them, God will forgive us and clean us from our unrighteousness!<br><br>Are you ready to take responsibility for your actions, confessing your sins to God and asking for His forgiveness? He has promised to forgive you because forgiveness is the gift He gave us when He hung on the cross!<br><br>YOU CAN EXPERIENCE TRUE FORGIVENESS WHEN YOU ADMIT RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR SINS.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â…you in your great mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness.<br><br>--Nehemiah 9:19<br><br>IsnÂ’t it great to know that no matter how unfaithful we are, Yahweh is always faithful and merciful to us? His love is astounding and amazing to me, even as it was to the Israelites as we read in chapter 9 of Nehemiah.<br><br>But that doesnÂ’t mean we can take sin lightly. YahwehÂ’s love and mercy can only become real to us when we see them against the backdrop of our own sinfulness and lack of faith.<br><br>As the people of Israel looked back over their history and realized that they had rebelled against Yahweh, they were struck by the reality of sinfulness and the true magnitude of YahwehÂ’s great mercy towards them.<br><br>As believers, we need to be reminded of the seriousness of sin. Sin is not simply breaking a rule, but breaking trust with Yahweh. We rupture our relationship with Yahweh when we sin. ThatÂ’s why it is so heartbreaking to the Lord when we rebel against Him.<br><br>Of course, this breaking of trust doesnÂ’t mean we arenÂ’t believers anymore. But it does create a breach in our intimacy with Yeshua. In a sense, we start walking backward or a little farther away from Yahweh when we sin, making our relationship weaker.<br><br>But the good news is that when we are repentant, turning back to Yeshua and renewing our commitment to Him, that intimacy is restored. I encourage you, walk toward the Lord todayÂ…and rejoice in His faithfulness!<br><br>EVEN THOUGH SIN BREAKS OUR INTIMACY WITH YESHUA, REPENTANCE RESTORES IT!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â“You are the LORD, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in themÂ….Â”<br><br>--Nehemiah 9:6<br><br>The Lord wants us to approach Him with an attitude of awe and humility. Nothing less is appropriate when we realize that we donÂ’t measure up to the standards of an all-powerful, holy, and sinless Yahweh. We need to come with a sense of awe and wonder before the Yahweh of the universe.<br><br>This is really where true prayer begins. ThereÂ’s a great example of this in chapter nine of Nehemiah. After Ezra read the law, the Israelites realized just how awesome Yahweh was, and how far short of His glory they fell.<br><br>They came to confess their sins, but first they did something that I believe we forget to do quite often, which is to spend time telling the Lord just how mighty and wonderful He is.<br><br>People today try to ignore Yahweh, and deny their need of Him by filling their lives with pleasures, possessions, and other things that canÂ’t fill the void. We can try to escape the inevitable, but sooner or later we all have to come before a holy Yahweh and confess that we have no hope for today or tomorrow apart from Him.<br><br>When we reach that point of selflessness, and come to grips with who Yahweh really is, we cannot help but truly humble ourselves in His presence. When you come to the end of yourself, you realize that it is either Yeshua or nothing!<br><br>The Israelites fell on their faces in worship, and covered themselves with rags to show Yahweh their unworthiness and need of Him. When was the last time you fell on your face, or even your knees, to adore the Lord for His greatness and confess your sins?<br><br>Make today an awesome day by spending time in adoration of Yahweh!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Keep Running!<br><br>Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.<br><br>Â—Hebrews 12:1Â–2<br><br>In the Greek games, a judge would stand at the finish line holding, in plain sight, the laurel leaves that would be rewarded to the victor.  As runners came down the final stretch, they were exhausted, tired, and feeling as though they couldnÂ’t go another step.  But suddenly there was the prize in sight, and a new burst of energy would kick in.<br><br>This is the picture behind the phrase Â“looking unto JesusÂ” in Hebrews 12:2.  We have to keep our eyes on Jesus Christ.  And our prize is the privilege of standing before Him and receiving the crown of righteousness that He will give us.<br><br>That is why we live the Christian life, why we try to live godly lives, and why we try to reach people for Him.   It isnÂ’t for brownie points.  It isnÂ’t for applause.  It isnÂ’t for notoriety.  It is so we can hear Jesus say to us on that final day, Â“Well done, good and faithful servant.Â”  It isnÂ’t to earn His approval, because as believers, we already have found it.   But it is to ultimately say, Â“Lord, I took the life You gave me and tried to make a difference.  Here it is.  I offer it to you.Â”<br><br>Â“Looking unto Jesus. . . . Â”   That keeps you going, doesnÂ’t it?  After all, you can get discouraged at times.  People will let you down.  They will disappoint you.  They wonÂ’t appreciate your hard work.  They wonÂ’t see your efforts.  They wonÂ’t see your real motives.  So they will criticize you.  That is when you remind yourself, I am not running for you.  I am running for the Lord.  And I will keep running.<br><br>by Greg Laurie</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Breaking Camp<br><br>For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.<br><br>Â—2 Corinthians 5:1<br><br>After a few days of camping, especially a week, I am always ready to break camp and go home to enjoy the luxuries of a hot shower, clean clothes, and a roof over my head.  I am happy to break camp.<br><br>Referring to his imminent death, the apostle Paul, wrote, Â“The time of my departure is at handÂ” (2 Timothy 4:6).   He chose a very interesting word here, because in the original language, the word Â“departureÂ” could also be described as breaking camp.<br><br>It reminds us that when death comes, our tent, also known as the body, will be laid aside when our spirit moves into a more permanent residence.  As Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5:1, Â“For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.Â”<br><br>The word Â“departureÂ” Paul used could also be translated, Â“to be released from shackles.Â”  It is the picture of a prisoner in a cell, who was bound, but his shackles are being released.<br><br>Lastly, the word Â“departureÂ” in the original language also describes a boat being untied from its moorings.  So Paul was saying, Â“ItÂ’s time to set sail.  ItÂ’s time to be freed from the shackles.  ItÂ’s time to break camp.  It is good news, because I am going to a better place.Â”<br><br>This reminds us that heaven is not a place of unconscious oblivion; it is a place of conscious existence.  It is to go and be with Christ, not merely lie in some grave.  It is a part of life, not the conclusion of it.  It is a beginning, not an ending.<br><br>by Greg Laurie</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Greatness of YahwehIsaiah 40:12-31<br><br>Ask a group of people what Yahweh is like, and youÂ’ll get many different answers. Some will say HeÂ’s a force somewhere in the universe. Others picture a benevolent grandfather who overlooks our Â“littleÂ” sins. Most of the time, the actions and characteristics we assign to Yahweh suit us individually. But they donÂ’t add up to who He really is.<br><br>The real Yahweh might surprise you. As He reveals Himself in Scripture, Yahweh is a personÂ—in every reference. He is namedÂ—Yahweh, Elohim, LordÂ—or spoken of using masculine pronouns, such as He and Him. Yahweh fits all of the attributes of a person. He shows intelligence to reason, emotions to feel, and the will to make decisions. From Genesis to Revelation, Yahweh displays these features.<br><br>Scripture also shows YahwehÂ’s unchanging character. He is always Spirit, and His love remains constant. Believers can expect YahwehÂ’s principles and laws to hold true and for Him to act exactly as He has promised. Yahweh does adjust His emotions to fit a situation. But feelings, such as joy and anger, are consistent with His character.<br><br>Yahweh is eternal. He has no beginning or end. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. No one created Him. Yahweh simply is. ThatÂ’s hard for people to understand. But if the Lord were completely explainable, He would be like us and unworthy of worship. If weÂ’re to honor our Heavenly Father, we should know Him as He really isÂ—an eternal, unchanging person.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Controlling Your Thoughts Colossians 3:1-4<br><br>A thought can be happy, pleasant, sad, or depressing. It also can be tempting, the kind of thought that will cause you to question its origin.<br><br>As tempting thoughts bear down on us, we may find ourselves surrendering to them and falling into sin. Whether it is for just a moment or for months, tempting thoughts have a way of breaking down our resistance and causing us to rationalize away the action.<br><br>Everyone is subject to these tempting thoughts, both Christians and non-Christians. However, as Christians we can prevent these thoughts from lingering in our minds by knowing our position in Christ.<br><br>So, what is your position in Christ? If you are a Christian, Christ lives in you, and you are in Him. And if He is in you, then you should honor Him by doing what Paul urges in verse 2: "Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on the earth."<br><br>If you continue to think like you did before you came to know the Lord, you will never reach the full potential God has for you in this life. Tempting thoughts will come your way. This is not a sin. But dwelling on these thoughts only breeds sin.<br><br>Remember, every action you take begins with a thought in your mind. "For as he thinks within himself, so he is" (Proverbs 23:7).<br><br></div>
