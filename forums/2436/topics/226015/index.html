            <div class='col-md body'>I agree on most of the issues you brought up. It seems that you enjoy having the same perspectives as the Jews to view God as the Lord, rather than as the Father. To a certain extent, you revel in the impersonality of God as being regarded as Yahweh. You do know that the term Yahweh is considered a Christianised bastardisation of the Tetragrammaton?<br><br>I do not have any direction on a forum such as this. I have no goals to achieve here. I just enjoy reading some of your posts. I just wanted to know about your background further for further insights.<br><br>You must note that saying 'biblical perspective' can be applied to many many different views. It is easy to say that, but ultimately, the means could possibly result in many different ends. It is really an old standby in theological discussions, one that i do not enjoy pursuing.</div>

I am aware that Yahweh is an english bastardisation of the Tetragrammation... when I say biblical perspective I mean what is written according to the Holy Scriptures or as the christians say OT.<br><br>I don't know if I would go so far as to revel in the imporsanality of Hashem, even with a jewish perspective, Hashem was never impersonal to them. He was always close, and sometimes too in your face that is why they got Moses to talk to Him...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Hashem is very personal to me, to whom I call Abba, but I am also very acutely aware of having the fear and reverence of the LORD.<br><br>Glad you stopped by and please feel free to contribute or to debate if you so desire..</div>
