YHVH, YHWH is also called the tetragrammation. If you want to very precise, then yuvheivavhei would be the way to say it. But Yahweh is also the name of the God of the Israelites. As is Adonai, Elohim, Yahveh or Hashem etc.<br><br>Yahweh/Yahveh is specific, when I use it, I am very precise as to who I am worshipping, the God of Israel.
