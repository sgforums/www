            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The word "G-d" (or rather, g-d) is a title, but not a proper name. </strong><br><br>In English Bibles the word is sometimes translating the Hebrew Elohim (or elohim), El (or el), and Eloah. In the Greek Scriptures the word translates the Greek word "theos". Both the Hebrew and Greek "root" meaning is "Mighty one" or "Powerful one," and is applicable to terrestrial and celestial beings. However, it is most often incorrectly used as a substitute for the Hebrew Tetragrammaton (YHWH). Transliterated as YAHWEH, or YAHUWEH pronounced YAH-OO-AY.<br></div>

Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics and Webster's Twentieth Century Dictionary, Unabridged agree that the origin is Teutonic paganism.<br><br>In Indo-Germanic dictionaries, only one word resembles "g-d."

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ANSWER:</strong><br><br>It is true that most English Bibles refer to the Creator as "the LORD" and "G-d" rather than "Yahweh." It is also true that most English Bibles do not give "G-d" as the name of the Canaanite idol in ISAIAH 65:11. It is "that Troop" or "Fortune" or "Gad" etc.<br><br>First of all, the Scriptures were originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, NOT English. The English is only a translation, and translations are subject to errors, and to the erroneous opinions of the translators.<br><br>Quite frankly, it is VERY EASY to prove that the name of the Creator, according to the Hebrew Scriptures is YAHWEH. It is SO EASY and there are SO MANY REFERENCES to verify this, that we will simply ask you to do a little work (VERY LITTLE) to look up the name YAHWEH in any good encyclopedia and see for yourself.<br><br>However, proving that Yahweh and G-d are two DIFFERENT people, according to the Scriptures, is somewhat more difficult, because, as you CORRECTLY stated, most English Bibles call the Creator "G-d" and not "Yahweh."<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Therefore, let us follow this simple line of reasoning,</strong><br><br>#1) The Biblical Creator is named "Yahweh" (EASILY proven).<br><br>#2) YAHWEH is often called "G-d" in many English Bibles, but YAHWEH is NEVER referred to by a word that is pronounced "G-d" (Gawd) in the Hebrew text. The most common Hebrew title that is translated as "G-d" is the Hebrew word "Elohim." Many might say that even though this Hebrew word "Elohim" is not PRONOUNCED "G-d", it MEANS "G-d." It is true that in our MODERN ENGLISH "G-d" has much the same meaning as the Hebrew word "Elohim" however, the point was that "G-d" and "Yahweh" are two different beings ACCORDING TO THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES. And, all will admit that the Old Covenant was ORIGINALLY written in Hebrew. So, even though we will agree that "Elohim" is usually translated as "G-d" we must say that this is NOT the CORRECT way to translate the HEBREW word "Elohim." It should be "Mighty One."<br><br>#3) This will take a little more effort on your part. If you learn the Hebrew alphabet, and the sounds of the Hebrew letters (itÂ’s really not hard to do), you can look up ISAIAH 65:11 in any Hebrew Interlinear, or simply look up the name of the Canaanite idol ("Troop" in the King James Bible), and you will see that this name "Gawd" is pronounced "G-d."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Why not use Â“lordÂ” or Â“godÂ” for Father Yahweh?</strong><br><br>Â“And it shall be at that day, saith Yahweh, that thou shalt call me Husband; and shalt call me no more Baal(i). For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.Â” Hosea 2:16-17<br><br>In WesleyÂ’s Commentary concerning the breakdown of the specific words used in verse 16-17 of Hosea 2 we find, Â“Baali - That is, my LordÂ…By their name - Their names perishing with them.Â”<br><br>Â“Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.Â” Jer 23:27 (KJV)<br><br>Strong's Hebrew Number 1168 Hebrew word: Ba'al {bah'-al}StrongÂ’s shows: Baal = "lord" (Baal equals Lord).<br><br>StrongÂ’s says: Lord or Baal was the Â“supreme male divinity of the Phoenicians or Canaanites.Â”<br><br>Have we considered that the title Â“lordÂ” is actually a name? And yet we find enough evidence showing it is exactly that. So what about the title Â“godÂ” is it also just a title?<br><br>Â“GOD---The common Teutonic word for a personal object of religious worshipÂ…applied to all those superhuman beings of the heathen mythologies. The word Â‘godÂ’ on the conversion of the Teutonic peoples were converted to Christianity was adopted as the same name of the one Supreme BeingÂ…Â”----Encylclopedia Britannica, 11th edition<br><br>James Hastings says of Â“god,Â” Â“after the conversion of Teutons to Christianity the word came to be applied to the Christian DeityÂ…Â”---Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, vol 6, page 302<br><br>LetÂ’s look the following Scripture from the King James Version: Â“But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.Â” Isaiah 65:11 (KJV)<br><br>Now lets uncover what Satan would just love to keep covered! The same verse but with a literal translation from The Scriptures: Â“But you are those who forsake YHWH [shown in Hebrew], who forget My set-apart mountain, who prepare a table for Gad, and who fill a drink offering for Meni.Â” Isaiah 65:11 (TS)<br><br>We read in Come Out of Her My People, by C.J. Koster: Â“All commentators agree that Gad [pronounced gawd, see StrongÂ’s #1409] is a pagan deity, and so is Meni. Gad is usually interpreted as the well-known Syrian or Canaanite deity of Â‘Good LuckÂ’ or Â‘Furtune,Â’ and Meni the deity of Â‘Destiny.Â’ This Gad is written in the Hebrew as GD, but the Massoretes afterwards vowel-pointed it, adding an Â‘a,Â’ to give us Â‘Gad.Â’ However, we find other references in Scripture to a similar deity, if not the same one, also spelt GD in the Hebrew text but this time vowel-pointed to read Â‘GawdÂ’ or Â‘GodÂ’ (Jos. 11:17, 12:7, 13:5), where we find Â‘Baal-GawdÂ’ or Â‘Baal-GodÂ’ according to the vowel-pointing Massoretic Hebrew text. This Baal-Gawd or Baal-God was obviously a place named after their deity.Â”<br><br>Please read the following Scriptures and understand that Yahweh does NOT want to be called by a Pagan name or names. Please read: Ex 23:13; Josh 23:7; Ps 16:4; Deut 12:3, 18:20; and again Hos 2:16-17.<br></div>
