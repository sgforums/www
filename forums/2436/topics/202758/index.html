            <div class='col-md body'>House Votes to Support Israel's Confrontation in Lebanon<br>Thursday, July 20, 2006<br><br>The resolution, which was passed on a 410-8 vote, also condemns enemies of the Jewish state.<br><br>Rep. Ron Paul of Texas was the only Republican to vote against the resolution. Democrats who voted against the measure of support were Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii, John Conyers, Carolyn Kilpatrick and John Dingell, all from Michigan, Jim McDermott of Washington, Nick Rahall of West Virginia and Pete Stark of California.<br><br>House Republican leader John Boehner cited Israel's "unique relationship" with the United States as a reason for his colleagues to swiftly go on record supporting Israel in the latest flare-up of violence in the Mideast.<br><br>Little of the political divisiveness in Congress on other national security issues was evident as lawmakers embraced the Bush administration's position.<br><br>So strong was the momentum for the resolution that it was steamrolling efforts by a small group of House members who argued that Congress's pro-Israel stance goes too far.<br><br>The nonbinding resolution is similar to one the Senate passed Tuesday. It harshly condemns Israel's enemies and says Syria and Iran should be held accountable for providing Hezbollah with money and missile technology used to attack Israel.<br><br>"I certainly sympathize with the Lebanese people and the Lebanese government," Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told CBS' "The Early Show" on Thursday. But, he said, if Hezbollah is "going to launch attacks from the Lebanese territory, then tragically the Lebanese government and people pay a price for that."<br><br>Yet as Republican and Democratic leaders rally behind the measure in rare bipartisan fashion, a handful of lawmakers have quietly expressed reservations that the resolution was too much the result of a powerful lobbying force and attempts to court Jewish voters.<br><br>"I'm just sick in the stomach, to put it mildly," said Rep. Nick J. Rahall II, D-W.Va., who is of Lebanese descent.<br><br>Rahall joined other Arab-American lawmakers in drafting an alternative resolution that would have omitted language holding Lebanon responsible for Hezbollah's actions and called for restraint from all sides. Rahall said that proposal was "politely swept under the rug," a political reality he and others say reflects the influence Israel has in Congress.<br><br>"There's a lot (of lawmakers) that don't feel it's right ... but vote yes, and get it the heck out of here," Rahall said.<br><br>Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who co-sponsored the alternative resolution and also is of Lebanese descent, agreed. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee lobby "throws in language that AIPAC wants. That isn't always the best thing for this body to endorse," Issa said.<br><br>Nevertheless, Rahall and Issa said they were considering voting in favor of the resolution. "I want to show support for Israel's right to defend itself," Issa said.<br><br>Another lawmaker with Lebanese roots, Rep. Charles Boustany Jr., R-La., said he too planned to vote in favor of the resolution despite holding deep reservations on its language regarding Lebanon. "I think it's a good resolution. But I think it's incomplete," he said.<br><br>The lack of momentum for alternative proposals frustrated pro-Arab groups.<br><br>"This is the usual problem with any resolution that talks about Israel Â— there are a lot of closet naysayers up there (in Congress), but they don't want to be a target of the lobby" of Israel, said Eugene H. Bird, president of the Council for the National Interest, a group that harshly condemns Israel's military campaign.<br><br>"These guys aren't legislating. They're politicking," said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute.<br><br>An AIPAC spokeswoman said Congress's overwhelming support for Israel reflects the support of U.S. voters and not any pressure applied by lobbyists. "The American people overwhelming support Israel's war on terrorism and understand that we must stand by our closest ally in this time of crisis," said Jennifer Cannata.<br><br>Click here to view a timeline of the current conflict.<br><br>Meanwhile, Israel is predicting its offensive could last for weeks, although international pressure is building for a quick cease-fire. Israel and the United States oppose that move, preferring a more comprehensive agreement. Lebanon's prime minister estimated Wednesday that Israel's military week-old campaign had killed some 300 people and wounded 1,000 more, most of whom were civilians.<br><br>The Bush administration said Wednesday it saw no point in leaning directly on Syria to help stop the cross-border warfare between Israel and the Hezbollah guerrillas that Syria supports.<br><br>"The track record stinks," White House press secretary Tony Snow said.<br><br>Snow described previous diplomatic sessions with Syria as meetings where U.S. officials drank tea and sat for "five, six, 10 hours listening to polite, but long discourses on greater Syria and at the end of that having gotten nothing."<br><br>The administration has no diplomatic ties to Iran, and no contact with Hezbollah, which it considers a terrorist group.<br><br>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice planned to discuss diplomatic efforts to end the violence, and the possibility of international troops to police a peace, over dinner Thursday in New York with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.<br><br>On Friday, Rice will receive a report from fact-finders Annan sent to the region.<br><br>Rice, herself, is expected to go there. "She intends to travel to the region as early as next week," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.<br><br>Approximately 2,600 U.S. citizens have been evacuated from Lebanon by the United States since Sunday.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An Account from Israel's Frontlines by Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein<br>by Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein / AH : Jul 28, 2006 : IFCJ-Reprinted with permission<br><br>Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, founder and president of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, offers Part 1 of a report after visiting, and bringing aid to cities and villages on Israel's northern border.<br><br>An interview with Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, Part 1:<br><br>How has The Fellowship been responding to the current crisis in Israel?<br><br>When the missiles started flying about 12 or 13 days ago, our staff went north to meet with the various mayors. Within 24 hours we were able to give each of the cities and villages on the northern border 40, 50, 60 thousand dollars for their immediate needs. So the Fellowship was and is really appreciated here because before any other groups came, before the government was able to get itself together, we were in the position to help with the basic needs as people started going into the shelters.<br><br>How were you able to act so quickly?<br><br>We've been working with our Guardians of Israel program with these and 100 other cities for a couple of years, so we know the officials - we know the welfare department heads, we know their transparency in terms of documentation and numbers. We have an emergency fund precisely for situations like this. That's why within 24 hours we were up there and within 24 hours after that we were able to provide the basic things that were needed as people started moving to shelters. That means air conditioning or fans, beds and mattresses, food, diapers, toys for children - all the things you don't even think of that now have to be put into a shelter. For some of the civil workers it meant flak jackets because they had nothing to protect them.<br><br>That is what we did at the very beginning, and we've been continuing going around [seeing] what else we can do. What I did now was to come myself to the northern border to see the situation first hand and how we are getting out the stuff, to meet with the mayors and to see at 2 weeks end, what are the needs are today.<br><br>How are the Israeli people holding up in your view?<br><br>I also went into the shelters and gave encouragement to the people and brought them food and water and things like that. I want them to know that American Christians are standing with Israel. Through the course of the day we started at one town, where right away we experienced three sirens. They give you 12-15 seconds to find a shelter and that was my first exposure to it. When the siren sounded I started to walk fast and people started yelling at me, "Hey this isn't a game - you've got to run to the shelter, you only have a few seconds." So we all started running. There were three such episodes while we were there. One rocket hit just a mile or two away from us and unfortunately killed a 15 year old girl, an Arab girl in a village that we also helped.<br><br>So we went from place to place - in one place it seemed like there was a bomb going off every 5 seconds. I did a TV program there for the news. As we made our way slowly back to Jerusalem, one thing was clear - the morale of the people in the shelters is very high. You can imagine how difficult it must be to spend a day or night together with 25 or 30 other people in a crowded, hot, stuffy and tense room - and then to multiply that by 12-13 days. Meanwhile you're not working, you're sitting inside, your kids are crying, you don't have money, you're unsure if you'll have a job when you get out Â… it is a very difficult situation, but people's spirit is so strong they all say they will stand behind the army as long as it takes if it means putting an end to the Hezbollah threat. They would rather endure this for longer if it gets the job done than to compromise and be subjected to terrorist threats from the northern border.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Omega Letter Intelligence Digest<br>Vol: 58 Issue: 29 - Saturday, July 29, 2006<br><br>Shalu Shlom Yerushalayim<br><br>One of our members forwarded an email along that they received from<br>Israel, with a very interesting twist to it. First, I will share the<br>contents of the email, and then we'll discuss it.<br><br>(Begin email report) Israel lost quite a number of dead and wounded over<br>the last several days, and this week Colonel Kline was one of those who<br>died in the midst of battle. What was not widely reported in the media<br>is "how he died, and what happened as a result of his death."<br><br>Klein had taken a unit of 20 Israeli soldiers into the midst of one of<br>Lebanon's border cities where the fighting was fierce. He led his men<br>into a courtyard that was walled up around believing it provide a place<br>of cover and rest from enemy fire.<br><br>Suddenly, someone tossed a hand grenade out of one of the windows above<br>them and as it hit the ground, Klein threw his body over the hand<br>grenade and<br>cried out shouting: "Schema Yisrael Adoni Elohinu, Adonai Ekhad." Hear O<br>Israel, the L-rd our G-d, the L-rd is One!<br><br>As he shouted the last words he would ever speak in this holiest of<br>prayers He honored his G-d. The grenade blew up killing him but sparing<br>all of his soldiers from death. Some were slightly injured from shrapnel<br>but none had life threatening wounds because of Colonel Klein's actions.<br>It seems afterward some of the soldiers saw an angel standing over the<br>lifeless body of the Colonel. Some of the wounded were taken to a<br>hospital and wanted to speak about this but they were told to say<br>nothing. However, some of them could not keep silent. Who could keep<br>silent after seeing and angel?<br><br>The word got out through some of their parents. The mainstream media<br>here has maintained silence, and the army has ordered them not to speak<br>about their experience, but our sources are bringing us this awesome<br>news! We are seeking to contact and go meet some of these wounded<br>men....Pray for the L-rd to open a door to speak with those who have<br>seen one of G-d's messengers and can now be a witness that He is real.<br>He is alive; He is the living G-d!<br><br>Colonel Klein called upon the living G-d and gave Him glory seconds<br>before He died saving his comrades. G-d showed up immediately and sent<br>one of His messengers to reveal that He was there with them, and now<br>Colonel Kline is with their G-d! (end of email report)<br><br>Assessment:<br>In the early 1990's I was blessed to make the acquaintance of Gershon<br>Saloman, the head of Israel's Temple Mount Faithful while I was working<br>with the This Week in Bible Prophecy television program. When we met for<br>the first time, it was for an interview for the program. We soon became<br>fast friends. Gershon stayed at our home when he was in Canada, and when<br>I was in Jerusalem, he returned the favor. I was invited to celebrate<br>Shabbot (the Sabbath) with him and his family in his home. It was one of<br>the most moving experiences of my life. I say all that to preface the<br>fact that the story Gershon told me was friend-to-friend and not a<br>canned fund-raising speech he was using to raise money for the TMF.<br><br>When I met Gershon, he walked with a cane, and from the way his back was<br>bowed, I assumed he was born with a spinal defect, like spina bifida or<br>something similar.<br><br>At his home in Jerusalem, after our Shabbot dinner, he told me the story<br>of what happened.<br><br>Gershon is a tenth generation 'sabra' (native born Jerusalemite) who<br>fought in every one of Israel's wars including the 1948 War of<br>Independence. His wife stood on the balcony of their home and pointed to<br>a field behind their house.<br>During the Six Days' War, "The Jordanians were right there," she<br>pointed. Gershon's unit was right over there. We could see the fighting<br>from here."<br><br>In 1958, during a battle in the Golan Heights, Gershon was wounded when<br>an Israeli tank accidentally ran over him. The tank caught the collar of<br>his shirt and FOLDED HIM OVER BACKWARDS, snapping his spine. The Syrians<br>overran his position and began shooting the wounded Israeli soldiers. As<br>they were about to shoot him, Gershon told me, they suddenly dropped<br>their weapons and ran away.<br><br>Later, he said, these Syrians soldiers reported to UN officers that they<br>had seen 'thousands of angels' around the crippled IDF officer and had,<br>therefore, fled. He showed me documentary evidence from the UN to prove<br>it. As another interesting side note, despite his injuries, Gershon<br>fought in both the Six Days' War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He was<br>among the Israeli paratroopers who captured the Temple Mount from Jordan<br>in 1967.<br><br>Gershon swelled with pride when he recounted being among the first Jews<br>to set foot on Temple Mount in nearly two thousand years. Now we return<br>to the story at hand -- angels on the Israeli battlefield. Gershon's<br>story of angelic warriors is not the first I'd heard -- it was merely<br>the first time I'd heard the story first-hand from an eyewitness.<br>Soldiers in all of Israel's wars have reported seeing angels on the<br>battlefield. During the Yom Kippur War, a lone Israeli soldier in the<br>Sinai led a captured Egyptian column back to Israeli lines. When the<br>Egyptian officer was asked why he surrendered an entire tank column to a<br>single Israeli soldier, the Egyptian officer replied, "One soldier?<br>There were thousands of them."<br><br>"The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the<br>Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place." (Psalms 68:7) The<br>officer said the rest of the 'soldiers' had melted away as they<br>approached the Israeli lines. The Israeli soldier reported that he was<br>alone when the Egyptian commander surrendered to him. He didn't see the<br>army of angelic warriors. The Egyptians did.<br><br>I read this account some years ago in a secular book about Israel's wars<br>written by an Israeli military historian.<br><br>The Bible identifies the archangel Michael as Israel's guardian angel.<br>(Daniel 10:13, 31) The prophet Zechariah predicted that in the last<br>days, God would send His angels to fight alongside Israel. "In that day<br>shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is<br>feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David<br>shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them." (Zechariah 12:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>In its existence, Israel has fought back invaders in five major wars<br>aimed at its annihilation, against impossible odds exceeding 650 to 1 in<br>some cases. Israel's victory in the War of Independence was nothing<br>short of miraculous, as were her victories in 1967 and 1973 against the<br>combined might of the Soviet-backed Arab Legions.<br><br>Given her precarious geography, with enemies on three sides and her back<br>to the sea, the Arab armies should have cut through her like a hot knife<br>through butter, but amazingly, each victory left Israel in possession of<br>more land than she had when attacked. And in every war, there are<br>reports from BOTH sides of angelic intervention on Israel's behalf.<br>Israel's warrior angels make appearances during the Exodus, during most<br>of Israel's early battles, and are promised as Israel's protectors in<br>the last days.<br><br>There are too many independent accounts to dismiss reports of angelic<br>warriors as battle fatigue, particularly when one considers that they've<br>been seen by BOTH sides.<br><br>I don't want to start an angel-worship cult. Angels are not gods, or<br>deserving of worship. They are created beings who serve as messengers of<br>God<br><br>But they are real. They are active in the defense of Israel. And that is<br>why Israel will win.<br><br>And the fact that we are talking about them is more evidence that these<br>are indeed the very last of the last days before the return of the Messiah Yeshua, Shalu Shlom Yerushalayim! Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! Until He<br>comes. Maybe today?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hizbollah rockets kill 8 in Israel<br>Thu Aug 3, 2006 11:32am ET<br><br>MAALOT, Israel (Reuters) - Hizbollah rockets killed eight people in northern Israel on Thursday, equaling the most lethal barrage launched by the Lebanese guerrilla group since fighting began more than three weeks ago.<br><br>The deaths, in the cities of Acre and Maalot, raised to 27 the number of people killed by rocket fire from Lebanon during the current conflict.<br><br>More than 100 rockets struck in the late afternoon, killing eight people and wounding dozens, police said. It was the highest number of Israeli dead in a rocket attack since eight people were killed in the port city of Haifa on July 16.<br><br>The latest barrages were another sign the guerrilla group was still a potent threat to Israel despite comments on Wednesday by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that Israel had destroyed its infrastructure.<br><br>"Israel will actively seek out and pursue Hizbollah, until these murderous attacks cease and until quiet is restored to northern Israel," said David Baker, an official in Olmert's office.<br><br>Hizbollah fired more than 200 rockets into Israel on Wednesday, its most intense one-day barrage of the conflict.<br><br>On a road outside Maalot, cars came to a screeching stop and motorists ran for cover in ditches at the sound of multiple explosions. Smoke rose over the town and a nearby forest.<br><br>"People have been holed up in shelters -- it is difficult, but people understand that soldiers are still fighting in Lebanon and we will get through this period," Acre Mayor Shimon Lancry said on Channel 2 television.<br><br>Some 10,000 Israeli troops have pushed into southern Lebanon in the ground offensive against Hizbollah. Israel's Channel 10 television said the army had carved out a "security zone" of 20 Lebanese villages up to six km (four miles) from the border.<br><br>"They will remain until a multinational force arrives," the television said, quoting the army. It did not specify whether this meant the military had completed its planned advance in south Lebanon.<br><br>The army's chief spokeswoman, Brigadier-General Miri Regev, said the military, which pulled out of southern Lebanon in 2000, had no intention of making its current deployment permanent.<br><br>"We do intend to clear an area near the border with Lebanon of Hizbollah terrorists to stop them from firing at Israel and to hit their infrastructure," she told Army Radio. "At the moment we have seven divisions inside the area."<br><br>Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said 900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Lebanon.<br><br>Sixty-six Israelis, including 39 troops, have been killed in the violence, which began after Hizbollah killed eight soldiers and kidnapped two others in a cross-border raid on July 12.<br><br></div>

Joel 3:9-11<br><br>Shabbat shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>As we enter into this Shabbat and the 23rd day of fighting in Lebanon, The Holy Spirit impressed upon me to stir you up to pray for Israel like never before.

One Jew had escaped from one such horror camp and was running through the forests naked, hungry, thirsty and exhausted. All of a sudden he spotted a house of a Polish villager and knocked on the door. A woman answered the door and was astonished to see a Jew, a Death Camp refugee in front of her, standing absolutely naked. He said to her something like this: Â“I am Jesus Christ, I just came down from the Cross and I am on a mission. I need some food, some rest, a shower and some clothesÂ”. The woman immediately believed the story and let him in, endangering her own life and catered to him hand and foot by feeding him and giving him clothes.<br><br>Every Jew should speak to you of YÂ’shua, and when you see the Jews in need and in danger, you should hear in your heart, Â“these are the brethren of YÂ’shuaÂ”,<br><br>And the King will answer and say to them, Â‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.Â’  Matthew  25:40<br><br>I am a mother of children and though I have punished them when they did wrong, I pity the person that would decide to harm them or that would ignore them when they are in danger or in need! They would meet a lioness of a mother! So is YAH about Israel,<br><br>Yahveh also will roar from Zion, And utter His voice from Jerusalem; The heavens and earth will shake; But Yahveh will be a shelter for His people, And the strength of the children of Israel. Joel 3:16<br><br>What is happening right now in Lebanon is not only IsraelÂ’s right to defend herself from terrible murderers that plan to annihilate her such as Hizbollah and the Palestinian Hamas supported by Syria and Iran, but it is definitely a Â“Holy WarÂ” by which YAHVEH is establishing His Covenant withy Israel. This war has nothing to do with World Politics but with GODÂ’S COVENANT. And His Covenant is up to 1000 generations!<br><br>He remembers His covenant forever, The word which He commanded, for a thousand generations, The covenant which He made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac, And confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, Psalms 105:8-10<br><br>The following scripture describes GodÂ’s feelings about LebanonÂ’s involvement in the destruction of Israel. Please remember that Tyre, Sidon and Philistia, include Lebanon and Gaza(!); the Hamas and the Hizbolla- The TWO fronts that we have been fighting for years! The Disengagement from Gaza did not stop this war but actually provoked a greater war because the Moslems interpreted the Disengagement as Â“weaknessÂ” and reward for terror, so their spirits are soaring high and they have become bolder!<br><br>Â“Indeed, what have you to do with Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the coasts of Philistia?  Will you retaliate against Me? But if you retaliate against Me, Swiftly and speedily I will return your retaliation upon your own head.Â” Joel 3:4<br><br>My prayer is that as you pray for Israel, you do not pray nice Â“wishy washyÂ” Christian prayers that are Â“politically correctÂ” but true impacting, powerful prayers that are Â“Covenant CorrectÂ”. It is time to wake up the men and the women of war that will fight for Israel like never before. When Israel comes on top, then revival can happen in the Moslem nations because they will know that YAHVEH and not Allah is the Ruler and the King of the Universe.<br><br>Then the word of YAHVEH came to me, saying, Â“Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her, and say, Â‘Thus says YAHVEH GOD: Â“Behold, I am against you, O Sidon; I will be glorified in your midst; And they shall know that I am YAHVEH, When I execute judgments in her and am hallowed in her. For I will send pestilence upon her, And blood in her streets; The wounded shall be judged in her midst By the sword against her on every side; Then they shall know that I am YAHVEH. Â“And there shall no longer be a pricking brier or a painful thorn for the house of Israel from among all who are around them, who despise them. Then they shall know that I am YAHVEH GOD.Â” Ezekiel 28:20-24<br><br>It is not Jesus Christ that the Moslems need to meet with, they need to meet with YÂ’shua the Jewish Messiah, The Lion from the Tribe of Judah that they are trying to annihilate! And they need to come to terms with the fact that a Jew died for them and that hating the Jews is hating YÂ’shua-Jesus! Therefore the Moslems hate all The People of The Book; the Jews and the Christians<br><br>Israel, even in her unbelief is fighting YAHÂ’S (GodÂ’s) battle for the sake of His Holy Name! The Moslems pray five times a day declaring through the loudspeakers of their mosques- Alla Uakbar, which means: Allah is the greatest.<br><br>Every wounded Israeli soldier and every Israeli soldier killed in this war is proclaiming with his blood, through the loudspeakers of Heaven,<br><br>Adonai, YAHVEH is the greatest and His Word is never changing. In spite of thousands of years of suffering at the hands of the nations, here we are in our own Covenant Land fulfilling His word up to 1000 generations!<br><br>Thank you for fighting with us with your prayers, with your giving, with your love and with your support.<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Rabbi Baruch and Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Brigitte Gabriel's speech - made at Duke University<br><br>"I'm proud and honored to stand here today as a Lebanese, speaking for Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East. As someone who was raised in an Arabic country, I want to give you a glimpse into the heart of the Arabic world.<br><br>I was raised in where I was taught that the Jews are evil, Israel is the devil, and the only time we will have peace in the Middle East is when we kill all the Jews and drive them into the sea.<br><br>When the Muslims and Palestinians declared jihad on the Christians in 1975, they started massacring the Christians city after city. I ended up living in a bomb shelter underground from age 10 to 17, without electricity, eating grass to live, and crawling under sniper bullets to a spring to get water.<br><br>It was Israel who came to help the Christians in Lebanon. My mother was wounded by a Muslim shell and was taken into an Israeli hospital for treatment. When we entered the emergency room, I was shocked at what I saw. There were hundreds of people wounded, Muslims, Palestinians, Lebanese Christians, and Israeli soldiers lying on the floor. The doctors treated everyone according to their injury. They treated my mother before they treated the Israeli soldier lying next to her. They didn't see religion, they didn't see political affiliation; they saw people in need and they helped.<br><br>For the first time in my life, I experienced a human quality that I know my culture would not have shown to their enemy. I experienced the values of the Israelis, who were able to love their enemy in their most trying moments. I spent 22 days at that hospital; those days changed my life and the way I believe information, the way I listen to the radio or to television. I realized that I was sold a fabricated lie by my government about the Jews and Israel, which was so far from reality. I knew for a fact that if I were a Jew standing in an Arab hospital, I would be lynched and thrown to the ground as shouts of joy of "Allahu Akbar" (God is great) echoed through the hospital and the surrounding streets.<br><br>I became friends with the families of the wounded Israeli soldiers, one in particular, Rina, whose only child was wounded in his eyes. One day, I was visiting with her and the Israeli army band came to play national songs to lift the spirits of the wounded soldiers. As they surrounded his bed playing a song about Jerusalem, Rina and I started crying. I felt out of place and started walking out of the room, and this mother held my hand and pulled me back in without even looking at me. She held me, crying, and said, "It is not your fault." We just stood there, crying, holding each other's hands. What a contrast between herÂ—a mother looking at her deformed, 19-year-old only child and still able to love me, the enemyÂ—and a Muslim mother who sends her son to blow himself up to smithereens just to kill a few Jews or Christians.<br><br>The difference between the Arabic world and Israel is a difference in values and character. It's barbarism versus civilization. It's democracy versus dictatorship. It's goodness versus evil.<br><br>Once upon a time, there was a special place in the lowest depths of hell for anyone who would intentionally murder a child. Now, the intentional murder of Israeli children is legitimized as Palestinian "armed struggle." However, once such behavior is legitimized against Israel, it is legitimized everywhere in the world, constrained by nothing more than the subjective belief of people who would wrap themselves in dynamite and nails for the purpose of killing children in the name of god.<br><br>Because the Palestinians have been encouraged to believe that murdering innocent Israeli civilians is a legitimate tactic for advancing their cause, the whole world now suffers from a plague of terrorism, from Nairobi to New York, from Moscow to Madrid, from Bali to Beslan.<br><br>They blame suicide bombings on the "desperation of occupation." Let me tell you the truth. The first major terror bombing committed by Arabs against the Jewish state occurred 10 weeks before Israel even became independent. On Sunday morning, February 22, 1948, in anticipation of Israel's independence, a triple truck bomb was detonated by Arab terrorists on Ben Yehuda Street in what was then the Jewish section of Jerusalem. Fifty-four people were killed and hundreds were wounded.<br><br>Thus, it is obvious that Arab terrorism is caused not by "desperation" or "occupation", but by the VERY THOUGHT of a Jewish state.<br><br>So many times in history in the last 100 years, citizens have stood by and done nothing, allowing evil to prevail. As America stood up against and defeated communism, now it is time to stand up against the terror of religious bigotry and intolerance. It's time for everyone to stand up and support and defend the State of Israel, which is the front line of the war against terrorism.<br><br>Thank you<br></div>

And I think if they do, they'll see that there is much in it which is very much in the interests of Lebanon".<br><br>Lebanon has proposed amendments on the cease-fire and territorial dispute that Mr Churkin said "go pretty far from the text which was negotiated".<br><br>The envoys from Britain, China and the United States did not comment after the meeting.<br><br>-ABC/AFP/Reuters<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An exerpt taken from Jerusalem Prayer Team's newsletter...<br><br>Israel must be allowed time to root this terror cancer out of Lebanon. Many of HezbollahÂ’s rockets have been destroyed; however no measures have been set in place to halt Syria or Iran from renewing that supply. In order to thwart future surprise attacks against Israel by Hezbollah, a buffer zone must be set up in southern Lebanon.<br><br>Israel remains in imminent danger as long as the open weapons pipeline continues the flow of weapons into Lebanon and into HezbollahÂ’s hands. This cannot and will not be accomplished if the UN is in control of southern Lebanon.<br><br>Among the UN Security Council members refusing to place Hezbollah on the terror list are Russia and China. There are countries such as Germany that want HezbollahÂ’s approval to police them. This is ridiculousÂ…approval from a terrorist organization to stop their terror activities?<br><br>In fact, Hezbollah's chief spokesman said in a live interview with Al-Jazerra television, "Declaring a cease-fire is not the concern of the people of Lebanon as long as there is one Israeli soldier on Lebanese soil - even one meter (into Lebanon). We will not accept any (Israeli) soldier staying on Lebanese territory, and it is the right of every Lebanese to fight until liberation."<br><br>While speaking to the Organization of Islamic State at an emergency summit in Malaysia, Iran's President Ahmadinejad called for an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, but also told the group, "Although the main solution is for the elimination of the Zionist regime, at this stage an immediate cease-fire must be implemented." It seems his aspirations to "wipe Israel off the map" have not changed.<br><br>And the track record of the UN international observers in Lebanon is less than stellar. They have yet to stop Hezbollah from lobbing one rocket across the border into Israel. Perhaps the label Â“observersÂ” is best suited for this force. In fact, the reports filed by this group have resounded with opposition towards Israel.<br><br>It was this same group that watched October of 2000 while three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped by Hezbollah, forced into a car and driven into Lebanon. Nor has it prevented suicide bombers with backpacks stuffed with explosives, nails, ball bearings, and shrapnel from slipping across the border into Israel to target Israeli civilians. This is the group that the international community wants in southern Lebanon. The question begs to be asked: Why?<br><br>Jews are dying so Christians can live. If Israel loses this war, the next target for Hezbollah will be America.<br><br>According to IsraelÂ’s Justice Minister Haim Ramon, (Iran) wants Israel to stop attacking Hezbollah so (Iran) can retain the ability to threaten Israel whenever (Iran) wants. In an interview on Israel radio, Minister Ramon said: "What Nasrallah (Iran) wants is for us to give in, for Iran to remain with the rocket threat - and whenever Iran feels like it, Iran will be able to attack Israel, and whenever Iran feels like it, Iran will fire rockets on a civilian population." What Nasrallah wants - and I certainly understand why Iran wants to attain this major accomplishment, from his perspective - it won't happen. We won't let it."<br><br>Your ambassador to Jerusalem,<br><br>Mike Evans<br><br></div>

I told the Mayor I would ask every Jerusalem Prayer Team member to contribute within the next 24-hours to launch this fund. I want to thank the 253 Jerusalem Prayer Team members that responded, and ask every member to please respond today.<br><br>My heart broke as I saw the devastation and visited the wounded in the hospital.

We shall not lose this war, which we did not start.<br><br>Our duty is to serve as a defense force of the Jewish People, and to secure the peace of mind of the civilians in northern Israel. If we shall not do it, no one will do it in our place.<br><br>For two thousand years we waited for the establishment of the Jewish State, and we are not going to roll back because a bunch of terrorists assume that they can scare us.<br><br>He who cannot defend Liberty does not deserve Liberty. If we will not be able to fight until our last drop of blood, in order to secure the Liberty of our People on its own soil, our People will not enjoy Liberty.<br><br>There is time to talk and there is time to act. At this time, when missiles and Katyushas afflict the North all the way to Haifa , in addition to the two kidnapped soldiers, the ten soldiers killed and the dozens injured, it is time to fight and not to talk. We are the force, which has been chosen to fight, and we shall perform in the most effective manner.<br><br>I will be the first one to enter the battle and the last one to come out, and will do everything in my power to get you out alive and well. On Friday, with G-D's help, we will rejoin with our families. However, I cannot do it alone. Once we cross the northern border, you should exercise full alert and full responsibility toward your fellow soldier."<br><br>And we must not forget the three young soldiers still being held by Hizbullah Â– Ehud Goldwasser, Gilad Shalit and Eldad Regev. They were snatched from inside Israel when a Hizbullah raiding party decided to test IsraelÂ’s mettle, and found her resolve to be composed of iron.<br><br>While in Israel, I met with the mother, father and wife of Ehud Goldwasser, one of the kidnap victims. His precious mother broke down and wept for the first time as I prayed with her. She was in shock.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cease Fire is not the End of the War </strong><br><br>Shabbat Shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>Here are some thoughts while we mourn our dead and Â“lick our woundsÂ”<br><br>Hamas, Hizbollah and Iran have vowed to annihilate Israel. These are not just mere words, but rather satanÂ’s usual agenda- Â“kill the JewsÂ” has resounded through the ages from Pharao in Egypt, to Haman in ancient Persia (Iran today) through the Christian Crusades, the Inquisitions and the Shoa (Nazi Holocaust). An Esther Church is needed to rise up to the occasion just like Queen Esther of old. A Grafted into the Olive Tree Church, that will never forget that she is part of the Commonwealth of Israel and the Bride of a Jewish Messiah. May this Esther Church arise for such a time as this!<br><br>And a courageous journalist in Beirut wrote: (English Â– Translated from the French by Llewellyn Brown)<br><br>Â“The politicians, journalists and intellectuals of Lebanon have, of late, been experiencing the shock of their lives. They knew full well that Hezbollah had created an independent state in our country, a state including all the ministers and parallel institutions, duplicating those of Lebanon. What they did not know - and are discovering with this war, and what has petrified them with surprise and terror - is the extent of this phagocytosis<br><br>In fact, our country had become an extension of Iran, and our so-called political power also served as a political and military cover for the Islamists of Teheran. We suddenly discovered that Teheran had stocked more than 12,000 missiles, of all types and calibers, on our territory and that they had patiently, systematically, organized a suppletive force, with the help of the Syrians, that took over, day after day, all the rooms in the House of Lebanon. Just imagine it : we stock ground-to-ground missiles, Zilzals, on our territory and that the firing of such devices without our knowledge, has the power to spark a regional strategic conflict and, potentially, bring about the annihilation of Lebanon.<br><br>Lebanon a victim? What a joke<br><br>Before the Israeli attack, Lebanon no longer existed; it was no more than a hologram. At Beirut innocent citizens like myself were forbidden access to certain areas of their own capital. But our police, our army and our judges were also excluded. That was the case, for example, of Hezbollah's and the Syrians' command zone in the Haret Hreik quarter . A square measuring a kilometer wide, a capital within the capital, permanently guarded by a Horla army, possessing its own institutions, its schools, its crÃ¨ches, its tribunals, its radio, its television and, above all_ its government. A "government" that, alone decided, in the place of the figureheads of the Lebanese government - in which Hezbollah also had its ministers! - to attack a neighboring state, with which we had no substantial or grounded quarrel, and to plunge US into a bloody conflict. And if attacking a sovereign nation on its territory, assassinating eight of its soldiers, kidnapping two others and, simultaneously, launching missiles on nine of its towns does not constitute a casus belli, the latter juridical principle will seriously need revising.<br><br>Thus almost all of these cowardly politicians, including numerous shiah leaders and religious personalities themselves, are blessing each bomb that falls from a Jewish F-16 turning the insult to our sovereignty that was Haret Hreik, right in the heart of Beirut, into a lunar landscape. Without the Israelis, how could we have received another chance - that we in no way deserve! - to rebuild our country?<br><br>Like the overwhelming majority of Lebanese, I pray that no one puts an end to the Israeli attack before it finishes shattering the terrorists. I pray that the Hebrew soldiers will penetrate all the hidden recesses of southern Lebanon and will hunt out, in our stead, the vermin that has taken root there.<br><br>continued...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>part2 Cease fire is not the end of the war...<br><br>I will end this all with a very serious and alarming quote from another Arab Youseef  Ibrahim on August 7th, 2006<br><br>Â“For years, Israel claimed that its survival was at stake, surrounded as it was by Arab armies. In fact, it had already destroyed each of them, in a matter of days. Now, however, anyone can see that Israel is indeed facing an existential threat Â­ call it death by a thousand paper cuts. Israel's economy and a million of its citizens in the north cannot survive a war of attrition. Unless it is reinstituted with extreme ferocity, Israel's aura of invincibility will give way to a feeding frenzy of Jihadi sharks and the collapse of a peacefully inclined but weak Lebanese government<br><br>The apocalyptic scenario of an enemy within and a Shiite militia without comes with impressive numbers to back it up. Together with Hezbollah's sister Lebanese Shiite militia, Amal, and 1 million Shiites in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran's combined Shiite population of 100 million looms large. This huge force is poised to fight foes selected by the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, and his masters<br><br>I am not an alarmist, just an egoist. For after these jihadi hordes finish their work in Lebanon and Iraq, they'll come for the rest of us: moderate Arabs, secular Arabs, Christian Arabs, Kurds, Armenians, Druze, and eventually the Sunni Muslims (whom they are already cutting to pieces in Iraq).<br>In this "Spartacus"-like Shiite uprising, which began with the Iranian Revolution of 1979, those hanging on crosses all the way to the gates of Rome will be all the non-jihadists among us. This time around, the barbarians at the gate aren't just coming for the Jews, but also for what is left of Arab secularism and liberal Islam. That, again, is why a cease-fire will not do.Â”<br>If we were to affix red pins to wherever jihadists are operating today on a map of the Middle East, red would be the color of Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Algeria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. So, once again, a cease-fire will not do.<br><br>If the mythology of Hezbollah survives the war in Lebanon without a demonstrable humiliation or defeat, the notion will spread that jihadists don't need armies, just some fighters and a bit of momentum<br><br>That momentum has spread to Al Qaeda, which is now rallying to Hezbollah's side, as well as Hamas; the Muslim Brotherhoods of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria; Iran's mullahs, and all the jihadi franchises around the world. This is why a cease-fire will not do in the Israel-Hezbollah war.<br><br>What can one add to all these words of outrage and of sorrow? I feel like crying like Jeremiah: Â“O my soul, my soul I am pained in my very heart. My heart makes a noise in me. I cannot hold my peace, because You have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.Â” Jeremiah 4:19<br><br>Only G-d Himself can save Israel out of her present predicament! May we all fervently pray for that to happen pleading His mercy which endures forever!<br><br>Taken from Jan Willem van der Hoeven, Director<br>International Christian Zionist Center<br><br>www.israelmybeloved.com<br><br>continued...</div>

Gaza was a desert that the Jews turned into a blooming garden called Gush Katif. Now that Gush Katif and its hard working Jewish inhabitants have been forcefully Â“disengagedÂ” it has become a desert once again and a dangerous at that- A launching pad for Kassam rockets on innocent Israelis. The Land of Israel was a desert filled with swamps, sand dunes and rocks after mostly Islamic rule for over 1000 years. When the Jews purchased the land from the Moslem Turks it was good for nothing! And after lots of hard work and GodÂ’s blessing, they turned it into a Garden of Eden. Now the so called Â“PalestiniansÂ” want Â“their landÂ” back and they are willing to blow themselves up in order to execute their agenda of hatred against the Jewish State. If they just learnt to love Israel and cooperate with her, they would be thriving and prosperous all the way.<br><br>Â“Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fallÂ” Proverbs 16:18<br><br>The words and actions of the Islamic world against Israel are arrogant and hateful words. We need to understand that sooner or later Islam will fall and those harmed by it and those trapped in its deathly ideology will go free! Let us pray for Islam to fall and for its captives to be released!<br><br>Thus says the LORD: Â“Against all My evil neighbors who touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inheritÂ—behold, I will pluck them out of their land and pluck out the house of Judah from among them. Then it shall be, after I have plucked them out, that I will return and have compassion on them and bring them back, everyone to his heritage and everyone to his land. And it shall be, if they will learn carefully the ways of My people, to swear by My name, Â‘As the LORD lives,Â’ as they taught My people to swear by Baal, then they shall be established in the midst of My people. But if they do not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation,Â” says the LORD.  Jeremiah 12:14-17<br><br>Interesting turn of events<br><br>For years I have been praising the decision of Costa Rica to have its embassy in Jerusalem. Â“They are the only prosperous Latin American country and they have no army! They donÂ’t need one because Yahveh has been protecting them for honoring Israel.Â”  I have said in the past.  However with the change in government there is a shift in Costa Rica,<br><br>Costa Rica to Move Embassy from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv<br>03:00 Aug 17, '06 / 23 Av 5766<br><br>(IsraelNN.com) Costa Rica will be moving its embassy in Israel from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. The countryÂ’s new president Oscar Arias added that this move would be made to form new alliances in the Middle East.<br><br>Â“The time has come to rectify this historic mistake, which has prevented us from building connections with Arab countries,Â” stated Arias. The decision will leave El Salvador as the only country in the world to have its embassy located in Jerusalem.<br><br>Now they will befriend the Arab Oil and make the God of Israel their enemy, what a sad turn of events! The same turn of events has happened in Venezuela with President Hugo Chavez that has made an alliance with Iran against Israel. The Ambassador of Venezuela in Israel and the Ambassador of Israel in Venezuela have both left!<br><br>Let us pray for El Salvador, the only country with its Embassy in Jerusalem! El Salvador means Â“The SaviorÂ”. Let us shout HaleluYAH in the midst of tribulation for this sign that the only one left in Jerusalem is YESHUA, THE SAVIOR, The One who keeps Israel and neither slumbers nor sleeps. Let us pray like never before for The Savior; El Salvador- YÂ’shua to be revealed to Jerusalem and to all of Israel. Please be also praying for our new Hebrew web site called Besorot-Tovot or Â“Good NewsÂ”, pray fervently for many to come to YÂ’shua through this internet tool.
