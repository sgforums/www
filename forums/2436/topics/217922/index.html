Its as you have said, we lose a part of us, a part of our identity.</span><br>2. All the years of friendship and companionship simple halted.<br><span style="color: blue;">3. Its hard to forget and maybe hard to forgive. Afterall we love our friends right? But because we love them its why we wish them the best of luck and hope instead of hating them.</span><br>4. There is no simple way to let it go. We bear with the pain, but gradually time will ease the pain.<br><span style="color: blue;">5. God has presented us with this ordeal in order for us to grow from it.</span><br>6. God wants the best for us and He always has a unique way of doing so.
