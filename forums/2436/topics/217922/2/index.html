I hate moving. Anyway, we had a breather of a month before we moved in proper. During which time, with the exception of some electrical work, we did everything ourselves. We found some hardwood laminate on sale so the living room and the entire second floor is laminate. Took us a while to lay it all down. *whew!* We painted all the walls, did some minor plumbing, changed out all the ceiling fans, put in a new kitchen (this we left to the experts), am still in the midst of trying to complete the base boards among other little things left to do. How's the house you're fixing up?</div>
