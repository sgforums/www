We are commanded to keep it. I did not impose this requirement on them. Yahweh did. If we read the NT, even Shaul did not waver from keeping Shabbat and he did not instruct any of the gentiles differently. The only exceptions then were 1) no immediate need for circumcision, 2) do not eat food offered to idols and 3) abstain from sexual imorality. Amongst the believers Shabbat was still kept in the synagogues on Shabbat. The keeping of Shabbat is not an imposition or a yoke. It only becomes one when the person or persons decide not to follow the commandments of Yahweh.<br><br>You make the point of worshipping Yahweh with all our hearts, mind and if I am not wrong scripture also says strength. So by not keeping Shabbat, are you then worshipping Yahweh with all your heart, mind and strength? Make not mistake, sunday is not holy neither are any other days holy the only day which Yahweh has sanctified and made holy is shabbat, and we are commanded to keep it.<br><br>Exodus 16:23<br>Then he said to them, Â“This is what the LORD has said: Â‘Tomorrow is a Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake today, and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.Â’Â”<br><br>Exodus 16:29<br>See! <strong>For the LORD has given you the Sabbath</strong>; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let every man remain in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.Â”<br><br>Exodus 20:8<br>Â“ Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br><br>Exodus 20:10<br>but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates.<br><br>Exodus 20:11<br>For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. T<strong>herefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.</strong><br><br>Exodus 31:13<br>Â“Speak also to the children of Israel, saying: Â‘Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.<br><br>Exodus 31:16<br><strong>Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.</strong><br><br>Leviticus 19:30<br><strong>Â‘You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary: I am the LORD.</strong><br><br>Leviticus 23:3<br>[ The Sabbath ] Â‘Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation.

Sorry for keeping so quiet after starting this topic... unusually busy the past few weeks.<br><br>Just from reading the posts thus far, they reiterate what the topic is about.<br><br>Yeshua lived on earth as a faultless Jew fulfilling every bit of the Torah. So when he asked us to follow Him, wouldn't that mean for us to follow His example of how He lived here?<br><br>These days, Christians claim to follow Christ, but yet, how can they know who He really is because in the majority of cases, the Torah is not taught to them and are taught that it is obsolete, the "old covenant", so they are unable to fully appreciate who Yeshua is and what He taught while He was on earth, since He constantly referred to the Torah.<br><br>So if they have a foreign concept of who Christ is, then in their worshipping of who they formulate Christ to be, out of either erroneous teaching or ignorance, has Christ just become an idol to them?<br></div>
