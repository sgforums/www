            <div class='col-md body'>Part1<br><strong>Male and Female Adam</strong><br><br>Shabbat shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>Lately I have been noticing the need to speak about Elohim as a Tri-Une God as depicted in the Hebrew Holy Scriptures. Already in the first chapter of Genesis we can see The Tri-Une God in action!<br><br>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. Then God said, Â“Let there be lightÂ”; and there was light.Genesis 1:1-3<br><br>We can see that Elohim, who is a plural form of EL, created the Heavens and the Earth. Right afterwards something happened to render His marvelous creation chaotic. I believe it was when Lucifer lifted himself above the Most High and was thrown to the earth prior to the creation of Man-Adam!<br><br>Â“How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How you are cut down to the ground, You who weakened the nations! For you have said in your heart: Â‘I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God;  I will also sit on the mount of the congregation On the farthest sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.Â’ Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, To the lowest depths of the Pit.  Isaiah 14:12-15<br><br>Later on we see a confirmation of this in the Book of Revelation,<br><br>And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.  Revelation 12:7-9<br><br>So, after this heavenly war that ended dethroning satan from His lofty position with Elohim, satan and his angels now turned Â“demonsÂ” ended on the earth and caused the earth to be in great chaos called in Hebrew,<br><br>continued...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOHU VABOHU<br><br>It is in this scenario that we see the Tri-Une God in FULL operation and this pattern will accompany us through and through.<br><br>The three members of The God-Head,<br><br>The Ruach or Spirit of Elohim<br><br>Elohim who speaks<br><br>The Word of Elohim<br><br>The Ruach or Spirit of Elohim hovers over the waters of a chaotic earth, Â“without form and voidÂ”. SatanÂ’s relocation to the earth caused the earth to suffer from disorder and emptiness. That is the condition of all human beings without Elohim-Tohu Vabohu, namely chaos, confusion, disorder, emptiness, aimlessnessÂ…<br><br>The Ruach is depicted here in the Hebrew as a female motherly dancer that with tender loving care and with great protectiveness hovers over in a very soft, ethereal and lady like dance over the formless, void earth!<br><br>RUACH ELOHIM MERACHEFET AL PNEI HAMAYIM<br><br>In the same way, prior to our salvation the Ruach, the Spirit was as a mother hovering over our lives and getting us ready to receive The Word of Elohim that would produce our salvation. I remember how the Ruach was working in my life prior to my salvation and it was leading me to repentance for breaking ElohimÂ’s Commandments. That the Spirit of Elohim is described in Hebrew as a Â“sheÂ” is very revealing! The Ruach becomes the conductor of the Word of Elohim, The Ruach is the channel by which The Word goes through. The Word is the SEED and the Ruach is the CONTAINER of the SEED!<br><br>Then, Elohim speaks Â“Let there be lightÂ” and there was light! The Word is spoken out of the lips of Elohim, The Ruach conduces the Word to the earth and there is LIGHT!<br><br>The Tri-Une God in Action- Ruach Elohim-Elohim-Word of Elohim and the outcome is LIGHT and LIFE! In order for light and life to be released anywhere we have to have the FULL operation of the Tri-Unity,<br><br>Ruach Â– in female gender, prepares, hovers, cares, dances and conduces The Word<br><br>Elohim- described here as a singular spokesman is The Father<br><br>The Word of Elohim- The Son, YÂ’shua<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. John 1:1<br><br>I am amazed when people find it distasteful that the Ruach is described as a female in the original Hebrew text, which is The Original Bible! As if Elohim would only have male attributes! What heresy! In that sense, people that have a problem with having the Ruach in female gender, will also have a problem accepting women as co-equal with men in Creation. So, women have been historically treated as inferior by the Church to this day! But it is totally contrary to Scripture! Elohim has both male and female attributes and that is why He created Adam-Man in His image!<br><br>Then God said, Â“Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.Â” So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Genesis 1:26,27<br><br>Elohim is not a man, neither is He a woman- He is all in all. He has all attributes inside of Him. He created Adam-Man in His image as a male and a female, not only as a male!<br><br>Anyone that believes that God is a male makes Him to be a liar, because He said that He created ADAM in His own Image and Likeness as a Male and a Female not only as a Male! In fact the Woman was also called Adam in the beginning. It is only AFTER the fall that the Man RENAMES her EVE!<br><br>And Yahveh God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. Then the rib which Yahveh God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. And Adam said: Â“This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.Â” Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.<br><br>Genesis 2:21-24<br><br>ISH- Hebrew for Male Adam, translated as MAN<br><br>ISHA- Hebrew for Female Adam, translated as Wo-Man<br><br>Adam in male gender was called= ISH<br><br>Adam in female gender was called= ISHA<br><br>It was only in Genesis 3:20 that Adam changes her name to Eve<br><br>And Adam called his wifeÂ’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. Genesis 3:20<br><br>Then the name and the RELATIONSHIP between both of them changes from co-equality to bondage and strife,<br><br>To the woman He said: Â“I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; In pain you shall bring forth children; Your desire shall be for your husband, And he shall rule over you.Â” Genesis 3:16<br><br>The Tri-Unity of Elohim in Action will always have male and female attributes and the Good News is that YÂ’shua has come so that all things might be restored and returned to their original plan and purpose! Elohim has purposed it for End Time Couples to walk in total unity as co-heirs of the Gift of Life having dominion authority, being fruitful and multiplying!<br><br>Then God blessed them, and God said to them, Â“Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.Â” Genesis 1:28<br><br>It is time for us to know Elohim in all His fullness and both MALE and FEMALE, Man and Woman, Ish and Isha are needed in order to display Him in these End Times. It is time to get free from the traditions of demons and men that cannot accept the fact that Women are also made in the image of Elohim just like Man!<br><br>The Woman is taken out of the heart cavity, the rib of the Man and is formed as a living being. She is not removed out of his foot or his back but from under his heart! She is taken out of the Holy of Holiest of Man and forever the perfect relationship between the two will be a Â“heart relationshipÂ”. Man would have to protect and honor his Woman, for she is his very heart!<br><br>And Yahveh God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. Then the rib which Yahveh God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. And Adam said: Â“This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.Â” Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.  Genesis 2:21-25<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Please pray with me,<br><br>Dear Father in Heaven, please forgive me for my ignorance concerning your full attributes of male and female. Forgive me for considering the woman to be an inferior creation to man. I renounce this lie and I receive women as created in your image and likeness as well. I ask you to cleanse me from all deception in this issue that has guided my life and my relationships with the opposite sex and in my marriage.

Your word is truth. As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified by the truth.  Â“I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word;  that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me.  And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one: John 17:17,22<br>We love you and care for you<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Rabbi Baruch and Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br>Â© Bishop Dr Dominiquae Bierman 2006 - Permission is granted (and we encourage you) to distribute these writings.
