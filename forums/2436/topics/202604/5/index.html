            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">MIchael Behe presents several examples of irreducibly complex systems to prove his point, here is another one: the cilium. Cilia are hair-like structures, which are used by animals and plants to move fluid over various surfaces (for example, cilia in your respiratory tree sweep mucous towards the throat and thus promote elimination of contaminants) and by single-celled organisms to move through water. Cilia are like "oars" which contain their own mechanism for bending. That mechanism involves tiny rod-like structures called microtubules that are arranged in a ring. Adjacent microtubules are connected to each other by two types of "bridges"-a flexible linker bridge and an arm that can "walk" up the neighboring microtubule. The cilia bends by activating the "walker" arms, and the sliding motion that this tends to generate is converted to a bending motion by the flexible linker bridges.<br><br>Thus, the cilium has several essential components: stiff microtubules, linker bridges, and the "motors" in the form of walker arms. While my description is greatly simplified (Behe notes that over 200 separate proteins have been identified in this particular system), these 3 components form the basic system, and show what is required for functionality. For without one of these components, the system simply will not function. We can't evolve a cilium by starting with microtubules alone, because the microtubules will be fixed and rigid-not much good for moving around. Adding the flexible linker bridges to the system will not do any good either-there is still no motor and the cilia still will not bend. If we have microtubules and the walker arms (the motors) but no flexible linker arms, the microtubules will keep on sliding past each other till they float away from each other and are lost.<br><br>This is only one of many biochemical systems that Behe discusses in his book, Darwin's Black Box. Other examples of irreducible complexity include the light-sensing system in animal eyes, the transport system within the cell, the bacterial flagellum, and the blood clotting system. All consist of a very complex system of interacting parts which cannot be simplified while maintaining functionality.<br><br>Evolution simply cannot produce complex structures in a single generation as would be required for the formation of irreducibly complex systems. To imagine that a chance set of mutations would produce all 200 proteins required for cilia function in a single generation stretches the imagination beyond the breaking point. And yet, producing one or a few of these proteins at a time, in standard Darwinian fashion, would convey no survival advantage because those few proteins would have no function-indeed, they would constitute a waste of energy for the cell to even produce. Darwin recognized this as a potent threat to his theory of evolution-the issue that could completely disprove his idea. So the question must be raised: Has Darwin's theory of evolution "absolutely broken down?" According to Michael Behe, the answer is a resounding "yes." This same argument can be applied to the supposed evolution of the eye. </div></blockquote>Sigh... you quote the same example again and again to argue against how I refuted against the eye?<br><br>All Michael Behe pointed out was the cilia is a complex structure and any failure of any bit would render it useless. Any one with a textbook on cilia can do that. I suggest you read more on other theories other than your own before you arrive at your conclusion.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_flagella" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_flagella</a><br><br>Here's another article on Michael Behe:<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Behe" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Behe</a><br><br>Note that Michael Behe's testimony in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District is rejected due to the fact that <span style="font-style: italic;">"Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large."</span><br><br>Also, another statement made by the court case that I think you should read:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">"ID proponents primarily argue for design through negative arguments against evolution, as illustrated by Professor BeheÂ’s argument that Â“irreducibly complexÂ” systems cannot be produced through Darwinian, or any natural, mechanisms. However, Â… arguments against evolution are not arguments for design. <span style="color: red;">Expert testimony revealed that just because scientists cannot explain today how biological systems evolved does not mean that they cannot, and will not, be able to explain them tomorrow. As Dr. Padian aptly noted, Â“absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.Â” </span>Â… Irreducible complexity is a negative argument against evolution, not proof of design, a point conceded by defense expert Professor Minnich."</span></div>

A number of Babylonian documents have been discovered which describe the same flood.<br><br>Ancient tablet listing the Sumerian kings<br>[More information]<br><br>The Sumerian King List (pictured here), for example, lists kings who reigned for long periods of time. Then a great flood came. Following the flood, Sumerian kings ruled for much shorter periods of time. This is the same pattern found in the Bible. Men had long life spans before the flood and shorter life spans after the flood. The 11th tablet of the Gilgamesh Epic speaks of an ark, animals taken on the ark, birds sent out during the course of the flood, the ark landing on a mountain, and a sacrifice offered after the ark landed.<br><br>The Story of Adapa tells of a test for immortality involving food, similar to the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>Sumerian tablets record the confusion of language as we have in the Biblical account of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9). There was a golden age when all mankind spoke the same language. Speech was then confused by the god Enki, lord of wisdom.

Think about it, how far can they build? Even if they excel all the skyscrappers of modern age, they are still far from reaching the outer atmosphere of Earth. We've been to the moon and far beyond the solar systems. How come we don't get stopped by God? Why was God so threatened by their building of a miserable towel?<br><br>All your evidence on the Babylonian tower/gods only further prove that the bible from derived from mythical stories from the pagans.

You're right about the many variables. If time is to go back and we go thru the whole sequence of evolution again, we will find ourselves surrounded by a whole different assortment of animals.<br><br>It is complex to you now because you don't see the big picture. Every advantage that enables more reproduction would be carried on forward to the descendants. You tend to look at the mutations at an individual level. At the population level, you can find that overall good mutations will be carried on, and with each generation, increase in proportions.<br><br>They don't have to be there at the right time, because they can be inside you, like when you might have immunity to SARS but you won't know until the virus hits you. A defect might be advantageous in different settings. Example, people with heterogeneous sickle cell anaemia will be protected against malaria. That's why you see a greater proportion of people carrying the sickle cell gene mutation in areas with malaria as compared to the Western countries.<br><br>Evolution may not be perfect, but it should beats attributing everything to one God that we couldn't prove.

I think the argument can swing both ways depending on the inclination of the individual. But i tend to find them believeable otherwise I would no thave posted them. As to whether any of the articules you have posted are objective or not, is also debatable.<br><br>My conscience is clear. I do not believe in evolution hence would tend to believe the articles to be accurate and true.<br><br>Shalom!</div>

It has to do with correct referencing and stating the facts as the way they are. Misrepresenting information by not understand the mechanisms of evolution and yet attacking the theory with enthusiasm is not a scholar should do.<br><br>Least what these authors can do, is try to understand evolution more before criticising it.<br><br>Do take note that although some of articles I've posted are anti-creationist, they based their arguments on facts and not assumptions, much unlike creationist articles. They don't sandwich assumptions between useless references and mislead the public.<br><br>Moreover, most of the articles I've put up were written by reputable writers defending facts, not discredited authors like Michael Behe, whose sole purpose was to disprove evolution.<br><br>Since you've already indicated that you find these articles objective, I've no more to say. However, I can't help but indicate my disappointment in the lack of efforts on your part to at least do some quality control on the articles you've posted. Failure to separate good and sound articles can only undermine your overall credibility. Just a suggestion which I sincerely doubt you will accept.<br><br>Thank you for your time.</div>
