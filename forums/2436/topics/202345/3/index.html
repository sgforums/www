Yahweh does not need to assimilate other pagan religions and cultures to celebrate as His own is our Yahweh so unoriginal as that? I think not. The 40 days of lent, do you know their origins? The easter egg... do you know why some chruches only let you paint them in one colour blood red? Do you know who else has his birthdate on the 25th of Dec?<br><br>Seriously what does christmas do except make people spend a lot of money??It has been so commercialized and the church has capitalized on it!</div></blockquote>woah. Christmas is celebrated as the birth of My Lord. I know that 25th December isnt the actual day, but does it matter? Isn;t it wads inside that's important?<br><br>Easter is the Resurrection of My Lord and during the season of Lent, I reflect and prepare for Easter? Is all this wrong? I am doing it out of the love i have for My Lord. Yes maybe the dates are not accurate but can't we try and relive all these major events?<br><br>What about Christmas being commercialised? In my family, Christmas is a time where we all get together for a meal, say Grace as a family, enjoy a nice dinner and proceed to Mass to worship our Lord. Does it matter whether it falls on 25th Dec or 5th of MArch, isn't the attitude of worship more important?<br><br>I am sure u have European friends. all of my European friends look forward to Christmas as a time to get together with the family.

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway, i find it puzzling. Protestant insist in a correct way that Christianity is about a relationship with God. And the bottom line of relationship is Love. I call my dad 'Pa'. some of my friends call their father 'daddy' Isn;t words just a personal value that we attach to it?</div>
