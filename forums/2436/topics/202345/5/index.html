            <div class='col-md body'>Biblical Interpretation<br>If I say the word, apple, you might picture a big, red, juicy one. An artist might picture the apple with a stem with a couple leaves on it and maybe even a worm. A farmer might picture an entire apple orchard. To that end, the English and Hebrew languages are similar in that images are associated with words.<br><br>What image comes to mind when I say the word, walk? You might picture a person walking down a sidewalk in your neighborhood for exercise. Perhaps you can imagine the way a famous movie star walks. You might even picture people walking around town. Some are in a hurry to get somewhere while others are leisurely strolling around to see the sights.<br><br>In Hebrew, the word for walk is  (halakh), pronounced {haw-lock}. The image from the Hebrew word is a little different from the Western idea. In fact, to walk Hebraically is to follow, i.e. to worship God, to live, to imitate a manner of life. In short, the way you live your life is your walk.<br><br>Virtually all Hebrew words are at least slightly different in image when compared to the English language. Some are dramatically different in their meaning and imagery. For example, Exodus chapter 20 verse 5 says, " . . . for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God . . .(KJV)" The image we might get from the word jealous is that of a jilted spouse or lover seeking revenge after finding his partner with someone else. This image leans to the idea that God Himself is petty and jealous. The Hebrew word in this scripture is  (qana), pronounced {kaw-naw}, and although it can be used in this manner, it was not in this particular scripture. Qana is "to burn with zeal, passion, and desire for someone, to be zealous for their cause." God couldn't feel this way about someone if He were petty and jealous. God's feelings for us have never and will never change in spite of what we do or don't do. God was not saying that He gets mad, seeks revenge and dishes out punishment when we serve another. He was telling us to serve only Him because He is the only God who actually loves and desires us.<br><br>There are seven  (bin-yan), pronounced {been-yawn}, to each Hebrew word. Binyan are sometimes called tenses i.e. past, present, and future, but technically, there are only two tenses in the Hebrew language, perfect and imperfect. That is to say, things will happen or they have already happened. Each binyan determines if a word is passive, intensive, a command or if it is reflective. The binyan also includes gender, numeric value and whether a word is singular or plural.<br><br>Now take the question, "Do you hear me?" This can be negative as in a parent scolding a child. I can tell a joke and then ask the same question, but the meaning would not be the same. Maybe I just want to know if you understand me. On the other hand, if I'm in a large stadium, I might ask this question to find out if the volume is loud enough.<br><br>Every root word has seven binyan, but all seven are not always used. Both the Young's and Strong's concordances give more than one binyan to each word (sometimes all seven), but they do not separate them in any way. This often proves to be problematic in interpretation since so many people take the binyan that best fits what they believe. The downside to this approach happens when the person interpreting the scripture doesn't choose the correct binyan. As a result, incorrect interpretation sounds credible.<br><br>Psalm 68:35 says, " O God, thou art terrible . . .(KJV)" The Hebrew word translated as "terrible" is  (yare), pronounced {yaw-reh}. What happens if a person believes God to be mean and vindictive? This may be all the proof this person needs, especially if he looks at a concordance or a dictionary that says things like, "fear, be afraid, be dreadful, to make afraid, to terrify." A dictionary gives us the meaning of the English word not the Hebrew or Greek word. In some cases, the meaning given by the dictionary for a Hebrew/Greek word will correspond to the meaning given in a concordance as is the case in this example, but not always. In this instance, wrong interpretation sounds legitimate. The use of this word here is meant to portray God as an awe-inspiring, honorable, and astonishing God.<br><br>Hebrew sentences are built around the verb. English is built around the noun. We want to know who, and the Hebrew's want to know why. Every Hebrew verb has a three-letter root. Hebrew nouns only have a two-letter root, but each one is built from a three-letter verb root, which means all Hebrew words have a verb root. This is important because the verb root will always paint a picture. These are very vivid, sometimes turn-your-face-red images. The language as a whole is graphic beyond belief at times.<br><br>continued...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>from previous post... continued.<br><br>There is also something else that happens to cause wrong interpretation. The concordances are keyed to the English text in the King James Bible. This would not necessarily be bad except that the numbers are keyed to words that are sometimes not actually in the Hebrew/Greek text. For instance, if you look up the English word "praise," you will find a reference to Jud 5:3 " . . . I will sing priase to the LORD, . . ." even though the word is not found in the Hebrew text. It is important to know that the translation from Hebrew/Greek into the KJV is not wrong. The reason we don't get the "picture" is that the translation is basically word-for-word, one English word for one Hebrew/Greek word. However, in an attempt to make the translation make sense, the interpreters added words like "own, as, it, but, etc." This word-for-word approach almost always leaves out the picture, which can cause us to miss the intended meaning. Of course if the Bible was translated this way, you would have to lug it around on a dolly.<br><br>The Bible was written from a conceptual point of view as apposed to our Western abstract point of view. The Greek and English "abstract" approach lends itself to pulling a single word, scripture, passage or book out of the text and letting it stand on its own. Further, if the scripture says that something means one thing, and it is turned around, it will have the opposite meaning. For example, a pastor once told his congregation that Mat. 28: 19-20 says, "19. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 20. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, [even] unto the end of the world. Amen. (KJV)" Then he told the congregation, "No go, no lo." He was literally telling his congregation that if they didn't go and preach the gospel, God would not be with them. Now we know that Heb.13:5 says, " . . . I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." So this man couldn't have been more wrong. Conceptual writing and thinking has never lent itself to this abstract approach because nothing will stand on its own. Every concept is built from a single thread that winds itself through the Bible developing a single concept, and if the thread is not followed in this manner, understanding the scripture may not be in line with the intended meaning.<br><br>Hebrews wrote the Bible, Genesis to Revelation, from a conceptual point of view. There is a possibility that Luke was not a Hebrew, but it is not likely even though his name is Greek. Many Jews to this day have non-Hebrew names. Some scholars believe that most, if not all, of the original letters were initially written in Hebrew or Aramaic then translated to Greek. Those who have only studied Greek tend to believe that the various writers of the New Testament were somewhat less than fluent in their Greek because there are so many grammatical errors in the text, but what they do not know is that the sentences containing the errors are grammatically perfect in Hebrew. For example, in Matthew 6:13 it says, "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. (KJV)" This sentence is written improperly in the Greek and English languages because of the use of the conjunction, and, but this sentence would be completely proper in the Hebrew language. It is apparent to those who read Hebrew that the text was written in a Semitic language from a conceptual point of view and translated into Greek for the Gentiles who could not read the original letters.<br><br>There is a difference between interpretation and application. There can only be one correct interpretation of scripture, but there are countless applications to a single interpretation. The difference is subtle but important. For instance, if I interpret Eph 5:1, "Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;" (KJV) to mean that I am to act like a small child, my application will be different than if I have interpreted it to mean "beloved offspring." There is a big difference in being told to act like small children and being told to act like the offspring of a King. The offspring are going to act like they are loved and belong, and perhaps more importantly, they will act their age, as well as act in a manner appropriate for a child of a king.<br><br>It takes specialized training to correctly interpret Biblical text. It is important to recognize each of the Hebrew/Greek symbols, dots, and dashes. A fairly good knowledge of Hebrew/Greek grammar as well as the ability to recognize which binyan/stem the individual word is using is also important. It doesn't take four years in a specialized Bible college to learn this approach of studying. Actually anyone can learn in a short amount of time over the internet from books or through someone who teaches locally. Some of these courses are free, and you can meet some fascinating people.<br><br>Some would say that relying on the Holy Spirit is all that is needed for interpretation, but this approach is not Biblical. The scriptures make it clear that we are to study. 2nd Tim 2:15 tells us to study, but more important than study is proper training. Peter speaks to this in 2nd Peter 3:15-17. In this scripture, Peter tells us that some things Paul wrote are hard to understand, and those who are  (amathes), pronounced {am-ath-ace'}, unlearned or uneducated, interpret the scriptures to their own destruction. You can get the job done without the proper tools, but it will not be done to exact standards or with any great precision. Peter was aware that the Spirit of God was our teacher and that all flesh was filled with the Spirit of God. He was there! Yet he still concludes that improper training can lead a Spirit-filled believer to his own destruction.<br><br>I am not saying that people canÂ’t teach the Bible without first learning proper methodology for translating the Hebrew and Greek text. We can teach the gospel from an abstract point of view and be correct. It can and does lead sinners to salvation and believers to a deeper relationship and understanding, but it still lacks the depth and beauty of the Biblical languages. By taking the time to learn the languages and the customs of Biblical times, we can transcend time and experience the stories of the Bible almost as though we were there. If you don't have the time to do this, find a teacher who does. It will be worth the effort.<br><br>Shalom,<br><br>Robert Allon<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus<br>Â“The Hem of His GarmentÂ”<br><br>Modern scholars have greater access to documents and research developments relating to first-century Judaism than at any other time in history. Many scholars, who only a few years ago were trying to disprove the Bible, are now working together to gain a better understanding of the ancient culture in which Jesus lived. Archaeological finds have become so plentiful that some have hailed these times as the beginning of a golden age of biblical archaeology.<br><br>All of these discoveries have not only given us further proof of the veracity of the Bible, but have given us a greater understanding of the period in which Jesus lived out His life on the earth and further evidence of the Jewishness of His teaching. He was Jewish and His teachings reflect His Jewishness.<br><br>The church at Rome was admonished by Paul that the Christian faith was never intended to be a repudiation of its Jewish roots, but rather, the engrafted Gentile Church was actually a branch that grew out of these roots (Rom. 11:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. The essence of these teachings is that without Judaism there would be no Christianity.<br><br>Perhaps the most convincing evidence of the thorough-going Jewishness of Jesus is His method of teaching Over the past fifty years, studies of the Jewish nature of the early Church have brought to light many new insights into the first century documents, especially concerning the idioms and Galilean teaching methods of Jesus. In these articles we will study some of the more common idioms in the life of Jesus and His disciples.<br><br>The Tzitzit and Prophecy<br><br>One important Jewish concept, which is often missed in English translations of the Bible, concerns the story of a woman with an issue of blood, recorded in Matthew 9:20-21. Having heard that the Messiah was near, the woman said within herself, "If I may but touch His garment, I shall be whole." The text indicates that it was specifically the hem of His garment that she touched, an important detail from an Hebraic viewpoint.<br><br>The English word hem is a translation of a Greek word meaning a tassel of twisted wool. The woman was, in fact, reaching for the tassels on Jesus prayer shawl. In Hebrew, these tassels, which are attached to the corners of the prayer shawl, are called tzitzit. They were, and still are, worn by observant Jews in fulfillment of the biblical commandments found in Numbers 15:37-41 and Deuteronomy 22:12 and are intended to remind the people of God s commandments.<br><br>In Numbers 15:38 the word translated border or corner is a Hebrew word which can also be translated wings as it is some seventy-six times in the biblical text. For this reason, the corners of the prayer shawl are often called wings. Each tzitzit consists of five double knots and eight threads, a total of thirteen elements. This number added to six hundred, the Hebraic numerical value of the word tzitzit points to the six hundred and thirteen commandments of the Torah.<br><br>The Tzitzit and Jesus<br><br>In Jesus' day, Jewish men wore a simple tunic both at home and at work. When appearing in public, they would cover their tunic with a large rectangular cloth which draped over the shoulder and fell to the ankles. This cloth was called a tallit and served as protection from cold and rain. Hanging from the end of each of its four corners (wings) was a tzitzit in obedience to the biblical command.<br><br>Through the centuries, during times of persecution, Jews were often forbidden to wear the tzitzit on the outside of their garments. This forced them to wear a small four-cornered tallit under their shirts. Today the prayer shawl is called a tallit.<br><br>During the first century there were several traditions associated with the tzitzit concerning Messiah. One was that these knotted fringes possessed healing powers. This tradition has its roots in the prophecy of Malachi 4:2 where the Messiah is said to be coming with healing in His wings.<br><br>The Sun of Righteousness<br><br>Certainly the woman with the issue of blood knew of these traditions, which would explain why she sought to touch the corner (the wings) of Jesus' prayer garment. The same word used in Numbers 15:38 for corner is used in Malachi 4:2 for wings. With this understanding in mind, an ancient Jew under the prayer shawl could be said to be dwelling in the secret place of the Most High and under His wings (Ps. 91:1-4). When one realized the significance of this concept to the first-century Hebraic mind, it becomes clear why this woman was instantly healed. She was expressing her faith in Jesus as the Son of Righteousness with healing in His wings and declaring her faith in God's prophetic Word.<br><br>Personal Application<br><br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever. He is still able to heal, in every way, those who will press in to touch the hem of His garment. He is still the Son of Righteousness with Healing in His Wings. As we seek Him with our whole heart, let us expect His healing power to make us whole in every area of our life.<br></div>
