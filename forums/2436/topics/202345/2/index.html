How did I react any different? did I insult you? did I deride you? no, i just took your advice because I thought it might be best... at least I don't stay there an antagonise you... not my intention.

I start my own forum, afterall it was your idea... so you blame me for your suggestion? I am also offering another point of view, it is up to you whether you want to accept it or not.

It is my call right? but you guys just name call... did I call you any names in all of this? even if I did I apologised, at least I had the courtesy to... I get called a judiazer, I get called a heretic... and worse... but is there an apology coming from any of the members of EH? so much for the courtesy campaign in singapore...<br><br>I post another point of view and you say I am insistent that my way is right when you push your ways as hard as I do mine?

I just don't get it. Yahweh is really specific and when He spoke to the Israelites He was very specific in giving instructions and not just the general principle... and if Malachi 3:6 is to be believed, then He does not change. So why would He change anything with us christians today??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>well, let's start from the beginning.....<br><br>I posted a link that is contrary to your belief.

Your second post was totally unnecessary. I DID NOT POST ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS ISSUE AFTER your apology.<br><br>If you still don't understand all these... it's ok.... no need to worry about it anymore.<br><br>Am I flippant over what God said? No! Here's the crux, God spoke to the ISRAELITES. God did not speak to the Gentiles. You go on and on about the issue that they are the same thing, NT shows otherwise. It is very clear in the NT that Jews and Gentiles are different folks.

But if your name is say new_b and I call you new_d, does it make a difference to you? of course. Likewise, Yeshua is the name of our saviour. Yeshua means salvation, but Jesus has no meaning other than it was a wrong translation from the greek bible.<br><br>Some may argue that the new testament was written in greek and never hebrew, but there is now evidence that the new testament was written in hebrew. If you read the topic on Jesus or Yeshua, you will understand clearer how this mistake occured.<br><br>Thank you for stopping by and shalom to you!</div>

So, using the actual names is good/useful especially when it comes to character studies to know that person better.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Eg ruth... she took naomi's God to be her God, and naomi's people to be her people. And if for so long Yahweh did it this way, then why would He change things just for the gentiles today? The only thing that has been "changed" is the way by which we gain our citizenship, it is through faith in Yeshua. This is the grace that we have.<br><br>We are told in the new testament that we have become partakers of the promise of avraham through faith in Yeshua and that we are part of the commomwealth of ISRAEL and fellow citizens (Eph2) together with the saints and of the same household, that was built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets.<br><br>Now if you are a citizen of a particular country whose laws and guidelines do you have to obey and uphold?<br><br>It is stated clearly in Eph2 that we ARE citizens of the commonwealth of ISRAEL, if Yahweh wanted it to be any different, He would have said commonwealth of believers or something else... and to make things clear as to what we are to be like or to follow, Shaul clarifies this point by saying that this citizenship that we have is built upon the foundation of not just the apostles, but the prophets. Implying that it is built upon the new and the old testaments... the new is a progression of the old, you cannot have the new alone because then there would be no proper foundation and the new would just be a cult.<br><br>If Yahweh had really meant any different, why do we have in revelations John writing about a new Jerusalem and whose names are written on the gates of the new city? none other than the names of the twelve tribes of ISRAEL.<br></div>
