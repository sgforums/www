Allah was then known as the Moon God, who had 3 daughters who were viewed as intercessors for the people into Allah. Their names were Al-at, Al-uzza, and Al-Manat, which were three goddesses; the first two daughters of Allah had names which were feminine forms of Allah.

This is why Hubal, the Moon god, (known by other names) was the central focus of prayer at the Kaabah and people prayed to Hubal and they used the name Allah. The crescent moon was the symbol of the moon God Allah (Hubal) and is still used as a symbol of Islam today (although they have changed the meaning to be -from Mecca to the moon Islam will spread). Today there is hardly a Muslim that knows its ancient origin. History records it as an ancient pagan fertility symbol that is found throughout the Middle East.

The God of the Bible is personal and wants an ongoing friendship with each of us. Islam portrays God as one who expects us to do our religious duty or He angers. There are rules to be obeyed and one can only please him but not know him personally. No Muslim would ever consider being able to have a personal relationship with him, by talking to him, and loving him. Jesus instead taught Christians to pray Â“our Father in heavenÂ” (Matthew 6:9). Throughout the Old Testament God was real to the prophets who had him personally speak to them and they to him. Â“Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously with one another by profaning the covenant of the fathers?Â” (Mal 2:10)<br><br>The God in the Bible is called the God of the Jews, an impossibility with Allah. They are called his chosen people, but they are not Allah's chosen. Allah commands the Muslim to not take the Jews or Christians as friends, Sura.5:51 disdains the Jews. Mohammed said, Â“The last hour will not come before the Muslims fight the Jews, and the Muslims kill them.Â” (Mishkat Al Masabih Sh.M. Ashraf pp.147, 721, 810-11, 1130). So how could Israel inherit the land or any of God's promises from Allah, if he is their God. Clearly he is not the same God of the Bible.</div>

You've got to better than that.... Yaffa.<br></div></blockquote>Hi CE,<br><br>Did a search on wikis.. here is what I found, if we take the traditional or conservative Jewish perspective according to Jewish law, then yes, religion follows the mother.<br><br>Traditional (Halakhic) perspective<br>According to the traditional Rabbinic view, which is maintained by all branches of Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism today, only Halakha ("Jewish law" ) can define who is or is not a Jew when a question of Jewish identity, lineage, or parentage arises about any person seeking to define themselves or claim that they are a "Jew" or "Jewish".<br><br>Therefore, Halakha defines a "Jew" as someone, male or female, who is:<br><br>Either<br><br>(1) The child of a Jewish mother, known in English as "matrilineal descent". This tradition is derived from Deuteronomy 7:4.[1] [2]<br>or<br><br>(2) A person who converts, meaning, formally converted to Judaism under the auspices of a halakhically constituted and recognized Beth Din ("Court [of Jewish-Torah Law]" ) consisting preferably of three learned rabbis acting as Dayanim ("judges" ), but also possibly two learned and respected lay members of the community along with a rabbi who then issue a Shtar geirut ("Certificate of Conversion" ).<br>Who the first Jews were is a matter of some controversy. Some maintain that it was those who were present, bodily, at the revelation of the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai; others maintain that Abraham and Sarah were the first Jews.<br><br>This standard for conversion is mandated by a long series of codes of law and texts, including the Talmud, through the Shulkhan Arukh, and subsequent interpretations that are held as authoritative by Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism.<br><br>As a result, mere belief in the principles of Judaism does not make one a Jew. Similarly, non-adherence by a Jew to the Jewish principles of faith, or even formal conversion to another faith, does not make one lose one's Jewish status. Thus the immediate descendants of all female Jews (even apostates) are still considered to be Jews, as are those of all her female descendants. Even those descendants who are not aware they are Jews, or practice a faith other than Judaism, are technically still Jews, as long as they come from an unbroken female line of descent. As a corollary, the children of a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother are not considered to be Jews by Orthodoxy or Conservatism unless they formally convert, even if raised practising Judaism.<br><br>Those not born to a Jewish mother may become accepted as Jews by the Orthodox and Conservative movements through a formal and usually difficult process of conversion to Judaism in order to become "true converts" (Geirei tzedek in Hebrew), and they are then accepted as Jews by the movement doing the conversion. In addition, Halakha requires that the new convert commits himself to observance of its tenets; this is called Kabbalat Ol Mitzvot, "Acceptance [of the] Yoke [of the] Commandments", the most important being the observance of Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath), Kashrut (the dietary laws), Niddah (husband and wife abstaining from sexual contact during menstruation).<br><br>Conversion is still relatively rare, and typically discouraged. Orthodoxy does not accept the validity of non-Orthodox conversions; it recognises only those conversions in which the new convert accepts and undertakes to observe Halakha as interpreted by the teachings of Orthodox Judaism. Non-Orthodox rabbis do not require that converts make this commitment, and therefore do not perform conversions accepted under Orthodoxy. Additionally, because of the constant internal differences within all groups, it is not unusual for rabbis to be suspicious of conversions performed by their colleagues.<br><br>Conservative Judaism may accept the validity of some Reform and Reconstructionist conversions, but only if they include immersion in a ritual bath (mikvah), appearance before a rabbinical court (beit din) and, for men, circumcision (brit milah) or a symbolic circumcision for those already circumcised (hatfah dam brit).<br><br>Taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F" rel="nofollow">WhoisaJew?</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and an exerpt from another webpage not wiki...<br><br>Who is a Jew according to Halacha (Jewish Law)?<br>According to Jewish law, a child born to a Jewish mother or an adult who has converted to Judaism is considered a Jew; one does not have to reaffirm their Jewishness or practice any of the laws of the Torah to be Jewish. According to Reform Judaism, a person is a Jew if they were born to either a Jewish mother or a Jewish father. Also, Reform Judaism stresses the importance of being raised Jewish; if a child is born to Jewish parents and was not raised Jewish then the child is not considered Jewish. According to the Orthodox movement, the fatherÂ’s religion and whether the person practices is immaterial. No affirmation or upbringing is needed, as long as the mother was Jewish.<br><br>Besides for differing opinions on patrilineal descent, the various streams also have different conversion practices. Conversion done under the auspices of an Orthodox rabbi, entails Jewish study, brit milah (for men), mikvah (for both men and women) and a stated commitment to follow the laws of the Torah. Conservative conversions use the same requirements as the Orthodox do; however, conversions by the Reform movement and other streams do not have the same requirements. Since the conversion practices are not uniform, many Orthodox Jews do not recognize Reform or Conservative conversions as valid and, hence, do not consider the converts Jews. Once a person has converted to Judaism, he is not referred to by any special term; he is as much a Jew as anyone born Jewish.<br><br>About Matrilineal Descent<br>Many people have asked why traditional Judaism uses matrilineal descent to determine Jewish status, when in all other things (tribal affiliation, priestly status, royalty, etc.) patrilineal descent is used.<br><br>The Torah does not specifically state anywhere that matrilineal descent should be used; however, there are several passages in the Torah where it is understood that the child of a Jewish woman and a non-Jewish man is a Jew, and several other passages where it is understood that the child of a non-Jewish woman and a Jewish man is not a Jew.<br><br>In Deuteronomy 7:1-5, in expressing the prohibition against intermarriage, G-d says "he [ie, the non-Jewish male spouse] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods of others." No such concern is expressed about the child of a non-Jewish female spouse. From this, we infer that the child of a non-Jewish male spouse is Jewish (and can therefore be turned away from Judaism), but the child of a non-Jewish female spouse is not Jewish (and therefore turning away is not an issue).<br><br>Leviticus 24:10 speaks of the son of an Israelite woman and an Egyptian man as being "among the community of Israel" (i.e., a Jew).<br><br>On the other hand, in Ezra 10:2-3, the Jews returning to Israel vowed to put aside their non-Jewish wives and the children born to those wives. They could not have put aside those children if those children were Jews.<br><br>by Rebecca Weiner <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/whojew1.html" rel="nofollow">Jewish Virtual Library</a></div>

The reason Yaakov gives for choosing Ephraim and Manasseh is because they were the sons born to Yosef before his father and brothers came to Egypt. HaShem is rewarding Yosef's sons through adopting them into Yisrael. Therefore, HaShemÂ’s reward for YosefÂ’s steadfast faith is the grafting-in of Ephraim and Manasseh. In other words, because Yosef remained faithful during the separation from his family, HaShemÂ’s reward to Yosef is an equal portion in the land HaShem promised AvrahamÂ’s descendents. In fact, BÂ’reisheet 41:50 states Ephraim and Manasseh were born to Â“Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.Â” We can see that HaShem is making YosefÂ’s non-Hebrew sons part of the commonwealth of Yisrael. Yaakov even places the blessings of three generations on the heads of Ephraim and Manasseh, as BÂ’reisheet 48:16 states Â“The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.Â” Yaakov retroactively brought them into the covenant by placing the names of Yitzak and Avraham on their heads. HaShem completely replaced their Egyptian ancestry with Hebrew ancestry. Therefore, Ephraim and Manasseh become a symbol of the concern HaShem has for all nations. BÂ’reisheet 48:20 states Â“In you shall Yisrael bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh.Â” It is clear that one form of encouragement HaShem gives to His servants is a reward for their faithfulness.<br><br>See also:<br><br><a href="http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/041224/torah.shtml" rel="nofollow">Ephraim and Manasseh</a></div>
