            <div class='col-md body'><br>The Hebrews have never believed in a trinity the way the Western world does. They have always believed that there is only one God with a triune nature, and man was created in that image. The Hebrews have recited the prayer of "sh'ma" (pronounced shma) every day for centuries now, and it comes in part from Deut. 6:4, "Hear O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD." (KJV)<br><br>This is the Hebrew text,  It reads like this if we substitute our alphabet for the Hebrew symbols, "sh'ma yisrael YHVH elohÃ©nu YHVH ekhad."<br><br>When the Bible translates the word,  (elohÃ©nu), it simply gives us "God", "God of us", or "our God". What some people don't know is that all Hebrew words have numeric and gender specific values. This word is both masculine and feminine, but more importantly, its numeric value is three or more. This would seem contradictory to the word, ekhad, which is translated as "one" unless you know that ekhad means one by the joining of many, like a rope. So the meaning of elohÃ©nu is, "Our God who is above all gods, three or more in number, both masculine and feminine, superior in power and might, by the joining of many becoming greater in strength in unity as one."<br><br>If you take a single strand of rope between your hands and yank really hard, you can easily brake it. However, if you take three or more strands and wind them together very tightly, you probably won't be able to break the rope. The idea of one by the joining of many is that no part or portion is complete without the other. God has no body outside of the Son, The Son has no Spirit outside of the Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost has no soul outside the Father. They are not separated in any way. They are not three, separate or distinct entities. They are three, separate and distinct facets of one entity.<br><br>In Gen. 2:23-24, Adam says two things that are important for us to understand. First, the text says, "because she was taken out of Man." (KJV) Here is the Hebrew,  Transliterated into our alphabet it looks like this, "meish luqakhahÂ—zot." The first word, meish, means "from man or from husband." The words, luqakhahÂ—zot, mean "this was taken out." In other words, everything that makes a woman female was inside of the man in the first place. God took those things out of the man, who was created perfect, complete, and whole in the image of God, then He created a woman. Adam then says, "and they shall be one flesh." (KJV) They shall be "ekhad" flesh. This word has absolutely nothing to do with sex in any way. The idea of the man and woman becoming ekhad is that they are incomplete one without the other. Simply put, a man is only half a human, and a woman is only half a human. A man and a woman combining their thoughts, emotions, passions, wants, needs and desires creates one whole Adam which means human.<br><br>In John 10:30, the Pharisees (Hebrews) asked the Lord to tell them plainly if He was the Messiah. The Lord didn't answer their question, instead He said, "ani v'haav ekhad." Translated literally into English that simply says, "I and the Father are one." To the Hebrew mind, this was an outrageous and blasphemous thing to say, because to the Hebrews what the Lord said was, "I am God." "I am one of the strands that is God. That makes me God.(the flesh)" We know without a doubt that this is how the Hebrews took the statement, because in the very next verse, they picked up stones to kill Him. The punishment for blasphemy was death by stoning.<br><br>There is only one God, and He is made up of many strands like a rope. To split God into three, distinct parts is actually a simplification of who He is. God is Righteousness, Love, Joy, Peace, Power, Might, Flesh, Spirit, Soul, Body, etc., all bound together like the chords of a rope making Him one God, who is Savior and Lord of all. God does not exist without righteousness anymore than He exists without His Spirit.<br><br>Shalom,<br><br>Robert Allon<br></div>

But God exists in three persons ("...baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:" - Matthew 28:19 - notice that it is "name" and not "names", indicating that there is only one God). Jesus showed that He and the Father are only One God when He said "I and my Father are one" (John 10:30). They are related as follows: The Father sent The Son (John 3:16) and the Father and the Son sent the Spirit (John 14:26; 15:26).<br><a href="http://www.lifefebc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifefebc.com/</a><br><br>The Trinity - God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit<br>The Bible teaches that there is ONE God, and there are THREE persons - Father, Son and the Holy Spirit (the Holy Trinity). The Bible affirms that each of these three persons has divine attributes, titles, and actions and accords to them the worship that is due to Deity.<br><a href="http://www.livingstreams.org.sg/sac/info/beliefs/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.livingstreams.org.sg/sac/info/beliefs/index.html</a><br><br>Just a few examples I dug up CE... it is common teaching that Yahweh is believed to be ONE God, but 3 persons. This I disagree with because if Yahweh is one, how can He be three persons? (can you see the oxymoron here?) He is not 3 persons, but different facets of the same Yahweh. It is clearly explained in the article...<br><br>Yahweh is ONE GOD, but with 3 different facets or aspects... but there is more to Yahweh than just these, because Yahweh is also Love... etc...<br><br>That is why the Jews say Shema Israel Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad. Hear O Israel the Lord thy God is ONE God. Nothing mentioned about 3 persons... thought you might like to know.</div>
