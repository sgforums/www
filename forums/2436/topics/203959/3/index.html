            <div class='col-md body'>sorry brey, we agreed to stop, but I am responding to Yaffa.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yaffa:</div><div class="quote_body">You asked in a previous post about English translations of the New Testament which are more true Hebraically, using original names of people including Yeshua: HRV, Jewish New Testament, Complete Jewish Bible, ISR, just for example, there are more.<br></div></blockquote>Yup, and they are all the Jewish version of the Bible (English edition nonetheless).

I also don't believe that the Hebrew people were 100% right. If you say that the Protestant church broke away because of the errors and on the same note, the Hebraic roots are developing too, why don't you give benefit of doubt that the Protestant churches is working it out, base on continual wisdom given by our Lord, instead of condemning all of being wrong.

What deeper understanding would the use of Yeshua achieve? Let me say that I do not disagree with a deeper study of the Scripture as well as understand the Hebrew culture by looking at the background and the nuances of the language, but it fails me to see just the use of Yeshua would increase my understanding of scripture. So I ask you, Yaffa, say, I am a Chinese educated Christian, one without hope of learning other language, use Ye1 Su1, would this impede my spiritual life?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yaffa:</div><div class="quote_body">If Jesus were preached by His real Name, Yeshua, they would probably preach and teach that His name means salvation or saviour.

Through anti-semitism, much or all of His Jewishness has been obliterated.<br></div></blockquote>Strange, we are all told in church that Jesus also means Saviour. So therefore, from young, we are told that the name Jesus means this, how can it not have any meaning? I am sure in the dialect churches, Yar1 Sor1 (hokkien), Yeah Soh (cantonese), Ye1 Su1 (mandarin) means exactly the same thing - Saviour.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yaffa:</div><div class="quote_body">We are all learning, and the Lord reveals something to everyone.

I have never ever say that the opinions posted so far by you or brey are wrong. I am saying that in some of these instances, because of the authors, they are inclined towards a certain strata of people - the scholars. It has not meaning to those in the lower echelon of society and neither is it practical for them. As a matter of fact, the ONLY thing that I wish to get across is - don't say that it's incorrect or spiritually immature to use "Jesus". I think, brey and I have an understanding on that.  You statement above: "We are all learning..... to be humble and to submit...." Is it a two way statement or do you just mean me? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Too many and too long?
