And how do you know what it is to love thy neighbour as thyself? Yeshua said, if you love me keep my commandments as I have kept MY FATHER'S commandments. Which of His fathers commandments do you think He meant?<br><br>So the cycle continues, if you say you follow the ways of Yahweh, yet choose to keep a different sabbath, choose to celebrate feasts like chirstmas and easter, are you really keeping HIS ways? From my understanding that Yahweh is a jealous God and will not share His glory with another, how then do you think that He will condone sharing His birth and ressurection with days which are taken from paganism? It is the subtle naunces that ha sa tan will try and pervert the church, you say it is harmless, it means nothing, but how do you know that it does not grieve Yahweh? If you know His Character, you will know that it is unacceptable to Him.<br><br>Ask yourself a simple question. Should those who claim to be Christian take the Bible seriously? In Jeremiah 10:2, Yahweh declared to His people through the pen of the prophet: "Do not learn the way of the Gentiles." He went on to state that "the customs of the peoples are futile," that is, they are utterly empty and useless. God wants His people to follow His instructions, not to look at pagan practices and seek to copy them. What kind of empty, pagan customs was Jeremiah talking about in Jeremiah 10? The specific example in that chapter involved going out into the woods, cutting a tree and bringing it home to set it upright and decorate it (vv. 3Â–4). Does this sound amazingly like putting up a Christmas tree?</div>

So there is nothing to retract.<br><br>But in saying that using Jesus is not wrong, does that mean that there is meaning to the name Jesus except that it is a transliteration of a transliteration? No, Jesus as a name has not meaning.<br><br>But Jesus is an english name which is a term used by Christians to refer to  Yeshua. I never said this was wrong either, so there is nothing to retract.<br><br>When young believers and non-believers in the faith start out, they call upon the name of Jesus, like I said so did I, but if you continue to grow in the faith, you will continue to learn more, and certain things will mean more to you than when you first started, when I started my walk with Yeshua, I called on the name of Jesus, but now that I am older, I know His real name, Yeshua, which means saviour, so I choose to use Yeshua because it has meaning.<br><br>Learning that Jesus is a transliteration of a transliteration, somehow makes the name twice removed from what it originally was, but I am sure that you can still call upon Jesus. Like I said it is a term used by Christians to refer to Yeshua.

Yahweh can help these people appreciate the hebraic concept very easily and if they are seeking, He will show it to them. Or do you doubt Yahweh?<br></div></blockquote>Has this been an ongoing project? Not that I noticed... Maybe we should discuss this in twenty years time? seeing that nothing much was done from the Hebraic standpoint globally. Of course, if God wanted to do something about it, sure he can..... but seeing that in the past thousand years or so, something else has taken place, then we can either assume that God is in control of this something else as well, or are you prepared to state that God didn't do anything?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">Why should the name thing offend you so much? I already said it is not wrong to use Jesus, but Yeshua is the more meaningful name. So then the ultimate choice is still left up to the individual so why are you so offended?

I choose to use the name of my saviour that is more meaningful to me.<br><br>Side topic: Greeks use chirstos or christ to refer to any one who is anointed or can be a god, so to term this with Yeshua is to cheapen His name in my opinion, this makes Yeshua on par with the myraid of other anointed beings or gods out there and this is just simply not the case. He is so MUCH MORE THAN THAT!!!! </div></blockquote>So when you look at the cross (borrowing from ben), do you see the suffering of Jesus or do you see a Roman symbol of torture (which is what it really is).<br><br>Err... when I last check, I don't recognise the myriad of anointed beings or gods out there.... you are telling me they exists?
