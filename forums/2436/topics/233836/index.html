            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbi Shmuley Boteach<br><br><strong>The mega-millionaire's unbridled misogyny in his public feud with Rosie O'Donnell is nothing but a venom-filled display.</strong><br><br>Is it asking too much for America's most famous businessman to simply behave like a gentleman? I don't think so. With great wealth and fame come responsibility, the foremost of which for a man of power is the proper treatment of women.<br><br>For weeks, America has been riveted by the nasty public dispute between Rosie O'Donnell and Donald Trump. Rosie, commenting on Trump's ownership of beauty pageants, called Trump "a pimp," an unnecessarily harsh term that obscured an otherwise important point, namely, that Trump owns beauty pageants that exploit women as cheap meat to entertain lecherous men.<br><br>There were many ways for Trump to respond to O'Donnell's opening salvo. He could have ignored her, debated her, or simply said that he is prepared to respond to legitimate criticism, but not when it is vented with venom.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Instead, Trump, who like many narcissistic men has a very thin public skin, erupted like a bile-filled volcano. Refusing to respond to any of Rosie's points, he instead called her "a slob," "disgusting," and "an animal." Now, whatever provocation Rosie might be guilty ofÂ—and why undermine a sound moral argument by using names?Â—one recoils at the spectacle of America's best-known businessman betraying unbridled misogyny by hating a woman for being overweight.<br><br>Indeed, Donald Trump represents a completely new paradigm in the evolution of male honor, with grave repercussions for those who aspire to be gentlemen.<br><br>Men begin life with superficial dreams: to make money, to be powerful, or to be famous. But as we get older and wiser, those dreams hopefully evolve and mature into something more wholesome. Bill Gates crushed competitors and became the world's richest man. But then his passion was transformed from selling software into giving away his billions. A similar transition occurred within his good friend Warren Buffet. Bill Clinton aspired to power and influence. But after his reputation was sullied through impeachment, he wished to be respected and launched an impressive array of international initiatives to help the downtrodden.<br><br>Trump, however, has never outgrown his obsession for unbridled self-aggrandizement. Indeed, he has not evolved, but devolved. His narcissism and boastfulness scrape the skies just like his buildings. Enlightenment seems utterly beyond Trump, who continues to believe that self-glorification is life's only purpose. If wisdom's highest manifestation is the human ability to discern a cause greater than oneself, then Trump is mired in an abyss of self-absorbed darkness.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now, normally, such monumental flaws would be no one's business but the subject himself. The difference, however, is that Trump's success-through-boastfulness augurs ill for the rest of us.<br><br>Ancient codes of honor dictated that a while a man should aspire to greatness, he should do so with a whisper. Let others speak of his feats of daring. A gentleman is not crass and is certainly not a braggart. Indeed, boasting of one's achievements undermines them, as it betrays insecurity rather than confidence, and weakness rather than strength.<br><br>These codes held that troubadours and minstrels could create your legend, as Homer did for Achilles and an unnamed bard did for Beowulf. To crow of oneself, however, was the height of vulgarity.<br><br>But Trump has built his brand name through sheer and unending braggadocio, and as such, has made it challenging, and perhaps impossible, for the rest of us not to follow suit. After Trump, if you want to build your brand, you have to brag, humility be damned. When one shouts above the din, then those who seek to live modestly will forever be dwarfed by those who seek success at any cost.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Moreover, the ancient codes of male honor dictated that a gentleman was judged first and foremost by his treatment of women. Trump's nauseating attacks on Rosie's body mass betray a man who denies women an independent identity and creates them solely in a man's image. Who determines how women should look? Trump and his testosterone-filled friends. Rosie, who lacks an hourglass figure, fails to entertain him, and is therefore a primate. He had every right to criticize her words, but not her weight; her opinion, but not her shape.<br><br>But the hallmark of the misogynist is the conviction that all women belong to him and he therefore retains the right to pass judgment on every aspect of these servants. During slavery, black women were put on the block and studied for the health of their gums and teeth. Trump's beauty pageants are slightly more sublime, focusing instead on the shapeliness of a woman's breasts and the length of her legs. Beauty pageants are really nothing more than the respectable man's pornography, and their existence in the year 2007 undermines our nation's claims to societal sophistication.<br><br>What Donald Trump has invented is a new kind of rich man. The man who has money, but is bereft of class. The man with a million bucks, but with impoverished manners. The man who lives in high society, but whose behavior is in the gutter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Trump is also proof that one can be immensely rich but feel extremely poor. Nothing seems to fill this man up. All the money in the world will not grant him the self-esteem that has permanently eluded him, and for which he must compensate through boasting. Character, rather than money, is the real currency by which we are meant to purchase self-esteem.<br><br>Trump is a billionaire businessman. And yet you and I own him. We are his masters. He lives in our small pockets. Everything he does is calculated to impress us. If he buys a building, he needs us to know of it. If his show has high ratings he needs us to read of it. He does not crave our approval, he is utterly dependent on it. Amazing. To be worth billions, and still be the slave of the public.<br><br>There is good in Trump. He seems to be a loving father, and he recently praised Israel and announced a major development project in Tel Aviv. And there is always hope that perhaps one day he will take his responsibility as a public role model seriously and aspire to be a more refined gentleman.<br></div>
