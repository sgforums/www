            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong>SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM: UNDERSTANDING.</strong></span><br><br><strong>Firstly, what is Yahweh's definition of understanding: Keeping His statutes and judgements. </strong><br><br>Deuteronomy 4:5-6<br>5 Â“Surely I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should act according to them in the land which you go to possess. 6 Therefore be careful to observe them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, Â‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.Â’<br><br>Psalm 119:104<br>Through Your precepts I get understanding;Therefore I hate every false way.<br><br>Proverbs 9:10<br>Â“ The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.<br><br><strong>Understanding is from Yahweh.</strong><br><br>Job 32:8<br>But there is a spirit in man,And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding.<br><br>Proverbs 2:6<br>For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding;<br><br><strong>Understanding gives us discernment.</strong><br><br>1 Kings 3:9<br>Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?Â”<br><br><strong>Understanding allows us to know what to do.</strong><br><br>1 Chronicles 12:32<br>of the sons of Issachar who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their chiefs were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their command;<br><br><strong>Understanding is departing from the ways of evil.</strong><br><br>Job 28:28<br>And to man He said,Â‘ Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, And to depart from evil is understanding.Â’Â”<br><br><strong>Understanding leads to life.</strong><br><br>Psalm 119:144<br>The righteousness of Your testimonies is everlasting;Give me understanding, and I shall live.<br><br>Proverbs 2:11<br>Discretion will preserve you; Understanding will keep you,<br><br>Proverbs 16:22<br>Understanding is a wellspring of life to him who has it. But the correction of fools is folly.<br><br><strong>Understanding can gain us favour.</strong><br><br>Proverbs 13:15<br>Good understanding gains favor, But the way of the unfaithful is hard.<br><br><strong>Understanding leads to a calm spirit.</strong><br><br>Proverbs 17:27<br>He who has knowledge spares his words, And a man of understanding is of a calm spirit.<br><br><strong>Understanding helps one find good.</strong><br><br>Proverbs 19:8<br>He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; He who keeps understanding will find good.<br><br><strong>Understanding helps to draw out deep counsel.</strong><br><br>Proverbs 20:5<br>Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, But a man of understanding will draw it out.<br><br><strong>Understanding establishes you.</strong><br><br>Proverbs 24:3<br>Through wisdom a house is built, And by understanding it is established;<br><br></div>
