For they have turned their back to Me, and not their face....<br><br>Whilst reading the bible this morning, this verse sort of jumped out at me. The immediate thing that came to mind was that very often when we are facing problems we do not turn our faces toward Yahweh, we rather turn our backs to Him and try finding a solution away from Him, turn our faces to Him in times of trouble and He will show you the way to walk through the time of adversity.<br><br>On the converse side as well, when times are going well, we also turn our faces away from Yahweh, but it is in these times that we have to face Him to get the full benefit of our nuturing from Yahweh our Elohim.</div>

Do you not perceive that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him, 19 because it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and is eliminated, thus purifying all foods?Â” 20 And He said, Â“What comes out of a man, that defiles a man. 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 22 thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. 23 All these evil things come from within and defile a man.Â”</blockquote></div>

Obviously, I would not even just use one section of the scripture to justify one stand - you know me too well to know that I would not do that.<br><br>Nonetheless, the critical point is: Peter's reaction to what he'd seen which obviously offended him. His first reaction is natural, based on his mindset and perhaps an inkling to "a trial from YHWH"?. Note the number of times the vision was repeated, plus the affirmation from the most high.<br><br>The real issue, of course, is NOT about the offending food, but Peter's attitude towards the Gentiles. However, the fact that "food" was chosen to illustrate a point God wanted to make speaks volumes on the change (or at least the differentiation between Jews and Gentiles) of focus (or practice). Note also the operative verb - EAT!<br><br>Whether or not Peter starts eating non-kosher food is not the issue, but the fact that as a practicing Jew, Peter was told by the Holy Spirit that those things considered unclean is no longer so.<br><br>The lesson to be learnt: There are no more unclean things as defined by the Jewish liturgy. Yes many laws were written in the OT pertaining on how the Jews should live, however, in light of a fast changing world, God through the Holy Spirit taught a lesson to on of the most orthodox Jews of all, and as a true disciple of God, Peter obeyed.<br><br>Are we prepared to accept Scripture at face value or do we attempt to insert meanings there are not present in the first place in order to satisfy our own world view?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Here's not to say that I think that those who insists on eating kosher food is wrong.</span><br></div>

The purification of food referred to the way the body's digestive system eliminated minor impurities such as might be present from eating with unwashed hands.<br><br>In context, Yeshua came and obeyed all the commandments, so He would not have eaten any meat considered unclean. The Pharisees, like Yeshua and His disciples, ate only meat from which the scriptures considered clean. The objection given by the pharisees here is to eating of clean food with unclean hands because Yeshua and His disciples did not go through the Pharisee' customary ritual of meticulously washing their hands before eating.<br><br>Yeshua whose hands were sufficiently clean for eating, even if not clean enough to meet the Pharisees' humanly devised standards, explained that the human body was designed to handle any small particles of dust or dirt that might enter it due to handling food with hands that handnot been ritually washed.

Cleansing one's thoughts, Yeshua said, is eminently more spiritually important than washing ones's hands (verses 20-23).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On Kefa's (Peter's) vision in Acts 10...<br><br>One often-misunderstood section of the Bible concerns Peter's vision in which he "saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth." In this sheet "were all kinds of fourÂ—footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air." Peter heard a voice tell him, "Rise, Peter; kill and eat" (Acts 10:11-13).<br><br>Assuming the vision meant he should eat unclean animals, Peter spontaneously responded: "Not so, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean" (verse 14). The same vision came to Peter three times (verse 16).<br><br>At this point many readers, without finishing the account, assume they know the meaning of the visionÂ—that Yahweh told Peter we are now free to eat any kind of animal flesh we desire. In context, however, these scriptures show that this is not at all what Peter understood. On the contrary, even after seeing the vision three times he still "wondered within himself what this vision which he had seen meant" (verse 17).<br><br>Later Peter realized the significance of the revelation. It was that "Yahweh has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean" (verse 28 ). Recognizing the real intent of the vision, Peter baptized the first gentiles (non-Israelites) Yahweh called into the Church (verses 45-48 ).<br><br>This divine disclosure, we see from reading further in the account, did not concern food at all. Rather, it concerned people. Because the Jewish religious leaders at the time of Yeshua had erroneously considered gentiles to be unclean, this dramatic vision righted a common misperception that had come to affect Peter and other members of the Church. It demonstrated that Yahweh was beginning to offer salvation to members of any race. Gentiles whom Yahweh was calling were now welcomed into the Church.<br><br>Far from abolishing Yahweh's instructions against eating unclean meats, these verses show that, almost 20 years after Christ's death, Peter had "never eaten anything common or unclean."<br><br>Peter obviously had not assumed that Yahweh had annulled His own food laws or that Yeshua's death and resurrection rendered them obsolete. From Peter's own words we see that he continued to faithfully follow those laws.<br><br>Nor do we find any evidence that he ate unclean meats after this experience. He obviously continued to obey Yahweh's laws delineating meats that could and could not be eaten and saw no reason to change his practice. He realized that the puzzling vision could not be annulling Yahweh's instructions, which is why he "thought about the vision" until he understood its meaning (verses 17-19, 28 )-that gentiles could become members of the Church, too (verses 34-35, 45-48 ).<br><br></div>

Many Bible resources agree that Paul wrote the book of 1 Corinthians around A.D. 55 and that he wrote his epistle to the Romans from Corinth in 56 or 57. As demonstrated above, the food controversy in Corinth was over meat sacrificed to idols. Since Paul was writing to the Romans from Corinth, where this had been a significant issue, the subject was fresh on Paul's mind and is the logical, biblically supported basis for his comments in Romans 14.<br><br>continued...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Understanding Paul's intent<br><br>Those who assume the subject of Romans 14 is a retraction of God's law regarding clean and unclean animals must force this interpretation into the text because it has no biblical foundation. The historical basis for the discussion appears, from evidence in the chapter itself, to have been meat sacrificed to idols.<br><br>Verse 2 contrasts the one who "eats only vegetables" with the one who believes "he may eat all things"Â—meat as well as vegetables. Verse 6 discusses eating vs. not eating and is variously interpreted as referring to fasting (not eating or drinking), vegetarianism (consuming only vegetables) or eating or not eating meat sacrificed to idols.<br><br>Verse 21 shows that meat offered to idols was the dominant issue of this chapter: "It is good neither to eat meat nor drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is made weak." Romans of the day commonly offered both meat and wine to idols, with portions of the offerings later sold in the marketplace.<br><br>The Life Application Bible comments on verse 2: "The ancient system of sacrifice was at the center of the religious, social, and domestic life of the Roman world. After a sacrifice was presented to a god in a pagan temple, only part of it was burned. The remainder was often sent to the market to be sold. Thus a Christian might easilyÂ—even unknowinglyÂ—buy such meat in the marketplace or eat it at the home of a friend.<br><br>"Should a Christian question the source of his meat? Some thought there was nothing wrong with eating meat that had been offered to idols because idols were worthless and phony. Others carefully checked the source of their meat or gave up meat altogether, in order to avoid a guilty conscience. The problem was especially acute for Christians who had once been idol worshipers. For them, such a strong reminder of their pagan days might weaken their newfound faith. Paul also deals with this problem in 1 Corinthians 8."<br><br>What is the point of Paul's instruction in Romans 14? Depending upon their consciences, early believers had several choices they could make while traveling or residing in their communities. If they did not want to eat meat that had been sacrificed to idols, they could choose to fast or eat only vegetables to make sure they did not consume any meat of suspicious background that might offend their consciences. If their consciences were not bothered by eating meat sacrificed to idols, they could choose any of the options. Within this context, said Paul, "let each be fully convinced in his own mind" (verse 5) because "whatever is not from faith is sin" (verse 23).<br><br>Romans 14 is, in part, a chapter on Christian libertyÂ—acting according to one's conscience within the framework of God's laws as they pertained to meat sacrificed to idols. Understood in its context, Romans 14 does not convey permission to eat pork or any other unclean meat. When one understands that the food controversy of the New Testament era dealt with meat sacrificed to idols and not which meats were clean, other scriptures become clear.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Understanding 'Unclean' in Romans 14<br>Does Paul's statement in Romans 14:14 that "I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself" mean the early Church made no distinction between clean and unclean meats?<br><br>An understanding of Greek terminology can help us here.<br><br>It is important to realize that the New Testament writers referred to two concepts of unclean in the New Testament, with different Greek words used to convey those ideas. Unclean could refer to animals God did not intend to be used as food (Leviticus 11; Deuteronomy 14). Unclean could also refer to ceremonial uncleanness.<br><br>In Romans 14 Paul uses the word koinos, which means "common" (W.E. Vine, Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words, 1985, "Unclean," p. 649). In addition to the meanings of "common" and "ordinary," as used in English (Acts 2:44; 4:32; Titus 1:4; Hebrews 10:29; Jude 3), the word also applied to things considered polluted or defiled. This word, along with its verb form koinoo, is used in Mark 7:2, 15-23, where it obviously refers to ceremonial uncleanness in the incident when the disciples ate without having first washed their hands.<br><br>Through a concordance or similar Bible help you can verify that koinos and koinoo appear throughout the New Testament to refer to this kind of ceremonial uncleanness. Something could be "common"Â—ceremonially uncleanÂ—even though it was otherwise considered a clean meat.<br><br>An entirely different word, akathartos, is used in the New Testament for animals Scripture specifies as unclean. In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament in wide use in Paul's day), akathartos is used to designate the unclean meats listed in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14.<br><br>Both words, koinos and akathartos, are used in Acts 10 in describing Peter's vision of the sheet filled with "all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air" (verse 12), both clean and unclean. Peter himself distinguished between the two concepts of uncleanness by using both words in verse 14. After a voice told Peter to "kill and eat," he replied, "I have never eaten anything common [koinos] or unclean [akathartos]." Most Bible translations distinguish between the meanings of the two words used here. Peter used the same terminology in verse 28 and Acts 11:8 in discussing this vision.<br><br>When Paul said in Romans 14:14 that "I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean [koinos, or 'common'] of itself," he was making the same point he had made earlier to the Corinthians: Just because meat that was otherwise lawful to eat may have been associated with idol worship does not mean it is no longer fit for human consumption. As seen from the context, Paul wasn't discussing biblical dietary restrictions at all.<br><br>Paul goes on to state in Romans 14:20 that "all food is clean" (New International Version). The word translated "clean" is katharos, "free from impure admixture, without blemish, spotless" (Vine, "Clean, Cleanness, Cleanse, Cleansing," p. 103). Clean meats as such aren't addressed in the New Testament, so there isn't a specific word to describe them. Katharos is used to describe all kinds of cleanliness and purity, including clean dishes (Matthew 23:26), people (John 13:10) and clothing (Revelation 15:6; 19:8, 14), "pure" religion (James 1:27), gold and glass (Revelation 21:18 ).<br><br>Realize also that, in both verses 14 and 20 of Romans 14, the word food or meat isn't in the original wording. No specific object is mentioned relative to cleanness or uncleanness. The sense of these verses is merely that "nothing [is] unclean [koinos: common or ceremonially defiled] of itself," and "all is clean [katharos: free from impure admixture, without blemish, spotless]."<br><br>Paul's point is that any association of food with idolatrous activity had no bearing on whether the food was suitable for eating.<br></div>
