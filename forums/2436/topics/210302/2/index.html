I don't hero worship Martin Luther or Charles Wesley but I recognise the sacrifice that they have made which resulted in the propagation of the church of today. When I look back in history as to how the message spread, I see fallable humans. When I asked you for Jews who evangelise and are contemporaries of Luther or Wesley, don't have say don't have, please don't give unrealistic answers. You have always given good realistic answers.

For most parts, no.<br>On the issue of tone: sure you can think that church people are not "Godly", but isn't a pronouncement of "workers of iniquity" a little too harsh.

If it's anything, it's Hitler. During those tumultous periods, there are plenty of anti-Jew sentiments around. It did not help either that in those times too, the Jews were anti-Jesus. Now in 2006, there are some Jews who think differently. Yeah, ML wasn't very nice, but neither were the Jews. As I'd said, hindsight is 20/20.... and the ability to do good research nowadays sure helped. To be on the strict side, Charles Wesley's life wasn't too exemplery either. So it is odd that you find one acceptable and another not. Probably the only problem is the effect on the Jews.

Silence is praise for You, O God [Who dwells in] Zion; and to You vows will be paid. 3. O Heeder of prayer, to You does all flesh come. 4.

Answer us with awesome deeds as befits Your righteousness, O God of our salvation, the security of all [who inhabit] the ends of the earth and distant seas. 7. With His strength He prepares [rain for] the mountains; He is girded with might. 8. He quiets the roar of the seas, the roar of their waves and the tumult of nations. 9. Those who inhabit the ends [of the earth] fear [You] because of Your signs; the emergences of morning and evening cause [man] to sing praise. 10. You remember the earth and water it, you enrich it abundantly [from] God's stream filled with water. You prepare their grain, for so do You prepare it. 11. You saturate its furrows, gratifying its legions; with showers You soften it and bless its growth. 12. You crown the year of Your goodness [with rain], and Your clouds drip abundance. 13. They drip on pastures of wilderness, and the hills gird themselves with joy. 14. The meadows don sheep, and the valleys cloak themselves with grain; they sound blasts, indeed they sing<br></div>
