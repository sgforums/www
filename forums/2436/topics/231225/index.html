            <div class='col-md body'>We now come to the most prolific and ubiquitous number in scripture. There is much to be written about the number seven and it's occurrances, which are too numerous to mention here, not assuming that 'all' have been discovered. There is almost universal agreement as to the meaning of this number, and it's etymological root testifies of this. It speaks of completeness and rest, so it is no wonder that this number appears 54 times in the last book of scripture. YHVH does marvelous things in the earth with this number. The 7th word of scripture is 'eretz, or the 'earth', and this word winds up the initial creation with 7 words. All material, visible and invisible, was created in the beginning, followed by the fall of Lucifer and chaos, and then the 7 days of making, forming, calling, letting be, and seeing were begun. This was complete on the 7th day. However, the 7th day was not declared tov, or good, which also means to be complete. This was done in anticipation of the fall of man, from which the 7 days would begin again, each day representing a thousand years according to several prophecies in scripture. Man, after 6 thousand years on earth, will once again see the final Sabbath in the last thousand years or the 7th millenium.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Man was created on the 6th day and is represented in his nature by the number 6. There is only one (1) thing that stands between man (6) and completeness (7), and that is the (1) one God Himself. In the same way the complete (7) Word of God had to set aside His glory (1) in order to take upon the flesh of man (6). Either way, man always falls short.<br><br>From the beginning, the number 7 has represented God's completed acts. All of His celebrations are given in 7 feasts. When we sing and praise our Creator, we use combinations of 7 whole tones on the musical scale. All of that which is clean was taken into the ark of Noach in sevens (B'reshith 7:2). Priests were consecrated seven whole days before entering the priesthood (Vayikra 8:31-36). Blood was sprinkled on the mercy seat 7 times to show the complete redemption of the coming Messiah (Vayikra 16:14, Ivrim 9:12). God told Yehoshua to march around Jericho 6 times and then the 7th time the walls would fall. The 'Book of Life' is mentioned 7 times in scripture. Our bodies operate in complete cycles of sevens. There are 7 bones in our neck, face, and ankles. There are 7 holes in our face. All right, go ahead and count them. Finished? Ok, let's go on. We are in the womb a predetermined average of 280 days (40x7).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The word 'seven' is from the Hebrew word sheva'. This word first shows up in B'reshith 2:2:<br><br>"And on the SEVENTH day God ended His work which he had made; and He rested on the SEVENTH day from all His work which He had made."<br><br>It's root means to complete or finish and is used many times as in to complete a cycle, rather than to finish something entirely. This is the word used in Hebrew to express a week or a cycle of seven days, or any cycle of seven. It is the word in this form that is used to express a number or 'how many'. A word closely related to the number seven is the word Shabbat. Shabbat is related because the day of rest is the 7th day. However, the word shabbat, is not synonymous with the word sheva'. The word shabbat, with the doubling of the bet and the 'tav' ending, speaks only of the 7th day, or rest. In other words, shabbat is not the Hebrew word for 'week'. The Hebrew word for 'week' is shavu'a. The Greek word for 'week' is bdomada. The Sabbath means only Sabbath, and sabbaths mean only sabbaths. The feast of Shavu'ot, or the feast of weeks, is taken from Vayikra 23, and refers to the counting of one Sabbath to another Sabbath. The word shabbat first appears in B'reshith 2:2 as well, and is translated as 'rest'. Actually, the naming of the 7th day of rest as shabbat does not occur until Sh'mot 16:23:<br><br>"And he said unto them, This is that which YHVH hath said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto YHVH ..."<br><br>The Greek transliteration of the Hebrew word for sabbaths is 'sabbaton'. By transliterating this word into Greek, it is meant that the word shabbat is being referring to. 'Sabbaton' is NOT the Hebrew or Greek equivilent to 'week'. The phrase 'mia ton sabbaton' in the Greek is correct. The phrase translated from the Greek is 'one of the sabbaths'. The KJV translation of 'first day of the week' is a mutilation in more ways than one, and only done to promote the change of shabbat to Sunday.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The use of the number seven in scripture is everywhere, and there are many references to this number in myriads of books. I do not know that I can add anything refreshing to them. Keep in mind the idea of completion, rest, and finishing when seeing the number 7.
