            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>From the letter of the Emperor (Constantine) to all those not present at the council. (Found in Eusebius, Vita Const., Lib III 18-20)<br><br>When the question relative to the sacred festival of Easter arose, it was universally thought that it would be convenient that all should keep the feast on one day; for what could be more beautiful and more desirable than to see this festival, through which we receive the hope of immortality, celebrated by all with one accord and in the same manner? It was declared to be particularly unworthy for this, the holiest of festivals, to follow the customs (the calculation) of the Jews who had soiled their hands with the most fearful of crimes, and whose minds were blinded. In rejecting their custom we may transmit to our descendants the legitimate mode of celebrating Easter; which we have observed from the time of the SaviourÂ’s passion (according to the day of the week).<br><br>We ought not therefore to have anything in common with the Jew, for the Saviour has shown us another way; our worship following a more legitimate and more convenient course (the order of the days of the week: And consequently in unanimously adopting this mode, we desire, dearest brethren to separate ourselves from the detestable company of the Jew. For it is truly shameful for us to hear them boast that without their direction we could not keep this feast. How can they be in the right, they who, after the death of the Saviour, have no longer been led by reason but by wild violence, as their delusion may urge them? They do not possess the truth in this Easter question, for in their blindness and repugnance to all improvements they frequently celebrate two Passovers in the same year. We could not imitate those who are openly in error.<br><br>How, then, could we follow these Jews who are most certainly blinded by error? For to celebrate a Passover twice in one year, is totally inadmissible.<br><br>But even if this were not so it would still be your duty not to tarnish your soul by communication with such wicked people (the Jews). You should consider not only that the number of churches in these provinces make a majority, but also that it is right to demand what our reason approves, and that we should have nothing in common with the Jews.<br><br>(Gleaned from Dr. Henry R. PercivalÂ’s Â“The Nicean and post Nicean FathersÂ”. Vol. XIV Grand Rapid: Erdmans pub. 1979,pgs. 54-55)<br><br>EXPOSING THE 21 LIES AND DOCTRINAL ERRORS<br><br>OF<br><br>THE FIRST COUNCIL OF NICEA OF 325<br><br>[1st Lie] When the question relative to the sacred festival of Easter<br><br>The truth: sacred to pagan traditions, this is a pagan name derived from the goddess Ishtar, Exodus 20:3, Hosea 2:17<br><br>arose, it was [2nd lie] universally<br><br>The truth: Everyone in the universe? Is Constantine the king of the universe? Isaiah 14:3<br><br>thought that it would [3rd lie] be convenient<br><br>The truth: God does not call us to convenience but to obedience John 15:10<br><br>that all should keep the feast on one day; for what could be more beautiful and more desirable than to see this festival, through which we receive the hope of immortality, celebrated by [4th lie] all with one accord and in the same manner?<br><br>The truth: Without the Jews? John 17:21, unity between Jew and Gentile brings the salvation of all mankind, Psalms 133,Isaiah 56<br><br>It was declared to be particularly [5th lie] unworthy<br><br>The truth: YahvehÂ’s choice of dates is Â‘unworthyÂ’ to Constantine as he sets himself above GodÂ’s choosing of timings - Daniel 7:25, Isaiah 14:13 - Lucifer<br><br>for this, the holiest of festivals to follow the customs (the calculation) of the [6th lie] Jews<br><br>The truth: Which are the original and true calculations, Leviticus 23:1, Jeremiah 31:31-34<br><br>[7th lie] who had soiled their hands with the most fearful of crimes, and whose minds were blinded<br><br>The truth: John 10:17,18- YÂ’shua lays His own life down, John 3:16. The accusation that the Jews killed Christ has been the incentive for extermination of millions of Jews from that point onwards and until this day, including the Holocaust.Matthew 7:17-20 - fruit of this theology<br><br>[8th lie] In rejecting their custom The truth: which is GodÂ’s custom according to His Word we may transmit to our descendants the legitimate The truth: according to Constantine but not according to the Word of God, Matthew 26:2, Leviticus 23:1-4, Genesis 1:14,John 20:1-9, Matthew 12:39 mode of celebrating Easter which we have observed The truth: pagan name and feast not mentioned in the Holy Scriptures.<br><br>[9th lie] We ought not therefore to have anything in common with the Jew, for the Saviour has shown us another way<br><br>The truth: YÂ’shua is Jewish, so if nothing is in common with the Jews, nothing is in common with the Messiah, Matthew 1,John 19;19, Luke 1:59, Luke 2:21<br><br>[10th lie] our worship following a more legitimate and more convenient course, the order of the days of the week<br><br>The truth: Constantine legitimises his own ideas in order to gain political power and control and he attempts to dethrone the Word of God on this subject - setting himself and his opinions above YAH and His unchanging Word<br><br>[11th lie] And consequently in unanimously<br><br>The truth: without the Jews from which salvation comes! John 4:22<br><br>[12th lie] adopting this mode, we desire, dearest brethren to separate ourselves from the detestable company of the Jew For it is truly shameful for us to hear them boast that without their direction we could not keep this feast. How can they be in the right, they who, after the death of the Saviour.<br><br>The truth: Romans 11:15-20 warns the Gentiles not to be arrogant against the Jews or Gentiles will be cut of the Olive Tree!<br><br>[13th lie] have no longer been led by reason<br><br>The truth: True sons of God are not led by reason or Greek Philosophy but by the Spirit of God. Since Constantine and the Council of Nicea, the Church in its vast majority has been led by reason and by theologians instead of by powerful apostles, Romans 8:14, Ephesians 2:20 - these are all Jewish<br><br>[14th lie] but by wild violence, as their delusion may urge them<br><br>The truth: What wild violence is he talking about? Unsupported accusation used many times to incite the masses against the Jews like in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion?<br><br>They do not possess the truth in this Easter question, for in their blindness and [15th lie] repugnance to all improvements<br><br>The truth: traditions of demons and men that make null and void the Word of God, Matthew 15:3,4, Mark 7:13<br><br>they frequently celebrate two Passovers in the same year . We could not imitate those who are openly in error [16th lie] How, then, could we follow these Jews who are most certainly blinded by error?<br><br>The truth: Is following the Biblical customs error? Who is really blinded here? Gentiles are supposed to be Grafted Into IsraelÂ’s Olive Tree and not vice versa! Romans 11:15-20<br><br>[17th lie] For to celebrate a Passover twice in one year is totally inadmissible.<br><br>The truth: 2 Chronicles 30:1-3, it is totally scriptural<br><br>[18th lie] But even if this were not so it would still be your duty not to tarnish your soul by communication with such wicked people (the Jews).<br><br>The truth: In other words Constantine's purpose is to separate from the Jews and the Torah no matter what! Why? 1 John 4:1-3 states that the spirit of anti Messiah, in operation through Constantine, removes the identity of Messiah as a Jew, and sets himself above God and His word and His sovereign choice of choosing the Jews to bring salvation<br><br>[19th lie] You should consider not only that the number of churches in these provinces make a majority<br><br>The truth: God has never worked with Â‘majoritiesÂ’ but with obedience. Trusting in the arm of the flesh or the opinions of men brings about a curse! Deuteronomy 28:1-14, Jeremiah 17:5, Judges 7:2-8, 1 Samuel 14:6<br><br>[20th lie] but also that it is right to demand what our reason approves<br><br>The truth: human reasoning 1 Corinthians 1:27,, Isaiah 29:14b, James 1<br><br>[21st lie] and that we should have nothing in common with the Jews.<br><br>The truth: or with the Jewish Messiah or His salvation - John 4:22, Romans 11:15-20. He set the Gentile part of the Church onto a path of self destruction, remaining a wild olive instead of being grafted into the cultivated Olive Tree - which is Israel - because of arrogance, removing the foundations of the Jewish apostles and prophets, Psalms 11:3, Ephesians 2:20, Revelation 21:14<br><br>PRAYER OF RENOUNCING AND REVOCATION<br><br>OF<br><br>THE FIRST COUNCIL OF NICEA OF 325<br><br>Please pray and sign at the end<br><br>Before the Almighty God of Israel I stand and hereby renounce the First Council of Nicea as led by Constantine. I renounce its foundation and all the anti Jewish fruit that came out of it. I renounce every doctrinal error and every lie in it including Replacement Theology in all of its aspects.<br><br>I hereby affirm my faith in Yahveh the God of Israel, who is the Creator of the Universe and my Father through the atoning death of His Holy Son YÂ’shua, who is both the promised Jewish Messiah, and God in the flesh. I hereby affirm my faith in the resurrection of YÂ’shua the Messiah and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit of God from the Day of Shavuot (Pentecost) and onwards, to all that repent and believe in the Son. I hereby affirm my belief that I am grafted into the Olive Tree that represents Israel, and together with the believing Jewish people I will inherit eternal life. I hereby affirm that the God of Israel will never forsake His People, neither will He forget His covenant with the Jews or with the Ecclesia (Called out Ones - Church).<br><br>I thank you Holy Father for removing all the curses that have come into my life and into my nation due to our belief in the tenets of faith stated in the Council of Nicea, concerning the Jews and the Jewish foundations of the Faith. I beg you and thank you for pouring out your great mercy and forgiveness over myself, my family and my nation. I hereby commit myself to walk in Truth as You reveal it to me and in love with all my fellow men and especially my (and the ChurchÂ’s) spiritual parents, the Jewish people according to Genesis 12:1-3.<br><br>Your full Name:<br><br>Your nationality:<br><br>Date:<br><br>Your Signature:<br><br>If you have prayed this prayer and signed this form please let us know karenmap@netvision.net.il or fax +972 2 533 3534<br><br>Â© Bishop Dr Dominiquae Bierman 2006  - Permission is granted (and we encourage you) to distribute these writings.
