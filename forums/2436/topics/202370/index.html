            <div class='col-md body'>YHVH Rohi - The Lord, My Shepherd (Psalms 23:1)<br><br>Although Israel learned to magnify the Lord for life, healing, victory,<br>holiness, peace, and protection, they were still pilgrims, and they<br>were in dire need of divine provision in their wilderness journey with<br>all its weariness, physical needs, duties, dangers and difficulties.<br>Thus, there came the revelation of God as their YHVH Rohi, the One<br>whose Shepherd's love, care, and resources they could depend upon in<br>all the un-trodden and unknown pathways of the future.<br><br>Thus the Lord is the feeder to provide for us, keeper to protect us,<br>companion to cheer us, friend to help us, pastor to comfort us, and<br>herdsman near to us, as His frequent revelations prove.<br><br>Psalms 23 contains eight redemptive names of YHVH:<br><br>1)  YHVH Rohi - "Jehovah is my shepherd...." (Psalms 23:1)<br>2)  YHVH Jireh - "I shall not want." (Psalms 23:1)<br>3)  YHVH Shalom - The Lord is my peace.  (Psalms 23:2) "He makes me to<br>lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters."<br>4)  Jehovah Rophi - The Lord, my healer. (Psalms 23:3)  "He restores my<br>soul."<br>5)  YHVH Tsidkenu - The Lord is righteousness. (Psalms 23:3)  "He<br>leadeth me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake."<br>6)  YHVH Nissi - The Lord is my banner. (Psalms 23:5)   "He prepares a<br>table before me in the presence of my enemies."<br>7)  YHVH M'Kaddesh - The Lord my sanctifier. (Psalms 23:5)  "He anoints<br>my head with oil."<br>8 )  YHVH Shammah - The Lord is there. (Psalms 23:4)   "...thou art with<br>me."<br><br>YHVH Jireh - The Lord Will Provide (Genesis 22:14)<br><br>The definition of this term is "The Lord will see" or "The Lord will<br>provide". For man, this conjunctive meaning seems impossible. However,<br>for the all knowing God of creation, the dual meaning is easily<br>exemplified.<br><br>His pre-vision means His pro-vision. That was Abraham's revelation<br>given to the place where He found the ram provided as a substitute for<br>Isaac. This miracle was not of a normal significance; but rather it was<br>a creative miracle by God for the sacrifice, in the same sense that the<br>Lord created a body through the miraculous conception for the<br>substitute sacrifice for man.<br><br>As Elohim, God demanded the sacrifice of Isaac, but as YHVH He made<br>complete provision of a substitute for the son Abraham willingly<br>offered. The place of this miracle is important. It is the first<br>recorded instance in scripture of the naming of a place after a divine<br>interposition or manifestation.<br><br>YHVH Tsidkenu - The Lord Our Righteousness (Jeremiah 33:16)<br><br>In the Old Testament, there is evident revelation of Israel as being a<br>nation seeking after righteousness. Yet in their passionate desire for<br>righteousness, the people discovered their own unrighteousness.<br>Therefore, we become people who seek after purity of heart, so we can<br>enjoy communion with God. "Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall<br>see God." (Matthew 5:8 )<br><br>The Greeks sought after wisdom, and the Romans pursued power and world<br>dominion; but today there is a remnant of God's chosen people who seek<br>after God and His righteousness.<br><br>To the glory of the gospel, is that YHVH Tsidkenu became flesh and was<br>made unto us righteousness. (1 Corinthians 1:30) A righteous God<br>pronounced death as the penalty of sin--yet that same God became flesh,<br>the righteous branch, to taste death for every sinner and to provide<br>the righteousness that is transferred or imputed to the believer and is<br>thereby accepted before God. Acceptable righteousness; therefore, is<br>not attained but obtained.<br><br>YHVH Shalom - The Lord Our Peace<br><br>The word "Peace", and words directly related to it, appear over 400<br>times in scripture. It is one of the most precious and fundamentally<br>essential ingredients for a believer to be at peace with God and know<br>the peace of God. It relates to a harmonious relationship obtained<br>through reconciliation of a debt paid in full. Peace or "Shalom" is<br>often translated--welfare, good health, prosperity, favor, rest whole,<br>finished, restitution or repay and perfect.<br><br>YHVH Rophi - The Lord Our Physician (Exodus 15:26)<br><br>From Israel, we learn that in times of sickness God heals, for He is<br>our YHVH Rophi, "I am Jehovah thy healer". To express God's grace in<br>restoring spirit life, He declared that He healed all of our diseases,<br>spiritual as well as physical. (Psalms 103:3)<br><br>He also heals the broken in heart (Psalms 147:3), and for those who are<br>backsliding, He is their healer as well (Jeremiah 3:22). The scriptures<br>also clearly indicate the removal of bodily infirmity (Genesis 20:17;<br>Matthew 4:23).<br><br>YHVH Nissi - The Lord Our Banner (Exodus 17:15-16)<br><br>Moses took care that God should have the glory for the victory over<br>Amalek. Instead of setting up a trophy in the honor of Joshua (though<br>it had been a standard policy to put marks of honor upon men), he built<br>an altar to God's honor. What is most carefully recorded is the<br>inscription upon the altar, YHVH-Nissi - The Lord my Banner. The<br>presence and power of YHVH were the banner under which they were<br>enlisted, and the banner by which they were kept together.<br><br>YHVH Nissi in literal Hebrew means "A hand upon the throne of YHVH".<br>YHVH will have war with Amalek from generation to generation. Amalek's<br>hand had dared to assault YHVH's throne to overturn it, so He gave<br>Israel the authority and power of that throne to overwhelm Amalek. The<br>uplifted hands of Moses symbolized this banner. Here we have an<br>illustration of the hand of faith outstretched in prayer.<br><br>YHVH M'Kaddesh - The Lord Who Sanctifies (Exodus 31:13<br><br>The term holiness is from the Hebrew word "Kodesh" and is allied to<br>"sanctify". It is translated as dedicate, consecrate, hallow, and holy<br>in various translations. "I am YHVH M'Kaddesh - The Lord who sanctifies<br>you". This term's main influence relates to moral and spiritual purity.<br>In the New Testament, many scriptures relate to the process of<br>sanctification, the sum of which are provided to the church through the<br>atoning work of YESHUA:<br><br>SANCTIFIED By Truth (John 15:3; 17:17)<br>SANCTIFIED By the Blood (Hebrews 13:12)<br>SANCTIFIED By Faith (Acts 26:18 )<br>SANCTIFIED By Prayer (I Timothy 4:5)<br><br>YHVH Tsebahoth - The Lord of Hosts (I Samuel 1:3)<br><br>This term in Hebrew is taken from sabaoth, meaning host or hosts, with<br>special reference to warfare or service, and the word often appears as<br>the Lord of Hosts. This Hebrew term has also rendered armies. This<br>reference for YHVH appears 14 times in the book of Haggai and 24 times<br>in the book of Malachi.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Zechariah, the Lord of Hosts occurs 53 times and is of great<br>interest, seeing that it is connected with God's action in judgment and<br>blessing upon Israel. The _expression "Thus saith the Lord of Hosts",<br>implied divine revelation and divine authority; a phrase like "Holiness<br>unto the Lord of Hosts", (Zechariah 14:21).<br><br>When the conquest of Canaan was about to begin, the Lord was revealed<br>as the unknown warrior with naked sword standing before Joshua. When<br>Joshua asked the question, "are you for us or against us"; the reply<br>came, "I am Prince of the Host of YHVH", therefore Joshua humbly<br>surrendered his sword to YHVH Tsebahoth.<br><br>The whole of His creation is under His control and obeys His sovereign<br>command, willingly or otherwise. He is:<br><br>1)  Lord of all angelic hosts (I Kings 22:19)<br>2)  The Lord of all steller things (Genesis 1:16)<br>3)  The Lord of all the feathered hosts (I Kings 17:2-7)<br>4)  The Lord of all the animal hosts (Isaiah 11:6)<br>5)  The Lord of all the human hosts (Isaiah 40:15)<br>6)  The Lord of the satanic hosts (Matthew 28:18 )<br><br>YHVH Heleyon - The Lord Most High<br><br>YHVH Heleyon is frequently used in the Psalms as a declaration of God's<br>highest position or kingship. This title reveals God as the high and<br>lofty one that inhabits eternity (Isaiah 57:15). It is prophetically<br>speaking of YHVH's reign over the earth at the time of Israel's<br>restoration or the restoration of God's chosen people.<br><br>It is also reassuring for us to know that during these difficult days,<br>that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, also (Daniel 4:25).<br>This redemptive name places God at the highest place of every realm of<br>life, so that He can fulfill His will in and through us. When applied<br>to God, this redemptive name reveals that though He is the highest,<br>there are others below Him endowed by Him with like natures, and<br>therefore, in some way, related to Him by His Spirit.<br><br>YHVH-Makkeh - The Lord Who Smites (Ezekiel 7:9)<br><br>The Lord has given Israel to us as an example of His dealings with man.<br>He set Israel in the midst of heathen nations as His witness, but<br>instead of revealing and glorifying Him, she changed His judgments into<br>wickedness greater than all the nations she was supposed to influence<br>for Him. Therefore He said, "You shall know that I am YHVH-Makkeh", the<br>Lord who smites thee. (Ezekiel 7:9)<br><br>The 9th chapter of Daniel reveals that Israel found herself in<br>captivity because she refused to heed the voice of the Lord God, which<br>was set before her by His servants, the prophets. As a result of<br>Israel's disobedience, the Lord smote Israel and disciplined her<br>because of her unbelief and rejection of His true revealed word. The<br>church has also experienced a similar disciplinary period over the past<br>forty years because of her rejection of the true revealed word as<br>brought to the church by His servants, the prophets.<br><br>The good news is His promise to restore. According to Hosea 6:1-2,<br>Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us but He will heal<br>us; He has wounded us but He will bandage us. He will revive us after<br>two days; He will raise us up on the third day, that we may live before<br>Him."<br><br>YHVH Gmolah - The God of Recompense (Jeremiah 51:6)<br><br>The scriptures declare that retribution or recompense does not belong<br>to us but rather it belongs to God. In Jeremiah 51, the Lord declares<br>that He will severely punish Babylon because of their harsh dealing<br>with Israel, thereby revealing Himself as the God of retribution.<br><br>The same was true of Egypt when they placed the nation of Israel under<br>a heavy burden and struck the apple of His eye. When a person is<br>shamefully treated or misjudged, even wrongfully condemned or blamed<br>when innocent, it becomes very difficult not to take up our own<br>defense, and leave our reputation to God. Yet this is the precise way<br>that He has instructed for us to respond. Retribution and recompense<br>belong only to him. Vengeance is His, and He promised to repay<br>(Deuteronomy 32:35; 2 Thessalonians 1:8 ).<br><br>YHVH Shammah - The Lord Is There (Ezekiel 48:35)<br><br>The name of the city revealed through Ezekiel is YHVH Shammah - the<br>Lord is There. This location is so named because of the manifest<br>presence and power of YHVH residing there. We also know from scripture<br>that God does not dwell in temples made by hands, but rather we are to<br>be God's temple.<br><br>This is the last of YHVH's redemptive titles in the order of their Old<br>Testament occurrence. It discloses the consummation of His progressive<br>self-revelation.<br><br>The people of Israel were brought out of the bondage of Egypt by His<br>manifest presence (Deuteronomy 4:37). However, the people willfully and<br>continually sinned, and the conscious manifest Presence of God was<br>rescinded. Yet when the people repented of their gross idolatry,<br>because of His love and pity, the angel of His presence redeemed them<br>once again (Isaiah 63:9).<br><br>The apostle Paul describes the church as a habitation of God, a house<br>of God, and the building growing unto a holy temple in the Lord.<br><br>The question remains: Does the Glory of YHVH fill YHVH's house, and are<br>we, members of that house, displaying His Glory?<br><br>Note: Name of God edited to YHVH, the great "I AM".<br><br>Paul Keith Davis</div>
