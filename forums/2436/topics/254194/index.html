            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Â“Those who love Your law have great peace,<br><br>and nothing causes them to stumble.Â“  Psalms 119:165</strong></span><br><br>Shabbat shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>As we progress in the Restoration of the Tabernacle of David (Amos 9:11), we need to realize that King David loved the Law of God. He was totally in love with YahÂ’s Commandments! When the Council of Nicea was signed it provoked hatred to YahÂ’s laws and Commandments and they were REPLACED for the traditions of demons and men. If we are to see true REVIVAL the love of YahÂ’s laws need to be restored and a righteous worship generation will rise up! When Replacement Theology began to rule the Ecclesia; it divorced between Yeshua, The Lord and His Law in the same way that it divorced between Yeshua and His Jewish identity!<br><br>Yeshua is ONE with the Law in the same way that he is ONE with His Father.<br><br>"Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth. "As You sent Me into the world, also have sent them into the world. Â“For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. "I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word; that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.  John 17:17-21<br><br>He felt so strong about the Law that he warned us not to even THINK that He came to abolish it and warned us seriously against deception in this matter.<br><br>"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. "For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished. "Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. "For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.Â”  Matthew 5:17-20<br><br>The reason why most believers are struggling in their walk is because of what I would call Â“Spiritual SchizophreniaÂ”: They love The Lord but hate His Commandments, Statutes and Laws. They see His Commandments as Â“bondageÂ” and call those that are teaching them Â“judaizersÂ”, however Yeshua said that keeping them and teaching them will make us GREAT in the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Church has been so Romanized after the signing of the Council of Nicea that for the most part it still rejects the WORD of YAH (God) - His laws and commandments. That is why moral standards have become Â“relativeÂ” and homosexuals can actually officiate in some churches. In many worship teams there are people in some kind of immorality and many pastors hide the sin of lust and adultery. Shabbat has been replaced by Sunday and the Holy feasts (Leviticus 23) for Pagan Feasts. Most Christians call this Â“freedomÂ” but this is nothing but paganism because His laws have become the Â“enemyÂ” instead of carnality and sin being the TRUE ENEMY!<br><br>We think that if we pray more then we will see REVIVAL and I totally agree that PRAYER is an extremely important KEY for REVIVAL but prayer should lead us to REPENTANCE for breaking YahÂ’s Commandments and for rejecting them altogether. In fact if we will not repent of this and go back to OBEDIENCE our prayers will be rejected!<br><br>Â“He who turns away his ear from listening to the law, even his prayer is an abomination.Â”  Proverbs 28:9<br><br>The Hebrew for Â“Hearing the LawÂ” is the word SHMA which means: TO HEAR AND TO DO!<br><br>Contrary to what many think, loving the Law of Elohim will not lead us to LEGALISM. Legalism is a demonic religious spirit and attitude that flows from a prideful, self righteous and unrepentant heart. When we love the Law we always trust in His mercy and compassion and we become totally dependent in His Holy Spirit. We realize that we need His help at every step. Those that love His Law become totally aware that Â“in our weakness He is made strongÂ”. King David kept an attitude of brokenness and faith before Yah. Loving His Law-Torah makes us sensitive to His Holy Spirit and careful and ALERT in our walk.<br><br>Â“So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;Â”  Philippians 2:12<br><br>Prayer and meditation in His Word becomes a way of life at all times. The Fear of Yahveh rules our lives rather than the fear of man or of circumstances! Keeping His laws and commandments is as much a matter of a PURE HEART as it is a matter of RIGHT BEHAVIOR. BOTH GO HAND IN HAND! Religious hypocrites may Â“do the right thing externally but their hearts are full of sin and that is why they judge others rather than themselves.<br><br>"Behold, days are coming," declares Yahveh, "when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them," declares Yahveh. Â“But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days," declares Yahveh,Â” I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their Elohim, and they shall be My people. "They will not teach again, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, 'Know Yahveh,' for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them," declares Yahveh, "for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."  Jeremiah 31:31-34<br><br>The TRUE MARK of the New Covenant is that the LAW is written in our hearts and minds, not in tablets of stone but in hearts of flesh. When we reject YahÂ’s Commandments, call them Â“bondageÂ” and those that teach them Â“judaizersÂ” (which is a very Anti Semitic term), we are actually rejecting the NEW COVENANT and the Agent of the New Covenant, the Jewish Messiah! Many Christians are about to be broken off the Olive Tree for rejecting the Law of God. (Romans 11:17-24)<br><br>"Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?'  "And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.'  Matthew 7:22-23<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Restoring the Love for ElohimÂ’s laws and Commandments is a matter of life and death and what separates the true believers from the pagans! The work of the Holy Spirit is to be our Â“RabbiÂ” and teach us His laws and Commandments leading us to all TRUTH.<br><br>"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.  "He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you. "All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I said that He takes of Mine and will disclose it to you.Â” John 16:13-15<br><br>There is a Josiah generation that is finding out that we have broken ElohimÂ’s Commandments and is repenting. This generation will destroy the altars to foreign gods in the Church. These are young zealous Kings and Priests that will not hate the law but rather love it as King David did. They will catapult us into the End Time Revival of Holiness, Righteousness, signs, wonders and miracles! (Read 2 Kings 22)<br><br>Â“It is time for Yahveh to act, for they have broken Your law. Therefore I love Your commandments above gold, yes, above fine gold.Â”  Psalms 119:126-127<br><br>It is time for Yahveh to ACT and for the Book of the Acts of the Apostles chapter 21st Century to be released. The KEY is to go back to LOVE ELOHIMÂ’S LAWS like the Jewish Apostles and Prophets of old did and walked in HOLINESS and in the GLORY!<br><br>Yeshua is the LAW MADE FLESH!<br><br>(John 1:14)<br><br>That is the reason why in Malachi 4 (the chapter that best describes the End Time Revival!) it says that we must FIRST REMEMBER THE LAW OF MOSES and then Elijah will come and restore the hearts of the Fathers to the Sons and of the Sons to the Fathers! (Read Malachi 4!). Righteousness must be sought after and restored so that HEALING and REVIVAL can come.<br><br>Â“ If  My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land.Â”  2 Chronicles 7:14<br><br>A PRAYER OF REPENTANCE<br><br>Dear Father in Heaven forgive me for hating and rejecting your laws and commandments and for believing the lies of Replacement Theology. From this day I decree that I love your laws and Commandments and invite Your Holy Spirit to write them in my heart. I break away from all sin, lawlessness and paganism in YÂ’shuaÂ’s Name.<br><br>Â“I opened my mouth wide and panted, for I longed for Your commandments.  Turn to me and be gracious to me, after Your manner with those who love Your name. Establish my footsteps in Your word, and do not let any iniquity have dominion over me.Â” Psalms 119:131-133<br><br>May you be refreshed and revived as His First Love is restored in you. May the Holy Fire of His Spirit fill you and overtake you as you wait on Him to REVOLUTIONIZE you to become a Vessel of Fire in this End Time Revival. We also invite you to join us in our Tours and Trainings in Israel so that you can be equipped with Truth and Spiritual Impartation in a short amount of time.<br><br>Â“The sum of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous ordinances is everlasting.Â”  Psalms 119:160<br><br>In YÂ’shuaÂ’s Love and Commitment to see you through!<br><br>Bishop Dominiquae and Rabbi Baruch Bierman<br></div>
