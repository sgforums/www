            <div class='col-md body'>interesting story i got from email <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>One day, a father of a very wealthy family took his son on a trip to the country with the firm purpose of showing his son how poor people live. They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of what would be considered a very poor family. On their return from their trip, the father asked his son, "How was the trip?"<br>"It was great, Dad."<br><br>"Did you see how poor people live?" the father asked.<br><br>"Oh yeah," said the son.<br><br>"So, tell me, what did you learn from the trip?" asked the father.<br><br>The son answered, "I saw that we have one dog and they had four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden, and they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lanterns in our garden, and they have the stars at night. Our patio reaches to the front yard, and they have the whole horizon. We have a small piece of land to live on, and they have fields that go beyond our sight. We have servants who serve us, but they serve others. We buy our food, but they grow theirs. We have walls around our property to protect us; they have friends to protect them."<br><br>The boy's father was speechless.<br><br>Then his son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay so now let's get real.<br><br><blockquote>The son answered, "I saw that we have one dog and they had four."</blockquote>But their one dog probably has the best food and medical care while the poor family's four dogs are probably mongrels who get table scraps or have to forage for their own food most of the time.<br><br><blockquote>We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden, and they have a creek that has no end.</blockquote>The creek is filled with industrial pollutants illegally dumped by the factory up the creek. Also, people upstream pee, shit and do laundry upstream of the creek.<br><br><blockquote>We have imported lanterns in our garden, and they have the stars at night.</blockquote>They have the stars at night because the whole region is so poor that they don't have electricity. Also the rich man soon after decided to build a planetarium in the back yard.<br><br><blockquote>Our patio reaches to the front yard, and they have the whole horizon.</blockquote>When the rich man brings his son on an airplane, they have the whole sky. And besides, their vacation home by the seaside also has the whole horizon.<br><br><blockquote>We have a small piece of land to live on, and they have fields that go beyond our sight.</blockquote>And in those large fields, they break their backs in toil trying to eke out a subsistence living. Planting rice, ain't no fun, bent from dawn to the set of sun, cannot stand, cannot sit, cannot rest a little bit.<br><br><blockquote>We have servants who serve us, but they serve others.</blockquote>So lucky. But the rich man's son can also serve others.<br><br><blockquote>We buy our food, but they grow theirs.</blockquote>And they struggle to stay fed.<br><br><blockquote>We have walls around our property to protect us; they have friends to protect them.</blockquote>Because they don't have any property.<br><br></div>

If they wanted to, they could live like the poor. The poor have no options.<br><br>Let's share one more story.<br><br>A rich man just finished an expensive steak and lobster meal. As he is walking to his car, he sees a poor man sitting on a kerb eating a packet of rice garnished with some vegetables.<br><br>The rich man then says to the poor man, "You are so lucky! As a rich person, I keep eating a high fat, high cholesterol diet. I drink too much of the best wine and brandy because it tastes so good! I end up having to pay so much on medical bills. Furthermore I also have to have a gym membership and a personal trainer to help me control my weight! But you don't have all these problems. You eat a healthy, mostly vegetarian diet. You don't have to go gym or see the doctor regularly. Now I know how unfortunate I am!"</div>
