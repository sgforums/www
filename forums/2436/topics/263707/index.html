            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Blessings Before Learning Torah</strong><br><br>The Torah commands us to recite a special blessing over the study of Torah before we study Torah. This is required only once a day, every day. If you have not said these blessings today, please recite them now, before reading the Torah on this web site.<br><br>Blessed are You, Hashem our G-d, King of the universe, Who has made us holy through His commandments, and commanded us to actively study Torah.<br><br>Please Hashem, our G-d, sweeten the words of Your Torah in our mouths and in the mouths of all Your people Israel. May we and our offspring, and our offspring's offspring, and all the offspring of Your people, the House of Israel, may we all, together, know Your Name and study Your Torah for the sake of fulfilling Your desire. Blessed are You, Hashem, Who teaches Torah to His people Israel.<br><br>Blessed are You, Hashem our G-d, King of the universe, Who chose us from all the nations, and gave us the Torah. Blessed are You, Hashem, Giver of the Torah.<br><br><strong>We now recite some Torah selections:</strong><br><br>Hashem spoke to Moses, explaining a Commandment. "Speak to Aaron and his sons, and teach them the following Commandment: This is how you should bless the Children of Israel. Say to the Children of Israel:<br><br>May Hashem bless you and keep watch over you;<br>May Hashem make His Presence enlighten you, and may He be kind to you;<br>May Hashem bestow favor on you, and grant you peace.<br><br>This way, the priests will link My Name with the Israelites, and I will bless them."<br><br><strong>It is good to recite this passage from the Talmud as well:</strong><br><br>These are the Laws for which the Torah did not mandate specific amounts: How much growing produce must be left in the corner of the field for the poor; how much of the first fruits must be offered at the Holy Temple; how much one must bring as an offering when one visits the Holy Temple three times a year; how much one must do when doing acts of kindness; and there is no maximum amount of Torah that a person must study.<br><br>These are the Laws whose benefits a person can often enjoy even in this world, even though the primary reward is in the Next World: They are: Honoring one's father and mother; doing acts of kindness; early attendance at the place of Torah study -- morning and night; showing hospitality to guests; visiting the sick; providing for the financial needs of a bride; escorting the dead; being very engrossed in prayer; bringing peace between two people, and between husband and wife; but the study of Torah is as great as all of them together.<br></div>
