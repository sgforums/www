However, there are efforts, not parallel to yours to rectify doctrinal errors. Years before reading what you wrote and believe in, I have banned Santa Claus in the SS, I have questioned the distribution of the Easter eggs in churches, I have questioned the purpose Christmas trees etc. What I did not do - I did not leave the church and condemn it from the outside! Please don't assume that people are sitting on their fat ass and just accept what the church dishes out. There are many of us who question the church, but we do it in the INSIDE!<br><br></div></blockquote>Now who is judging who? So you are telling me that this is the right way to go? Why stay in a system which is hostile to you? Why stay in the lie when you don't believe in that mindset of the system? Are you not then just being untrue to what you know??<br><br>Did I ever say anything about the people who attend the church? Don't put words in my mouth and please do not assume those are my sentiments. Now who is over generalising?</div>

You are creating your own god, are you sure that is Hashem.<br><br>Hashem is loving, merciful, kind, gracious... yes, whilst these attributes apply, Hashem is also the God of the Holy Scriptures... who demands obedience. We have to follow His ways not He succumb to our weaknesses and say its all right, Hashem will forgive, whilst Hashem understands our struggles and gives us grace to repent and change, it still does not excuse us from making the changes when we know the truth!
