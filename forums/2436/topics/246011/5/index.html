Jews were persecuted because of their race, Christian preachers (white, black, yellow, etc)  were persecuted because of their faith and in many countries the persecution continues till today!<br><br>At the end of the day, how many true Jews, messianic or otherwise, were active in "making disciples of all nations"?

But I think that in the global scale, every race faced persecution and genocide some time or another. To have a mindset that "I suffered the most" is, to me, the cry baby who keep saying that he's being bullied all the time.<br><br>Going back to the Great Commission thing... while it is true that Jews were whacked by the church fathers, how many of these Jews were doing the Great Commission thing? Jews were persecuted because of their race, Christian preachers (white, black, yellow, etc)  were persecuted because of their faith and in many countries the persecution continues till today!<br><br>At the end of the day, how many true Jews, messianic or otherwise, were active in "making disciples of all nations"? If there were none, the church had the misfortune of having the gospel spread by Europeans who doesn't know any better, and we are left with this current predicament...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>If you want to learn about Hashem from the Jews, just go ask a Rabbi or a practising Jew. They have lots to say. If you will listen. Well now there are Messianic Jews who are doing just that, making disciples of all nations. The Jewish way of making a disciple is very differnt from the churchs very loose way of making a disciple. First many of the man made festivities have to be jettisoned.<br></div>
