Acts 15:18-21.<br><br>Known to God rom eternity are all His works. Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God, but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from things strangled, and from blood. For Moses has had thoughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.<br><br>None of the apostles would have broken the Torah. They all kept and knew Torah, it is understood from reading the context of this verse that initially that is what goyim would be required to do but as they participated in meeting on the Shabbat they would learn Moses as he was preached in every city and read in the synagogues every Shabbat. They would then grow from there initially and learn how to keep the ways of Hashem.</div>

I quote verses 27-29 (NIV):<br><br><blockquote>27Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. 28It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us <strong>not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements</strong>: 29You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.</blockquote></div>
