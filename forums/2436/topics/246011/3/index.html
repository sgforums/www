You have your bible and you can clearly read and understand english or mandrin so you go read your Holy Scriptures and you tell me what Hashem says about keeping His feasts and whether Yeshua commanded us to celebrate easter?<br><br>Even if the churchers celebrated passover, they have already missed the time. Passover and easter have almost never fallen on the same time frame. Sometimes they are weeks apart. The predicament that we are in today is not the fault of the Jews who have always kept Hashem's ways and feasts and commandments.<br><br>The fault that we have today is that of the gentile church for wanting to distance itself from the chosen people of Hashem for fear of repirsal from the authorities way back in around 300AD?<br><br>So now we have come round full circle.

Yet for all the festivals that we are told to keep, we do not do it. Even the simplest thing of keeping Shabbat, the church has not taught! Yet when we read the Holy Scriptures, we find that Hashem considers it so important that those who do not keep Shabbat will be put to death!

It confuses people also.<br><br>For example, I wonder who is the idiot who translated the Hebrew Bible into English and came out with the following book titles like Numbers and Judges?<br><br>Luckily the chinese translators have brains. Numbers now become min2 shu4 ji4 and Judges is now shi4 shi2 ji4. Anyone with a moderate command of chinese can now guess Numbers has to do with a census and Judges has to do with a group of people who are warrior-priest.<br><br>More examples:<br><br>Book of James -&gt; ya3 ge2 shu1<br>Book of Jude -&gt; you2 da4 shu1<br>Gospel of John -&gt; yue2 han4 fu2 yin1<br><br>From Brey's sticky, the chinese translations are actually closer to the Hebrew names:<br><br>JAMES - YA'AKOV<br>JUDE - Y'HUDAH<br>JOHN - YOCHANAN</div></blockquote>wah! use bad words.... careful, mod very strict one.<br><br>that's the whole point isn't it.... kbkb about how words are used.<br><br>... and we are wondering why English is the language for business globally.<br><br>anyway... nuff said lah... brey had said once that he wants to learn from people to write in to DT, my respond then was, there is nothing for him to learn..... it is true again today.</div>
