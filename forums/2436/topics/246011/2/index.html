The bible tells us that the nominated feast for this season is passover, hence if we are following the bible, then we should align ourselves with passover rather than easter.

They wanted to alienate themselves from the Jews. Some bishops were in favour of holding the celebration on Passover day though.<br><br>Refer to the the Quartodeciman or Paschal controversy if you are interested - <a href="http://www.wcg.org/lit/church/holidays/passover.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wcg.org/lit/church/holidays/passover.htm</a><br><br><blockquote>The controversy involved three events: the controversy between Polycarp, the bishop of Smyrna, and Anicetus, the bishop of Rome, that occurred around a.d. 155; the more heated controversy between Polycrates, the bishop of Ephesus, and Victor, the bishop of Rome, that broke out around 195; and the decree of Constantine following the Nicene Council in 325.<br><br><strong>Scholars disagree about the controversy's details. They do agree that its arguments revolved around whether the primary Christian spring festival should happen on Nisan 14 (the Passover day) or annually on a Sunday.</strong><br><br>Eusebius is our primary source for the controversy between Polycarp and Anicetus. Polycarp knew the apostle John and was of such stature that many considered him John's spiritual, though not apostolic, successor in Asia Minor. Polycarp believed that Nisan 14 was the correct time for the spring festival, but Anicetus, bishop of Rome, favored Sunday. </blockquote>Mai siao siao .. Polycarp against the Pope (bishop of Rome).<br><br>This controversy is enough to show that the early church was not as united as the Roman Catholics claim.<br><br>PS: Actually I don't understand why Polycarp is not considered the apostolic successor of John.
