            <div class='col-md body'>In the Torah, there are many examples of how obedience is a key component of faith. The Brit Hadasha even gives examples of how obedience led individuals to demonstrate their faith to the world. For example, NoahÂ’s obedience led him to build the ark, despite the signs around him. Noah's obedience to HaShem's warning became a witness, to other individuals. Obedience is one of the most effective ways to demonstrate our faith to the world. Every faithful servant has to be obedient. Through obedience, the world witnesses the power and glory of HaShem. Our obedience to HaShem, allows the world to see a visible distinction between the followers of Yeshua and the rest of the world. It is crucial that believers strive to become obedient and serve HaShem in all areas of their lives. In Ki Tetze, we can see that a vow is one form of obedience. However, unlike other forms of obedience a vow is publicly declared. As a result, failure to fulfill a vow makes it a negative public witness. Therefore, believers should not make vows without full consideration of the resulting consequences.<br><br>Devarim 23:21-23 states Â“When you shall vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, you shall not hesitate to pay it: for the LORD your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you. But if you shall not vow, it will not be sin to you. That which is gone out of your lips you shall keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as you have vowed unto the LORD thy God, which you have promised with your mouth.Â”<br><br>HaShem requires all vows to be fulfilled. When we donÂ’t fulfill a vow HaShem considers it sin. Therefore, we must not make impulsive vows. The consequences of a vow made impulsively can either lead us to sin by not fulfilling the vow, or to fulfill a vow that has devastating consequences. Shoftim 11:30-37 states<br><br>Â“Yiftach vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. So Yiftach passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands. And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus, the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. And Yiftach came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. And it happened, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back. And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened your mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for you of your enemies, even of the children of Ammon. And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me:Â”<br><br>Yiftach did not consider the consequences of his vow. As a result, Yiftach's vow led Yiftach to commit sin. Yiftach had two choices, which were to sin against HaShem by not fulfilling the vow, or to sin against HaShem by offering his daughter. When Yiftach made the vow, the vow became Holy. As a result, Yiftach was required to fulfill his vow.  Unfortunately, Yiftach and his daughter paid a very high price for YiftachÂ’s impulsive vow.<br><br>Yeshua also warns his followers not to make vows impulsively. Mathew 5:33-37 states, Â“you have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform unto the Lord your oaths: But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shall thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yes; No: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evilÂ”. Individuals do not have the power to control the consequences of their vows. Therefore, Yeshua prefers, that we not make vows. An impulsive vow can put us in a situation similar to Yiftach. If Yiftach had foreseen that his daughter would be the first out of the door, he would not have made the vow. Yeshua makes it clear that His followerÂ’s obedience should be based on yes or no, instead of a promise to fulfill a vow. Therefore, it is better for believers to witness to the world through a lifestyle of obedience, than demonstrate obedience to the world through the fulfillment of vows.<br><br>A foundational component of faith is obedience. The faithful individuals listed in the scripture, were obedient to HaShem despite their circumstances. One way some individuals choose to display obedience is the vow. However, vows are a public display for the world to see. The Torah considers a vow, to be a Holy action, between an individual and HaShem. As a result, when an individual makes a vow the vow must be fulfilled. Yeshua warns us that it is better to serve HaShem with yes or no, than to make a vow that cannot be fulfilled. Therefore, when a believer makes a vow, the individual must fully weigh the cost. A Believer can be obedient without making a vow. However, when an individual is led to make a vow he or she must be prepared to fulfill the vow despite the consequences.<br><br>By Rabbi Yaakov benYosef<br></div>
