All the miracles he performed was not with his own power, but God's.  This is to show that it is possible for everyone to keep the commandments of God perfectly in heart and deed.  Actually due to Jesus' sacrifice it is now even easier to keep God's commandments perfectly as we can seek forgiveness directly from Jesus without having to go through the ritual of sacrificing burnt offerings.<br><br>Before Jesus, there was Enoch and Elijah.  They could do it, so can we.<br><br>To clarify what keeping God commandments perfectly means...<br><br>1.  Love God<br>2.  Love your neighbour<br><br>Everytime we sin we must seek God for forgiveness to absolve our sins.  Once our sins have been absolved we are 100% holy until we sin again.  However this does not mean we can sin with impunity.  To prove our sincerity we must try to sin less and less each time God forgives us until eventually we sin no more.  This is because God only forgives those who truly wish to repent.<br><br>The thing to note is that once a sin has been absolved by God it is forever forgiven.  You may remember it, but God will not bring it up anymore.<br></div></blockquote>Love God... in doing so you keep the first 4 commandments.<br><br>Love your neighbour as yourself... in doing this, you keep the next six commandments... so who says you don't have to keep the commandments...<br><br>But in all of this we have to learn to keep Torah.</div>

Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. 12But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!<br><br>13I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry 14in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. 15For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 16If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.<br><br>17If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, 18do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. 19You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in." 20Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. 21For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.<br><br>22Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. 23And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 24After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!<br><br><strong>Ephesians 1:4-6</strong><br>4For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love 5he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and willÂ— 6to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Was God's Law Abolished in the New Testament?</strong><br><br>If the Sabbath were indeed abolished in the New Testament, we should find numerous passages throughout the New Testament making that clear. The negating of one of God's Ten Commandments would certainly require nothing less.<br><br>Jesus Christ said that "one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law" until all is "fulfilled," or has completely filled its purpose (Matthew 5:18 ). Various passages, including entire chapters of the New Testament, make clear the spiritual purpose behind such practices as animal sacrifices and temple worship (Hebrews 7:11-19; 8:1-6; 9:1-15; 10:1-18 ).<br><br>But God's commandments remain. The last books written in the New Testament were, in A.D. 85-95, John's epistles and, about A.D. 95, the book of Revelation. Were the Ten Commandments abolished by that time? Notice John's words: "Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, 'I know Him,' and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him" (1 John 2:3, 4).<br><br>John defined sin as the violation of God's laws. "Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness," he wrote (1 John 3:4). He knew that God's law was a law of love, defining both our love for others and our love for God: "By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome" (1 John 5:2, 3).<br><br>The intent of God's law from the beginning was love, as Jesus Christ taught: "This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it" (2 John 6).<br><br>The book of Revelation, divinely inspired by Jesus Christ Himself (Revelation 1:1), also upholds keeping God's commandments. In Revelation 12:17, shortly before Jesus Christ's return, Satan attempts to destroy members of God's Church, "who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."<br><br>In Revelation 14:12, the saints are described as "those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus." Faith and keeping God's commandments go hand in hand, as Paul stated earlier (Romans 3:31).<br><br>In the last chapter of the Bible, Jesus Christ gave a final message to the Church: "'Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work...'Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of [eternal] life, and may enter through the gates into the city" (Revelation 22:12, 14).<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large"><strong>Clearly God's law is not abolished in the New Testament.</strong></span></span></div>

Judah was the ancestor of one of the tribes of Israel, which was named after him. Likewise, the word Judaism literally means "Judah-ism," that is, the religion of the Yehudim. Other sources, however, say that the word "Yehudim" means "People of G-d," because the first three letters of "Yehudah" are the same as the first three letters of G-d's four-letter name.<br><br>Originally, the term Yehudi referred specifically to members of the tribe of Judah, as distinguished from the other tribes of Israel. However, after the death of King Solomon, the nation of Israel was split into two kingdoms: the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel (I Kings 12; II Chronicles 10). After that time, the word Yehudi could properly be used to describe anyone from the kingdom of Judah, which included the tribes of Judah, Benjamin and Levi, as well as scattered settlements from other tribes. <strong>The most obvious biblical example of this usage is in Esther 2:5, where Mordecai is referred to as both a Yehudi and a member of the tribe of Benjamin.</strong><br><br>In the 6th century B.C.E., the kingdom of Israel was conquered by Assyria and the ten tribes were exiled from the land (II Kings 17), leaving only the tribes in the kingdom of Judah remaining to carry on Abraham's heritage. These people of the kingdom of Judah were generally known to themselves and to other nations as Yehudim (Jews), and that name continues to be used today.</blockquote>So this answers your question. The word was used in biblical times.</div>
