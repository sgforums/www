It was indeed his proper name, given to him by his parents, and only in Hebrew does this name have any meaning. In Hebrew Yeshua means both "Salvation," and the concatenated form of Yahoshua, is "Lord who is Salvation." The name Jesus has no intrinsic meaning in English whatsoever.</blockquote>Here is an interesting article I came across recently, something that I was curious about on how those various meanings of the people's/places' name (especially that of the Lord and his prophets and the places mentioned in the Bible) come about...<br><br>Probably have to do a bit more reading on this subject, but its interesting to note that the English names were translated from and the various limits encountered during the translation that causes the original meaning behind the names to be masked off...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>btw: there are also quite a bit of resources at this website as well... have fun..<br><br></div>
