            <div class='col-md body'>As we share about weddings and marriages, we would like to take the opportunity to shed some light of truth on marriage relationships that I believe will change your theology and your life!<br><br>In most religious circles the whole responsibility of the marriage success has been placed wrongly on women! Whenever there is a problem in a couple, the solution of all the (predominantly male pastors) is to put the weight of response on the woman. They just command her to Â“submitÂ” some more (even to abuse and ungodly sex life) or to suffer some more until her man will decide to finally turn! Women have been suffering terribly under an ungodly yoke that is not theirs to carry! And the proof of this is that in general the marriages in the Church are not that wonderful! In fact there is a lot of domestic violence under the surface of Â“nice Sunday clothesÂ” and a lot of verbal abuse, strife and misery under the Â“plastic smilesÂ” of praise God! I believe that all this could be easily solved with a little Â“Torah TeachingÂ” that is, listening to the instructions given by Elohim Himself to the men!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When most people talk about AUTHORITY, HEADSHIP and RULING in the Body, they talk about the MEN. But when they talk about RESPONSIBILITY they put it mostly on the shoulders of the WOMEN! That is an error that is costing dearly to all the marriages in the Kehila (Church). Authority by force carries with it all the weight of responsibility! Authority without responsibility is called Â“dictatorshipÂ” and abuse! A person that carries all the weight of responsibility without authority is an abused person!<br><br>If we are to display Kingdom Marriages, then it is necessary that men take their rightful place in the area of RESPONSIBILITY! In fact authority according to Scriptures is totally shared between the man and the wife!<br><br>Then God said, Â“Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.Â” So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Then God blessed them, and God said to them, Â“Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.Â”  Genesis 1:26-28<br><br>But responsibility is totally the manÂ’s domain!<br><br>Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. Genesis 2:24<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is the responsibility of the man to cling to his wife and become ONE with her! In other words it is manÂ’s responsibility to leave everything (father and mother), to relinquish their own lives and to stick to his woman and not the other way around! If men would do that, strife in the marriage would cease. For the most part wives feel left alone, abandoned and neglected by their husbands!<br><br>It is also the responsibility of the husband to give himself up for his wife and not the other way around! For the most part Â“christian counselingÂ” counsels women to give themselves up for their husbands! Not so! The Word of God is clear that men are to give themselves up just like Messiah did for the Ekklesia (Church). Messiah did not lord it over His people but died for us. Men, that would be willing to Â“dieÂ” for their wives will be able to receive all their honor and respect and marriages will be heavenly!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Husbands, love your wives, just as the Messiah also loved the church and gave Himself for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church. For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones. Â“For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.Â” This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning the Messiah and the church. Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband. Ephesians 5:25-33<br><br>To sum it all up: Dominion and authority is to be shared by the husband and the wife while the greater responsibility remains the husbandÂ’s both for the UNITY in the marriage and for the wellbeing of his wife. If husbands obey YAHÂ’S instructions and remain submitted to Him, wives will be happy and respond with love and respect.<br><br>Husbands that will 100% give themselves up and take 100% of the responsibility for the relationship will have 100% success in their marriages! Men are the most important factor for a happy marriage, they are the head, the source of giving, unity and happiness!<br><br>It is time for TRUE ORDER to return to YÂ’shuaÂ’s Body in this issue and to see the happiest marriages on earth come forth! Many religious doctrines and traditions must be discarded as we return to the Truth that makes us all FREE!<br><br>Your friends in Israel<br><br>Rabbi Baruch and Bishop Dominiquae Bierman<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">RESTORATION OF HEADSHIP</span></strong><br><br>Shabbat shalom dearly beloved:<br><br>This week we will talk about one of the most important subjects of restoration. That is the restoration of True Headship in Man.<br><br>Then Yahveh God called to Adam and said to him, Â“Where are you?Â”<br>So he said, Â“I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.Â” And He said, Â“Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?Â” Then the man said, Â“The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.Â”  Genesis 3:9-12<br><br>Rosh Katan- Shoving responsibility unto the woman.<br><br>In this passage of scripture we can see that the first reaction of Man when Elohim calls him to accountability is to hide and to shove the responsibility of the sin to his Woman. Though it is true that the woman used her influence wrongly by enticing him, Man made his own choice to follow her in sin and by not calling her to accountability. In other words he became Rosh Katan or a Â“small headÂ” in Hebrew, which means; someone that will not take responsibility!<br><br>Man lost dominion over the earth, now the earth will resist the Man. Provision will not come easy causing great frustration.<br><br>Then to Adam He said, Â“Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, Â‘You shall not eat of itÂ’: Â“Cursed is the ground for your sake; In toil you shall eat of it All the days of your life. Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, And you shall eat the herb of the field. In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread  Till you return to the ground, For out of it you were taken;  For dust you are, And to dust you shall return.Â” Genesis 3:17-19<br><br>Woman lost the freedom and the co-equality with Man. Now Man will rule Woman. This will cause constant strife and misery in the relationship. Abuse will become the order of the day in the relationship of Man with Woman with conniving and manipulation to gain lost authority and freedom, which will rule the relationship from Woman to Man. What was given for free, and taken for granted, now has been withheld.  Adam sinned, (Woman and Man) and Man relinquished his responsibility to the Woman. In Hebrew this is called Rosh Katan, which means a Small Head. That is a person that plays it down in the area of responsibility so as to have it easy. Rosh Katan never amounts to anything because they are always evading responsibility.<br><br>To the woman He said: Â“I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; In pain you shall bring forth children; Your desire shall be for your husband, And he shall rule over you.Â” Genesis 3:16<br><br>continued...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>RESTORATION OF HEADSHIP Part2</strong></span><br><br>Man became Â“Rosh KatanÂ” and through it an inferiority complex set in. From now on Man will want to assert his headship by forcing his ruling over Woman and showing that he is a Â“MachoÂ”, by putting the Woman down.  Many Â“respectableÂ” Church Theologians and ministers that have not truly understood or believed the Gospel of the Kingdom and the FREEDOM that YÂ’shua has purchased for women, have spoken horrible and ungodly things against women in order to ascertain their position of Â“inferiorityÂ”. These terrible doctrines and attitudes in the Church have perpetuated misery in the family and have been the cause of persecution and even extermination of Women that dared to Â“break out of the moldÂ”.<br><br>The following are only a small sample of quotes by Church Leaders that have shaped the beliefs of the Church towards women and caused untold pain and misery. Taken from Â“10 Lies the Church Tells WomenÂ” by J. Lee Grady:<br><br>Â“What is the difference whether it is in a wife or a mother; it is still Eve the temptress that we must be aware of in any woman Â…. I fail to see what use woman can be to man, if one excludes the function of bearing childrenÂ” St Augustine of Hippo (354-430)<br><br>Â“Â…. Woman is defective and misbegotten, for the active power in the male seed tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex, while production of woman comes from defect in the active force.Â” Thomas Aquinas<br><br>Â“God maintained the order of each sex by dividing the business of life into two parts, and assigned the more necessary and beneficial aspects to the man and the less important, inferior matters to the woman.Â”  Early Church Father John Chrysostom (A.D. 347-407)<br><br>Â“Men should not sit and listen to a woman Â…. Even if she says admirable things, or even saintly things, this is of little consequence, since they came from the mouth a womanÂ” Origen (A.D. 185-254), The Early Church Father<br><br>Â“Even the single woman is not to make any decision without a male head.Â”  Letha Scanzoni, Author of the 1974 Book All WeÂ’re Meant to Be<br><br>Â“Do you not know that you are (each) an Eve?   The sentence of God on this sex of your lives in this age; the guilt must of necessity live too.  You are the DevilÂ’s gateway:  You are the unsealer of that (forbidden) tree:  you are the first deserter of the divine law: you are she who persuaded him whom the devil was not valiant enough to attack.  On account of your desert Â– that is, death Â– even the Son of God had to die.Â” Tertullian (A.D. 155-220)<br><br>Â”Woman must neither begin nor complete anything without man:  Where he is, there she must be, and bend before him as before a master, whom she shall fear and to whom she shall be subject and obedient.Â”  Martin Luther.<br><br>continued....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>RESTORATION OF HEADSHIP Part3</strong></span><br><br>In general The Gospel of YÂ’shua concerning Women has not been understood. He came to set Humanity FREE and that includes Woman!<br><br>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in the Messiah YÂ’shua. And if you are MessiahÂ’s, then you are AbrahamÂ’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.  Galatians 3:28-29<br><br>On the other hand in order to escape her miserable predicament and outcome of the Curse, Woman would try to assert her lost authority by using sexual appeal, conniving and manipulation. What a MESS! And this state of affairs has been ruling the marriages, the family and the society! But Glory be to God that through YÂ’shua the Messiah ALL things have been RESTORED to their original intent. True believing and forgiven Men can now be co-equal with their wives without any need to ascertain their authority by force. It is enough for the Man to take all the responsibility for the success in his relationship with YAH and with his wife.<br><br>Only the taking of responsibility bestows true authority! That is restoration of TRUE Headship. Not the Â“imposing of authority but the taking of responsibility.Â”<br><br>Once redeemed Men become the GIVERS that they are called to be, authority comes easy; Â“Not by might, nor power but by My spirit says Adonai!Â”<br><br>YÂ’shua became a curse so we can break away from the CURSE imposed upon us in the Garden of Eden. He said Â“It is finishedÂ”<br><br>The Messiah has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, Â“Cursed is everyone who hangs on a treeÂ”), that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. Galatians 3:13-14<br><br>Once Man submits himself to the true Gospel of Messiah, the true Good News of the Kingdom, he will want to break away from the pattern of the Curse in his relationship with Woman. That will bring Freedom and Joy to the relationships, fulfillment to the Marriage, the Family and of course wholeness to The Body of Messiah! Then the world will be able to look in and become jealous to have the freedom that we have and to enjoy the Heavenly Relationships that we enjoy! Right now, the world is doing much better than the Church in this area! Without the redeeming blood, they are trying to go back to the original pattern of relationships, while in the Church ungodliness, hidden misery and religiosity reins in the relationships of husbands and wives. Some times the worst condition of marriages is among the pastors as they need to maintain the supposed Â“holy faÃ§adeÂ” of a Â“godly marriageÂ” according to their deathly religious theology.<br><br>However under the surface, the husband is constantly angry with his wife because she does not Â“submitÂ”. Most pastors keep their women hidden in order to keep them Â“in their placeÂ” of inferiority allowing them to do nothing to attract attention to her. The seemingly Â“submissiveÂ” wife for the most part feels abused, rejected and even hates her husband secretly! However on Sundays, they dress well and put on the eternal Â“plastic smileÂ” as if things are really going well!<br><br>This is totally contrary to MessiahÂ’s relationship with His own Bride upon whom He bestowed ALL His authority! He died in order to display His Wife! He is not afraid of His Wife receiving all the attention. He is sitting in Heaven interceding for her! No one can see Him, but everyone can see her, and the more she shines and succeeds, the more Glory He gets!<br><br>Â“Modern mainstream Christian thinking would never support spouse abuse, nor would it suggest that women forfeit political rights to conform to a patriarchal form of government.  Nevertheless, we still use the Bible to minimize womenÂ’s rights and to limit them from having significant spiritual influence.<br><br>continued...</div>

ItÂ’s no wonder that religious homes in the United States are ranked among the highest in incidents of domestic abuse Â– second only to the homes of alcoholics.Â”  From 10 Lies the Church Tells Women by J. Lee Grady<br><br>YÂ’shua is the ULTIMATE TRUE MAN.  He is the Last Adam. Pastors, leaders and all men would do well to follow His pattern with no fear and see the Kingdom Come in their marriages, families and congregations. Men that are truly free; love to see their wives fulfilled, successful and shining.  They are not threatened by strong, talented women.  They are not afraid of Â“loosing their authorityÂ” if women are Â“too successfulÂ”, no! The very success of their wives bestows glory upon such a selfless man that gives up his life for her. These awesome, Godly men say to their women like Adam when he saw his Lady for the first time- Â“You are now bone of my bones, flesh of my fleshÂ”, or in modern terminology, Â“Your success is my successÂ”. Men that keep their women Â“subduedÂ” and inferior become inferior themselves. When you see a happy, fulfilled, shining woman, you will know that there is a TRUE MAN with her. One that is not threatened but like Messiah thrives in the success of his wife! Those men are to receive the highest honor just like YÂ’shua receives the highest honor when His bride exhibits the beauty, authority and power of His Kingdom! That is the restoration of TRUE HEADSHIP!<br><br>Beloved it is time to stop Â“the circusÂ” and come back to the True Gospel of the Kingdom concerning the relationship between Man and Woman. It is time that we show the world the TRUE Unity in marriages and the TRUE Freedom that only Messiah can give! This will bring more people into The Kingdom than any evangelistic tactic! People out there will want to have what we have.  They will recognize the signature of TRUE LOVE AND ENJOYMENT in our marriages! This will release unity, passion and fulfillment. It will affect the children who will be made free from their rebellion! And of course it will affect all of society that is made out of COUPLES!<br><br>Dear Men, let True Headship be restored to you today as you take the responsibility for your relationship with your wife to be like the relationship of Messiah with His Bride. Who did not impose authority but rather took responsibility for our sin by dying for us. He did not impose authority, He released and bestowed authority upon His wife.  He took all the responsibility and still does by interceding for her! Heavenly Marriages are at your reach.<br><br>Husbands, love your wives, just as the Messiah also loved the church and gave Himself for her, Husbands, love your wives, just as the Messiah also loved the church and gave Himself for her, Â…. So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself. Â…Â….. This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning the Messiah and the church. Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband. Ephesians 5:25,28,32,33,<br><br>Let Your Kingdom Come and Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven!<br><br>Next issue we will discuss the response of Women to truly Restored Men<br><br>Shabbat Shalom<br><br>From your friends in Israel<br>Bishop Dominiquae and Rabbi Baruch  Bierman<br></div>
