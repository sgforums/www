But gambling in the casino is a different matter altogether, for the casino is making enough money, and they figure that a certain percentage of the people will walk out with a profit.<br><br>But then the problem here is that you are supporting a "wicked" establishment.<br><br>The Holy Scriptures surprisingly say little about gambling...but<br><br>Scripture speaks of at least three ways that one may obtain or earn money:<br><br>1. Working. Ephesians 4:28 and 1 Thessalonians 4:11-12<br>2. Exchange or barter. Genesis 47:17 and 1 Kings 5:10-11<br>3. Inheritences. Matthew 7:11 and Ephesians 4:28<br><br>Is gambling at the casino wrong in the eyes of Yahweh? The question is how are you convicted?<br><br>Asking what a religion teaches about gambling is a silly question... of course all religions which are designed to teach good, will say no it is not acceptable and not good. But those religions which are more lax will say it is ok. Even within a particular religion, asking this question is like asking, how long is a piece of string. Hence I return again to my initial statement:<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>It is relationship with Yahweh through Yeshua that will produce the heart change that is needed to keep away from the casino.</strong></span><br><br>What is Yahweh's conviction speaking to you today about this particular subject matter <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>It all boils down to the individual and only you are responsible for your choices. Like I said in the other thread, stop trying to find a scapegoat for a person's lack of self control. If one is not disciplined, one never will be.</div>

It is whether you want to stay away from it if you think it is harmful.<br><br>I have read your posts in EH, you seem to be going round and round...<br><br>I have already quoted verses to you as to what Yahweh thinks about the love of money... so you go figure. Far be it from me to stand here and condemn. I personally feel that this problem with the casino is not new, it has been around for a long time already.<br><br>I have gone to las vegas and have visited all the casino's for the various shows like CE has stated, so then I am in the wrong?? and that was when I was 15. So how?<br><br>The question to you is this, if you think the casino is so bad, then you stay away from it, other than that it is up to each individuals persuasion as to whether he wants to go to the casino or not.<br><br>The question here is does going to the casino make you an inherently bad or sinful person?<br><br>What are the ten commandments? And if by going to the casino you are breaking any one of the ten commandments and any one of the 613 by laws which define how to live the commandments, then you are sinning. SO for example if you go to the casino because you covet, then you have sinned. But if you go there to look see, and have no desire to covet money, then you have not sinned. In fact, there are much more things in everday life that will cause one to sin much more readily than the casino...</div>
