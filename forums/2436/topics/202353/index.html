            <div class='col-md body'>Torah part1<br>by Todd Elder<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The word 'Torah' can refer to many different things depending on how it is used and who is using it. Defined simply as the Almighty's instructions it can be used to refer to the first five books of the Bible, the entire Old Testament, or all of the Bible. In looking at the word 'torah', we find that it is defined as a precept or statute and comes from a root word meaning teaching or instruction. Used this way it more specifically refers to what is variously known as the Torah, Pentetuch, first five books of the Bible, Books of Moses, and books of the law.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>For purposes of this paper, Torah will be defined as those statutes given by YHVH to Israel in the first five books of the Scriptures. These can be considered as His rules, instructions, and guidelines that He has given to be followed and obeyed. The purpose in giving them is for many things but among the most important are to show us how to have a relationship with YHVH and each other, and to show us how to have a good (and peaceful) life. Included within these books is the background of creation, who is YHVH's people, and the instructions for the Tabernacle which are only a pattern of what exists in Heaven. His people Israel, both descendants of Abraham and those grafted in, were meant to follow these rules and still are today.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Some people consider following the Torah just the keeping of the 10 commandments. This is not so because these cover just the basic concepts that say to have only YHVH as the Mighty One and to treat parents and other people with love and respect. The Torah contains detailed instructions on many different themes: for men, women, marriage, money, relationships, being YHVH's people, how to treat other people, help the poor, care for the world we live in, etc. In short, it shows us how to love (think about the two greatest commandments to love YHVH with all your heart mind soul and strength and also love your neighbor as yourself - they both involve love).<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It is interesting to note that by oneself, no one person would ever have to directly obey every single law. Many of these laws are made and built for being in a community. In using myself as an example, if alone, I would quickly find I could ignore the rules about kings, women, courts &amp; punishment, borrowed property, marriage &amp; family, laws for strangers and aliens, and government &amp; military themes. It is good to know these laws because I do live in society and do deal with almost every one of these issues on a regular basis. If all people followed these instructions, life would run smoothly, peacefully, and there would likely be no hunger or need. There is provision for every aspect of life.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Torah part 2<br><br>Submission<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Submission to Torah is a touchy subject for many people. We want to do what is right in the Almighty's eyes, but we do not want to do it simply as a rote form of memorization without meaning. The term legalism (trying to earn salvation by keeping the law) strikes fear into some people ... so much so that they run the other way and avoid following the law entirely.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The first thing we need to understand is that we are in submission to YHVH, The One Most High, not to the writing on some pages. Our obedience to Torah is because He is the one who has given us these instructions to follow. Next we need to know that being in submission to the Torah is not the same as legalism. Salvation is something that is given to us from the Almighty through our Savior and is not something we can earn. When we follow His rules, we are honoring Him and showing our respect and love. Because of the covenant we have with YHVH, our obedience or disobedience to His will and His rules will bring upon us blessings or curses, but this does not dictate whether we are His people or not. It is our choice to make to have faith in Him and to choose to follow. He is there ready to accept all people.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Some would worry that it is possible to make an idol out of Torah. This is probably true. We can make an idol out of anything if we choose to follow that thing and put it in the place of the One Most High. Some people do follow Torah only and do not follow or have relationship with YHVH. If we think any power or righteousness comes from keeping these laws then yes we are making an idol of the written word. It is also possible for people to keep Torah and feel they have satisfied the requirements. Yes and no. They may be keeping much of the technical requirements, but they have missed the basic point of the whole thing which is to build relationship with YHVH and each other through love. They are going through the motions that are to be done, but they are doing it without love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Torah part3<br><br>A kingdom example<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>When we first looked at the definition of worship, it included 'giving oneself to Him' and 'letting Him be Master'. In prayer recently I was deealing with the issue of giving oneself to Him and He defined it as "submission to His rules". In today's modern democratic (get away with what you can) society we are not accustomed to the high level of submission that goes to a king in his kingdom.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>One way to illustrate this is to have you imagine going into a kingdom as would have existed in early England. You are a sheep herder and would like to have his protection over you and your flock. When you approach the king and request staying in his kingdom and under his protection, the king can say yes or no and if he says yes, he can add any provisions he wants. Assum he agrees to let you stay provided you observe the civil laws of the land and that you also pay a small tribute of 50 pounds of wool each year to the palace. You agree to those terms. What happens if you do not actually keep to this bargain? If you break the laws of the land you can be thrown in prison. If you do not pay the tribute, you can be cast out of the kingdom. It does not really matter what reason you have for doing something different. If the law says do not steal and you steal (for any reason), you have broken the law. If you decide not to pay the tribute, or even if you decide to pay the tribute later in the season (for your own convenience), then you have not done as the king ordered and you can lose his favor, be punished, or even cast out of the kingdom. His law is final.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Why do I use this as an example? Because YHVH's kingdom has rules. We have great liberty and freedom of choice, but that is still within His rules. Try to imagine what would happen if everybody was able to follow their own rules and ideas in the physical world ... we would have chaos. If each person did their own thing in the spiritual ... we would have even greater chaos. Elohim likes order and shows us what is good and what is evil.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A question to ask ourselves is do we believe His word? Do we believe that when He says to do something we are to do it and when He says not to do something that we should not do it? The appearant answer is no, it is not that easy. Humans, even in settings of believers, seem to fall into discussing various theories set forth by scientists, religious thinkers, and even philosophers. We look at and discuss all these different options while trying to figure out how we should live when the answer is often quite plainly in the Scriptures. When we pick up His word, it ought to be considered as Words of the One Most High that He has recorded for us instead of just another book with some interesting reading.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I do not mean to be harsh. None of us would purposely choose to do something against His will, but in modern society, there is so much of what goes against Scripture that we become desensitized to it and it creeps into our lives without even realizing it. We are dulled to the evil around us. This is especially true to the things that are a lust to the flesh (greed, power, sexual impurity, and gluttony for example) ... these things are running rampant around us. We should be taking steps to protect ourselves from it. We should be taking further steps to try and stop it or slow it down.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In the past, I did commercial photography. This is different than the nature photography I did as a hobby. This included portraits, weddings, and even fashion model photography. Looking back, I was in the world's system (glamour in general) even if I was trying to create artwork. What a wretched world that is ... I am appalled to look back at the work I created at that time. Most, if not all of it, has now been destroyed from my collection. It took me a few years of being out of it to begin to recognize the worst of it which I then destroyed. It took still longer to recognize what was wrong with other parts of it which I then slowly got rid of as I recognized it. It is something I have repented of. This is not just asking forgiveness, but this is literally turning away from such activities and now teaching people not to do the same. As the writer of Ecclesiastes reminds us, it really is all just vanity (emptiness).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Torah part 4<br><br>More than facts<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I have been working on our family tree recently ... actually off and on for many years. As I have worked, I have collected a lot of names and dates. This has given me a little insight into where my wife and I come from, but I have found out that this is basic information and not very satisfying. I have begun finding out what these people did in their lives. Their stories are very interesting. One was a harnesss maker, another a schoolteacher, a union soldier, a cooper for a china factory, a farmer, and the list goes on. Details about what they did with their lives (jobs, hobbies, adventures in their lives) makes them feel more real. It puts a person behind the name. Knowing these details helps me to understand my family better ... learn where family traditions come from, and understand things I otherwise would not.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Similarly, the keeping of Torah should not be a dry empty exercise done from a sense of duty or because of fear of punishment. Instead, it should be done from a willing heart that wants a relationship with YHVH, is open to love and kindness, and can be done out of respect and a desire for purity. The technical motions of keeping it, has no life to it. It is only in the confines of relationship and love that it opens up and makes them more real in our lives. After making the effort to follow Torah's instruction the last couple years, one of the most important things I have learned is that these rules are there for our protection, both in the physical and in the spiritual. It safeguards us from much pain and punishment that we otherwise do not need or want. Following these guidelines forms a safety net around us that tries to keep us from going out of bounds and hurting ourselves or others. It is much like jumping on a modern trampoline with a net built around it. That net keeps us from going over the edge and falling in awkward and often painful ways the way the older trampolines would allow.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>We do not always understand or know the reason behind the instructions, but we know there is a benefit from following them. More often than not, when I start following something I have learned, I do not understand the reason nor the benefit nor the blessing until after I do them for some time and actually see the changes that come in my life because of it. We should be able to see the benefits of right living in our lives everyday (conversely we should see the problems of wrong living in our lives also).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Torah part 5<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Getting started<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Choosing to follow Torah is not something that can be forced on a person ... it must come from inside. If it does not come from an internal motivation, such an attempt will often wane and subside within a few short weeks. Actually living by the rules of Torah is not something you suddenly do in one day like turning a light bulb on. It takes time to learn and to practice. One must break old habits and form new ones. The keeping Torah is a way of thinking ... of consistently wanting to be close to Him and have relationship with Him by doing things His way. The Scriptures tell us that if we draw near to YHVH, He will draw near to us. They also tell us that if we resist the devil, he will flee. What a great thing ... and it really is much simpler than most people make this out to be.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>For myself, trying to follow all of Torah came from the beginning of my decision to form a better relationshp with YHVH. I grew up with a typical New Testament theology teaching. When I was 28, I was faced with the question of whether or not the 7th day (saturday) Sabbath is correct. It took a long time to decide, in part because I looked into so many other aspects of the Old Testament law. It simply made sense that if one old testmant law applied to my life then they all would ... I simply could not pick and choose which laws I wanted to keep. Thus it became an all or nothing question. After about a year, I concluded that yes indeed these laws were applicable to our lives and I started to keep them as best I knew how.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Did I know how? Looking back, I realize I knew only a very little bit. This is something that is a learning process throughout all of ones life. I can look over how my life has changed in recent years as I have grown into trying to obey Torah. As I began to incorporate the laws of Torah into my life and later to make them the rule book I try to guide my life by, my life has changed dramatically. It has not always been an easy choice, but it has consistently brought greater peace into my life and comfort in being in the care of the One Most High. I have experienced at least some of the blessings that come in obedience to the Father.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>People often ask where did I start? All I can say is that there are certain laws that people tend to make a big deal out of. These tend to be the ones that are visible and public (details follow below). These were the ones I was aware of as well. It was not until later that other laws, not as noticeable or which effect ones private life, were brought to my attention. As I learned of them, I tried to keep them also. There are many more I have not specifically dealt with yet, but now I look forward to learning them because I know that greater peace comes with greater obedience.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>As noted above, the keeeping of a 7th day Sabbath was the concept that originally had me exploring the Scriptures for understanding. Without a lot of effort, one can note that the Almighty set Shabbbat apart as a day of rest and as memorial for what He did with creation. It is also easy to note that it was man who decided to change the day of observance to sunday. Various reasons are given for this, but it comes down to the fact that all of those reasons are man-made. YHVH never gave the instruction for theSabbath day to be changed. Following this statute brings many good things ... more than most people give credit. It not only gives ourselves time to rest, but it gives us a specifc and frequent time to come before Him in fellowship (or alone) to praise and worship Him and to encourage one another.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Of similar note are the the observing of the Biblical Festivals instead of the christian traditional holy days. Many of those reading this newsletter are familiar with the three festival celebrations held in Jerusalem and their symbolic significance of the Two comings of the Messiah. This was something I learned only a few years ago and it has helped bring me closer to the Almighty in ways I never would have dreamed of years ago. It also brings understanding of Yahshua's role as Savior and King and the effects this has in our lives. This includes the offerings and sacrifices that were made in the Temple and the symbolism contained of His sacrifice for us for our atonement. Much of this is missing (and much has been added) in the celebrations of christmas and easter which are set by human standards.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Another of the visible changes comes in dietary habits. Most readers are probably familiar with the passages of Scripture outlining the types of meat which are not to be eaten such as that found in Lev 11. Is there really a reasoning behind this? Yes. Speaking strictly in the physical, it is for our health. Biologically speaking we can quickly ses that the Almighty would have us eat only animals that eat only plants. Animals that eat other animals or animals that act as scavengers and eat just about anything we are told to avoid. Why? Because these animals carry many diseases.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>My point of view on the natural world and world history has changed as well. The scriptures talk of creation being only about 6000 years ago. It talks of the world wide flood that made the world what it is today. Society talks of evolution and has influenced almost every aspect of our life with this theory. If we set evolution aside and try looking at the world from a creationist standpoint, we suddenly see it making a lot more sense than evolution makes. The world looks like a great piece of real estate, much of which has been devastated by a bunch of water and most of it made uninhabitable by ice, desert, or ocean. This is another reminder that the wages of sin is cursing and death. Know that YHVH has truly made the Heavens and the Earth and all that is in them, gives us hope because it is all under His control and has promised a new Heaven and Earth when the time has fully come. We should realize that one of our jobs in this life is to care for His creation. it is appearant that we (all humanity) have not done well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Torah part 6<br><br>Where it's heading<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Over time, what I realized was that my priorities were changing. This is when peace really started to enter my life and the benefits of following Torah became evident. I realized I was finally starting to put the Almighty first in my life. Then came my family and my house. This is probably the most important thing the Almighty gives a person responsibility over. After that comes other relationships. The idea of trying to amass material objects and of pursuing my own goals, desires, and dreams became less and less. It was then that I realized these things had a power over me as long as they were something I was pursuing. Vanity, wealth, and power are the confines of the devil. These things show themselves out because they make themselves urgent in our lives and displace what is truly important. In reality, if we follow the important (the things of YHVH), the urgent things of the devil just fall away. When we place Him first in our lives, we want to spend time with Him. We make the time to pray, read scripture, praise, worship, and draw close to Him. It was after my priorities changed that the less noticeable, but more personal changes also hit strongly. This includes things like finances, marriage, keeping a house spiritually clean (ex. reading material), and recognizing what it means to be in a covenant.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It is not always an easy walk. Sacrifices must be made. Selfish desires must be left behind. When we decide our convenience is more important to us than His ways, then we are saying that we are more important than He is. We are not letting Him be master, but ourselves instead. It is easier to give in to man's ways and to feel confident in what we can do or to rely upon the government for back-up ... but where does it get us? In the long term, we are forsaking the Almighty and His ways and His blessings in exhcange for man's ways and thus we are taken farther from Him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Torah part 7<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>After my attempts to follow Torah for a few years my conclusion is simple. Life is better now than it was a few years ago. There is more peace in my relationship with YHVH, in my marriage, at work, and elsewhere. I am not saying that things are perfect (for we all make our mistakes and have our own growing to do), but I have put my life into His hands and am letting Him lead me, in part through His instructions, and life is better and my hope for the future greater. Why? because these laws show us His love for us, give His protection of us, and teach us how to love Him and each other. There is nothing else in life more important.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Torah has been given to the People of Israel by YAHVEH in order to show and demonstrate His ways to the world. This was not only given for the Jewish People to keep these marvellous instructions for themselves but rather for us to share them with the entire world and thus bring the world into the ways of THE BLESSING.<br>The whole notion about Torah is very different than most Western ideas of 'LAW'. The Western idea of law is very dry, ruthless and some times even illogical. However TORAH is mostly loving, caring and it makes complete sense. This is very important that you understand this: YAH did not give us laws because He is sitting in Heaven as a dictator and wants to 'play king' with us. His laws and commandments called TORAH are given to us for a few reasons:<br>1.	To show us the way of Holiness for He is Holy<br>2.	To teach us the ways of the Kingdom of YAH because after the FALL , man lost those ways.<br>3.	To instruct us on how to stay healthy and blessed in spirit, soul and body.<br>The purpose of His Torah was not to make life miserable for us, but rather to help us live this life on earth full of holiness, purity, blessing, fruitfulness and satisfaction. And when we choose His Torah instructions after we are born again they still work for us today, just like they worked for Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and Y'shua!<br><br>The God of Israel is a God of plenty, of abundance, of greatness and He is a LOVER, He is LOVE Himself and he hates to see the people that He created disconnected from the abundant life of His Kingdom. That is why He said so clearly in John 10:10: "The thief did not come but to steal, kill and destroy. But I came to give you life and life more abundantly." Y'shua said that when we see Him, we see the Father. The Word also says to walk just as Y'shua walked and how did He walk? In obedience to His Father's commandments and because of that He was favoured by His Father and could do so many miracles!. The Word also tells us that Y'shua learnt obedience by the things He suffered. He Himself had to learn and be instructed by the Torah to be obedient to His Heavenly Father! But that obedience caused Him to fulfil His calling as Messiah, raise the dead, heal the sick, open blind eyes and feed the thousands with almost no food!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part2 The torah explained...<br><br>In Deuteronomy 28:1-14 is written so clearly that when we obey YAH"S commandments we will be the head and not the tail and that we will be blessed in everywhere and in everything we do! The Holy Spirit has been given unto us in order to lead us to obedience and teach us the Blessing ways of YAH, that is the Torah. The Holy Spirit interprets it to us, that is the New Covenant according to Jeremiah 31:31-34, the marvellous blessing ways of Elohim which is the TORAH written in our hearts. As we let it happen we enter into another realm of the Blessing and we wonder why did it take us so long to understand it and why did we oppose it for so long? And my answer to that is that the devil lied to you in order to keep you lowly, sick, poor, weak, fruitless and small. But your Father in Heaven loves you so much and if you listen to His instructions in the Torah, you will see it what your own eyes and feel it in your body, finances, family, job and everywhere.<br>Sometimes when I teach people about the dietary commandments according to Leviticus 11, they get very upset with me. They think that I am trying to 'put them under the law'. My dear friends the opposite is the truth! I am endeavouring to show you the ways of the Blessing and the way out of endless sickness, disease and a host of other problems. You see I know my Father in Heaven and He is GOOD. He is not 'sometimes good and sometimes not'. He is all good! His purpose from the beginning was to give us the best. That is what Adam had. He had the best Heaven could offer, right here on earth. And when they disobeyed one dietary commandment and they ate from the forbidden tree, they lost everything! That dietary commandment was for their own good. Elohim knew that that tree was bad for them. He created that tree that way. But the snake lied to them and basically said that the tree was actually good for them, however Elohim was not good. He did not want them to enjoy themselves. And even today the same snake is lying to most Christians, making them believe that the Torah is bondage and that the dietary laws are not for today.<br><br>Would a good father or mother give to his child food filled with worms? Would a good father feed his child with food that kills them young and causes disaster in the brain and all the internal organs? I surely think that no good parent would on purpose kill their children with that kind of food! Do you think that a good parent would tell a child a lie? Something like this: 'You are free to eat this food filled with worms as long as you bless it'. Then the child would believe his or her parent and take that food with thanksgiving and then become sick and die prematurely and even get epileptic seizures? Can you imagine a scenario like that? Would that child trust his or her parent again? I don't think so! However the majority of the Church has been made to believe this lie and to misinterpret many Scriptures in the Torah and to make The God of Israel a liar.<br><br>I have been a nutritionist and a health consultant for over 20 years now and I can assure you that science itself proves the Word of God true about all the dietary laws as written in Leviticus 11. Science has proven pigs to be one of the most deadly, poisoning and disease promoting animals that people ingest. In an article entitled 'Death in the Kitchen' by A. N. Dugger the editor of the Mt. Zion reporter it reads:<br><br>The United States Medical Association, has sent out many broadcasts warning about the danger of eating swines flesh. A post mortem examination showed Trichina in the bodies of 75% of dead people over 60 years of age. In a certain large city of America, and this city was no exception. Others were supposed to rate just as high.<br><br>All pork (swine's flesh) is infested with a small serpent like worm so small that they cannot be seen without a strong magnifying glass. These worms are called 'Trichina'. In different ways when pork is used, they get into the human body, and lodge in some organs, bring on a diseased condition and death which occurs some times after a few months or weeks, and some times causes a lingering illness.<br><br>One writer describes the case of a sufferer in these words- "An intelligent lady, a teacher in the public schools, who died of this horrible disease in consequence of tasting a single mouthful of uncooked sausage said to the writer as she was panting for breath, after suffering untold agonies from myriads of those horrible parasites which were working their way through every fiber of her body: Warn people not to eat pork!"<br><br>These little worms get into the blood stream and are carried to all parts of the body. If they set up their breeding quarters in any organ, that person dies of that disease without mentioning its cause. It has been claimed by medical authorities in the US that 50% of the deaths of people over 30 is caused by this infection.<br><br>It is said that cooking thoroughly, will destroy the larva and the eggs, but they have been found to be fertile after rendering the lard from the fat.  (Not even high heat cooking destroys them! D.B.)<br><br>Some people say: "But I have enough faith and if I pray over them and bless the pork it will become 'clean' and will not harm me."<br><br>Unfortunately that is not really Scriptural and countless of Christians<br>are praying and 'blessing' pork every day and they are still sick with many diseases connected with pork, shellfish, shrimps and other 'unclean delicacies'. In fact some of the sickest people are actually in the Church!<br>See the following passage of Scripture:<br><br>"For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving' For it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer." 1 Timothy 4:4,5<br><br>Please notice that there are two things that will sanctify your food:<br>1.	The Word of God<br>2.	Prayer<br><br>PRAYER ALONE DOES NOT SANCTIFY YOUR FOOD. THE WORD IS NEEDED ALSO.<br>When the New Testament speaks about the Word it always means the Tanach or commonly called the Old Testament Scriptures. Their real name is the Holy Scriptures. At the time that Shaul/Paul the Apostle, emissary of Y'shua wrote this letter to Timothy there was no New Testament portion of the Bible. This was canonized only 300 years later! There is not one Scripture in the Holy Scriptures, the Tanach that sanctifies pork or shrimp or any of the unclean animals described in Leviticus 11 (please read the chapter). On the contrary there are many Scriptures connecting swine with curses and with idolatry.<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 3 The torah explained...<br><br>Look at this prophetic word in Isaiah 66 about the End Times. In the New King James English Bible it is entitled: True worship and false<br><br>"For by fire and by his sword the Lord will judge all flesh; and the slain of the Lord will be many.  Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens after an idol in the midst, eating swine's flesh and the abomination and the mouse, shall be consumed together," says the Lord.<br>Here the Word is clearly connecting idolatrous practices with the eating of unclean animals. It is very revealing that Y'shua cast the demons out of the demoniac from Gadarenes into a herd of pigs. Why did He not choose sheep or goats for that? He always intended for pigs and all unclean animals to serve the purpose of 'garbage collectors', both spiritual and physical. They all eat garbage or rotten flesh. You and I are children of the King of Kings and we deserve a lot better than this!<br><br>To sanctify, means to make it holy for holy use! Have you ever thought that you are holy? You and I are the very Temple of the Holy Spirit, so Elohim intends even your food to be holy, you children to be holy, your finances to be holy?  The Holy Lifestyle is the lifestyle of the blessing!<br><br>"And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for others. Whoever walks the road though a fool shall not go astray."  Isaiah 35:8<br>This Scripture tells us that anyone that wants to walk in obedience to the Blessing, the way of the Holy Commandments, the way of Torah as revealed by the Spirit. Anyone can do it, you don't have to be a super person! The Holy Spirit has come for this very purpose to help us walk in the Way of the Blessing, that is the Highway of Holiness!<br><br>I am completely aware that when you decide to enter into the Blessing of Abraham in its fullness you have some choices to make, some decisions to take that is why YAH said to the people of Israel:<br><br>"I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live." Deuteronomy 30:19<br><br>It is all about life and blessing, abundant life and that is what YAHVEH intended when He gave the commandments to Israel and when He walked the earth in the form of Messiah Y'shua and when He sent the Holy Spirit to write the Torah in our hearts and to help us interpret it. May this life and blessing, health and prosperity be yours as you restore to you and to your family that which the devil has stolen and lied about for so long<br>The Torah interpreted by the Ruach, the Spirit of Elohim.<br><br><strong>AN IMPORTANT DELIVERANCE PRAYER</strong><br>Dear Father in Heaven, thank you for being all good and wanting to bless me in every are of my life. Forgive me for not fully believing in your goodness and for wrongly thinking that you holy instructions, called Torah were to put me in bondage or to steal my salvation 'freedom'. I understand today that true freedom is to be healthy, holy and blessed and that you have given to me instructions in your Holy Hebrew Scripture that can teach me the lifestyle of the Blessing. Please keep on revealing this subject to me. I also renounce any addiction I may have to unclean animals including pork and shellfish. I only want to be addicted to you and to you Word. So I break the power of any addiction and I am willing to let you write your Torah completely in my heart. I renounce all unnecessary fear and I bind every spirit of fear that I have had concerning the Torah and I ask the Holy Spirit to teach it to me now. In Y'shua's name I pray.<br><br>Â© Bishop Dr Dominiquae Bierman 2005  - Permission is granted (and we encourage you) to distribute these writings.
