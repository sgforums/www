It is a person's choice to CHOOSE to go to the casino, you cannot legislate for everything, otherwise, we might as well have gone right back to the start in the garden of eden and asked Yahweh to not give us free will, which in itself is an oxymoronic idea as the choice to give up free will is in essence free will anyway.
