Most people think lust equals love when one has little to do with the other. When one "feels" in love, it is probably more lust than anything, so when the lust has been consumed, there is nothing left to that relationship.<br><br>Love in a relationship is a commitment made between 2 people, that no matter what happens, they will choose to remain faithful and supportive to each other and stick it out, through good and bad times. They choose to treasure each other as real people, not just sexual objects or for what one can gain from the relationship. Sure there is chemistry and physicality in this relationship, but it extends beyond physical pleasures and feelings of being in love alone.</div>
