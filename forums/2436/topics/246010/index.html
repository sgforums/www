Later that day, little children will hunt for beautifully-decorated Easter eggs, supposedly laid by the Easter bunny. Catholics, of course, weeks earlier began the season with Lent, a forty-day period of abstinence and Â“mourningÂ” leading up to Easter.<br><br>What does it all mean? WhereÂ’s the biblical connection of Easter to JesusÂ’ resurrection? And why didnÂ’t Jesus teach His disciples to observe Easter?<br><br>Ask the average Christian why he or she holds to a particular belief or practice and youÂ’ll probably get a blank stare. Â“ItÂ’s a tradition,Â” some might answer. Or, Â“The church teaches it.Â” But the fact is, most people donÂ’t have a clue as to the origin of much of what they embrace as truth. Typically, people tend to just accept what they are toldÂ—without thinking.<br><br>The result is that many Â“ChristiansÂ” unknowingly find themselves participating in what are actually ancient traditions founded in pagan mystery religions that flourishing thousands of years before Christ!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Amazing Historical Origin of Easter</strong><br><br>It comes as a surprise to many to learn that the only place in the King James Version of the Bible that even mentions Â“EasterÂ”Â—Acts 12:4Â—is a gross mistranslation. Here, the Greek word Pascha (translated Easter) always means Â“Passover.Â” The widely acknowledged error has been corrected in all modern translations. Referring to the passage, BarnesÂ’ Notes comments that there Â“was never a more absurd Â… translation than this.Â”<br><br>So, if there is no biblical basis for Easter, where and how did it originate?<br><br>Astonishingly, Easter has its roots in ancient, polytheistic pagan religions. Countless scholarly books and reference materials document the historical development of EasterÂ—clearly demonstrating that it is fully pagan in origin.<br><br>In Come Out of Her My People, Dr. C. J. Koster, writes: Â“The whole subject of Easter, its Sunday-emphasizing date, and its pagan emblems and rites, such as Easter sunrise services, is crowned by the general admission that the word Â‘EasterÂ’ is derived from the name of a goddess, the dawn-goddess, the spring-deity, the goddess of fertility.<br><br>Â“Easter had a pre-Christian origin, namely [involving] a festival [held] in honor of Eostre, the Teutonic dawn-goddessÂ…. This Eostre was also known to be the spring goddess of fertility. [As] another form of sun-worship Â… Eostre, also called Eastre, Eostra or Ostara, was adopted by or merged with Christianity. This same dawn-goddess was also well known Â… [as] the Assyrian Ishtar, goddess of the morningÂ” (emphasis added). 1<br><br>In the ancient Middle East, people were deeply connected to the land and to the naturally-occurring agricultural cycle. The landÂ’s fertility was the key to survival. The spring of the year was highly anticipatedÂ—when productivity and fertility returned after a long desolate winter. Many cultures celebrated the coming of spring as an integral part of the worship of their gods or goddesses, particularly those associated with fertility. Koster adds that eggs and rabbits were common symbols of fertility, and that the Easter goddess was Â“not only goddess of dawn but also goddess of spring with all its fertility symbols and fertility rites.Â”<br><br>The Encyclopedia Americana states that the word Easter is Â“derived from the Norse Ostara or Eostre, meaning the festival of spring Â… when nature is in resurrection after winter. Hence, the rabbits, notable for their fecundity, and the eggs, colored like rays of the returning sunÂ….Â” 3  According to The Catholic Encyclopedia, Â“a great many pagan customs celebrating the return of spring gravitated to EasterÂ…. The rabbit is a pagan symbol and has always been an emblem of fertilityÂ” (emphasis added). 4<br><br>Alexander Hislop, in The Two Babylons, writes that Easter Â“is not a Christian name. It bears its Chaldean origin on its very forehead. Easter is nothing [more] than Astarte Â… the queen of heaven, whose name, as pronounced by the people of Nineveh, was evidently identical with that now in common use in this country [England]. That name, as found Â… on the Assyrian monuments, is Ishtar.Â” 5  In other words, the ancient Assyrians pronounced Ishtar the same way we pronounce Easter today!<br><br>The origin of Easter, however, is actually quite ancientÂ—going all the way back to the post-flood biblical Tower of Babel. NimrodÂ—who stood in opposition to the true God of heaven (Gen. 10:8-9)Â—was the key founder of the ancient Babylonian Â“mystery religion.Â” After his death, his wife, Queen Semiramis, was determined to maintain their Â“religionÂ” by deifying him as the sun-god. Later, Semiramis gave birth an illegitimate son, Tammuz (also known in Greek culture as Adonis), who she claimed was actually Nimrod reborn. Semiramis herself was deified as the Â“queen of heaven.Â” Fred Coulter, in Occult Holidays or GodÂ’s Holy DaysÂ—Which?, writes that Easter is in part a tradition that Â“celebrates the return of Semiramis into her reincarnated form as the Spring GoddessÂ…. The Babylonian goddess, Ishtar Â… is another pseudonym for Semiramis, the wife of Nimrod, and the real founder of the Babylonian cult.Â” 6<br><br>Tammuz is central as well to the Easter amalgamate. Following his untimely death at age forty, a tradition began in which he both died and was resurrected each spring. Coulter says Â“the Easter bunny and Easter egg symbolize the sexual union that produced Tammuz, the son and false messiah of Semiramis, the queen of heavenÂ…. The son of Nimrod, Tammuz was the ancient false messiah who allegedly died and was resurrected each year.Â” 7  Indeed, an obvious death and resurrection drama-theme reappears in many pagan religions. It seems that anciently Ishtar and Tammuz were both involved in a mythological death and resurrection cycleÂ—one as the moon-goddess of spring and fertility, the other as the sun-god messiah figureÂ—making them perfect forerunners of the modern Easter tradition. According to Coulter, sunrise services originated with the Babylonian priesthood to symbolically hasten the resurrection of both. 8<br><br>Historically, laments were held for the departed Tammuz for forty daysÂ—a day for each year of his life. The period ended, of course, in the early spring at his Â“resurrection.Â” Hislop writes: Â“The forty days [of] abstinence of Lent was directly borrowed from the worshippers of the Babylonian goddess [Ishtar].Â” 9  Is it a mere coincidence that Orthodox Christendom today practices a peculiarly similar customÂ—LentÂ’s forty days of mourning and abstinence leading up to Easter?<br><br>Sir James Frazer, author of The Golden Bough, adds this: Â“The sorrow of the worshippers was turned to joyÂ…. The resurrection of the god [Tammuz] was hailed by his disciples as a promise that they too would issue triumphant from the corruption of the grave.Â” 10  Note the uncanny parallel between the so-called Â“resurrectionÂ” of Tammuz and the biblical teaching on the resurrection of the saints (Rom. 6:5; I Cor. 15:12; etc.).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>How Easter Crept Into the Orthodox Church</strong><br><br>Considering its clearly pagan origin, just how did Easter find its way into Christianity? The answer has to do with syncretismÂ—the reconciliation or fusion of differing systems of belief. After the death of the apostles, the Church began to grow rapidly among Gentiles, particularly in the West. After several decades, the church at RomeÂ—now apostate but possessing considerable political and financial cloutÂ—became dominant. Determined to bring the masses of pagans into the church, Orthodox leaders in Rome were careful not to force them to abandon their idolatrous celebrations. Craftily, church leaders found a way to blend various ancient customs and pagan practicesÂ—and then apply them to Christian doctrine. Easter itself is largely a convergence of various heathen traditions applied to JesusÂ’ death and resurrection.<br><br>Koster, for example, writes that Â“festivals were celebrated [by pagans], with the rites of Adonis or of Tammuz Â… [and with ChristianityÂ’s] dead and risen Messiah being assimilated to the pagan celebration of the dead and risen Adonis (Tammuz)Â” (emphasis added). 11<br><br>Referring to the fusion of the Passover with pagan spring celebrations, Hislop writes: Â“To conciliate the pagans to nominal Christianity, Rome, pursuing its usual policy [of syncretism], took measures to get Christian and pagan festivals amalgamated, and, by a complicated but skillful adjustment of the calendar, it was found no difficult matter, in general, to get paganism and ChristianityÂ—now far sunk into idolatryÂ—in this as in so many other things, to shake hands.Â” 12<br><br>Concerning the syncretism of Easter, Frazer says: Â“When we reflect on how often the Church has skillfully contrived to plant the seeds of the new [Christian] faith on the old stock of paganism, we may surmise that the Easter celebration of the dead and risen Messiah was grafted upon a similar celebration of the dead and risen AdonisÂ…. Taken altogether, the coincidences of the Christian with the heathen festivals are too close and too numerous to be accidental. They mark the compromise which the Church Â… was compelled to makeÂ…Â” (emphasis added). 13   Frazer adds that Â“the Church may have consciously adapted the new festival [of Easter] to its heathen predecessor for the sake of winning souls for Christ.Â” 14<br><br>The Catholic Church also uses the term Christianization to describe this mixing of pagan rites with Christian practice.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Easter Becomes an Â“OfficialÂ” Church Holiday</strong><br><br>As Easter gained in popularityÂ—and the Roman church grew in influenceÂ—a long and bitter controversy developed between those faithful in the East who adhered to the Passover and those in the West who preferred Easter. The issue came to a head around ad 197, when Polycrates of Asia Minor paid the Roman church leadership a formal visit. In Ecclesiastical History, the well-known church historian Eusebius writes: Â“A question of no small importance arose at that time. For the parishes of all Asia, as from an older tradition, held that the fourteenth day of the [new] moon Â… should be observed as the feast of the SaviorÂ’s PassoverÂ…. [The] bishops of Asia, led by Polycrates, decided to hold to the old custom handed down to them. He himself, in a letter which he addressed to Victor [bishop of Rome] and the church of Rome, set forth in the following words the tradition which had come down to him: Â‘We observe the exact day [commanded in Scripture]; neither adding, nor taking away. For in Asia also great lights have fallen asleep, which shall rise again on the day of the LordÂ’s coming, when he shall come with glory from heaven, and shall seek out all the saints. Among these are Philip, one of the twelve apostles Â… and, moreover, John, who was both a witness and a teacher, who reclined upon the bosom of the Lord Â… and Polycarp in Smyrna, who was a bishop and martyrÂ…. All these observed the fourteenth day of the Passover according to the Gospel, deviating in no respect, but following the rule of faith.Â’ Â” 15<br><br>But Roman efforts to induce those from the East to abandon Passover observance were unsuccessful. As The Encyclopedia Americana brings out, the Â“early Christians were Jews and the Hebrew [Passover] tradition was powerful in their minds. A party of such conservatives [led by Polycrates] known as the Quartodecimans thus pressed for a continuance of the Jewish Passover Â… even to the point of schism, but they were overruled by the [Roman] Church as a wholeÂ….Â” 16  (Quartodeciman comes from the Latin word for Â“14thÂ”Â—and was a label given to those who followed the Scriptural command to observe the Passover on the evening of the 14th.)<br><br>In From Sabbath to Sunday, Samuele Bacchiocchi writes of this time: Â“On the one side, bishop Victor of Rome championed the Easter Sunday custom Â… and threatened to excommunicate the recalcitrant Christian communities of the province of Asia which refused to follow his instruction. On the other side, Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus and representative of the Asian churches, strongly advocated the traditional Passover date of Nisan 14. Polycrates Â… refused to be frightened into submission by the threats of Victor of Rome.Â” 17<br><br>When Polycrates firmly refused to agree to the demands of the Roman church, Victor proceeded to excommunicate himÂ—as well as all Christians who continued to observe Passover. The excommunication, as it turned out, lacked authority; nothing really changed except East and West drifted further apart on numerous issues.<br><br>In time, however, the Passover versus Easter controversy became pivotal; the church at Rome ultimately saw it as a test of their authority. Koster continues the story: Â“The Passover dispute between the Western Church and the more Scripture-adhering believers of the Near East was finally settled by ConstantineÂ’s Council of Nicaea in the year [ad] 325, where it was decided that Easter was to be kept on Sun-dayÂ…. [With] Constantine taking the lead, the Council of Nicaea decided to reject [the Passover] Â… in favor of Easter Sun-dayÂ…. Constantine exhorted all bishops to embrace [Easter Sunday observance].Â” 18<br><br>With the authority of imperial Rome finally behind it, Easter soon came to replace the Passover within visible, organized Â“Christianity.Â” True, faithful Christians were forced underground in order to continue their observance of the biblical Passover.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Are the Scriptures Silent on Easter?</strong><br><br>While there is clearly no biblical support for Easter, the Scriptures actually do have much to say against EasterÂ—both directly and indirectly. Interestingly, the Babylonian AstarteÂ—and the Assyrian IshtarÂ—are referred to dozens of times in the Old Testament using the Hebrew word Ashtaroth (Ashtoreth, Asherah), typically translated as groves in the KJV. Such groves were used in idolatrous ritual celebrations. For example, Â“And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the AsherahsÂ” (Judges 3:7, New King James Version). This verse could just as well be translated, Â“and served Baalim and EasterÂ”!<br><br>Virtually all scholars agree that Asherah is none other than AstarteÂ—also known as the Â“queen of heaven.Â” Notice Jeremiah 7:18: Â“The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke Me to anger.Â” Verse 10 calls the practice an Â“abomination.Â” The Jamieson Fausset &amp; Brown Bible Commentary has this to say about Jeremiah 7:18: Â“Cakes were made of honey, fine flour, etc., in a round flat shape to resemble the disc of the moon, to which they were offeredÂ…. The Phoenicians called the moon Ashtoreth or Astarte: the wife of Baal or Moloch, the king of heaven. The male and female pair of deities symbolized the generative powers of natureÂ….Â”<br><br>The cakes offered to the queen of heavenÂ—Astarte/IshtarÂ—are the Â“hot cross bunsÂ” of todayÂ’s Catholic Â“ChristianityÂ”! Koster adds, Â“The Â‘buns,Â’ known by the identical name boun, were used of the queen of heaven already 1500 years before the Christian eraÂ…. Even the round shape Â… with the cross on top exactly represents the very ancient symbol of the sun, namely the cross with a circled around it. This was especially known to be the symbol of the Babylonian Sun-deity.Â” 19<br><br>Surprisingly, Â“sunrise servicesÂ” are mentioned in the Bible as wellÂ—but only in a negative way. The prophet Ezekiel was shown, in vision, an important prophecy concerning the sins of GodÂ’s peopleÂ—then and today. Â“And He said to me, Â‘Turn again, and you will see greater abominations that they are doing.Â’ So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the LORDÂ’S house; and to my dismay, women were sitting there weeping for TammuzÂ”Â—the false messianic figure who dies and is resurrected every spring!Â—Â“Then He said to me, Â‘Have you seen this, O son of man? Turn again, you will see greater abominations than these.Â’ So He brought me into the inner court of the LORDÂ’S house; and there, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the [rising] sun toward the east. And He said to me, Â‘Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here?Â’ Â” (Ezek. 8:13-17).<br><br>Can we begin to put the pieces of the puzzle togetherÂ—Asherahs, the Â“queen of heavenÂ” with her cakes, worship of the sun, TammuzÂ—and see that the Â“ChristianÂ” Easter has been contrived of ancient myths, and is itself nothing but a pagan abomination?<br><br>Consider GodÂ’s warning to Israel as they possessed the land He had promised to them: Â“Observe and obey all these words which I command youÂ…. [And when you] dwell in their land, take heed to yourself that you are not ensnared to follow them Â… and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, Â‘How did these nations serve their gods? I also will do likewise.Â’ You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way; for every abomination to the Lord which He hates they have done to their godsÂ…. Whatever I command you, be careful to observe it; you shall not add to it nor take away from itÂ” (Deut. 12:28-32).<br><br>God tells Christians: Â“Do not learn the way of the GentilesÂ….Â” (Jer. 10:2)Â—do not even mention the name of their gods! (see Ex. 23:13). The apostle Paul wrote: Â“Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and lawlessness have in common? And what fellowship does light have with darkness? And what union does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever? And what agreement is there between a temple of God and idols? For you are a temple of the living God, exactly as God said: Â‘I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.Â’ Therefore, Â‘Come out from the midst of them and be separate,Â’ says the Lord, Â‘and touch not the unclean, and I will receive youÂ’ Â” (II Cor. 6:14-17).<br><br>Do we really believe these plain scriptures? Clearly, a true Christian can never mix what is godly with what is paganÂ—or the true with the false! For God can only be worshipped in a spirit of truth (John 4:24).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jesus Only Gave One Sign That He Was Messiah</strong><br><br>TodayÂ’s Easter tradition is developed around a Â“Good FridayÂ” afternoon crucifixion and an Â“Easter SundayÂ” sunrise resurrection. What most Christians fail to realize is that this scenario threatens to annul the only sign Jesus gave as proof that He was the MessiahÂ—that He would be in the grave exactly three days and three nights. Â“For just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, in like manner the Son of man shall be in the heart of the earth three days and three nightsÂ” (Matt. 12:40).<br><br>You donÂ’t have to be a math genuis to see that from Friday afternoon to Sunday morning is not three days and three nights. Thus, on this count alone, Easter is shown to be fraudulent. 20<br><br>WhatÂ’s more, Scripture nowhere instructs Christians to honor JesusÂ’ resurrection. Rather, we are commanded to commemorate His death through the Passover (see Luke 22:19-20; I Cor. 11:23-26; etc.). Again, EasterÂ—which focuses on ChristÂ’s resurrectionÂ—is proven false.<br><br>This all begs the question: What god is really being honored by Easter? Who is the real savior central to the Easter Sunday tradition? Is it the Jesus Christ of the Bible? Or, could it be that traditional Christianity is unknowingly worshipping a false saviorÂ—another Â“JesusÂ”?<br><br>ItÂ’s been said that Â“the most dangerous counterfeit is the one that most closely resembles the truth.Â” The master counterfeiter is Satan the devil, the Â“god of this worldÂ” (II Cor. 4:4)Â—and he is actively deceiving the whole world (Rev. 12:9).<br><br>Could you too be deceived?<br><br></div>

Why, even Jesus himself fasted for 40 days in the desert. Is it wrong to imitate Him then? And what is so pagan about lighting candles and singing mourning hymns? Even the Jews light menorahs in their synagogues. As for Easter eggs and Easter bunnies, they have nothing to do with religious celebrations at all. We shall not discuss this.<br><br>Of course the word Easter is not mentioned in Scripture. Easter is a pagan word arising from pagan cultures and we do not deny that. But the proper word for this season is Pascha and is both used by the Eastern and Western Church. What I shall show is that the Easter we have now is not the Easter of the pagans, but that it is the celebration of the paschal mystery of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I understand your unease with inculturation and syncretism. But what use is the Gospel if nobody can understand it? It is wrong to explain it to the pagans in their own terms, redefined anew obviously?<br><br>IÂ’m sure we have all gone to an Easter service of some sort before. Have you heard the congregation praise Ishtar or any pagan gods? Who are they praising? Of coure they are praising Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords! It is that difficult to differentiate between the pagan Easter and the Christian Easter?<br><br>Since the Lord has commanded us to celebrate Passover, indeed we have and we shall. It is in observing Easter that we are observing the Passover. Christ himself is our Passover. At the Last Supper He instituted the Sacrament of the Eucharist. I will quote Pope John Paul 2Â’s homily on Holy Thursday, 20 April 2000.<br><br><blockquote>Christ ate the Passover Meal with his disciples in obedience to the Old Covenant prescriptions, but he gave the rite new substance. We have heard how Saint Paul explains it in the Second Reading, taken from the First Letter to the Corinthians. This text, which is thought to be the oldest account of the LordÂ’s Supper, recalls that Jesus, Â“on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, Â‘This is my body which is [given] for you. Do this in remembrance of meÂ’. In the same way also the cup at the end of the meal, saying, Â‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of meÂ’. For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the LordÂ’s death until he comesÂ” (1 Cor 11:23-26).</blockquote>Note that every time we celebrate the Eucharist, it is celebrating the Passover, which has been redefined by the Lord himself. No more Old Covenant, but a New Covenant.<br><br>Furthermore,<br><br><blockquote>Some who believe in the pagan origin of these holidays actually state that any Christian who celebrates them is unknowingly worshipping pagan deities. We can answer this by pointing out that a Christian who celebrates Easter does not intend to worship the goddess Eostra, but to commemorate the Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ. God looks upon the heart and sees His child's intention to worship Him, so He does not mistake it for idolatry.</blockquote><a href="http://%20http://home.nyc.rr.com/mysticalrose/pagan8.html" rel="nofollow"> http://home.nyc.rr.com/mysticalrose/pagan8.html</a><br><br>Jesus has explicitly commanded us to celebrate Pascha. But letÂ’s look at something else. Jesus never asked us to celebrate His birthday either. If we neither celebrate His birth, death and resurrection, what are we doing yearly to remember all this?<br><br>Jesus Christ is our Passover!<br></div>

It is that difficult to differentiate between the pagan Easter and the Christian Easter?<br><br></div></blockquote>Easter is a derivative of the name of the goddess Ishtar. Can you have a christian Ishtar? Which is an idol? The mere use of the word Easter is in itself an allusion to paganism and pagan gods. Which is that which was expressly forbidden by Hashem. You shall worship no other gods...<br><br>A christian easter? Is this a joke? Taking a pagan ritual and assimilating it into the church and repackaging it in "new material" ie in the guise of Yeshua still does not make it acceptable to Yaweh. If easter is christian, then why is the easter celebration followed by the church so much like the practices that they held for Tammuz? Yeshua most certainly did not have anything in common with this and with easter that is celebrated in the church today.<br><br>What happened to Pesach? Why is it that we have to create a new festival to honour our LORD's death when there is alreay one to commorate it? One which we are commanded to observe? Refer to Exodus Chapter 12.<br><br>We can find also from the new testament that Yeshua was crucified during passover and as you have rightly said that Yeshua is our passover lamb, so therefore Pesach is the correct celebration for this time. Why does the church not keep it??</div>

Pesach began sundown last night, but easter is celebrated on friday... where is the connection? The most important days of Pesach are the first and the last days, it lasts for 7 days. The way easter is celebrated is no where near the way Pesach is celebrated. The church has already missed Pesach.</div>
