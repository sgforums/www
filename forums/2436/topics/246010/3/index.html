            <div class='col-md body'>Once again Brey, you have displayed your ignorance of the New Testament. Acts 17:17 is taken out of context to support your argument.<br><br><blockquote>Acts 17 (NIV)<br><br>16While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. 17So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.</blockquote>Read verse 16 my friend!<br><br>The gentile worshippers are NOT gentile converts to Yeshua. If they are, why did Shaul reason with them?<br><br>Acts 17 is talking about Shaul preaching the good news of Yeshua to the Jews, God-fearers and pagans.</div>
