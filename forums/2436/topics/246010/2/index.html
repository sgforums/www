            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">Yeshua spent 40 days in the desert at the START of His ministry. How is this connected all the way to His death and ressurection at Pesach?<br><br>Find me a verse in the bible in which Hashem commands us to keep 40 days of mourning before Pesach?<br><br>Yeshua did not spend 40 days fasting and then suddenly get crucified...<br><br>It is plain from what you have posted that this pagan ritual has indeed been assimilated by the church under the guise of imitating Yeshua's suffering in the desert, but what has this got to do with Pesach?</div></blockquote>No, there is no verse in the Bible in which God commands us to keep 40 days of mourning before Pesach. However, it is interesting that we see the number 40 very often in the Bible. Jesus fasted for 40 days, the Israelites were in the desert for 40 years, Nineveh was given forty days to repent.<br><br>Irregardless, Jesus did not get crucified immediately, but the fast in the desert was before he began his public ministry, culminating in His death on the Cross. Lent is the ChristianÂ’s way of understanding these mysteries.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">Easter is a derivative of the name of the goddess Ishtar. Can you have a christian Ishtar? Which is an idol? The mere use of the word Easter is in itself an allusion to paganism and pagan gods. Which is that which was expressly forbidden by Hashem. You shall worship no other gods...<br><br>A christian easter? Is this a joke? Taking a pagan ritual and assimilating it into the church and repackaging it in "new material" ie in the guise of Yeshua still does not make it acceptable to Yaweh. If easter is christian, then why is the easter celebration followed by the church so much like the practices that they held for Tammuz? Yeshua most certainly did not have anything in common with this and with easter that is celebrated in the church today.<br><br>What happened to Pesach? Why is it that we have to create a new festival to honour our LORD's death when there is alreay one to commorate it? One which we are commanded to observe? Refer to Exodus Chapter 12.<br><br>We can find also from the new testament that Yeshua was crucified during passover and as you have rightly said that Yeshua is our passover lamb, so therefore Pesach is the correct celebration for this time. Why does the church not keep it??</div></blockquote>The names of the days of the week are also pagan-influenced. Everyday is a sinful day then? For example, Thursday is derived from ThorÂ’s day. You know who that is so I shanÂ’t educate you once more.<br><br>When Easter was first being celebrated, nobody called it Easter. It was called Pascha. And it still is. Therefore even if it Easter is a pagan word, it does not matter because Pascha is not about celebrating any pagan god.<br><br>Do tell us how the celebration of the Jewish Pesach commemorates the death of Our Lord. I cannot see it. What I see is that this festival has been recreated into Pascha by incorporating the paschal mystery of the Lord. Pascha is the celebration of the paschal mystery of Christ. It IS our Passover.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">Quick question, what is the Old Covenant and what is the New Covenant?</div></blockquote>Old Covenant = Covenant made between God and Moses, where God gives the people of Israel the Ten Commandments, and the Mosaic Laws.<br><br>New Covenant = A new covenant, resulting in a new Law where God will send the Holy Sprit to all people through faith in Jesus Christ, thus making perfect the foundation set up by the Old Covenant.<br>This is what Mother Church teaches. Paragraph 1968 of the Catechism states Â‘The Law of the Gospel fulfills the commandments of the Law. The Lord's Sermon on the Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing the moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their hidden potential and has new demands arise from them: it reveals their entire divine and human truth. It does not add new external precepts, but proceeds to reform the heart, the root of human acts, where man chooses between the pure and the impure,22 where faith, hope, and charity are formed and with them the other virtues. The Gospel thus brings the Law to its fullness through imitation of the perfection of the heavenly Father, through forgiveness of enemies and prayer for persecutors, in emulation of the divine generosity.23 Â‘<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">How are you observing Pesach by observing easter? Pesach began sundown last night, but easter is celebrated on friday... where is the connection? The most important days of Pesach are the first and the last days, it lasts for 7 days. The way easter is celebrated is no where near the way Pesach is celebrated. The church has already missed Pesach. </div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">If you want to celebrate the birthday of Yeshua at least do it in the right time? During the Feast of Tabernacles... not dec25?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>The question is not what are we doing yearly to remember all of this, is what do we do daily to remind us of all Yeshua has done for us?<br><br></div></blockquote>What we do daily is important, but that is not the crux of this debate. We are concerned with the public and communal celebration of the mysteries of Christ.<br><br>Since Jesus Christ has given Mother Church the power to bind and loose, His successors have the power and responsibility of determining the customs and laws of the Church. ThatÂ’s how we have Christmas, and Sunday as the holy day. In any case we gladly follow.<br><br>Furthermore God has granted the privilege of the Holy Spirit to guide the Apostles and their successors. Does the Spirit fail? No. Therefore it is in this confidence that we follow the leaders of the Church.<br><br>I was wondering, why do you insist that it must be during the Feast of Tabernacles? Do you know JesusÂ’ real birthdate? We donÂ’t claim to do so. It is just an estimate.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">It is not wrong to explain it to the pagans in their own terms, but it BECOMES wrong when the pagan customs are absorbed into our belief system. Even in OT times, the people of Yahweh were warned about associating with different religions and mixing them with their worship of Hashem. How so is this different now? Are we not Yahweh's people? Does not this warning apply to us as well? So why don't we follow?</div></blockquote>I believe we have different perceptions here. You see it as Christianity being corrupted by paganism. We see it as Christianity conquering paganism by making their pagan festival unrecognizable. And we ultimately have succeeded in conquering paganism.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">and we are certain he was born in a manger? english translation could be wrong you know...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>WhoÂ’s being unbiblical now? =P<br>As a parting shot, I will leave you to read the Acts of the Apostles Chapter 15.<br><blockquote><br>5Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, "The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses."<br>6The apostles and elders met to consider this question. 7After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: "Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. 8God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. 9He made no distinction between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. 10Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? 11No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are."<br></blockquote>Mosaic Law has been abolished; moral laws have been made perfect by the New Law.  Christianity has professed this for the past thousand years. I donÂ’t know why your Torah-observant movement is trying to re-invent the wheel. These ideas are recent innovations. Furthermore it does not help that you quote crap such as Alexander Hislop, whom is discredited even by Protestants. Stop misleading the faithful.</div>

Yeshua Himself celebrated Passover on the same day that the Jewish people kept it, so why has the church seen fit to change the day? Let us go back to Exodus when Yahweh Himself gave the commandment to keep the passover. Exodus 12:14 onwards...<br><br>This day shall be to you for a memorial; and you shall keep it a feast to the LORD thoroughout your generations shall you keep it a feast by ordinance forever. Seven day shall you eat unleavened bread, but on the first day there shall be a holy gathering, and on the seventh day there shall be a holy gathering to you; no manner of work shall be done on them... you shall observe the commandment of unleavened bread; for on this very day have I  brought your hosts out of Mizrayim: therefore shall you observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. In the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread...<br><br>Going by what Yahweh commanded, the church does not celebrate Passover on the 14th day of the first month of Aviv which is counted on a lunar calendar... they do not even observe that the first and the seventh days are sabbaths where no work ought to be done. They also do not observe the seven days of no leaven. So how can you even say that this is close to passover as Yeshua would have celebrated it.<br><br>Before His death Yeshua had the passover meal and He broke the bread and the wine and said do this in remembrance of Him.<br><br>This is how passover reminds us of the death of Yeshua. He is our passover lamb as rightly said by you, and Mizrayim (egypt) is a symbol of sin both in the spiritual and physical sense, therefore every year when we celebrate passover, we remember that Yahweh is the one that brought us out of sin. The passover lamb was always killed between the evening of the 14th day and the 15th day, and likewise Yeshua was killed on 3pm on the 15th day, before sundown.</div>

Do you know JesusÂ’ real birthdate? We donÂ’t claim to do so. It is just an estimate. </div></blockquote>The key to calculating the date of the birth of Messiah is Luke 1:5 where we<br>learn that Zechariah the father of Yochanan was a priest of the course of<br>Abijah.<br><br>The priests became to numerous to all serve at the Temple all the time, so<br>they were divided into 24 courses (1Chron. 24).  Each course served for two<br>weeks each year, once in the former rain (first half of the year) and once<br>in the latter rain (second half of the year).  There were also three weeks<br>in which all the priests were required to serve, these were the three<br>pilgrimage festivals (Dt. 16:16).  24 times 2 is 48 plus three is 51.  51<br>weeks is 357 days fitting nicely within the 360-day lunar year.<br><br>The course of Abijah is the eighth course (1Chron. 24:10) which serves the<br>tenth week during the former rain portion of the year (this is because<br>during Passover and Shavuot (Pentecost) all of the priests serve together<br>Dt. 16:16).  Zechariah had his vision while serving in the course of Abijah<br>in the tenth week (It will become apparent that he was serving his first<br>course not his second, as the timing will show as we progress).  Thus<br>Zechariah's vision took place during the 10th week of the year (The<br>religious year beginning at Nisan/Abib around 14 days before Passover).  We<br>must add two additional weeks before Yochanan (John) could be conceived, due<br>to the purity laws (Lev. 12:5; 15:19, 25).  So Yochanan was conceived in the<br>12th week of the year.  He was born about 40 weeks later during the 52nd<br>week of the year (12 + 40 = 52) which brings us to Passover.  Thus Yochanan<br>was born at Passover, the very time that Elijah was, according to Jewish<br>tradition, supposed to appear.<br><br>Yeshua was conceived 6 months (about 25 weeks) after Yochanan's conception.<br>This means Yeshua was conceived around the 37th week around Chanukah.  This<br>would mean the light of the world was conceived during the festival of<br>lights.<br><br>Yeshua was born 40 weeks later (around week 77 that is week 25 of the<br>following year) this brings us to the time of the fall feasts.<br><br>There are several clues that Yeshua was born at Sukkot:<br><br>1. Bethlehem was "booked solid."  This would have been due to the census,<br>which would have taken place over the period of a year.  Every Jew was<br>required to come to Jerusalem for Sukkot (Dt. 16:16) this would have over<br>run Jerusalem as well as Bethlehem just five miles away.<br><br>2. Yeshua was born in a stable.  The Hebrew word for "stable" is "sukkah"<br>(as in Gen. 33:17) so it is likely that Yeshua was born in a Sukkah/booth.<br><br>3. If Yeshua was born on the first day of Sukkot then he would have been<br>circumcised on the "eighth great day" a festival following Sukkot.  This day<br>was the original "Simchat Torah" (Rejoicing in the Torah) which is now held<br>the following day in Rabbinic Judaism.  Yeshua would have entered the<br>covenant on the day of "rejoicing in the Torah."<br><br>4. When the angels appeared to the shepherds they made a statement which<br>closely echoes the ancient Sukkot liturgy "...behold, we have come to<br>declare to you glad tidings of great joy." (Lk. 2:10-11)<br><br>5. Sukkot is symbolic of God dwelling in a "tabernacle" (body?) with us.<br></div>

In other words, they will learn what is right and wrong, clean and unclean, holy and unholy as they are taught every Shabbat. Does this same writer actually believe that gentiles are only restricted to these four prohibitions? Will the new gentile converts not learn each Shabbat that stealing is wrong, murder is not productive, or that lying and armed robbery are not beneficial?<br><br>From the beginning, God's commandments have always been for God's people.

It seems that the 4 requirements are there partly because the Jewish apostles did not want the gentile converts to grieve the Jewish converts (Matthew Henry).<br><br>David Guzik (I dunno who the heck is he to be honest) explains it quite well:<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.enduringword.com/commentaries/4415.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.enduringword.com/commentaries/4415.htm</a><br><br>g. <strong>But that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from things strangled, and from blood</strong>: JamesÂ’ decision that Gentile believers should not be under the Mosaic Law is also tempered by practical instruction.  The idea was that it was important that Gentile believers not act in a way that would antagonize the Jewish community <strong>in every city</strong> and destroy the churchÂ’s witness among Jews.<br><br>i. If the decision is that one does not have to be Jewish to be a Christian, it must also be declared that one does not need to forsake the Law of Moses to be a Christian.<br><br>h. <strong>To abstain from things polluted by idols . . . from things strangled, and from blood</strong>: These three commands have to do with the eating habits of Gentile Christians.  Though they were not bound under the Law of Moses, they were bound under the Law of Love.  The Law of Love tells them, Â“donÂ’t unnecessarily antagonize your Jewish neighbors, both in and out of the church.Â”<br><br>i. <strong>To abstain from . . . sexual immorality</strong>: When James declares that they forbid the Gentile Christians to abstain from . . . sexual immorality, we shouldnÂ’t think that it means common sex outside of marriage, which all Christians (Jew or Gentile) recognized as wrong.  Instead, James is directing these Gentiles living in such close fellowship with the Jewish believers to observe the specific marriage regulations required by Leviticus 18, which prohibited marriages between most family relations.  This was something that Jews would abhor, but most Gentiles would think little of.<br><br>j. Gentile Christians had the Â“rightÂ” to eat meat sacrificed to idols, to continue their marriage practices, and to eat food without a kosher bleeding, because these were aspects of the Mosaic law they definitely were not under.  However, they are encouraged (demanded?) to law down their Â“rightsÂ” in these matters as a display of love to their Jewish brethren.<br><br>i. Â“All four of the requested abstentions related to ceremonial laws laid down in Leviticus 17 and 18, and three of them concerned dietary matters which could inhibit Jewish-Gentile common meals.Â” (Stott)</blockquote>I find the Christian commentaries more convincing than your explanation.</div>
