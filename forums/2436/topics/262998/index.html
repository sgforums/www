            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Psalm Chapter 35</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This psalm is an awe-inspiring and wondrous prayer about David's enemies-that they be as chaff before the wind, chased by the angel of God. It also declares that everything comes about through God's help.</span><br><br>1. By David. Fight my antagonists, O Lord, battle those who battle against me. 2. Take hold of shield and armor and arise to help me. 3. Draw a spear, and bar the way before my pursuers; say to my soul, "I am your deliverance.Â” 4. Let those who seek my life be shamed and disgraced; let those who devise my harm retreat and be humiliated.5. Let them be as chaff before the wind; let the angel of the Lord thrust them away. 6. Let their path be dark and slippery; let them be chased by the angel of the Lord. 7. For without cause have they laid their nets in the pit for me; without cause have they dug [pits] for my soul. 8. Let darkness come upon him unawares; let the very snare that he hid trap him, in darkness he will fall in it. 9. And my soul shall exult in the Lord, rejoice in His deliverance. 10. My entire being shall declare: Lord, who is like You? Who saves the poor from one stronger than he, the poor and the destitute from one who would rob him. 11. Corrupt witnesses rise up [against me], they demand of me things of which I do not know. 12. They repay me evil for good, death for my soul. 13. But I wore sackcloth when they were ill; I afflicted my soul with fasting. Let my prayer return upon my own bosom. 14. As if it were my friend, my brother, I went about; like a mother in mourning, I was bent over in gloom. 15. But when I limped, they rejoiced and gathered; the lowly gathered against me-even those whom I do not know; they laugh and cannot be quiet. 16. With flattery and scorn, for the sake of a meal,1 they gnash their teeth at me. 17. My Lord, how long will You look on? Restore my life from their darkness; from young lions, my soul. 18. I will thank You in a great congregation, amidst a mighty nation I will praise You. 19. Let not those who hate me without cause rejoice over me; [let not] those who despise me without reason wink their eye. 20. For they speak not of peace, rather they scheme deceitful matters against the broken of the land. 21. They opened their mouths wide against me, they said, "Aha! Aha! Our eyes have seen [his misfortune].Â” 22. You saw, Lord, be not silent; my Lord, be not distant from me. 23. Rouse and awaken Yourself to my judgement, to my cause, my God and my Lord. 24. Judge me according to your righteousness, Lord my God; let them not rejoice over me. 25. Let them not say in their hearts, "Aha! We have our desire!" Let them not say, "We have swallowed him!Â” 26. Let them be shamed and disgraced together, those who rejoice at my trouble; let them be clothed in shame and humiliation, those who raise themselves arrogantly over me. 27. Let those who desire my vindication sing joyously and be glad; let them say always, "Let the Lord be exalted, Who desires the peace of His servant.Â” 28. My tongue will speak of Your righteousness, Your praise, all day long.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Psalms Chapter 36</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This psalm is a message to those who follow their evil inclination, that tells them, "Do not place the fear of God before you," and brings them to sin by beautifying evil deeds in their eyes. For so is his way: "He descends (to earth) and corrupts, then goes up (to the Heavenly Court) and prosecutes."</span><br><br>1. For the Conductor, by the servant of the Lord, by David. 2. [I think] in my heart: Sin says to the wicked, "There is none [who need place] the fear of God before his eyes.Â” 3. For Sin makes itself appealing to him, until his iniquity be found and he is hated. 4. The speech of his mouth is evil and deceit; he fails to reason, to improve. 5. On his bed he contemplates evil, he stands in a path that is not good; he does not despise evil. 6. O Lord, Your kindness is in the heavens; Your faithfulness is till the skies. 7. Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, Your judgements extend to the great deep; man and beast You deliver, O Lord. 8. How precious is Your kindness, O God; man takes shelter in the shadow of Your wings. 9. They will be filled by the abundance of Your house; from the stream of Your Eden, You will give them to drink. 10. For the source of life is with You; in Your Light do we see light. 11. Extend Your kindness to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright of heart. 12. Let not the foot of the arrogant overtake me; let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. 13. There1 the doers of evil fell, thrust down, unable to rise.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Psalms Chapter 37</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">King David exhorts his generation not to be jealous of the prosperity of the wicked, for it may lead to falling into their ways. Rather, put your trust in God, conduct yourselves with integrity, and God will take care of everything.</span><br><br>1. By David. Do not compete with the wicked; do not envy doers of injustice. 2. For like grass they will be swiftly cut down; like green vegetation they will wither. 3. Trust in the Lord and do good; then will you abide in the land and be nourished by faith. 4. Delight in the Lord, and He will grant you the desires of your heart. 5. Cast your needs upon the Lord; rely on Him, and He will take care. 6. He will reveal your righteousness like the light, your justness like the high noon. 7. Depend on the Lord and hope in Him. Compete not with the prosperous, with the man who invents evil schemes. 8. Let go of anger, abandon rage; do not compete with [one who intends] only to harm. 9. For the evildoers will be cut down; but those who hope in the Lord, they will inherit the earth. 10. For soon the wicked one will not be; you will gaze at his place and he will be gone. 11. But the humble shall inherit the earth, and delight in abundant peace. 12. The wicked one plots against the righteous, and gnashes his teeth at him. 13. My Lord laughs at him, for He sees that his day will come. 14. The wicked have drawn a sword and bent their bow to fell the poor and destitute, to slaughter those of upright ways. 15. But their sword shall enter their own hearts, and their bows shall break. 16. Better the little of the righteous, than the abundant wealth of the wicked. 17. For the strength of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord supports the righteous. 18. The Lord appreciates the days of the innocent; their inheritance will last forever. 19. They will not be shamed in times of calamity, and in days of famine they will be satisfied. 20. For the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord are as fattened sheep: consumed, consumed in smoke. 21. The wicked man borrows and does not repay; but the righteous man is gracious and gives. 22. For those blessed by Him will inherit the earth, and those cursed by Him will be cut off. 23. The steps of man are directed by God; He desires his way. 24. When he totters he shall not be thrown down, for the Lord supports his hand. 25. I have been a youth, I have also aged; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his offspring begging bread. 26. All day he is kind and lends; his offspring are a blessing. 27. Turn away from evil and do good, and you will dwell [in peace] forever. 28. For the Lord loves justice, he will not abandon his pious ones-they are protected forever; but the offspring of the wicked are cut off. 29. The righteous shall inherit the earth and dwell upon it forever. 30. The mouth of the righteous one utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice. 31. The Torah of his God is in his heart; his steps shall not falter. 32. The wicked one watches for the righteous man, and seeks to kill him. 33. But the Lord will not abandon him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. 34. Hope in the Lord and keep His way; then He will raise you high to inherit the earth. When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it. 35. I saw a powerful wicked man, well-rooted like a vibrant, native tree. 36. Yet he vanished, behold he was gone; I searched for him, but he could not be found. 37. Watch the innocent, and observe the upright, for the future of such a man is peace. 38. But sinners shall be destroyed together; the future of the wicked is cut off. 39. The deliverance of the righteous is from the Lord; He is their strength in time of distress. 40. The Lord helps them and delivers them; He delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they have put their trust in Him.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Psalms Chapter 38</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A prayer for every individual, bewailing the length of the exile. One who is in distress should recite this psalm, hence its introduction, "A psalm... to remind" (to remind us to recite it in times of distress). One can also derive many lessons from it.</span><br><br>1. A psalm by David, to remind. 2. O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger, nor chastise me in Your wrath. 3. For Your arrows have landed in me, Your hand descended upon me. 4. There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your rage, no peace in my bones because of my sin. 5. For my iniquities have flooded over my head; like a heavy load, they are too heavy for me. 6. My wounds are rotted; they reek because of my foolishness. 7. I am bent and extremely bowed; all day I go about in gloom. 8. My sides are inflamed; there is no soundness in my flesh. 9. I am weakened and extremely depressed; I howl from the moaning of my heart. 10. My Lord, all that I desire is before You; my sighing is not hidden from You. 11. My heart is engulfed, my strength has left me; the light of my eyes they, too, are not with me. 12. My friends and companions stand aloof from my affliction; my intimates stand afar. 13. The seekers of my life have laid traps; those who seek my harm speak destructiveness; they utter deceits all day long. 14. But I am like a deaf man, I do not hear; like a mute that does not open his mouth. 15. I was like a man that does not perceive, and in whose mouth there are no rebuttals. 16. Because for You, O Lord, I wait; You will answer, my Lord, my God. 17. For I said, "Lest they rejoice over me; when my foot falters they will gloat over me.Â” 18. For I am accustomed to limping, and my pain is constantly before me. 19. For I admit my iniquity; I worry because of my sin. 20. But my enemies abound with life; those who hate me without cause flourish. 21. Those who repay evil for good resent me for my pursuit of good. 22. Do not forsake me, O Lord; do not be distant from me, my God. 23. Hurry to my aid, O my Lord, my Salvation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Pslam 102<br><br>An awe-inspiring prayer for the exiled, and an appropriate prayer for anyone in distress.</strong><br><br>1. A prayer of the poor man when he is faint [with affliction], and pours out his tale of woe before the Lord.<br>2. O Lord, hear my prayer, let my cry reach You!<br>3. Hide not Your face from me on the day of my distress; turn Your ear to me; on the day that I call, answer me quickly.<br>4. For my days have vanished with the smoke; my bones are dried up as a hearth.<br>5. Smitten like grass and withered is my heart, for I have forgotten to eat my bread.<br>6. From the voice of my sigh, my bone cleaves to my flesh.<br>7. I am like the bird of the wilderness; like the owl of the wasteland have I become.<br>8. In haste I fled; I was like a bird, alone on a roof.<br>9. All day my enemies disgrace me; those who ridicule me curse using my name.<br>10. For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears,<br>11. because of Your anger and Your wrath-for You have raised me up, then cast me down.<br>12. My days are like the fleeting shadow; I wither away like the grass.<br>13. But You, Lord, will be enthroned forever, and Your remembrance is for all generations.<br>14. You will arise and have mercy on Zion, for it is time to be gracious to her; the appointed time has come.<br>15. For Your servants cherish her stones, and love her dust.<br>16. Then the nations will fear the Name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth Your glory,<br>17. when [they see that] the Lord has built Zion, He has appeared in His glory.<br>18. He turned to the entreaty of the prayerful, and did not despise their prayer.<br>19. Let this be written for the last generation, so that the newborn nation will praise the Lord.<br>20. For He looked down from His holy heights; from heaven, the Lord gazed upon the earth,<br>21. to hear the cry of the bound, to untie those who are doomed to die,<br>22. so that the Name of the Lord be declared in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem,<br>23. when nations and kingdoms will gather together to serve the Lord.<br>24. He weakened my strength on the way; He shortened my days.<br>25. I would say: "My God, do not remove me in the midst of my days! You Whose years endure through all generations.Â”<br>26. In the beginning You laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.<br>27. They will perish, but You will endure; all of them will wear out like a garment; You will exchange them like a robe, and they will vanish.<br>28. But You remain the same; Your years will not end.<br>29. The children of Your servants will abide; their seed shall be established before You.<br><br></div>

My soul, bless the Lord; forget not all His favors:<br>3. Who forgives all your sins, Who heals all your illnesses;<br>4. Who redeems your life from the grave, Who crowns you with kindness and mercy;<br>5. Who satisfies your mouth with goodness; like the eagle, your youth is renewed.<br>6. The Lord executes righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.<br>7. He made His ways known to Moses, His deeds to the Children of Israel.<br>8. The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and of great kindness.<br>9. He will not contend for eternity, nor harbor ill will forever.<br>10. He has not dealt with us according to our transgressions, nor requited us according to our sins.<br>11. For as high as heaven is above the earth, so has His kindness been mighty over those who fear Him.<br>12. As far as the east is from the west, so has He distanced our transgressions from us.<br>13. As a father has compassion on his children, so has the Lord had compassion on those who fear Him.<br>14. For He knows our nature; He is mindful that we are but dust.<br>15. As for man, his days are like grass; like a flower of the field, so he sprouts. 16. When a wind passes over him, he is gone; his place recognizes him no more.<br>17.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Psalm 139</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A most prominent psalm that guides man in the ways of God as no other in all of the five books of Tehillim. Fortunate is he who recites it daily.</span><br><br>1. For the Conductor, by David, a psalm. O Lord, You have probed me, and You know. 2. You know my sitting down and my standing up; You perceive my thought from afar. 3. You encircle my going about and my lying down; You are familiar with all my paths. 4. For there was not yet a word on my tongue-and behold, Lord, You knew it all. 5. You have besieged me front and back, You have laid Your hand upon me. 6. Knowledge [to escape You] is beyond me; it is exalted, I cannot know it. 7. Where can I go [to escape] Your spirit? And where can I flee from Your presence? 8. If I ascend to the heavens, You are there; if I make my bed in the grave, behold, You are there. 9. Were I to take up wings as the dawn and dwell in the furthest part of the sea, 10. there, too, Your hand would guide me; Your right hand would hold me. 11. Were I to say, "Surely the darkness will shadow me," then the night would be as light around me. 12. Even the darkness obscures nothing from You; and the night shines like the day-the darkness is as light. 13. For You created my mind; You covered me in my mother's womb. 14. I will thank You, for I was formed in an awesome and wondrous way; unfathomable are Your works, though my soul perceives much. 15. My essence was not hidden from You even while I was born in concealment, formed in the depths of the earth. 16. Your eyes beheld my raw form; all [happenings] are inscribed in Your book, even those to be formed in future days-to Him they are the same. 17. How precious are Your thoughts to me, O God! How overwhelming, [even] their beginnings! 18. Were I to count them, they would outnumber the sand, even if I were to remain awake and always with You. 19. O that You would slay the wicked, O God, and men of blood [to whom I say], "Depart from me!Â” 20. They exalt You for wicked schemes, Your enemies raise [You] for falsehood. 21. Indeed, I hate those who hate You, Lord; I contend with those who rise up against You. 22. I hate them with the utmost hatred; I regard them as my own enemies. 23. Search me, Lord, and know my heart; test me and know my thoughts. 24. See if there is a vexing way in me, then lead me in the way of the world.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Psalm Chapter 31</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Composed by a destitute and oppressed David, running from Saul while placing his trust in God, this psalm instructs man to put his trust in God alone.</span><br><br>1. For the Conductor, a psalm by David. 2. In You I have taken shelter, O Lord, I shall never be shamed; rescue me in Your righteousness. 3. Turn Your ear to me, save me quickly; be to me a rock of refuge, a fortress to deliver me. 4. For You are my rock and my fortress; for the sake of Your Name, direct me and lead me. 5. Remove me from the net they planted for me, for You are my stronghold. 6. I entrust my spirit into Your hand; You will redeem me, Lord, God of truth. 7. I despise those who anticipate worthless vanities; but I trust in the Lord. 8. I will rejoice and delight in Your kindness, for You have seen my affliction; You know the troubles of my soul. 9. You have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet on spacious ground. 10. Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am in distress; my eye wastes away from vexation-my soul and my stomach. 11. For my life is spent in sorrow, my years in sighing; my strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones are wasted away. 12. Because of my adversaries I have become a disgrace-exceedingly to my neighbors, and a dread to my friends; those who see me outside flee from me. 13. Like a dead man, I was forgotten from the heart; I became like a lost vessel. 14. For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side, when they assembled together against me and plotted to take my life. 15. But I trusted in You, O Lord; I said, "You are my God.Â” 16. My times are in Your hand; save me from the hands of my enemies and pursuers. 17. Shine Your countenance upon Your servant; deliver me in Your kindness. 18. O Lord, let me not be ashamed, for I have called You; let the wicked be shamed, let them be silent to the grave. 19. Let the lips of falsehood-which speak insolently against the righteous, with arrogance and contempt-be struck dumb. 20. How abundant is Your good that You have hidden for those who fear You; in the presence of man, You have acted for those who take refuge in You. 21. Conceal them from the haughtiness of man, in the shelter of Your countenance; hide them in a shelter from the strife of tongues. 22. Blessed is the Lord, for He has been wondrous in His kindness to me in a besieged city. 23. I said in my panic, "I am cut off from before Your eyes!" But in truth, You heard the voice of my pleas when I cried to You. 24. Love the lord, all His pious ones! The Lord preserves the faithful, and repays with exactness those who act haughtily. 25. Be strong and fortify your hearts, all who put their hope in the Lord!<br><br></div>

By David, a maskil.1Fortunate is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 2. Fortunate is the man to whom the Lord does not reckon his sin, and in whose spirit there is no deceit. 3. When I was silent, my limbs wore away through my wailing all day long. 4. For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my marrow became [dry] as the droughts of summer, Selah. 5. My sin I made known to You, my iniquity I did not cover. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord," and You have forgiven the iniquity of my transgression forever. 6. For this let every pious man pray to You, at a time when You may be found; indeed, the flood of many waters will not reach him. 7. You are a refuge to me; protect me from distress; surround me with songs of deliverance forever. 8. I will enlighten you and educate you in the path you should go; I will advise you with what I have seen. 9. Be not like a horse, like a mule, senseless, that must be muzzled with bit and bridle when being adorned, so that it not come near you. 10.

The entire psalm can be interpreted as referring to the giving of the Torah and the ingathering of the exiles.</span><br><br>1. A psalm by David. Render to the Lord, children of the mighty, render to the Lord honor and strength. 2. Render to the Lord the honor due to His Name; bow down to the Lord in resplendent holiness. 3. The voice of the Lord is over the waters, the God of glory thunders; the Lord is over mighty waters. 4. The voice of the Lord resounds with might; the voice of the Lord resounds with majesty. 5. The voice of the Lord breaks cedars; the Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon. 6. He makes them leap like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox. 7. The voice of the Lord strikes flames of fire. 8. The voice of the Lord makes the desert tremble; the Lord causes the desert of Kadesh to tremble. 9. The voice of the Lord causes the does to calve, and strips the forests bare; and in His Sanctuary all proclaim His glory. 10.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>No Joke</strong><br><br>By Rabbi Label Lam<br>"And you should love HASHEM your G-d with all your heart and all your soul and all your might." (Devarim 6:5)<br><br>With all your heart: With both of your inclinations. (Rashi)<br><br>With all your soul: Even if one comes to take your life. (Rashi)<br><br>With all your might: With all your money! There is such a person that his money is more important than his body and therefore it is written and with all your might/ money. (Rashi- Brochos 61)<br><br>WhatÂ’s bothering Rashi? Why does he tell us about someone whose Â“money is more dear than his lifeÂ”? If we examine the order of the verse we can observe that at first there is an increasing expectation of love from Â“the whole mindÂ” to Â“life itselfÂ” and then the verse seems to retreat to Â“all of oneÂ’s moneyÂ”. ItÂ’s as if I say Â“I love you 300. I love you 400. I even love you 200.Â” How absurd! The number 200 is already included in 400. Therefore Rashi tells about a pathological personality type whereby money is more-dear than life itself.<br><br>One of the longest laughs in radio history occurred during the Jack Benny show. Mr. Benny who was notoriously cheap was -late in arriving at the studio. His sidekick- straight man asked him why he was so late. He told him that he was mugged on the way. The questioner continued to wonder how that accounted for such extreme lateness. Does it really take that long to be robbed? Jack Benny answered in his deliberate manner, Â“The robber threatened me with the ultimatum, Â“Your money or your life?! And, I was thinkingÂ…Â”<br><br>I donÂ’t remember why I got onto this subject but while teaching a group of Jewish prisoners I began to describe how monkeys are captured in South America. They listened in rapture as I described the brilliant methodology of the hunters. They take a coconut and hollow it out. They put inside the coconut rice. The coconut with the rice is placed in a clearing. The curious primate takes the risk to explore whatÂ’s inside the coconut. When he discovers the rice he places his hand in to remove it.<br><br>The hole on the top of the coconut is calibrated so that the monkey can just barely squeeze his hand to get his prize but once he makes a fist to grasp it, his hand is now too large to allow him to withdraw the rice. HeÂ’s stuck at this point trying to figure out how he can get his hand out with the rice in his fist. He is not clever enough to let go of the rice and pour it into his hand and he stubbornly refuses let go of the rice. While he ponders his quandary a net is dropped on his head and he is captured for the zoo or monkey soup or whatever fate that market-place demands.<br><br>At this point the audience of prisoners broke out into uproarious laughter as if I had said the funniest joke. I had no intention to make a joke. I didnÂ’t even know what was so funny. I asked one of the fellows, Â“Murray, whatÂ’s so funny?Â” He told me, Â“ThatÂ’s how we all got here!Â” There was a second wave of laughter. This time I got it.<br><br>It may not be such an uncommon phenomenon. There are times when a person will risk everything, just not to take their hand out of the coconut, and let go. That becomes the tragic flaw and at that point itÂ’s no joke.<br><br></div>

Not for our sake, Lord, not for our sake, but for the sake of Your Name bestow glory, because of Your kindness and Your truth. 2. Why should the nations say, "Where, now, is their God?Â” 3. Indeed, our God is in heaven; whatever He desires, He does. 4. Their idols are of silver and gold, the product of human hands. 5. They have a mouth, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see; 6. they have ears, but cannot hear; they have a nose, but cannot smell; 7. their hands cannot touch; their feet cannot walk; they can make no sound in their throat. 8. Those who make them will become like them-all who put their trust in them. 9. Israel, trust in the Lord; He is their help and their shield. 10. House of Aaron, trust in the Lord; He is their help and their shield. 11. You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord; He is their help and their shield. 12. The Lord who is ever mindful of us, may He bless: May He bless the House of Israel; may He bless the House of Aaron; 13. may He bless those who fear the Lord, the small with the great. 14. May the Lord increase [blessing] upon you, upon you and upon your children. 15. You are blessed by the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth. 16. The heavens are the Lord's heavens, but the earth He gave to the children of man. 17. The dead cannot praise the Lord, nor any who descend into the silence [of the grave]. 18.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>The Power of Love</strong><br>By Rabbi Shlomo Jarcaig<br><br>The Shabbos (Sabbath) between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur is called Shabbos Shuva (return). This Shabbos offers us a unique opportunity to focus on teshuva (repentance) in a way we cannot during the rest of the week. What are the mechanics of teshuva?<br><br>Our Sages teach us that when one does teshuva out of fear of G-d, then the sins he transgressed intentionally are viewed as if they were committed accidentally, but if one repents from a love of G-d, then his previous sins become transformed to merits for him. How does this work? One of the greatest manifestations of G-d's love for His children is His desire to accept our repentance and overlook our wrongdoing. But why does He view them in a positive light afterwards and why is this perspective unique to when the teshuva was done out of ahava (love)?<br><br>Michtav Me'Eliyahu (collected writings and discourses of Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler (1891-1954) of London and B'nai Brak, one of the outstanding personalities and thinkers of the Mussar movement) explains that one of the main components of teshuva is remorse. When a person genuinely regrets his past deeds and repents out of fear, he acquires a new perspective of life: he stops to think about the greatness and awesomeness of G-d and the impropriety of violating His will. As this perspective develops and his outlook changes, he will now view his past transgression as accidental. He simply did not grasp the ramifications of his actions; had he, he would have never done them.<br><br>But teshuva out of love is different. True love is about giving. By definition, we cannot give anything to G-d, but the closest thing we can do is appreciate and express our gratitude for all He does for us. When someone develops his appreciation for the vastness of the array of G-d's constant giving - from the dozen involuntary breaths he takes every minute of every hour of every day to the breathtaking sunrise he witnessed this morning - he fortifies his love relationship with his Creator. Thus, when he contemplates his past misdeeds and realizes that, despite them, G-d continues His abundant benevolence, his gratitude is multiplied. The repentance borne of this sentiment is much more profound and builds an even greater bond. The development of this greater love is a result of the misdeed, so his repentance actually turned those misdeeds into something positive in generating a closer relationship with G-d.<br><br>Shabbos is designed specifically to allow us time each week to appreciate G-d and what He does for us. There is a specific mitzvah (commandment) to eat tasty foods that we do not have throughout the rest of the week to allow us to focus on His magnificent benevolence. Capitalizing on these opportunities to develop our consciousness of G-d's love for us will facilitate our return to Him out of love. Thus, Shabbos Shuva offers a unique prospect for an elevated sense of gratitude to turn our misdeeds into merits.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a special Shabbat day... it is also the day of Yom Kippur...<br><br>The Most Holy Day<br><br>Yom Kippur, or The Day of Atonement has been known through the centuries as the holiest day on the Hebrew calendar. It is a day scripture tells us to have a complete day of rest and also a day to deny ourselves. What is the meaning of this special day?<br><br>In Leviticus, we read of a special sacrifice Aaron was to offer on this day. It was an offering of atonement for all of Israel, corporate and individual. As we understand from the book of Hebrews though, the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin. This offering above all other offerings was looking forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Yeshua, our Messiah. Today we look back to His redemptive work in our lives, but is this all we are to do on this day, look back and remember?<br><br>Yom Kippur is a day each of us should approach with great reverence. It is a day to not only consider and appreciate our redemption in Yeshua. It is a day to examine our lives and our relations with others.<br><br>First we are to examine our own lives. Have we allowed the unclean to slip back into our lives or our homes? Have we in the past year taken the word of HaShem seriously? Have we lived by conviction, or by convenience? Have we, by our disobedience, trampled the shed blood of Messiah under foot? On this day, we should ask HaShem to examine our lives, our attitudes toward Him and to reveal the sin which we have neglected or attempted to hide from view.<br><br>We then examine our relationships on this earth. Yeshua said if we have wronged our fellow man, we are to leave our gift at the altar and go make it right before continuing to present ourselves to Him. This tells us that HaShem is just as concerned about our horizontal relationships with others as He is about our vertical relationship with Him.<br><br>In churches and congregations today there are many people who may have things right with their God, but are walking in division, strife and hurt with their fellow man. There are marriages and relationships with parents, spouses, family and friends which need desperately to be healed. Yom Kippur should be a day of reaching out in repentance to each other as well as to our God.<br><br>It is taught that Yom Kippur is also a day which will have a final fulfillment just prior to the Millennial Kingdom. It is the day in which all people will stand before HaShem to give an account for their lives. In that day, there will be no excuses and nothing hidden from view. The light of His presence will reveal all.<br><br>Today, we have the option to accept His sacrifice for our lives, turn from our sin and receive forgiveness by the blood of The Lamb. We can be restored to our relationship with our Creator as well as seek restoration with those around us. We can also choose to reject Him, continue in our sin and stand on the final Yom Kippur with our sin in hand to be judged and rightfully sentenced to an eternity without Him. The choice is ours.<br><br>Let us approach this most holy day with reverence, if not with fear and trembling. It is a day to deny ourselves the pleasures of life and ask that our lives would be opened before Him for examination. It is a day to go through the closets of our lives, both spiritually and naturally, asking for a detailed cleaning to occur.<br><br>I challenge you today to take your scripture, a notepad and paper, and spend some time alone on Yom Kippur. Depending on your method of counting the days it will either be this Shabbat or it will be the first day of the week. Take these items, find a quiet place, tell your family you do not want to be disturbed for any reason and spend time with HaShem. Ask Him to reveal your life as He sees it. Write down what He reveals and then act on the revelation. We may find that in the midst of the time there will be phone calls to make or people to see as He works on not only our vertical relationship, but also on our horizontal relationships.<br><br>Remember, the Feast of Tabernacles is coming soon. The joy we experience during that Feast may directly tie to our reverence and seriousness on Yom Kippur.<br><br>Shabbat Shalom,<br>Mike<br></div>
