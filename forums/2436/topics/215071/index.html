            <div class='col-md body'>G-d created the world in the way that is best suited for mankind, and put us in a world with many creations made to serve us particularly. The sun and moon and stars were created (and set) in a way that is the most beneficial to provide light and heat for mankind and for all life. Together with the earth's atmosphere the amount of heat provided by the sun is monitored precisely in the best possible manner. Were the heat just a bit more it would be too much for any of habitation to endure. And if it was just a bit less all habitation would freeze. Even though this heat is a constant necessity (in the proper amount) for all life; if the light was also as abundant, it would be harmful with it's steady bombardment to all life. This was all forseen by the Creator who fashioned the earth and its atmosphere in a way that the light of he sun would be available in any given place on the earth half of the time, and yet the sun's heat would be retained in all places in the world always.<br><br>But even when the light is not dominant, a certain amount of it is still needed for habitation. This was also seen by the Creator who put the moon and stars in the sky to provide minimal light for the earth'sinhabitants when the sun's light is not dominant. In addition the luminaries provide us with a means to tell from one time to another.<br><br>An additional wonder that the Creator made was the proper mixture of the proper gases in the atmosphere for all life, both flora and fauna, so that besides providing a blanket of monitored heat, all of life has a steady supply of both carbon and oxygen to sustain them to function.<br><br>Furthermore, the Creator filled the earth with the one fluid that all life must constantly utilize in order for them to function. And He devised a special natural system which is constantly in use in order to distill and refresh this fluid and remove any impurities so that it can always be reused, and which will constantly distribute it over dry land where humanity and all plant and animal life need it the most.<br><br>CONTINUED...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And the Creator endowed the earth with an abundant supply of plants to nourish us, each one bearing its own separate quality and distinct taste, coming in various forms, sizes, and shapes, and carrying its own means of reproduction for further use. These different forms of nourishment are abundantly available all over the world with some of them varying widely from place to place. Virtually every place in the world has its own array of plant life which is best suited to adapt to it. (In addition, these various forms of sustenance can be mixed and blended to create new forms of taste.)<br><br>In addition these various forms of plant life can be converted into clothing, shelter, and fuel to serve the different needs of the nearby inhabitants. (Interestingly enough, the colder climates are more replete with forests which can provide firewood for their inhabitants, as well as ground which is productive largely for grains which can provide energy and body heat for humans and livestock, while the warmer climates [where there is less of a necessity for the people to be active internally] are replete with fruit trees which provide readily digestable nourishment, and less stored up energy.)<br><br>In addition to plant life there is all over the world a wide array of animal life of various sizes (and shapes). While these animals share in the bounty bestowed upon by the Creator, they are also a considerable asset to all of humanity in many ways. First of all, we can learn many lessons from them. We see how the Creator takes care of all their needs even though they do nothing to serve Him in return. (This should teach us to rely upon Him even if we feel ourselves unworthy of His kindness.) Animals take care of themselves naturally and do not overeat or act in ways which are dangerous to themselves (with a few rare exceptions). They adapt well to the natural environment and do not pollute it.<br><br>They also function in ways that collectively enhance the outside environment. Animals (and humans) breathe in oxygen released by the plants, and in turn breathe out carbon dioxide which is subsequently breathed in by the plants. Thus, a balance is maintained with the gases in the atmosphere. In return the plants provide us and the animals with carbon as food. Worms help till the soil, and insects and flies eat up harmful bacteria. Animals of prey will keep the population of insects and pests from getting out of hand. Bacteria themselves and fungi are useful to break apart refuse and garbage and convert them back into soil.<br><br>CONTINUED...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All of these creations that G-d made follow exactly what He designed them for. They posses no inclination to do anything more or less than that. Animals may have their own desires and instincts, but they have no sense of intuition to do good. Man alone has this intuition, and this was given to him from G-d when He breathed into his nostrils the "Nishmas Chayim" (breath of life). Only then did the universe have its essential meaning to it. We human beings are the purpose of the world that G-d created. All that was created was tailor-made to be benefitted by mankind in the best possible manner. And when abused it would become harmful to him.<br><br>It is man's duty to recognize and to appreciate all these things that G-d does for him. It is mankind alone who is entrusted with this sublime ability and who is capable of this. If we ourselves do not take the time and effort to affirm our appreciation, then who will? The trees and the plants? The mountains and the seas? The monkeys and the zebras?<br><br>This may seem like an easy task, but in fact it is not. Human nature is to appreciate initially, and then gradually to take for granted whatever one has. We are given precepts and obligations in order to constantly remember the One who gave us all of this.<br><br>G-d put man in control of the world and all that is therein. Man with his actions can bring the entire universe to its highest use in serving him to enable him to recognize his Creator, or he can degrade it to its lowest form by using it as a means to fill his lusts and base desires. It is all dependent on his free will which direction he chooses for himself. Should he wish to use the world to serve his Creator and show his appreciation for all He has done and come closer to Him, he will not only raise himself, but the entire universe which serves him will rise with him to its ultimate purpose. If, on the other hand; he uses G-d's creations only to satisfy his lusts and feed his animalistic desires, then he will not only bring destruction upon himself, but the entire universe will lose value as well. Of what purpose can it be now? Just so that its inhabitants destroy themselves through it?<br><br>"Kol echad v'echad chayav lomar bishvili nivra haolam" (San.37) Each and every individual must take to heart that the world was especially made just for him as he is. G-d created many different people and no two are exactly alike. Each and every human being is a world to himself/herself, and is a central part of the universe. A Jew who is commited to G-d and to his Torah is given the especial task of doing his part to bring society to a state of improvement in a today's world. The Torah has in it the means and indeed the only means of doing this (see OWT. footnote). By following the Torah we are actively bringing improvement to the world.<br><br>The Torah is meant not merely to be kept, but to be constantly worked on and improved. It is like a plant which when healthy will not fail to grow and produce more seeds on its own. If it does not grow or produce more, then this is a sure sign that the plant is sick. If even a small growth on the plant was healthy it would grow well on its own and eventually take over the plant itself. Similiarly, if the Torah does not cause improvement in its follower, this is an indication that he/she is either not yet observing it well enough, or is not yet taking enough interest in its essence. It is of crucial importance; therefore, that those who do appreciate the importance of the Torah do whatever they can to strengthen it in themselves and in others.<br><br></div>
