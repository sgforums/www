            <div class='col-md body'>Are you asking questions you already know the answer to bait responses?<br><br>Your question is so general, and I think it's unreasonable to ask one school of thought to speak for all others. But if it needs to be broken down, no, not all Christians believe in the Rapture anymore then all believe in the speaking of tounges, and no the Rapture is not explictly stated in the bible but is a teaching that is inferred by those schools who believe in it from certain verses.<br><br>And more importantly, the Rapture is treated probably more as an interesting fact or speculation then a key tenet of end-times thought, not any more remarkable then in which order things are going to take place and the like. Believing in the Rapture or not does not qualify or disqualify you from being a Christian in most schools of thought, and level-headed Christians are supposed to do what they are supposed to do instead of becoming hermits and waiting for the end-times.<br><br>That's all I'm gonna say, I am certainly not going to be involved in a potential discussion or argument that has been repeated <span style="font-style: italic;">ad nauseum</span> since the whole idea started, for more information on the views regarding to rapture, please visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture</a>, but I think you have already known about all this and it is my opinion are just trying to find people ignorant enough to bait into and take apart in an argument.<br></div>

At the end of the day, when Christians attempt to offer their opinions, you'd just challenge it by saying that what you know is the TRUTH, so no way can there be any lively discussion.... just go ask anyone coming here...

There are many of us out there who have gone down the whole Christian route, found out that some biblical truths are lacking, distorted or misunderstood by the church and have progressed further.<br><br>We should use this forum to share a different opinion from mainstream Christianity which I believe to a great extent has strayed from the Truth and the Word. Let's edify one another and not tear each other down. Whoever wants to know about mainstream Christianity is able to do so easily, but the converse is not so.<br><br>In order for lively discussions to be held, everyone has to post respectfully and in the right spirit.<br><br>There are people who are seeking more from our Father and really want to hear this point of view, so please let us not put them off by contributing to the "climate" of discussion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
