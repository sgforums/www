            <div class='col-md body'>What is your view on the claim that the idea that the mother of Jesus was a virgin was due to a mistranslation of the Hewbrew text?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Old Testament talks about almah 'young woman,' not bethulah 'virgin.' However, the scholars in the 3rd century BC translated the Hebrew almah as parthenos in Greek. Thus the 'young woman' in Hebrew metamorphosed into a 'virgin' in GreekÂ—and she has remained a virgin ever since in translations across the world. The notion of 'virgin birth' was born, thanks to a mistranslation.</span><br><br><a href="http://accurapid.com/journal/18review.htm" rel="nofollow">http://accurapid.com/journal/18review.htm</a><br><br>I found a counter view here:<br><br><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071212233718AAYRLSB" rel="nofollow">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071212233718AAYRLSB</a><br><br>However, I don't really agree with that view. The New Testament was written in Greek and I think there were changes and additions done by New Testament writers and editors to make it look like Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecy. So th virgin birth entered the canon because New Testament writers thought that was what was supposed to happen due to the mistranslation.<br><br>But of course, as the writer points out, this can be a matter of endless debate.<br><br>I mean, if we can still argue that there's a genuine controversy over whether evolution occured, how much more so can we argue over what happened over 2000 years ago?</div>

Don't use the septuagint as the excuse!<br><br>Interestingly, Christians used to have the upper hand 'cos the oldest extant copy of the OT used to be the Septuagint, the Hebrew Masoretic dates from around the 10th century Aleppo Codex.<br><br>Heng ah, those folks discovered the Dead Sea Scrolls, containing the complete scroll of Isaiah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Furthermore, an analysis of the context of Isaiah does not strongly suggest the young woman is a virgin or that the young woman refers to Mary hundred of years later.</div>
