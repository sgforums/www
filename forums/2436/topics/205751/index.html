            <div class='col-md body'>Something intersting that my friend sent to me...<br><br>Sad but true<br><br>Today we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend, Common Sense, who<br>has been with us for many years.<br><br>No one knows for sure how old he was, as his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape.<br><br>He will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as knowing when to come in out of the rain, why the early bird gets the worm, life isn't always fair, and maybe it was my fault.<br><br>Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spend more than you earn) and reliable parenting strategies (adults, not children, are in charge).<br><br>His health began to deteriorate rapidly when well intentioned but overbearing<br>regulations were set in place.<br><br>Reports of a six-year-old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teens suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition.<br><br>Common Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the job they failed to do in disciplining their unruly children.<br><br>It declined even further when schools were required to get parental consent to administer Aspirin, sun lotion or a sticky plaster to a student but could not inform the parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an<br>abortion.<br><br>Common Sense lost the will to live as the Ten Commandments became contraband; churches became businesses; and criminals received better treatment than their victims.<br><br>Common Sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourself from a burglar in your own home and the burglar can sue you for assault.<br><br>Common Sense finally gave up the will to live, after a woman failed to realise that a   steaming cup of coffee was hot. She spilled a little in her lap, and was promptly awarded a huge settlement.<br><br>Common Sense was preceded in death by his parents, Truth and Trust, his wife, Discretion, his daughter, Responsibility; and his son, Reason.<br><br>He is survived by three stepbrothers; I Know My Rights, Someone Else<br>Is To Blame and I'm a Victim.<br><br>Not many attended his funeral because so few realised he was gone. If you still remember him, pass this on.<br></div>
