            <div class='col-md body'><br>Â“I felt him release himself from my grip and he began to run like the wind, I began to shout with a loud voice, Y. was already with half of his body over the railing, he was going to jump from the top floor of this small Israeli mall and smash himself on the hard concrete several meters below. As I shouted, he seemed to hesitate a moment. That was enough for my husband to forcefully hold him, restrain him and aggressively with determination rescue the life of my 19 year old son, a soldier in the Israeli Army from ending his young lifeÂ…I was shaking like a leaf as we brought him to the psychiatric ward of the hospital. I still kept on shaking for nearly three days. Had it not been for my shouts and the quick reactions of my husband, we would have attended a funeral that day. This was the second time that our young son had try to seriously kill himself in less than a month.Â” (A true story as told by the mother).<br><br>Deliver those who are drawn toward death, And hold back those stumbling to the slaughter. If you say, Â“Surely we did not know this,Â” Does not He who weighs the hearts consider it? He who keeps your soul, does He not know it? And will He not render to each man according to his deeds? Proverbs 24:11,12<br><br>What would you do if someone tried to commit suicide right in front of you? and if that someone were to be your relative, your very close relative? your son maybe? What would you do? Would you let him do it because it is his Â“freedom of choiceÂ” or would you do everything in your power to stop such devastating act and actually infringe in his Â“freedom of choiceÂ”?<br><br>Would you force that person to stay alive or would you just allow him to go ahead and kill himself?<br><br>I believe that for most of us it is a redundant question. If someone were to try to kill themselves in front of us, we would do anything to stop them, let alone if the person is our own relative! So what is the matter with all the nations that are seeing the tiny nation of Israel committing national suicide for years and yet they not only do nothing to stop her but rather encourage her and even pressure her to kill herself!? More important is: What is happening to all those who profess to believe in a Jewish Messiah born in Israel; Where are all the millions of Christians that are watching on live TV the story of a National Suicide and still try to be Â“politically correctÂ”???<br>I love those very Â“spiritualÂ” brethren that say Â“donÂ’t worry about Israel, God will deal with them on his own, let us keep on doing our own ministry agendaÂ”. I wonder how they would feel if their own son or close relative would try to jump down an eight story building in front of them. Would they also be so lethargic, insensitive and passive? Would they also say Â“donÂ’t worry about my son, God will catch himÂ” and would watch him passively as he jumped? Or would they do everything in their power to stop him?  that would include prayer, shouts for help and some physical restraining! Passivity is a killer, but it is deathly when dealing with suicidal people, how about a Â“suicidal nationÂ”? Israel has been suicidal for years and only a few are shouting, praying and restraining.<br><br>For the most part the people of Israel have lost the purpose by which God returned us to His Covenant Land after 2000 years of exile; and the majority has been steering the nation into Â“national suicideÂ” in the name of PEACE.<br><br>Let me illustrate the point through the story of two Israeli sons. One of them I will call S. and the other one I will Y. This is a true story. We already met Y. at the beginning of this letter when he was trying to jump and kill himself, but let me tell you a little bit about his background:<br><br>Y. was born in Israel, a native Israeli is called a Sabra. His grandfather used to be a Zionist leader that made Alyah (going up to Zion-immigration) together with his young family. He believed in the importance of the State of Israel and paid a price to be here. His son, the father of Y. was a brilliant intellectual, a secular humanist that cared for his country but cared a lot more for his own life. He had fought in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, lost his best friend to it and he himself suffered from Â“battle shockÂ”. The father of Y. was a liberal leftist and believed in relinquishing all the territories of Judea and Samaria that were added to us since the 1967 Six Day War. He was a PACIFIST and he did not believe in God at all. Many people tried to introduce him to the Messiah and to his saving power. His last words were: Â“I will never repentÂ”. A few days later he committed suicide, he was found shot in a small forest near the house where he and his parents raised his children. After the war he had suffered from reoccurring episodes of manic depression that destroyed his marriage brought about a divorce and finally in order to escape the pain of it all he took his life. He left two orphans, Y. being the youngest.<br><br>Continued...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Part2<br><br>Y. in turn, being raised a secular humanist developed the same views as his father. Because of his very high IQ and his brilliant mind, upon being drafted to the compulsory army service in the IDF, he was selected to work as a highly classified clerk in the central office of the entire IDF. That is the place where the Â“big menÂ” call all the shots. Y. excelled in his work but had trouble with the pressure. Being the CNS of army operations, it is the highest pressured office in the entire IDF. Y. began to experience breathing problems due to stress, fell into a deep depression that led him down the path of suicide, just like his father before him- in order to escape the pain. Y. also was a pacifist, a secular humanist and had no faith in God. His solution for the pain and the pressure was the one he was shown by his own dad- SUICIDE. Had it not been for the intervention of YAH (God) and for his believing, praying mother and his believing step father Y. would have been twice dead in less than a month! Now he is undergoing treatment with drugs and therapy but he must find God in order to change his thinking altogether from secular humanist and pacifist to a Man of the Covenant. With the help of YÂ’shua, medical treatment and the love of his believing mother and step father, he will make it but not without a great struggle!<br><br>Unfortunately Y. represents at least 70% of the people in Israel. They have left the Zionistic ideals behind in order to be like any other nation, the slogan has been- SHALOM ACHSHAV or PEACE NOW an at ALL COSTS.  Most of Israel has no idea that God is absolutely adamant to implement His Covenant of restoration. He said in Ezekiel 36 that He will do it and He will do it for the sake of His Holy Name. YahvehÂ’s plan is for Israel to rule from the River Nile in Egypt to the River Euphrates in Iraq. This is His Covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and it is for 1000 generations!<br><br>He is Yahveh our God; His judgments are in all the earth.  He remembers His covenant forever, The word which He commanded, for a thousand generations, The covenant which He made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac, And confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel as an everlasting covenant, Saying, Â“To you I will give the land of Canaan As the allotment of your inheritance, Â”Psalms 105:7-11<br><br>A generation of secular humanistic Israelis that does not know YAH, or His Word and Covenant cannot withstand the pain and the pressure that it takes to be a Jew, let alone an Israeli. The entire redemption of the world depends on Israel, the Messiah Himself will rule and reign from Jerusalem, this is no small matter! The nations have been pushing Y. and his generation of pacifists into a path of retreat, relinquishing of Covenant Land and self destruction. The Oslo Accords and the infamous Road MAP is nothing but a poisonous drug administered by the nations inducing a very weary and pained Israel, to Â“kill herselfÂ”. And this generation of Â“pacifistsÂ” has been swallowing the poisonous lies as if it was a delicious dessert putting their hope in a fantasy- PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AT ALL COSTS!<br><br>When Y. tried to jump, he thought that death would bring him the peace that he wanted, the cessation of pain. He did not believe that his immortal soul would suffer forever without God! Israel believes that accommodating a Palestinian Terror State will bring a cessation of battle. Israel is on a path of national suicide and we, the People of the Covenant must stop her! When Y.Â’s step father so courageously rescued him, he used aggressive force, the picture was not nice, he did not caress him, he forcefully put him down from the place where he wasÂ…Force many times is needed in order to stop a person from killing himself; shouts, prayer and force.<br><br>Statistics say that when a person commits suicide, he/she affects and harms at least six more people (his immediate family and/or circle of close friends). It also says that if a parent kills himself, his children are most likely to do the same! If Israel is self destroyed by trying to achieve peace at all costs it will actually harm all the nations! Terror will run rampart in every nation of the earth and it already is. If the nations keep on pushing Israel over the edge, they will die alsoÂ…Yet Israel will live because of the Covenant! PM Olmert is willing to implement unilateral withdrawal from Judea and Samaria, he is leading Israel to a path of national destruction even though it does not even have a partner for peace. He is willing to Â“jumpÂ” in order to escape the pain and the pressure and have Â“peaceÂ”!<br><br>continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part3<br><br>For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people slightly, Saying, Â‘Peace, peace!Â’  When there is no peace.  Jeremiah 8:11<br><br>Now let me tell you about the other son S. who is also a soldier in the IDF, actually a field commander in a fighting unit that goes before the troops. S. is the son of very strong believers. His Jewish father is an ardent Zionist and a minister of the Word, his mother is a marvelous intercessor, their marriage is stable and rooted in the Covenant. S. has been fighting in the front lines of the war with Lebanon. He has experienced much blood and death around him. He said that the stench of the dead bodies does not leave his nostrils for days after! And yet, he is stable and faithful to carry his task of delivering Israel from its formidable enemy. He is a strong believer and the God of the Covenant keeps Him stable throughout this terrible ordeal in spite of the terrible, constant pressure, the horror sites and the physical exertion!<br><br>Y. and S. are almost the same age, both of them are handsome and intelligent sabras, both of them are soldiers in the IDF and have tried to do the best for their country.  However  S. has the advantage of being rooted in the Covenant and in the God of the Covenant!  S.Â’s example for life is his believing father a man of God that loves God, His Word and his country. Y.Â’s example is a pacifist, secular humanist father that was traumatized during the war, could not hold under the pressure of life and killed himself.<br><br>S. is the hope of Y. He is the future of Israel who is full of Â“Y.sÂ” and Â“WhysÂ”??? Israel is full of question marks; Â“where was God during the HolocaustÂ”, Â“why are we in constant warÂ”, Â“when is peace going to comeÂ”, Â“If God exists why does he allow us to suffer so much?Â” and on, and on.<br><br>The mother of S. has had many sleepless nights watching and praying for her battling soldier in Lebanon. The mother of Y. has had much anguish, many hours of praying, believing and battling for her troubled soldier. None of the mothers will give up on their sons and they will win this battle against the enemy of Israel that is seeking to destroy their sons through active war (physical destruction) and false peace treaties that lead to National Suicide (mental destruction due to deception!).<br><br>Y. is Yuval my own son<br><br>and S. is Stefan; David and Josie SilverÂ’s son.<br><br>The step father that rescued Y. from killing himself for the second time in the last month is Rabbi Baruch, my husband.<br><br>continued...</div>

Do not let Israel be killed in war or commit national suicide through false peace treaties.
