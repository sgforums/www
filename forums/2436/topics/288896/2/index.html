The contradictions come as a result of flawed understanding on the part of man who employ a roman/greek hellenistic understanding of the Tanakh and not a Hebraic one. If one employs a Hebraic understanding the whole of the Brit Chadashah will be seen in a different light</strong>.</blockquote>Even with 'Hebraic' understanding, there are factual discrepancies. Let us examine these verses:<br><br>"And I heard the number of those who were sealed, 144 000 sealed from every tribes of Isreal;<br><br>From the tribe of Judah, 12 000 were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12 000, from the tribe of Gad 12 000,<br><br>from the tribe of Asher 12 000, from the tribe of Naphtali 12 000, from the tribe of Manasseh 12 000,<br><br>from the tribe of Simeon 12 000, from the tribe of Levi 12 000, from the  tribe of Issachar 12 000,<br><br>from the tribe of Zebulun 12 000, from the tribe of Joseph 12 000, from the tribe of Benjamin, 12 000 were sealed." Revelation 7:4-8 NASB<br><br>1. Are the above all the tribes of Isreal? What happen to tribe of Dan?<br><br>2. Do you have problem with verse 8. Is there a tribe call "Joseph". Consider these scriptures:<br><br>"Now your two sons, who are born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, shall be mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine no less than Reuben and Simeon. But the progeny born to you after them shall be yours; they shall be recorded instead (under the names) of their brothers in their inheritance." Genesis 48:5-6 Tanakh (JPS)<br><br></div>

However I beg to differ.<br><br>Let us look at these verses:<br><br>"But now, if you will, forgive their sin - and if not, please blot me out from your book which you have written!" The LORD said to Moses "Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book" Exodus 32:32-33 (NASB)<br><br>"But as for you, go your way to the end; then you will enter into rest and rise again for allotted portion at the end of the age" Daniel 12:13 (NASB)<br><br>It is without a shadow of doubt that Hashem alone will decide who will be included in His book of Life at the end of the age.<br><br>Shalom</div></blockquote>Of course it will be Yahweh who will decide who is included in the book of life at the end of this age.<br><br>Yeshua taught no different. He came so that we may be righteous before Yahweh because He is our atoning sacrifice once and for all. He came so that we may have the grace to repent. Yeshua is the one that points us to the way of life, making it possible for us to be part of Israel. He is the one that tears down the wall of division ending the enimity between Jew and Goyim so that one new man is made out of the two.<br><br>Salvation is the free gift of Yahweh to man, apart from works and the Torah. Salvation is by grace through faith in Yeshua, producing works acceptable to Yahweh. One may not earn, merit, or keep this eternal salvation by his own efforts. However, please remember, faith without works is dead.<br><br></div>

And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face. They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened. In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners. For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me. Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned. Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and <strong>THEY DO NOT RETURN TO THE LORD THEIR GOD</strong>, nor seek him for all this. Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. <strong>WOE UNTO THEM! FOR THEY HAVE FLED FROM ME: DESTRUCTION UNTO THEM!</strong> because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me. And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me. Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me. They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt."<br><br>Hosea 5:9<br>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke;<br>Among the tribes of Israel I make known what is sure.<br><br>Hosea 5:11<br>Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment,<br>Because he willingly walked by human precept.<br><br></div>

Sadly, or fortunately (depending on whose perspective .. lol), the educated Jews during that time did not fall for the trick.<br><br>The modus operandi of the early Christians is clear - when they cannot explain something, they sweep it under the carpet.
