Not the true believers, but rather sun god worshipping pagans, masquarading as believers in the true faith.<br><br>Constantine convened the ecumenical council of Nicea in 325 to resolve the doctrinal differences between various Christian divisions. Before this, Constantine had already decreed that the day of the sun would be kept throughout the empire. This Â“day of the sunÂ” was pivotal in unifying pagan sun-worshipers with nominal Â“Christians.Â”<br><br>These Â“ChristiansÂ” had already accepted Sunday and had never observed GodÂ’s seventh-day Sabbath to begin withÂ—except for apostates who had joined them. This was a marriage of convenience between Constantine and the church at Rome. The council of Nicea condemned the practice of true Christianity. All of the precepts of the emerging church at Rome were now decreed as part of the new state religion. As its protector, Constantine forced everyone, pagan or Christian, into either conformity or exile.<br><br>The pertinent verses that I speak of in Romans 11 are verses 25-27 and this is a direct quotation of Yeshayahu 59:20-21 and also from Yeshayahu chapter 27. This is directly out of the Tanakh. I think rabbinic jews will have not problems with this. Even when Shaul was preacing, he advocated for the people being taught to search the scriptures, which other scriptures would have existed then but the Tanakh? The Brit Chadashahwould not exist till 369AD as you point out...<br><br>Since you direct me to Yechezk'el, you already know that the temple will be in Yisrael.<br><br>In regards to the Cohen of Zadok, it is not for me to say, Yahweh Himeself will appoint the Cohanim who will serve Him in His sanctuary, yet do you not believe that in the remanant of Yisrael that there will be descendants of the lineage of Zadok? Even now, the Jews keep all the mitzvot of Yahweh that can be kept. They are more in tune with the true faith than the modern day christian church ever was.<br><br></div>
