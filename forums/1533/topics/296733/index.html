It's funny because she's almost going to be the outcast in the family because she's blonde and blue-eyed."<br><br>Jolie also admitted she would have been happy not to have a biological child.<br><br>But she changed her mind after seeing Brad with Zahara and Maddox after bringing her to the U.S. from Ethiopia.<br><br>She said: "I saw Brad with her and Maddox, and I realised how much he loved them - and how a biological child would not in any way be a threat."<br><br>The actress said she felt a deep connection to her adopted children because of the pain they had endured in their young lives.<br><br>She added: "I felt so much more for Madd, Zahara and Pax because they were survivors.<br><br>"Shiloh seemed so privileged from the moment she was born.<br><br>"But I'm conscious that I have to make sure I don't ignore her needs, just because I think the others are more vulnerable."<br><br>But when asked if she was glad she'd had Shiloh, Angelina said she avoids singling out her biological child at the expense of her adopted children.<br><br>She said: "It was so lovely. But at the same time, the first time we saw a picture of Zahara before we met her we were both very emotional.<br><br>"It was different journeys but very similar feelings."<br><br><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=501284&amp;in_page_id=1773" rel="nofollow">source</a><br></div>
