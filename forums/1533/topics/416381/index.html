              <p><span class="fontGray"><span id="photoForm:imageDescpText" class="fontGray">Kay Tse was badly affected by rumours that she and good friend Eason Chen were photographed in bed together. A photograph alleging the pair were caught in bed was circulating the Internet (Photos: Internet)</span></span></p>
              <p><span class="fontGray"><span class="fontGray">For six months, popular Hong Kong singer  Kay Tse could not eat nor sleep. She would also find herself crying uncontrollably and ocassionally throw up as well. But what scared her the most, was when she heard the voices of 20 to 30 people telling her to die.</span></span></p>
              <p><span class="fontGray"><span class="fontGray">She had been suffering from depression.<br><br>Kay, whose musical styles range from pop, folk, to jazz and rock, told Lianhe Wanbao in an interview in Hong Kong that the most horrific period when she was suffering from depression was hearing voices speaking loudly next to her.<br><br>"I could hear voices at night, at least 20 to 30 of them were speaking, telling me to go and die," Kay recounted.<br><br>She had to put on her earphones and turn up the music in order to sleep, albeit fitfully. But when morning came, her troubles would not be over as she experienced physical discomfort.<br><br>Kay, who was recently embroiled in a scandal where Hong Kong paparazzi alleged that she was photographed being intimate in bed with good friend and singer, Eason Chan, had to deal with her condition as well as the rumours.<br><br>She revealed that she sought medical treatment early for her condition, and even though she had to endure the rumours at the same time, she never gave up on herself.<br><br>Now, the singer has brushed off the rumours and was even willing to discuss it with the media.<br><br>"I've let it go, and there is nothing to mind now. I was affected by (the rumours) initially, but since I have done nothing wrong, I don't have to run away from this issue," she told Lianhe Wanbao.<br><br>She also brought up the topic of her friend, Eason, and praised him for putting in all his effort during his recent concert performance despite having to endure the rumours.<br><br>But, she reveals that she is careful not to appear too close to her friend in the public eye now, and when they have work commitments together, she is wary also not to be too affectionate around him.</span></span></p>
