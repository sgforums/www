              <div id="post_message_961271">Saw this in Straits Times.. feel damn sad for her...<br> <br> DJ Vernetta Lopez opens up about heartbreak and how her marriage fell apart in Memoirs Of A DJ.<br> <br> <img id="vBCodeIMG" class="vbimgcodelimit" title="Resized image - click to view original size" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BZl5Ffe2WW4/Tr5DPp7m3LI/AAAAAAAAD7Y/ZI2rYBsG0JA/s1600/vernmark.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="514"><br> <br> As her first marriage fell apart, radio deejay and actress Vernetta 
              Lopez maintained a stoic public facade while crying secretly in her 
              dressing room and stalking her then-husband to confirm that he was 
              cheating on her.<br> <br> The Class 95FM deejay, best known for playing teenager Denise in the 
              television comedy Under One Roof, is finally talking about her divorce 
              from Mark Richmond in an autobiography out tomorrow.<br> <br> They separated in 2001 after four years of marriage, and the divorce was finalised two years later.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>She declined to comment throughout the breakdown of the relationship, in part due to employer pressure, according to the book. </strong>Both were DJs with radio station Class 95FM at the time.[/B]</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Lopez reveals that Richmond had wanted to call the 
              wedding off days before the ceremony, and she had refused, fearing 
              public embarrassment.</strong></span><br> <br> <img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://www.asiaone.com/A1MEDIA/justwomen/02Feb08/20080223.084516_v_lopez.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> According to her, she could not see or did not want to admit that there 
              was no connection with Richmond, that they were two kids who were merely
               playing masak masak.<br> <br> Their relationship dissolved not long after the honeymoon and the book 
              described how she became suspicious of his relationship with another 
              woman, identified only as B in the book, and found an illicit love note 
              in his car when Richmond was away filming. <br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>The note was filled with sweet nothings that only an 
              intimate partner would say, she recalled in the book, including the 
              words “...I can still smell you on my pillow...”</strong></span><br> <br> When she asked Richmond about the note, she said “the blood literally drained from his lips” but he denied the relationship. <br> <br> Then came what she described as the “even more incredible part of this saga”. <br> <br> B met her to explain that she had written the letter to make Richmond 
              feel better. The letter was a snippet copied from a romance novel, it 
              was not real and she never intended to cause any harm.<br> <br> Although Lopez says that she accepted the explanations, she later 
              followed Richmond secretly and saw him on a date with the other woman. <br> <br> Even then, she could not make herself ask for a clean break. Instead, 
              she cried in solitude or in front of her make-up assistants.<br> <br> “It’s definitely not revenge. It’s just what happened. If I’m going to do my memoirs, it would be silly not to mention it.” <br> <br> Richmond told SundayLife! he found out about the book only five days ago, but had not read it.<br> <br> In a measured tone over the phone, he said he had no comments to make 
              except to wish his ex-wife well. “I have to respect the privacy of my 
              family, my wife and my five-year-old son,” he said.<br> <br> “But I don’t want to hurt people’s feelings. I’m not about to take a 
              dagger and stab it in someone’s back and destroy a family. All I’m 
              saying is, this is what I went through.<br> <br> “At the end of the day, I’m very happy for him, he has a wife and a kid and his career’s doing okay.”<br> <br> Richmond, a programme director with MediaCorp and DJ with Gold90.5FM is married to theatre director Beatrice Chia-Richmond, 38. <br> <br> <img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://newslink.asiaone.com/tn_photo/NP/2010/08/13784610.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>This is the face our national broadcaster sees fit to put in front of TV audience.
