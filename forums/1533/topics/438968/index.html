              <p>Minister of State, Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of 
              National Development Lee Yi Shyan has commented that Channel 8 drama 
              series are 'too shallow' after watching an episode of 'Love Thy 
              Neighbour', a series that has drawn criticism for its negative portrayal
               of Singaporeans.<br><br>Mr Lee asked why the characters in Channel 8 
              dramas shout and fight so much. He also felt there is not enough 
              communication between the characters and they fail to express themselves
               sufficiently.<br><br>In his post, he also said he felt the actors seem 
              to express their feelings through crying and shouting rather than 
              through their lines, which lack depth.<br><br>Mr Lee also said drama serials in countries like China have well-written lines which convey feelings and can touch audiences.<br><br>Only
               people who are unable to express themselves properly will resort to 
              anger, he said. Well-written lines on television will provide children 
              with good examples to follow and help them learn to communicate better, 
              he added.<br><br>However, Xiang Yun said in an interview that many 
              recent drama serials focus on the issues faced by common folk in 
              Singapore, so they tend to have simpler lines. Perhaps that was why the 
              minister felt that local drama serials lack depth.<br><br>A local 
              playwright Hong Rong Di gave his take on the issue:: "If everyone speaks
               in learned tones, the drama will seem unrealistic." He also explained 
              that Singapore's Chinese standards are not as high as that of China's, 
              so simpler words are used in the script.<br><br>Previously, netizens had
               more things to say about the content of 'Love Thy Neighbour'. Those who
               had called for a ban said it was "teaching bad things to their kids", 
              and portrays a negative image of Singaporeans.<br><br>The drama serial's
               debut episode apparently depicted a Singaporean household attempting to
               cheat their neighbours, a Malaysian couple living in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Minister of State, Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry
              of National Development Lee Yi Shyan has commented that Channel 8
              drama series are 'too shallow' after watching an episode of 'Love
              Thy Neighbour', a series that has drawn criticism for its negative
              portrayal of Singaporeans.<br> <br> Mr Lee asked why the characters in Channel 8 dramas shout and fight
              so much. He also felt there is not enough communication between the
              characters and they fail to express themselves sufficiently.<br> <br> In his post, he also said he felt the actors seem to express their
              feelings through crying and shouting rather than through their
              lines, which lack depth.<br> <br> Mr Lee also said drama serials in countries like China have
              well-written lines which convey feelings and can touch
              audiences.<br> <br> Only people who are unable to express themselves properly will
              resort to anger, he said. Well-written lines on television will
              provide children with good examples to follow and help them learn
              to communicate better, he added.<br> <br> However, Xiang Yun said in an interview that many recent drama
              serials focus on the issues faced by common folk in Singapore, so
              they tend to have simpler lines. Perhaps that was why the minister
              felt that local drama serials lack depth.<br> <br> A local playwright Hong Rong Di gave his take on the issue:: "If
              everyone speaks in learned tones, the drama will seem unrealistic."
              He also explained that Singapore's Chinese standards are not as
              high as that of China's, so simpler words are used in the
              script.<br> <br> Previously, netizens had more things to say about the content of
              'Love Thy Neighbour'. Those who had called for a ban said it was
              "teaching bad things to their kids", and portrays a negative image
              of Singaporeans.<br> <br> The drama serial's debut episode apparently depicted a Singaporean
              household attempting to cheat their neighbours, a Malaysian couple
              living in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Clap clap to Lee Yi Shyan for not being blind to spot the low grade local drama production from mediaocprse.     Seems this is first time he watched local drama to notice the shouting and fighting, these are around for donkey years.      One day I realised why the actors and actresses shout and shout in dramas when I saw the hopeless Lin ming zhe the director giving them instructions to shout and shout when they were filiming in one of the heartlands.    that is one of the reasons why I give up on mediacorpse dramas.    Think they should sack this director, hopeless!   Get in directors from Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Glad Mr Lee can see through the flaws.   hur hur hur!   </p>

              <p>This is hypocrisy, channel 8 dramas are propaganda shows designed to push the PAP political line and brainwash Singaporeans. Don't try to evade responsibility.</p>
              <p>Channel 8 drama writers should be ashamed of themselves for following the PAP propaganda line like dogs.</p>

              <p>I don't blame them completely.  They knows the ins and outs of Singaporeans.   They know whatever they do to bring singaporeans down, majority of them will continue to give them the mandate every election.</p>
              <p>PAP is overboard to bash Singaporeans.   But the 60% of their supporters deserve this from them.      Takes two hands to clap!   </p>
