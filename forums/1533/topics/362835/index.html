              <p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- American actor David Carradine has been found dead,
              hanging by a nylon rope in a hotel room closet in Bangkok, Thailand,

              <p>Carradine, who became famous in the 1970s when he starred as traveling
              Shaolin monk Kwai Chang Caine in the television series "Kung Fu," was
              72.</p>
              <p>The rope was believed to be from the hotel room curtains, Bangkok Police Lt. Col. Pirom Chanpirom said Thursday.</p>
              <p>He said investigators found no sign of forced entry into Carradine's room.</p>
              <p>An autopsy was being conducted at a Bangkok hospital, but no results will be available for another day, he said.</p>
              <p>A Carradine family spokeswoman issued a short statement saying the family "is devastated by the news of David's passing."</p>
              <p>"Circumstances surrounding his death are still unknown, and there will
              be no further comment until more information can be confirmed," the
              statement said.</p>
              <p>"The family appreciates the many expressions of condolence, and asks for privacy at this time."</p>

              <p>Police provided Carradine's family with information about their
              investigation, said Tiffany Smith, Carradine's personal co-manager.</p>
              <p>Smith said she was "in complete shock" and that suggestions that Carradine took his own life are unbelievable.</p>
              <p>"Knowing David, he would never commit suicide," and his death comes at a time when his "career is on a roll," she said.</p>
              <p>Carradine was in <a class="cnnInlineTopic" href="http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/bangkok">Bangkok</a> for filming of the movie "Stretch," being produced by a United
              Kingdom-based company, she said. He was the only American cast member.</p>

              <p>Modern audiences may best know Carradine as "Bill" in Quentin
              Tarantino's "Kill Bill" films. He earned a 2005 Golden Globe nomination
              for his role in the second movie in the two-part saga.</p>
              <p>His
              career included more than 100 feature films, two dozen television
              movies and theater work, according to the Internet Movie Database. <span class="cnnEmbeddedMosLnk"><img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/mosaic/tabs/photos.gif" border="0" alt="Photo" width="16" height="14"> <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/06/04/obit.david.carradine/index.html#cnnSTCPhoto">See photos of some of his notable roles »</a></span></p>
              <p>"He was clearly an actor who followed his own path," said Leah Rozen, the movie critic for People magazine.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>"He was never a guy who talked a whole lot. You knew him as an actor,
              the characters he played, you knew they had a past, you knew there was
              probably some unhappiness there, but he wasn't going to talk about it."</p>
              <p>Carradine made appearances in television series including "Gunsmoke"
              and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents." His first starring role in a series
              was as the title character in "Shane" in 1966.</p>
              <p>He worked with
              such directors as Martin Scorsese in "Box Car Bertha" in 1972 and
              Robert Altman in "The Long Goodbye" in 1973. <a href="http://www.ireport.com/ir-topic-stories.jspa?topicId=266821">iReport: Share memories of David Carradine</a></p>
              <p>Carradine was nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as folk music
              legend Woody Guthrie in the 1976 movie "Bound For Glory," according to
              a biography on his official Web site.</p>
              <p>His theater career began while he studied drama at San Francisco State College in California.</p>
              <p>He later landed roles on Broadway in "The Deputy" and "The Royal Hunt of the Sun."</p>
              <p>Carradine's legacy will probably be the "Kill Bill" movies and the "Kung Fu" series, Rozen said.</p>
              <p>The "Kill Bill" casting was particularly smart, she added.</p>
              <p>"<a class="cnnInlineTopic" href="http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/quentin_tarantino">Tarantino</a> was tapping into his just natural coolness, but more to the point,
              Tarantino was playing off that he still had this whole following from
              the 'Kung Fu' TV series," Rozen said. <span class="cnnEmbeddedMosLnk"><img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/mosaic/tabs/video.gif" border="0" alt="Video" width="16" height="14"> <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/06/04/obit.david.carradine/index.html#cnnSTCVideo">Watch Carradine talk about his 'Kung Fu' role »</a></span></p>
              <p>Carradine, who was married five times and divorced four, is survived by
              his widow, Annie Bierman, according to People magazine.</p>
              <p>Carradine was part of an acting dynasty. He was the son of actor John
              Carradine, a character actor who had appeared in hundreds of films,
              plays and television episodes. David Carradine also acted with his
              brothers Keith and Robert.</p>
              <p>"David's career as an artist did not
              begin on the stage, though some of his early career was on and off
              Broadway. His earliest work was as a sculptor and painter," Carradine's
              official Web site says.</p>
              <p>The site also includes an "Art Bio" in which the actor opens up about his life.</p>

              <p id="article_credit">LOS ANGELES —</p>
              <p>The forensics expert hired by David Carradine’s family has concluded that the 
              “Kung Fu” actor did not commit suicide, but said that more information was 
              needed from Thai investigators before the cause of death could be 
              determined.<br><br>Carradine’s brothers, Keith and Robert Carradine, each read 
              part of a prepared statement to reporters from The Associated Press at a Los 
              Angeles hotel Thursday morning. In their first appearance since their older 
              brother was found hanging in a Bangkok hotel room closet last week, they thanked 
              supporters and asked for privacy.<br><br>“This is a devastating loss for our 
              family and we greatly appreciate the compassion pouring in from all over the 
              world,” Keith Carradine said.<br><br>They also released a statement by Dr 
              Michael Baden of New York that indicated a second autopsy determined Carradine 
              didn’t kill himself.<br><br>“However, to reach a final determination as to the 
              cause and the manner of death, we must wait for further information from 
              Thailand as to the scene findings and the completion of the crime laboratory and 
              toxicology studies that are still being performed,” Baden’s statement 
              said.<br><br>Reached by phone after the morning briefing, Baden said he expects 
              to receive more information from Thai authorities in a week or two and stressed 
              that the information at hand was incomplete. Baden didn’t elaborate on how 
              suicide was ruled out.<br><br>“The autopsy is only part of the analysis,” he 
              said.<br><br>In the meantime, Robert Carradine asked the public and press for 
              patience and time to allow the family to grieve.<br><br>“Until we have all of 
              the pending results of the investigation we respectfully ask ... that we be 
              allowed to lay our beloved brother, husband, father, grandfather and 
              great-grandfather to rest in peace and with dignity,” Robert Carradine 
              said.<br><br>Rampant speculation about the actor’s death has swirled since a 
              chambermaid at the luxury Swissotel Nai Lert Park Hotel in Bangkok discovered 
              his body hanging in the closet of his room June 4. A Thai newspaper published a 
              graphic photo of the death scene that police have said appears to be a leaked 
              forensics image.<br><br>Thai police initially said they suspected Carradine’s 
              death was a suicide, but later conceded it could have been accidental. Their 
              description—that the actor’s body was found nude, with ropes around his neck, 
              wrist and genitals—fueled speculation that he was killed while engaging in a 
              dangerous sex practice called auto-erotic asphyxiation.<br><br>Thai authorities 
              said on June 5 that it would take about three weeks for the results of their 
              autopsy to be released.<br><br>Medical examiners in the United States and Canada 
              generally classify auto-erotic asphyxiation deaths as accidental.<br><br>Keith 
              Carradine last week asked the FBI to take a role, and Thai authorities later 
              said they would allow FBI agents to observe their investigation, but not take an 
              active role. FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said earlier this week that the 
              agency would not make any more comments about its role in the Carradine 
              investigation, but that agents stationed in Thailand have a good relationship 
              with local authorities.<br><br>Agents typically only get involved in the deaths 
              of U.S. citizens abroad when foul play is involved, she said.<br><br>Others who 
              knew the 72-year-old actor have said they suspect foul play was involved. Keith 
              and Robert Carradine on Thursday urged everyone to wait until the investigation 
              has concluded.<br><br>“Once the investigation is fully completed and definitive 
              conclusions have been reached, we will address the findings with the public,” 
              Robert Carradine said.<br><br>Both Keith and Robert Carradine shared the screen 
              with their brother, a prolific TV and film actor. David Carradine rose to 
              prominence for his role on the “Kung Fu” series in the 1970s and experienced a 
              resurgence in popularity after his role in Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill” 
              movies earlier this decade.<br><br>The family’s statement did not indicate the 
              location of his body, or offer any information about funeral arrangements. They 
              did not take questions Thursday after reading the statements.</p>
