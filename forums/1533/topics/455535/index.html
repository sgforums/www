              HONG KONG: Hong Kong actor-singer Alex To revealed during the opening of his new fusion restaurant in Hong Kong on Tuesday, that marriage is on the cards for him and his girlfriend Ice, who is 24 years his junior, reported Hong Kong media.
              
              The 50-year-old star expressed that he had been dating Ice for two years now, and their parents had already met, adding that "marriage is the next step".
              
              However, they have not yet set a date for their big day.
              
              "We are enjoying our time together right now, we love travelling, we have a lot of things we want to share.
              
              "We also have a lot of things we want to achieve â€¦ I feel that we really enjoy being with each other. I feel I need more time to gradually go to the next stage [of the relationship]," said To.
              
              During the event, To also said he intends to return to the music scene very soon.
              
              Born Alejandro Delfino, To, who is best known for his hits like "Baby Don't Go" and "Take Off", explained that he could not work on a new album because he had to care for his ailing parents over the past few years.
              
              Both have since died.
              
              To's mother, veteran singer Zhang Lu, died in 2009 while his father, Ollie Delfino, died last year.
