            <div class='col-md body'>FAQ on Channel U<br>March 17, 2005<br><br>"Will programme quality be sacrificed along with viewersÂ’ choice?" "I pay the annual TV license fee but why canÂ’t I choose what I want to watch?" "Why have the better programmes been moved to Channel 8?"<br><br>Ever since Channel UÂ’s move to the MediaCorp stable of TV stations on Jan 1 this year, many of you have been worried about the future of Channel U and what the changes will mean to you the audience. With the revamp comes a stronger image and direction, and MediaCorp TV hopes the following Q&amp;A will answer your queries about the station.<br><br>1. Why has MediaCorp TV reduced the transmission hours for Channel U?<br><br>The target audience of the revamped Channel U are young adults and working professionals aged 45 years and below. Most of them will only be available at home to watch TV from the late afternoon. To optimise resources, starting transmission at 3pm on weekdays will better serve the target audience. On Saturday and Sunday, Channel U will start transmission earlier at 10am.<br><br>2. Why are the news bulletins only 15 minutes long?<br><br>The 15-minute news bulletins NEWS JAB @ 7 and NEWS JAB @ 9 aim to provide busy working adults with concise updates on local and international developments. The additional news bulletin slots during primetime also mean that more home bound working adults will be able to catch at least one news update when they reach home.<br><br>3. What is the difference between the news bulletins at 7pm, 9pm and 11pm?<br><br>Due to the busy lifestyles of our viewers, the aim of NEWS JAB at 7pm and 9pm is to provide viewers with brief and concise news updates within 15 minutes. Offering different content and distinctive styles, NEWS JAB at 7pm will focus on international updates and local headlines while NEWS JAB at 9pm will focus more on local news in addition to international headlines. NEWS WORLD @ 11 is a half-hour news bulletin that provides comprehensive reports on local, international and financial developments for the day whilst NEWS CLUB on Saturdays and Sundays features infotainment and lifestyle news in addition to local and international news updates.<br><br>4. Why doesnÂ’t Singapore Press Holdings continue to produce Channel UÂ’s news bulletins since they also have a stake in the new company, MediaCorp TV Holdings?<br><br>Both organizations have agreed that Channel UÂ’s news operations would be managed by MediaCorp TV to optimise broadcast and electronic media resources so as to better serve the informational needs of the target audience in todayÂ’s fast-paced society. Due to the nature of news broadcast, consolidation of news operations and its human resources will also enable the station to respond faster to world developments and keep viewers abreast with local and international events.<br><br>5. Now that there is only one local terrestrial TV network, MediaCorp, will programme quality be sacrificed along with viewersÂ’ choice?<br><br>As society progresses with technological advancements and increased entertainment choices, audiences now have easy access to multiple mediums of communication and information technology. Conversely, MediaCorp is actually experiencing greater competition and constant challenges in the form of new media and advertising mediums. For example, to get daily news, one can now tune in to his or her choice of radio station, read from a range of newspapers, surf the Internet, watch cable or terrestrial TV news.<br><br>As a commercial television network, we have always been aware that the support from our viewers and advertisers remains our greatest asset to ensure the continual viability of our television business. The only way to ensure viewersÂ’ support is to continue with quality and innovative programming on our channels.<br><br>6. Why doesnÂ’t Channel U have any local drama productions?<br><br>Channel U has not given up on local drama production. Due to the high costs of producing quality dramas, MediaCorp is unable to finance these hefty productions without sufficient funding. If there is adequate funding in the future, Channel U will definitely continue to explore opportunities to present our viewers with quality local dramas.<br><br>7. I pay the annual TV license fee but why canÂ’t I choose what I want to watch?<br><br>The annual TV license fee is not paid to MediaCorp but is in fact, managed by the Media Development Authority of Singapore. Based on their developmental policies and regulations, MDA will then accord funding to the various production houses, television stations, media agencies etc. to stimulate the production of quality programmes and development of new media technology and infrastructure.<br><br>8. Why have the better programmes e.g. popular TVB drama serials been moved to Channel 8?<br><br>The programming department evaluates every programme carefully before they are scheduled for broadcast. Based on factors such as the channelÂ’s positioning, audience profiles and viewing preferences, all programmes including TVB drama serials will be spread across both Channel 8 and Channel U depending on their suitability.<br><br>9. Why are artistes like XXX appearing only on Channel U? Why are XXX artistes not seen on Channel U anymore?<br><br>If there is a suitable role for a MediaCorp artiste, whether it is a Channel 5, 8, U programme or an overseas production, it has always been MediaCorpÂ’s policy to ensure that the arrangement is made. This way, not only will artistes benefit from greater professional exposure and increased career opportunities, viewers will also get the chance to see different artistes collaborate with each other Â– making it a more refreshing and entertaining experience for viewers each time.<br><br>10. Why are current affairs programmes scheduled at 8.30pm and local variety programmes at an unusual 9.15pm?<br><br>In order to cater to different audience preferences and provide them with more viewing choices, Channel U and 8 will be showing programmes of different genres at the same time so that audiences have a variety to choose from and not have to worry about finding a suitable programme to watch.<br><br>11. Why is the current affairs programme at 8.30pm repeated at 11.30pm again?<br><br>Due to the busy schedules of working Singaporeans, many people may not be home by 8.30pm to catch Channel UÂ’s current affairs programmes. In response to this and the timely nature of the content, the 8.30pm current affairs programmes will be repeated at 11.30pm after NEWS WORLD @ 11 to benefit viewers keen on social and financial issues.<br><br><img src="http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/imagegallery/store/phpbykQz4_m.jpg"></div>
