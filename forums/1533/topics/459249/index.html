              <h1>Andy Williams, Crooner of ‘Moon River,’ Dies at 84</h1>
              <h6 class="byline">By 
              <span> <a title="More Articles by ANITA GATES" rel="author" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/anita_gates/index.html"><span>ANITA GATES</span></a></span></h6>
              <div id="articleBody">
              <p>Andy Williams, the affable, boyishly handsome crooner who defined both 
              easy listening and wholesome, easygoing charm for many American pop 
              music fans in the 1960s, most notably with his signature song, “Moon 
              River,” died on Tuesday night at his home in Branson, Mo. He was 84.</p>
              <p>The cause was complications of cancer, his publicist, Paul Shefrin, 
              said. Mr. Williams, who had continued to perform until last year, 
              announced in November that he had bladder cancer.</p>
              <p>“Moon River” was written by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer, and Audrey Hepburn introduced it in the 1961 film <a title='Web site for everything "Breakfast at Tiffany’s" ' href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/&amp;#126;bcash/breakfasthomepage.html">“Breakfast at Tiffany’s</a>,”
               but it was Mr. Williams who made the song indisputably his own when he 
              sang it at the 1962 Academy Awards ceremony and titled a subsequent 
              album after it. When he built a theater in Branson, he named it the Andy
               Williams Moon River Theater.</p>
              <p>“Moon River” became the theme song for his musical-variety television 
              series “The Andy Williams Show,” which, along with his family-oriented 
              Christmas TV specials, made him a household name.</p>
              <p>“The Andy Williams Show” ran on NBC from 1962 to 1971 and won three Emmy
               Awards for outstanding variety series. But its run also coincided with 
              the social and cultural upheavals of the 1960s, and with a lineup of 
              well-scrubbed acts like the Osmond Brothers (whom Mr. Williams 
              introduced to national television) and established performers like Judy 
              Garland and Bobby Darin, the show, at least to many members of a 
              younger, more rebellious generation, was hopelessly square — the sort of
               entertainment their parents would watch.</p>
              <p>Despite that image, “<a title="A clip from the show" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUbXFIopkxU">The Andy Williams Show</a>”
               was not oblivious to the cultural moment. Its guests also included 
              rising rock acts like Elton John and the Mamas and the Papas, and its 
              offbeat comedy skits, featuring characters like the relentless Cookie 
              Bear and the Walking Suitcase, predated similar absurdism on David 
              Letterman’s and Conan O’Brien’s talk shows by decades.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams’s Christmas specials, on the other hand, were entirely 
              anodyne and decidedly homey, featuring carols and crew-neck sweaters, 
              sleigh bells and fake snow, and a stage filled with family members, 
              including his wife, the telegenic French chanteuse <a title="About Ms. Longet" href="http://home.earthlink.net/&amp;#126;elbroome/longet/">Claudine Longet</a>,
               and their three children. The Osmonds were regular guests, as were his 
              older brothers, Bob, Don and Dick, who with Mr. Williams had formed the 
              Williams Brothers, the singing act in which he got his start in show 
              business.</p>
              <p>Although Mr. Williams’s fame came from television, movie themes were 
              among his best-known recordings, including those from “Love Story,” 
              “Charade,” “The Way We Were” and “<a title="Mr. Williams singing the song" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGA6b-DoX4c">Days of Wine and Roses</a>.”
               Decades after he had stopped recording regularly, his old hits 
              continued to turn up on movie soundtracks: “The Most Wonderful Time of 
              the Year” in “Bad Santa,” for instance, and his version of “Can’t Take 
              My Eyes Off You” in “Bridget Jones’s Diary.”</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams earned 18 gold and 3 platinum albums and was nominated for <a class="meta-classifier" title="More articles about the Grammy Awards." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/grammy_awards/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Grammy Awards</a> five times, but he never had a gold single. (His version of “Moon 
              River” was not released as a single, although versions by Mr. Mancini 
              and Jerry Butler reached the Top 20.) His biggest hit single — and his 
              only No. 1 — was “Butterfly,” an uncharacteristically rocklike 1957 
              number for which he was instructed to imitate Elvis Presley.</p>
              <p>His more mellow hits included “Canadian Sunset,” “The Hawaiian Wedding 
              Song,” “Lonely Street,” “Can’t Get Used to Losing You,” “The Shadow of 
              Your Smile” and “Are You Sincere?” He continued to record into the 
              1970s.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams was close friends with Senator Robert F. Kennedy and his 
              wife, Ethel, and sang “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” at Kennedy’s 
              funeral in 1968, but he considered himself a Republican. By 2009 he had 
              become an outspoken one. “Obama is following Marxist theory,” he told 
              The Radio Times, a British magazine. “He’s taken over the banks and the 
              car industry. He wants the country to fail.”</p>
              <p>For 21 years, until 1988, Mr. Williams was the host of a namesake golf 
              tournament in San Diego. He also collected art — works by Picasso, 
              Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Henry Moore — and in 1987 was 
              named to Arts &amp; Antiques magazine’s list of 100 top American 
              collectors.</p>
              <p>Howard Andrew Williams was born on Dec. 3, 1927, in Wall Lake, Iowa, a 
              small town northwest of Des Moines. His father, Jay, a railroad company 
              mail clerk who later went into the real estate and insurance businesses,
               and his mother, the former Florence Finley, had one daughter and five 
              sons, Andy being the fourth.</p>
              <p>He and his older brothers began singing in their local Presbyterian 
              church’s choir, which their father directed. When Andy was 6, the four 
              formed the Williams Brothers singing group and were soon appearing on 
              the radio stations WHO in Des Moines, WLS in Chicago and WLW in 
              Cincinnati.</p>
              <p>After the family moved to Los Angeles, Andy was asked to dub Lauren 
              Bacall’s singing voice in the 1944 film “To Have and Have Not.” 
              According to several sources, including Ms. Bacall, the studio ended up 
              using her voice after all, although perhaps a few high notes were the 
              boy’s.</p>
              <p>That same year Bing Crosby invited the Williams Brothers to sing backup 
              on his recording of the hit song “Swinging on a Star.” After <a class="meta-classifier" title="More articles about Wold War II." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/world_war_ii_/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">World War II</a> ended, the brothers toured with the singer, actress and author <a title="Times review of a biography" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/books/12book.html?pagewanted=all">Kay Thompson</a> for five years. Then the group disbanded, and the three older brothers left show business.</p>
              <p>At 24 Mr. Williams moved to New York, where he was hired for a two-week 
              engagement on NBC’s new, live late-night show, “Tonight,” hosted by 
              Steve Allen. As Mr. Williams often told interviewers, when the two weeks
               ended, he simply kept showing up at the studio and kept being paid.</p>
              <p>Both his recording career and his television fame grew from there, 
              leading to contracts with Cadence and Columbia Records and appearances 
              on summer-replacement series. He did so well on television that he was 
              soon given his own year-round prime-time spot.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams began performing in Las Vegas in 1966, as a headliner at 
              the opening of Caesars Palace, and continued to do shows there for two 
              decades. His one film role was in a comedy, “I’d Rather Be Rich” (1964),
               with Sandra Dee and Robert Goulet, and his one appearance on Broadway 
              was in a two-man, limited-run production with the pianist and composer 
              Michel Legrand at the Uris Theater in 1974.</p>
              <p>On a 1991 visit to Branson, the small Ozark Mountains town that had 
              become an entertainment vacation destination, Mr. Williams decided to 
              build a theater there. When the 2,000-seat <a title="The theater’s Web site" href="http://www.andywilliamstheatre.com/">Andy Williams Moon River Theater</a> opened the next year, it was Branson’s first non-country-music 
              attraction. He performed there several months a year until last 
              November. He also had a home in La Quinta, Calif.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams had a sudden burst of international fame in 1999, when 
              British automobile commercials began using his 1960s hit “Music to Watch
               Girls By.” The song was rereleased and climbed the British charts.</p>
              <p>In 2006 he released his first new album in about 15 years, “I Don’t 
              Remember Ever Growing Up,” which included a cover of the Police’s “Every
               Breath You Take.” He toured Asia that year and Britain in 2007.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams married Ms. Longet in 1961, and they had two sons, 
              Christian and Robert, and a daughter, Noelle. The couple divorced in 
              1975. That year Ms. Longet was charged with fatally shooting Spider 
              Sabich, a ski racing champion, in Aspen, Colo. Mr. Williams stood by his
               ex-wife, who contended that the shooting was accidental, and 
              accompanied her to court during her trial. She was found guilty of 
              criminally negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, and sentenced to 30 days 
              in jail.</p>
              <p>In 1991 Mr. Williams married Debbie Haas, a hotel executive. She 
              survives him, as do his children, his brothers Don and Dick, and six 
              grandchildren.</p>
              <p>In 2000, Mr. Williams spoke about the passing years to Larry King on 
              CNN. “I think everybody feels, ‘Where did it go?’ because it goes fast,”
               he said. “But I have done a lot of things that I love.”</p>
              <p>During his 2007 tour in Britain he attributed his longevity to the joy 
              of performing. He told a reporter there, “Perhaps that two hours out 
              onstage is the medicine that everybody should have.”</p>
