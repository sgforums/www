              71,700 signatures
              
              With more and more individuals growing frustrated over the controversy that first surfaced with the controversial tweets of the T-ara members and the announcement of Hwayoungâ€˜s contract termination with Core Contents Media, criticisms have been pouring in for the girl group.
              
              A petition has even been created online asking for the disbanding of the group, with the title, â€œPetition for the Disbanding of T-araâ€œ. The petitionâ€™s description states, â€œAs a group who does not take the stage seriously, and as a group who is taking the lead in the spread of bullying, a big social problem, we ask for the disbanding of this group. It seems the time has come for T-ara, a group who doesnâ€™t even greet their sunbaes if they donâ€™t believe the other artist to be popular enough, to face the verdict of the public. Please dissolve this group.â€�
              
              The petition has so far gained over 71,700 online signatures with numbers rising quickly.

               South Korean girl group T-ara has stirred controversy with the surprise
               decision to shed one of its members, a move which sparked an Internet 
              protest campaign backed by some 330,000 people.</p>
              <p>The row began Saturday when five of the eight group members posted 
              tweets apparently critical of the attitude of one member, rapper 
              Hwa-Young.</p>
              <p>On Monday the group's management agency Core Content Media announced it was ending its contract with her.</p>
              <p>Fans who suspected the 19-year-old had been bullied by other members 
              -- a claim denied by the agency -- began a campaign to reveal what they 
              called the truth.</p>
              <p>The issue attracted widespread media attention in a country which has
               seen a rising number of suicides of young people bullied by their 
              peers.</p>
              <p>Disillusioned fans created a website entitled "We demand the truth 
              from T-ara" and by Wednesday had attracted some 330,000 subscribers.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday Hwa-Young took steps to defuse the controversy.</p>
              <p>"I'm sorry to all the fans for disappointing you. Please stop 
              (criticisms)," she wrote on her Twitter account, apologising also to the
               management agency.</p>
              <p>The affair has still damaged the group, with some clients scrapping 
              advertising featuring them. T-ara's official fan club lost about 6,000 
              members, Yonhap news agency reported.</p>
              <p>Chosun Ilbo newspaper, in an article on its English-language website,
               said the affair revealed a "culture of catfights" among the 
              manufactured girl groups which are typical of South Korea's K-Pop 
              phenomenon.</p>
