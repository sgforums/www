              <p>Is Stefanie Sun finally coming back?</p>
              <p>According to a China website, home-grown singer Stefanie Sun is planning her comeback after a three-year-long hiatus with local record label Ocean Butterflies, even shelving marriage plans for her career.</p>
              <p>A close friend of Stefanie's confirmed the postponement.</p>
              <p>"Stefanie is tired of showbiz and really wants to lead a normal lifestyle. But that does not mean she is giving up on her singing career. Her relationship with her boyfriend is steady too; it's just that they're postponing marriage plans for now."</p>
              <p>An insider, who goes by the moniker Mr. Goh, revealed on a blog that when Stefanie signs the contract with Ocean Butterflies, she is effectively buying into Ocean Butterflies' shares, becoming a shareholder.</p>
              <p>"The price for Stefanie's contract is worth over RMB30m (S$6m) and this amount of money will be used for Stefanie's future albums over the next three years; whatever that is left will be converted in Ocean Butterflies shares."</p>
              <p>He also revealed that it was Stefanie's boyfriend who came up with the idea to sign with Ocean Butterflies, willingly postponing their marriage for her.</p>
              <p>Insider Mr. Goh went on to reveal that as Stefanie had always wanted more autonomy in her albums, she went on to set up her own production company to produce her own music.</p>
              <p>Besides that, the production company will also work closely with Ocean Butterflies to train a new all-female singing group, which is actually Stefanie's dream.</p>
              <p>Whoever this Mr. Goh is, he appears to have access to a lot of insider's information.</p>
              <p>Managing director of Ocean Butterflies spoke to reporters and clarified that he is not the 'Mr. Goh' in question.</p>
              <p>He explained that while Ocean Butterflies is indeed in the midst of discussing a deal with Stefanie, he is not sure how things are going.</p>
              <p>When asked if Stefanie might become a shareholder, he reportedly said that it is "not very possible".</p>
              <p>Founder and director of Ocean Butterflies, Billy Koh, could not be reached for comments.</p>
