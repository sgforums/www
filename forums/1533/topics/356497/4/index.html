              <p><br>Communism creates only leaders, there should be no landlords, top management or billionaires, all are consider comarde, even girls are said to be equal to men, they hv to do all the jobs as per men. There should be no class differentiation. The idealogy is good and sound very enlightening, all for one, and one for all. All resource are collectively collected and share equally. There should be no room for any thot of richness, industrialisation, bosses, religions, self interest, property, division of labour etc etc...all are comraderies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They are suppose to praise their leaders everytime, and that if you committed some offence, you must self admit infront of many people and get punishment as decided by the people and leaders. The leaders changing is decided by higher leaders, no way for voting. And a leader can become slave overnite if he/she is found to harbour self interest or any of the above offences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Communism is good in it theory, being everything equal and sharing is good, it create no enemy or struggling. But in practical, men or human so to speak cannot take on such ideology, because men are born by nature to be greedy, to be powerful, to be rich, to be smart, to hv ego and self interest, jealous, hatre, to dictate others, to bully, to be on top, to exploit each others etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China is just labeling itself as a communist country to differentiate themselves from the USA, but actually it is no more communism, there are million of millionaires in China today, they r free to roam the world, they exploited others to work for them, they created class differentiation, they embraced the western business adminstration that created the division of labour. But i dun blame them, cos communism is only good in theory, it cannot work in practice, cos it is to strict to follow. Just like religion, you can hardly follow the rules and regulations set on the religion fully.</p>

              <p>i want to post something about communism, communism is very effective during warring period. From the history communism military is powerful, i don't know the reason,  i will cite some example. like, during russian revolution, the red army defeat white army, and during the second world war, Soviet give a big bang to Nazi's stratedy of taking the Soviet easily, because hilter think russian is the slavs, which is a inferior race, but what happen following prove him to be wrong,</p>
              <p>in vietnam war, though US support south vietnam with weapon and advanced equipment, but south vietnam cannot defeat north vietnam which is also runned by communist, and even when US interfere directly, finally north vietnam win the war, and a communist leadership is established throughout the country, by election.</p>
              <p>and china CCP defeat KMT,</p>
              <p>i think communist's military is powerful, i don't know the reason.</p>
              <p>But now no one in the world is believing in communism, like angel said, it's good in theory, but cannot work out.</p>
              <p>So i think there is no real communist country in the world, maybe north korea is one, i don't know much about the situation in north korea, because it's locked up .</p>
              <p>and Now the name communist is being used as chip to accuse country with different ideology, and different interest, now there is no real laissez faire economy, even the most democratic and liberal country like US, have been adopt government interference and regulation during the depression,  it is shown during Roosvelt's New Deal plan,</p>
              <p>And according to Keynesianism, during depression, the government interference to the economy is a must.</p>
              <p>Now the name of communist or socialist failed to depict the so called communist country in the world, because they are applying a hybrid economic system, with both communist and capitalistic characteristics.So the name of communist is outdated already</p>

              <p>If one were to critically analyse Jackie Chan's controversial statement, it would be read as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a longing for the rule of law and everyone within a society adhering to it</span>, an Utopia which EVERYONE shares.</p>
              <p><br>It has nothing to do with political systems. Political systems are only a code of governance which a society can determine for themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Throughout history, free man had always sought and fought for a political system that is just and fair, acceptable with compromises on every single individual for the good of whole.</p>
              <p><br>Regardless of hyped up communism or capitalism, free men only longed for Utopia, and when given time it didnt work-politicaly or economically, the pitchforks would be out without fail.</p>
              <p><br>We cannot blame Jackie for making that call, because time had been given to Taiwan and HongKong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Had democracy worked? - freedom from hunger, freedom from poverty, freedom from illiteracy, freedom from diseases, freedom from discrimination? Only those who live in Taiwan and Hongkong can determine if it had work. Those of us who live outside cannot comment due to the complexities of such societies itself.</p>
              <p><br>For Singaporeans, we can only comment that we do live with such freedoms, and more critically, laws agreed upon by society at large is respected and adhered to. Is our country ruled by a strong hand? No, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the only strong hand is that of law itself</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reasonable laws that if followed would grant a common man whether he is rich or poor, MP or constituent, educated or uneducated, white or black, single or married, equality to a fair trial of justice and peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even our PM had to attend court, which speaks volume against that of many other 'free' country leaders that I know would be immuned.</p>
              <p><br>The only error that i find in his speech is for the claim that CHINESE needs a strong hand. This is discriminatory and a fatal fallacy which he should apologise not only to the chinese ethnic group, but to humanity as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Utopia belongs to no ethnic group, but to the human race who seeks freedom. We as a civilisation NEEDS the strong hand of laws, reasonable ones that is acceptable to society as a whole or at least to a greater majority, to achieve peace and prosperity without discriminations, regardless if we are anglo-saxons, slavics, arabs, africans, polynesians, indians or chinese, a longing we all humans share.</p>
              <p><br>Without agreed upon laws, a society will collapse and revert to barbarism - everyman for himself, whoever reaches the top dominates the rest, with several layers law for different society types, but no laws for himself.</p>

              <p>but i think no offence, some of singapore law is draconian law, like whip punishment and it's been rumoured in singapore if people commit suicide, he have to face fine when he failed to do that.</p>

              <p>when you impose that law, crime rate maybe reduced, and suicide rate is reduced, but after all, the law is not humanity friendly. And many country criticize that.</p>

              <p>jackie chan is a racist.  He seems insinuating that chinese is the only race in the world that need to be controlled.  chinese need to be controlled????  wtf!   bloody!   come jackie, migrate to singapore and I am sure you will love our ruling party pee ay pee's way of control and sucking money.</p>
              <p>The person that really needs control is he himself called jackie chan.    I suggest he zips his big mouth, to do this he will have to go plastic surgery.     this guy sometimes talks as though his brain is dislocated in his ass.  ha ha ha!</p>

              <p><br>That is a wonder when LKY told us during my poly years that it will be fascinating to see a Communist govern country open up and taking a capitalist economy. It is no more communism, just like my Uncle Andrew use to say, is singapore democratic? or a mixture of autorcratic and democratic??</p>
