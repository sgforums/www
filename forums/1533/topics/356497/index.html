              <p>Chan's comments drew applause from an audience of business leaders on China's southern island province of Hainan.</p>
              <p>The 55-year-old Hong Kong actor was participating in a panel at the annual Boao Forum on Saturday when he was asked to discuss censorship and restrictions on filmmakers in China. He expanded his comments to include society in general.</p>
              <p>'I'm not sure if it's good to have freedom or not,' Chan said.</p>
              <p>'I'm really confused now. If you're too free, you're like the way Hong Kong is now. It's very chaotic. Taiwan is also chaotic.'</p>
              <p>Chan added: 'I'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled. If we're not being controlled, we'll just do what we want.' -- AP</p>
