              <p>There is phrase, the more you know the more confused you are. And only the ignorant people dare to claim that they konw everything.</p>
              <p>people are confused, because of many reason, like bill gates could be confused about what he will do after retirement from microsoft, how he will spend the money, give it to the child , or donate it, if donate it ,in what way, just spread the money, or supervise, how is money is used ,</p>

              <p>during the june 4th crackdown, people become restless, and motivated by student from peking university, and Tsing hua university, which are top university from china.</p>
              <p>and someone believe they have been manipulated by taiwan agent or westerner spy,</p>
              <p>at that time the democracy become a popular name as fashion, people willing to read news from west, and dress like westerner, there are some democracy fighter ,which name is given by media, their name i cannot remember because they pop up the political stage, and soon dissappear,</p>
              <p>after cooling down from from radical reformist, people no more interested in democracy, but incline to accept a socialist system with chinese characteristics.</p>
              <p>when deng xiaopeng is recovered to his formal political position, he take a tour to shenzhen, and after deliberately consideration, his propose a openup, which is a historical moment of china,</p>
              <p> then people no more spend their time in discussing politics, but discussing where to make money, the political circumstance change gradually and quietly.</p>
              <p>that's the end of old china, and the openning of a new china, when people's focus greatly shifted from politics to economy, as addressed by china's political leader.</p>
              <p>and the 4 june inncident is buried in  people's memory, no one want to re raise again.</p>
              <p>i think if chinia's government didnot put down the student, maybe china now is already a different country, that's leave a lot of space for imagination.</p>

                  take pride in thinking properly and thinking well. You know why you
                  always talk rubbish? Garbage in garbage out, understand?</span></p>

              <p>basically, it is a central control system versus the free market system.</p>
              <p>jackie chan think that chinese needs to be controlled, very communist like, compared to the capitalist model.</p>
              <p>as for the clash in democracy, it can be avoided, no need to clash. so let's see if there is a voting process anywhere in China bah.</p>
