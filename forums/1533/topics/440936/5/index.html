              Chen</h1>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #999999;"> By <a style="color: #999999; text-decoration: underline;" title="Posts by Jayne" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jaynestars.com/author/jayne/">Jayne</a> on
              November 5, 2011</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.jaynestars.com/wp-content/uploads/cache/10274_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="317"></p>
              <p style="color: #1b1b1b; font-family: Arial,san-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">Entangled in another sex scandal, intimate photos
              of <strong>Edison Chen</strong> (é™³å† å¸Œ) and 16-year-old
              student, <strong>Cammi Tse</strong> (è¬�èŠ·è•™) circulated
              recently. Displeased with his behavior, Edison’s rumored
              ex-girlfriend, <strong>Gloria Wong</strong> (é»ƒæ¦•), scolded
              him bluntly for his fetish obsessions. In a telephone interview,
              Gloria revealed that Edison had asked her to wear a pink lingerie
              set to pose for some photographs in the past. The bra was made of
              thin transparent material, similar to a cheap set [purchased in a
              sex shop] for tens of dollars.</p>
              <p style="color: #1b1b1b; font-family: Arial,san-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">At the time, Edison scouted the best camera angles to shoot the
              intimate photographs, but did not ask Gloria to model any difficult
              poses. Gloria stressed that agreed to shoot the photos only once,
              which left her with a disgusted feeling, as if she were
              raped.  Subsequently, Gloria asked Edison to delete the
              photos, but she did not know if he did in fact do so. In Gloria’s
              mind, the lingerie photos represented a time-bomb ready to explode
              at any time. In retrospect, Gloria deeply regretted taking the
              photos for Edison.</p>
              <p style="color: #1b1b1b; font-family: Arial,san-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">Gloria revealed that Edison resided with his elder
              sister, <strong>Tricia Chan</strong> (é™³è¦‹é£›), for a period
              of time. He was too lazy to care whether Tricia was home or not and
              continued to urgently ask Gloria  to go to his house for
              “pressing needs.” However, Gloria and Edison did not play in the
              outdoors and remained within the comforts of home.</p>
              <p style="color: #1b1b1b; font-family: Arial,san-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"><strong>Gloria Wong: “They Went Beyond Kissing!”</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial,san-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #1b1b1b;">Regarding Cammi Tse’s insistence that
              she did not have a sexual relationship with Edison Chen, Gloria
              Wong said in a Now TV interview, “I do not believe her.</span> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Edison will not let women off
              the hook so easily</span></strong><span style="color: #1b1b1b;">.
              In the leaked photos, both Edison and Cammi did not wear any
              clothes [as indicated by their naked shoulders]. Their
              cheek-to-cheek photos revealed an obvious reddish glow in their
              faces, as if they were very ‘high.’ Of course they did not simply
              kiss!”</span></p>
              <p style="color: #1b1b1b; font-family: Arial,san-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">Gloria did not consider herself to be taking advantage of the
              situation [to attack Edison], but only wished to tell the
              truth.</p>

              <p>Edison Chen vows to have no more photo scandals<br>Posted: 16 December 2011 1637 hrs<br>      <br><br>TAIPEI: Hong Kong singer apologised once more for his involvement in a photo scandal with 16-year-old model Cammi Tse and vowed that such things won't happen again, when he attended a promotional event for his fashion label in Taiwan on Thursday, reported Hong Kong media.<br><br>"I am bad, I was wrong. That is it. The whole thing was because I am wrong. I was stupid, I need to be smarter," said Chen.<br><br>When asked if he would stop taking intimate photos of himself and his girlfriends, Chen refused to answer.<br><br>"I don't want to answer you all because that is my private space.<br><br>"This sort of thing won't happen in the future, if it does, you won't see Edison Chen again," said Chen.<br><br>The 31-year-old actor also expressed disappointment that the media has consistently focused only on his mistakes.<br><br>"When I do something good, nobody says anything," Chen lamented.<br><br>"But when I do something a little, little bit bad, it becomes a very big story.

              such things won't happen again, when he attended a promotional
              event for his fashion label in Taiwan on Thursday, reported Hong
              Kong media.<br> <br> "I am bad, I was wrong. That is it. The whole thing was because I

              his girlfriends, Chen refused to answer.<br> <br> "I don't want to answer you all because that is my private
