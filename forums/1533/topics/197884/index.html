We'll have to wait and see," Mellis said. "We'll work out some type of daily operation."<br><br>Boy George was warned by a judge on Monday that he faced jail if he refused to comply with the terms of his community service.<br><br>The singer had balked at the initial idea of sweeping leaves in a city park, arguing that his talents could be better used organising a music event to benefit AIDS charities.<br><br>"It would have been more useful to make 30 grand (30,000 dollars) with a concert, rather than be prancing around in a park," he told Britain's Press Association after the judge's warning.<br><br>The former Culture Club frontman stressed it wasn't the idea of menial work that bothered him.<br><br>"I don't care about doing cleaning up. My mum was a cleaner. I've always been a scrubber," he joked.<br><br>The judge gave him until the end of August to complete his allotted task.<br><br>Boy George was arrested October 7 last year after calling police to report a burglary at his downtown Manhattan apartment.<br><br>Police detected no sign of a break-in but said they found a small amount of cocaine.<br><br>As part of a plea deal, New York prosecutors dropped a cocaine possession charge that could have sent him to jail in exchange for his guilty plea to a false reporting charge.<br><br>As well as the community service, he agreed to undergo drug rehabilitation.<br><br>Boy George briefly embarked on a solo singing career after leaving Culture Club in 1987, before beginning a successful career as a DJ and launching fashion line B-Rude.<br><br>His musical "Taboo" closed on Broadway in 2004 after a short run and generally poor reviews.
