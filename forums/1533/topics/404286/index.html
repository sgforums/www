              <p>The 21st Golden Melody Awards held on Saturday in Taipei Arena was a night filled with both triumphs and upsets.</p>
              <p>All eyes were on the top awards for the Best Male Singer and Best Female Singer category, traditionally the categories with the stiffest competition.</p>
              <p>In the category for Best Female Singer, judges' votes for pop diva Chang Hui-mei (popularly known as A-Mei) were unanimous, allowing her to clinch the award.</p>
              <p>This is the veteran songstress' second award in the same category since first winning it in 2002. A-Mei then went on to win five more awards, making her the biggest winner that night.</p>
              <p>Over on the other side for Best Male Singer however, results came as a surprise to many as the hot favourite this year, Eason Chan, did not win.</p>
              <p>After judges' voting, singer-songwriter David Tao received ten votes whereas Eason only managed seven, making David the winner of the category. David was not present at the ceremony to receive the award though.</p>
              <p>After the awards show, the disgruntled Eason was spotted having supper with fellow Hong Kong singer, Karen Mok, who also lost out to A-Mei on the Best Female Singer award.</p>
              <p>While Karen tried covering up her disappointment when interviewed, Eason could hardly keep his discontentment to himself.</p>
              <p>"His (David) album is not good at all," said Eason, who later withdrew the remark and instead, said that he is actually "a big fan" of David's music.</p>
              <p>When reporters asked about why Eason pulled a long face throughout the whole evening, the eccentric star explained that that is his 'default' look and his flu that made him look unhappy that night, not because he was unhappy over losing the award.</p>
