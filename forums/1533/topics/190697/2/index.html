            <div class='col-md body'>The Electric New Paper :<br>The 10 o'clock addiction<br>Jewel in The Palace has everyone from toddlers to aunties to grandmas hooked<br>NE Singaporean toddler jiggles her butt to it.<br>Actress Kym Ng cries her heart out over it.<br>By Chang May Choon<br><br>28 May 2006<br>NE Singaporean toddler jiggles her butt to it.<br>Actress Kym Ng cries her heart out over it.<br><br>A 12-year-old girl and a 42-year-old woman love it so much, they've seen it at least five times.<br><br>The object of their obsession? Jewel In The Palace, a 70-episode Korean historical drama series showing on Channel U at 10pm on weekdays.<br><br>It tells of how a palace maid becomes the first female imperial physician.<br><br>The serial has captured the hearts of over 1.8 million viewers aged 15 and above, says TNS Media research firm.<br><br>This means every two in five Singaporeans rush home before 10pm to see it.<br><br>With an average rating of 13, Jewel is the most watched weekday drama in the time slot to date, beating Hong Kong serials such as Take My Word For It.<br><br>The serial has attracted not just women but a large number of men, too. (See report below.)<br><br>So, what is it about this serial that appeals to so many?<br><br>For 15-month-old Swen Teo, it is the chirpy melody of the theme song.<br><br>She can barely stand but jiggles her diaper-clad bottom to the music.<br><br>Mum Neo Lay Yiing, 30, a civil servant, said Swen watches the show with her every day.<br><br>'Sometimes she lies on her stomach, cups her face and watches transfixed. Sometimes she smiles at the screen.'<br><br>Older viewers are drawn to the gripping and well-knit plot, lush backdrop and excellent acting.<br><br>Fans told The New Paper that it was 'the best Korean drama' they had seen.<br><br>They love the detailed portrayal of Korea's history and palace culture and insights into royal cuisine and medicine - a refreshing change from the usual mushy Korean love stories.<br><br>In particular, they love the show's protagonist, Jang Geum (Lee Young Ae). With her heart of gold, never-say-die attitude and passion, she has become the epitome of female perfection and a role model to fans.<br><br>Management executive Phua Ping Ping, 43, who doesn't normally watch Korean serials, said: 'Jang Geum inspires by the way she faces difficulties with courage and optimism.<br><br>'Her parents died a wrongful death but she never resorts to underhanded methods. She is forgiving and has a magnanimous heart.'<br><br>Pri 6 student Lianne Ng, who has watched it five times - twice on DVD, twice on cable and now on Channel U - said: 'I find it very inspiring and touching that Jang Geum never gives up and helps others.'<br><br>Last year the Raffles Girls' Primary School student visited the places in Korea where the drama was filmed.<br><br>The never-ending power struggle between the righteous Jang Geum and the evil Lady Choi and her minions also makes for riveting viewing.<br><br>Cleaner Anna Tan, who is in her 40s, said she was hooked from the day the young Jang Geum was instructed to deliver all sorts of water - hot, cold, salty, sweet - to her mentor until she learnt to fulfil unspoken needs.<br><br>'Jang Geum is so pitiful. Someone is always trying to harm her and I've been watching to see what will happen in the end. Lady Choi is so devious I feel like whacking her!'<br><br>Property agent Noorine Ahmad, 42, who has watched the series five times on DVD, said: 'The writer is so imaginative! There are so many unexpected twists.<br><br>'On the Internet, people were discussing who was the most evil character, and someone said it was Jang Geum because she let us sleep only two or three hours (a day) because we're hooked on the drama.'<br><br>Housewife Chua Khah Ching, 65, who is watching Jewel for the second time on Channel U, loves the drama's heart-rending scenes.<br><br>'Some scenes can really make you cry, like when little Jang Geum feeds her dead mum berries.'<br><br>Then there is the romance between Jang Geum and an imperial guard, Min Jeong Ho (Ji Jin Hee).<br><br>Tour executive Zhong Tingting, 25, who has seen Jewel three times, said: 'Their love is so pure, they don't need mushy words to convey their feelings. Just one glance speaks volumes.'<br><br>Even MediaCorp actress Kym Ng is hooked. She watches and cries 'until I get cramps'.<br><br>Kym, who watched the entire DVD set in just three weeks, said: 'It's so touching to have somebody love you so much. Like when Jang Geum is exiled to Jeju and he goes to save her. He asks her to wait and he'll seek redress for her. It's sooo touching!'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Men love it for the story, the history<br><br>TEACHER Tan Guan Heng, 28, rushes home before 10pm to watch his favourite TV show, Jewel In The Palace.<br><br>'Every night I follow it diligently. I saw the first three episodes and I've been watching it since,' he said.<br><br>Mr Tan is not alone. Of the 1.8 million Singaporeans who tune in, almost half (44.2 per cent or 795,600 viewers) are men, according to TNS Media.<br><br>The biggest group is men aged 45 years and above (39.8 per cent). The 15-24 age group makes up 20 per cent.<br><br>But, why are the men glued to a drama aimed primarily at housewives?<br><br>Fans say the captivating story line and insight into Korean history.<br><br>Mr Tan said that he was able to relate to the drama as he finds Korea's ancient culture similiar to Chinese culture.<br><br>'Jang Geum gives people hope that if you persist, you will succeed. It reminds us of the Japanese drama Oshin, that you must persevere to the end and not be afraid of hardship.'<br><br>For retiree Wong Tat Meng, 67, it was the plot that was so absorbing.<br><br>'There's not a dull moment! It's a lively story with sadness, happiness, comedy and some romance. But the most important part is that it exposes Korea's palace politics.'<br><br>Senior tour officer Johnston Loh, 34 and his wife also tune in every night, despite having seen it on DVD.<br><br>He said: 'This is the best Korean drama I've watched so far. It's not just a love story, it also deals with Korean cuisine and medicine.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Once I mocked, now I am hooked<br>By Lee Xin En<br><br>I USED to mock my friend, a Korean drama junkie, after she put a picture of Ji Jin Hee (who plays royal guard Min Jeong Ho in Jewel In The Palace) on her MSN profile.<br><br>It seems that karma really exists because recently, I have been searching frantically for pictures of Jin Hee with his dorky, I mean dashing, Korean headgear.<br><br>He has been the apple of my eye ever since I started watching the drama - initially to see what the fuss was all about, only to become a devout fan myself.<br><br>Before I get mocked, let me explain the allure of Jeong Ho.<br><br>Chivalry doesn't seem to exist in this era - which is why I love him for doing the craziest things such as moving hundreds of kilometers to Jeju island to be near the object of his affections - palace cook Jang Geum (Lee Young Ae)<br><br>He also has this subtle look that says 'I'm repressing my feelings for you' whenever he is near Jang Geum. Very cute.<br><br>Best of all, the couple doesn't kiss or get up to any hanky-panky, which is rare in dramas these days. I'm bred on MTV's sexual innuendos but the overwhelming flood of sex on primetime serials is getting to me.<br><br>Hunk aside, I'm sure most people wouldn't link an 18-year-old like me to a Korean weepie.<br><br>But teenagers (and everyone else) love a kind-hearted underdog, which is essentially what Jewel is all about.<br><br>Sure, it can get weary watching Jang Geum getting into trouble in every episode - like getting on the wrong side of the devious Lady Choi or being maligned for poisoning the emperor's food.<br><br>But when I see her getting out of each mess, it makes me feel like there is an answer to all problems. And everyone likes answers.<br><br>In some ways, Jewel is like an episode of Oprah - it inspires me to get to work every day, ready for all the challenges ahead of me.<br><br></div>

The Queen.... actually quite loved by Koreans for generations.  In the story, the script made her sound like super heroine... super nice... super good.  That's why.</div>
