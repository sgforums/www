            <div class='col-md body'>Synopsis...........<br><br>Bridget Jones (RenÃ©e Zellweger) is now blissful and besotted in the arms of gorgeous lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). Mark is accomplished, supportive and tolerant of (nearly) all of Bridget's tiny jealousies; why wouldn't every woman in London, including Mark's new, drop-dead-gorgeous intern, want to lure him away from the plumpish, opinionated, sometimes inappropriate Bridget? With the entry of the leggy threat, Bridget's pink clouds begin to turn grey as her attacks of self-doubt sorely test her relationship with Darcy. And just when it seems that the waters couldn't get any more choppy, Bridget's former boss, womanizing heartthrob Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) sails into view.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just watched it yesterday.<br><br>It was as good &amp; touching as part 1.  My tears dropped when Mark Darcy said "I love you".  He is the best guy I have ever seen on a movie.  He accepted all Bridget's flaws and clumsiness.  He made all the sacrifices for her.<br><br>Just like part 1, it was quite funny.  Bridget and Mark had very good sex.  The next day, Bridget called Mark from her office, and said kinky things to him.  She didn't realised that Mark was having a meeting and he was talking to her using a speaker phone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Despite of all the embarassing moments that Bridget has given him, Mark still loved Bridget very much.<br><br>In part 2, Bridget suspected that Mark was having an affair with his good looking colleague.  They broke up for a while.  Then Bridget was assigned a task and had to travel with Daniel Cleaver to Thailand.  Once again, Daniel tried to sweet talk Bridget into having sex with him.  Did he succeed?  Go watch lor.<br><br>Also Bridget was thrown into prison in Thailand.  For what leh?  Go watch lor.<br>But in the prison, she met with some girls.  She told those girls that her bf Mark Darcy was very bad to her.  But when those girls shared with her what their bfs did to them (like beating them up, feeding them with cocaine etc), she realised how stupid she was breaking up with Mark.  But she was in prison.  Is there anyway she could undo her mistake and reconcile with Mark?<br><br>Go watch the movie lor....heheheh<br><br></div>
