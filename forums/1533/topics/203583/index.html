            <div class='col-md body'>If you are a fan of CRHK903's Love Valley, you might have heard this story before...<br><br>It was about 8am on a very chaotic morning. An elderly gentleman probably in his 80s, went to the hospital to have his stitches removed by a doctor. Unfortunately, there was a major road accident &amp; all the doctors were busy at the ER...the elderly man was left waiting...<br><br>As he waited, he couldn't help but to keep checking his watch impatiently for the time. At the same time a nurse who had just came on shift noticed him &amp; went over to help him with his stitches.<br><br>As she was removing the stitches, she asked, <span style="color: indigo;">"Mr, Are you in a hurry?"</span><br><br>And he replied, "<span style="color: blue;">Oh yes, my young lady, I've an appointment at 9am</span>."<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">After hearing his reply she started wondering what kind of appointment was of such importance to an elderly man like him</span>?<br><br>Then he added, "<span style="color: blue;">I've a daily breakfast date with my wife at the Health Care Center."</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">"Your wife's at the Health Care Center? Is she alright?" She asked with much concern.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">"No worries dear, it's just Parkinson's Disease. It has been a while since she remembers anything or anybody</span>." He answered.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">"You're her husband &amp; yet she can't recognise you?"</span> She asked again.<br><br>He answered with a little pause, "<span style="color: blue;">You are right, young lady, it's been 5 years...Actually, she wouldn't notice if I'm there or not..."</span><br><br>Upon hearing that, curiously she asked, "<span style="color: indigo;">Since she can't recognise you, why are you in such a hurry &amp; still keep to this daily routine?"</span><br><br>The elderly man tapped lightly on her hands &amp; replied with a smile, "<span style="color: blue;">She may have forgotten who I am...but I'm fine with it because I still do know that she's my wife."</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">As he finished, he thanked the nurse &amp; went off for his date.</span><br><br>A love like that seems simple to us...but to achieve, it'll take a lifetime. Today's youth are living under the fast-food culture. They want everything in a flash, instant well paid career, fast gals &amp; easy guys. Always dreaming of a love story like that of the movie Titanic...to be honest, that was just child's play.<br><br>When you're at the verge of death, it so easy to just "Die~". di cuco's mind was clouded by honeymoonin' with fat-winslate, on top of that, with the help of brain freezing sea water, he thought that he was tough enough &amp; heroically gave up the floating plank to fat-winslate...but who knows...<br><br>On the other hand, if they both survived, they'll be living happily......e~errr~.....for a month. Then di cuco, being the horny dog he is, will engage wh0res &amp; tries to get free meals by drawing portraits for them. At the same time, fat-winslate will be sick &amp; tired of this horny &amp; penniless cheap ass; left him &amp; went back to her mother, so that she can get hooked up with some rich man. This is reality. Is it as beautiful a story?<br><br></div>
