            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Popular</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.thecinemasource.com/moviesdb/images/popular_coverpic.jpg"><br><br><strong>Intro</strong><br><br>Popular was a teenage dramedy on The WB, created by Ryan Murphy (Nip/Tuck) and Gina Matthews (What Women Want, Jake 2.0, 13 Going on 30), starring Leslie Bibb and Carly Pope as two teenage girls that reside on polar opposite sides of the popularity spectrum at their high school, but are forced to co-exist when their single parents randomly meet and get married.<br><br>The show ran for two seasons on The WB from 1999 to 2001. Though the show was a big hit with The WB's teenage audience during its first year, the ratings could not sustain the network moving it to Friday nights, despite some outcry from loyal fans. Fans were also outraged over the rumor that Ryan Murphy had been promised a third season, which is why he left the final episode of the series on a cliffhanger, never to be resolved.<br><br><strong>Plot synopsis</strong><br><br>Sam McPherson and Brooke McQueen, high school students at Jacqueline Kennedy High School, are opposites. Brooke is a popular cheerleader, and Sam is an unpopular journalist. Their respective gangs are forced to socialize when Brooke's father and Sam's mother get engaged.<br><br>The plot of the first season revolves around the girls' plan to separate their parents. At the end of the season, Sam finds Brooke's real mother and encourages her to come back to town. This breaks up the engagement. By the second season, Sam and Brooke realize that their parents were happy together, and therefore team up to reunite them.<br><br>In the second season, a reversal of fortunes of sorts took place with Brooke resigning from cheerleading to focus on school issues as a member of the student council and Sam experiencing a surge of sudden popularity at school. Josh and Lily begin dating regularly, and Carmen replaces Nicole as the leader of the Glamazons. Harrison finds himself torn between Sam and Brooke, and Sugar Daddy finds love with exchange student Exquisite Woo. In the end of the second season finale — which turned out to be the series finale — Brooke is run over by an angry Nicole Julian.<br><br><strong>Reviews</strong><br><br>Despite fitting into a rather common category, as a teen-centered mix of drama and comedy, Popular differentiated itself from its peers in its quirky, non sequitur humor and overall satirical approach to characters and story lines, a feature that would grow as the series progressed. Such elements included Mary Cherry's long-lost sister from the ghetto, B. Ho (and even their mother's name, Cherry Cherry); an occasion where both groups switched hair colours; Bobbi Glass's lost finger being replaced with a metal one complete with extendable pointer and knife attachments; and Josh's work as a window seller. The show also utilized a variety of pop culture references and nonsensical jokes (for instance, April Tuna's reference to "getting some frottage" in the hall closet).<br><br><strong>Further info</strong><br><a href="http://www.tv.com/popular/show/254/summary.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=tabssh&amp;tag=tabs;summary" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.com/popular/show/254/summary.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=tabssh&amp;tag=tabs;summary</a><br><br><strong>Video Links</strong><br><br>Episode 1<br>Pt 1: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2-xTEgpTYQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2-xTEgpTYQ</a><br>Pt 2: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj_Fj8o98mY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj_Fj8o98mY</a><br>Pt 3: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS4hWwIDXV0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS4hWwIDXV0</a><br>Pt 4: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiOgEQS_HwU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiOgEQS_HwU</a><br>Pt 5: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z8SFeA5aaY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z8SFeA5aaY</a><br><br>More episodes<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=dawn152&amp;p=r&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=dawn152&amp;p=r&amp;page=1</a></div>
