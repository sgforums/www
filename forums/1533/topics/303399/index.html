We have cast iron rules on what any chef can and cannot buy in all Fifteens.<br><br>"I can't stop thinking it seems a coincidence this one-off has happened the week my programme airs. I've never been so disappointed. Heads will roll."<br><br>Jamie is trustee of the 15 Foundation charity and founder of all four Fifteen restaurants.<br><br>It has emerged Fifteen Cornwall bought 360 battery chicken eggs when a regular supplier of free range eggs let them down.<br><br>The farmer who found the egg was eating with 12 pals - including some battery chicken farmers - who were attending a wedding in the area.<br><br>A source said: "The farmer asked to see an egg. A waiter brought him an egg but the customer said 'This is a battery chicken egg'.<br><br>"The staff were shocked a chef could make such a stupid mistake - everyone is upset and the remaining battery eggs were thrown away.<br><br>People at the restaurant feel really strongly about free range eggs and thinks Jamie's campaign is brilliant.<br><br>"I feel somebody should be sacked over this, but I don't know if it will happen."<br><br>Restaurant chief executive Dave Meneer said: "We can only apologise and have taken steps to ensure this cannot happen again.<br><br>"We are very sorry for any embarrassment this may have caused Jamie. I'm sure it is the last thing he needed.<br><br>"I was at home watching Jamie on TV when this happened - the timing was amazing, you just couldn't have written the script. I barely believed it when I was told - but it's a fair cop.<br><br>"We were too complacent and should have checked the source. I could go throwing my weight around firing people, but I don't see where that gets you.<br><br>"I've got a cracking team of chefs and I need them all, but I have been reading the riot act because this was fundamental to how we do business."<br><br>Chefs use around 800 eggs a week at Fifteen Cornwall, which has served 120,000 diners since opening in Watergate Bay, Newquay, in May 2006. Some meals there cost Â£50 a head.<br><br>The restaurant employs 16 trainee chefs from disadvantaged backgrounds and another 19 youngsters are in college waiting to take up jobs.<br><br>Fifteen Cornwall boasts on its website how its eggs come from Clarence Court in nearby Liskeard.<br><br>It says: "The hens at Clarence Court are from old-fashioned breeds such as the Old Cotswold Legbar and the Burford Brown.<br><br>"Allowed to roam freely and given a totally natural diet, the hens produce seriously good eggs."<br><br><strong>GO TO WORK</strong><br><br>The average hen lays 257 eggs a year<br><br>Britons eat nearly 10billion eggs a year; that's 26million every day<br><br><strong>EGGHEADS</strong><br><br>White-shell eggs come from hens with white feathers and white ear lobes, brown eggs are produced by red hens with red lobes</div>
