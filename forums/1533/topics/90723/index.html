            <div class='col-md body'>The New Paper - 24 Aug 2004<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bai Ling loves to hog the limelight </span><br><br>By Wendy Teo<br>teowyw@sph.com.sg<br><br>CHINA-BORN actress Bai Ling sure likes to hog the limelight.<img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-08-23/webai-094015.jpg"><br><br>Currently doing the publicity rounds of her latest movie Three Extremes, the always outrageously-dressed babe has been providing much fodder for the press with her antics.<br><br>At a Hong Kong press conference last Tuesday, she caught everyone by surprise when she grabbed co-star Miriam Yeung and planted a smacker on the shocked girl's lips.<br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-08-23/webai-093841.jpg"><br>The next day, at the Taipei press conference, Bai Ling tantalised the media with the confession that she has had 50 boyfriends and is currently on her 51st - acclaimed cinematographer Christopher Doyle.<br><br>Yet, the 34-year-old toned it down and played coy during a phone conference with local reporters last Friday.<br><br>'I was only joking!' she said with a laugh when asked about the intriguing revelation.<br><br>'I don't know how many boyfriends I have had, I can't remember! You have to give me some time to think.'<br><br>Bai Ling also refused to reveal more about her relationship with Doyle, dismissing questions with the excuse that she didn't want the focus to veer away from the movie.<br><br>PUBLICITY STUNT<br><br>She also brushed off her kiss with Miriam as just a publicity stunt on her part.<br><br>Sounding amused at the furore she has created, Bai Ling said: 'I like Miriam a lot, so I just thought I would give her a kiss. That's just me, the mischievous genie.<br><br>'Anyway, it's good for publicity. And the kiss was so brief that I can't even tell you what her lips taste like!'<br><br>Three Extremes marks the Hollywood-based starlet's first foray into Asian cinema.<br><br>Bai Ling, who moved to the US in 1991, had angered the Chinese government for appearing in the controversial movie Red Corner - which exposed the corrupt Chinese legal system - with Richard Gere four years ago.<br><br>She then went on to appear in movies like Anna And The King and Star Wars: Episode III.<br><br>But now she is better known internationally as the Chinese actress who's forever appearing in sexy dresses in US supermarket tabloids.<br><br>In Three Extremes, Bai Ling plays an unlicensed midwife who makes dumplings out of aborted foetuses and placenta, and sells them to tai tais desperate to restore their youth and beauty.<br><br>But in reality, Bai Ling says she doesn't believe in such unconventional methods.<br><br>She has never tried such 'exotic' soups, and has no intention of doing so.<br><br>'I don't dare to. You never know what weird effect it might have on you after drinking it. Anyway, I don't believe in such methods, I believe that beauty should be from within.'<br><br>She had been disgusted when she learnt too late that some of the placenta used on the movie set were not props but the real thing.<br><br>She said: 'So there I was, poking them around and then going on to eat watermelon seeds without washing my hands. I only realised something was wrong when the seeds tasted funny and there was this stench. I was so furious with the props department for not telling me.'<br><br>While Bai Ling is known for her vanity, she claims that she is not too worried about ageing.<br><br>'The only form of exercise I do is dancing. I love clubbing very much, and I go every other night, so that's my regular exercise. But I also like to eat a lot, especially desserts.'<br><br>Despite her flamboyant party animal image, crooner Chris Isaak's ex-squeeze insists she is no loose woman.<br><br>'I'm very loyal to my feelings. I can't do it if I have no feelings for the person. I have to admit that I've met many good men on my travels around the globe, and that I've had the chance to be close to them. And I've learnt quite a bit from them too.'<br><br>And the still-single lady doesn't have plans to settle down as yet.<br><br>'When I see old couples, I feel very envious. But I don't want to set goals for myself. I prefer to live for the surprise, when every day is like opening presents on Christmas Day.'<br><br>Which brings us back to the question: Exactly how many broken hearts has she left in her wake?<br><br>Bai Ling giggled, before replying with the media savviness that she is so known for.<br><br>'I really can't remember. Why don't you ask me the next time you interview me?'<br><br>Three Extremes opens in cinemas on Sep 9.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>SEQUEL TO HORROR TRILOGY<br><br>THREE Extremes is a sequel to the 2002 horror trilogy Three.<br><br>It consists of three short movies by directors from Korea, Japan and Hong Kong.<br><br>Dumplings is the story of an ageing tai tai (Miriam Yeung) who wants to regain her youth and beauty, at any cost, in a bid to win back her straying husband.<br><br>The Korean movie, Cut, stars popular actor Lee Byung-Hun.<br><br>He plays a horror movie director who returns home after a shoot to find his wife being held hostage by a psychotic extra.<br><br>Box, directed by Japanese director Takashi Miike, stars actors Kyoko Hasegawa and Atsuro Watabe in a story about a popular female writer who hides dark secrets from her childhood.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Very wild in person, easy for her to get into character<br><br>THREE Extremes' director Fruit Chan doesn't mind his thunder being stolen by flamboyant actress Bai Ling.<br><br>The affable 45-year-old had joked at a press conference earlier that he won't be getting any media coverage for his movie, because all the limelight would be stolen by Bai Ling.<br><br>But during a phone conference with reporters last Friday, Fruit only laughed when reminded of his comment.<br><br>'There's actually no need for her to do publicity stunts, because she is already getting all the attention with her daring dressing.'<br><br>According to Fruit, both producer Peter Chan and himself had picked Bai Ling for the role because of her experience in Hollywood as well as her Chinese background.<br><br>He added: 'The character she plays is an immigrant from China.<br><br>'We didn't want to get an actress from Hong Kong because she won't be able to portray the idiosyncrasies of a Chinese native.'<br><br>The filmmakers even tailored the role to Bai Ling's personality in real life.<br><br>'She is very wild in person, so it was very easy for her to get into the character.<br><br>'And because she's so open, it was very easy to work with her,' he explained.<br><br>Fruit also had praises for his other leading lady, Miriam Yeung, who plays a tai tai trying to regain her beauty to win back her straying husband in the movie.<br><br>He said: 'She didn't know beforehand, what the movie was about.<br><br>'Miriam was keen to sign on, because it was a departure from her usual comedies.<br><br>'So she probably regretted it when she learnt about the disturbing nature of the movie.'<br><br>There was a scene where Miriam had to seduce her husband (played by Tony Leung Kar Fai), and Fruit had been worried that she might not be comfortable with it.<br><br>BRAVE<br><br>He said: 'A lot of singers are very conscious about their image, but Miriam was very brave.<br><br>'At first, we cleared the set for her, so that she would be more comfortable filming the scene.<br><br>'But after a while, she was so engrossed in her character that she didn't mind the crew of 30 looking on.'<br><br>Copyright Â© 2004 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
