In the magazine cover story, due out Friday, the Beverly Hills, 90210 alum reveals she learned of father Aaron Spelling's death last week as she dined in Toronto.<br><br>Her BlackBerry broke the bad news.<br><br>"A friend of mine had seen a TV report, and emailed me," Tori Spelling tells Us. "And I was just in total shock.<br><br>"My first thought was, I can't believe my mom didn't call me!"<br><br>Us Weekly's Website published excerpts of the interview on Wednesday, five days after Aaron Spelling died at his Los Angeles estate. The hit-making producer of 90210, Charlie's Angels and many, many more TV series was 83.<br><br>News of the rift, or as Tori Spelling says "the feud," are not new--they've been reported for months. But to Us, the actress breaks it down: She was on good terms with her legend father; her mother, not so much.<br><br>"My mom's behavior simply made me uncomfortable to be around my family," Tori Spelling says in the magazine.<br><br>Specifically, Tori Spelling is said to be unhappy that her mother, Candy, was spending time with a longtime family friend while her father's health deteriorated. Candy Spelling has denied a romance with the friend.<br><br>Tori Spelling tells the magazine she saw her father only once since last September--a Jun. 11 visit that came just seven days before Aaron Spelling suffered a stroke. He died later that week.<br><br>Although Tori Spelling's estrangement from her parents coincided with her split from first husband Charlie Shanian and her tabloid-tracked romance with actor Dean McDermott, whom she wed in May, the actress says "the feud" is unrelated to those events. And, she says, it's unrelated to her mother-mocking VH1 series, so noTORIous.<br><br>Tori Spelling says she last spoke with her father a couple of days before his death. His final words to her: "He said, 'I love you, babe.' "<br><br>The feud apparently was put on hold last Sunday, when Tori Spelling and McDermott were among those in attendance at a small, private service for the Hollywood clan's patriarch.<br><br>A larger service for Aaron Spelling's friends and colleagues has been set for September.<br><br></div>
