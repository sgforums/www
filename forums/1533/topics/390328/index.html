              <p>LOS ANGELES (AFP) - â€“ Michael Jackson's doctor will be charged in connection with the pop star's death next week, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office confirmed.</p>
              <p>A statement said unspecified charges would be filed on Monday followed by an arraignment. A law enforcement source speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed to AFP that Murray would be charged with involuntary manslaughter.</p>
              <p>The announcement followed days of speculation about the possibility of criminal charges being filed against Murray, the Houston-based physician who was with Jackson shortly before the pop icon died suddenly last June.</p>
              <p>Murray had initially been expected to surrender to custody on Friday ahead of a court hearing, but charges were delayed amid reports of a disagreement between prosecutors and the Los Angeles Police Department.</p>
              <p>Local prosecutors had been negotiating with defense lawyers for Murray to surrender voluntarily in the early hours of Friday, before appearing in court without handcuffs or shackles.</p>
              <p>Police were reportedly opposed to the plan, seeking to have Murray arrested, booked and handcuffed in plain view.</p>
              <p>Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck denied there was any conflict about the terms of the doctor's surrender or that the department was insisting on a "photo op" showing Murray in handcuffs.</p>
              <p>"We're not looking for that kind of photo op; that's not what we do," Beck said in an interview on KTLA television.</p>
              <p>Reports of Murray's looming manslaughter case followed a painstaking and prolonged police investigation.</p>
              <p>Under California law, involuntary manslaughter -- unintentionally causing death through negligence, carelessness or a misdemeanor -- is punishable by up to four years in prison.</p>
              <p>Murray, 56, has acknowledged that he administered the powerful anesthetic propofol to Jackson only after trying many other medications to help him sleep following the singer's "repeated demands/requests" for the drug.</p>
              <p>Propofol is a powerful anesthetic used to render patients unconscious before major surgery. Medical experts say it should only be used and administered by trained staff under hospital conditions.</p>
              <p>Unsealed court documents that included a review of toxicology results found that Jackson died from "lethal levels of propofol."</p>
