            <div class='col-md body'>The gents toilets are the last place you'd expect to find a princess who's fifth in line to the throne.<br><br>But that's exactly what happened when feisty Princess Beatrice was caught following her beleaguered boyfriend into the toilet to give him a right royal tongue-lashing.<br><br>The 19-year-old lambasted her man, Dave Clark, when she followed him into the gents at the launch party of the Virgin Galactic spaceship in New York.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_04/Beatrice4DM_468x668.jpg"><br><span class="small">Royal flush: Princess Beatrice, pictured with her Dave Clark in London last year, chased him into the men's bathroom</span><br><br>Clark, 25, is the head of astronaut relations on the project, and - in typical Richard Branson over-the-top fashion - all of the Virgin staff had their faces painted like Ziggy Stardust.<br><br>But towards the end of the night, Dave went to the bathroom to remove the glitter, which is when Bea charged in after him.<br><br>An onlooker said: Â“He felt a bit daft with the face paint on, so just wanted to wipe it off. But Bea thought it looked funny, and was demanding he keep it on.<br><br>"There were several men in the toilets, and they all couldn't believe it when she stormed in, screaming after her embarrassed boyfriend.<br><br>"The argument got quite heated, with Bea the more enthusiastic of the pair. She tried to get me involved in the argument, asking what I thought of the make-up.<br><br>"I was pretty terrified, and so was her boyfriend. She won in the end and he trudged out with his tail between his legs Â— glitter still all over his face."<br><br>The party was held at the American Museum of Natural History, and celebrated the launch of Virgin's ship that will take tourists into space.<br><br>Princess Bea has already put her deposit down for the Â£100,000 flight, as have Victoria Principal, Stephen Hawking and Trevor Beattie.<br><br><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=510154&amp;in_page_id=1773" rel="nofollow">source</a></div>
