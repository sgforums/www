              <p>So whats the purpose of sharing their experiences?</p>
              <p>So that others will not follow in their mistakes? singaporeans are not stupid. they don't need others to share their mistakes than they won't make the same mistake</p>

              <p>Probably to show the rest of Singapore that such cases do exist, and we should be on the look out for people like this and help them if we can.</p>

              <p>I watched the last few episodes and I ponder about the motive behind the production of this show. It appears to me that the program aims to achieve a higher viewership rather than helping those really in need of help.. Why ask them to appear on Tv and show them crying and portraying them as weakling? What's even worse is some of the messages sent out by this show. Like it is very common for woman to be physically abused by husband and the best solution is using DIVORCE to solve this problem.</p>
              <p>In the last episode, the host even asked the rape victim whether she had been having sex with her husband... On a LIVE program.. I don't understand the reason for asking this question...</p>
              <p>The donations also play a big part in encouraging those people to speak up. But is this something that we would like to encourage? If you are facing problems you should call up the press and media and ask them to highlight your problem so that all the donations will start coming in?</p>
              <p>Is it possible some ppl commited suicide by using atypical means such as jumping off MRT track so that the media would be interested in their case? They hope that through sacrificing their lifes maybe the family can get sth back in return??  </p>

              <p>I have the same thinking as straightstick.</p>
              <p>At least the previous shows whereby they go to poor families to help them renovate their house etc I can understand as it directly helps these poor people.</p>
              <p>But for this show life navigator its more like trying to get people to pity them and than donate money to them.</p>
              <p>And we can't even verify if the stories are true anot. For all you know they cook up some story to make p[eople pity them and donate to them</p>

              <p>some of the cases i felt very weird. anyone rmb the first case on show? i was watching then this woman talked about how pityful her life is blah blah, the fact that she's with 3 men(is it 3?) before and even have babies with them made me think that she's kind of éš�ä¾¿ ?</p>
              <p>and it's weird that without knowing her boyfriends' backgrounds and all and she just married them or have babies with them. what was she thinking? it made me wonder what's her highest education level?</p>
              <p>then she keep on saying it's bcos her dad dont like her and she want quickly go out of the house etc -.-</p>
              <p>and after her failed marriages with the first or second guy she still dare to fall in love with a 3rd? and did she have the 3rd's baby ? I cant rmb.</p>
              <p>it's like so weird la.</p>
              <p>as for the 3rd and latest case she say she got raped, okay this one is really sad.</p>
              <p>then after the people went for this program, how will mediacorp help them to improve?</p>

              <p>This show is really stupid. It brings some unfortunate people to the show, highlight their problems, and does nothing to help, expose their privacy, hope for some donation.</p>
              <p>If it does well, mediacorp celebrates the viewership and brings a few pple on stage in the stupid annual prize giving hong xing da jiang.Everything they do is for viewership.</p>
