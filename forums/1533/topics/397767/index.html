              <div class="content">
              <p>Following the departure of Fiona Xie, Dawn
                  Yeoh, and Jesseca Liu, Caldecott Hill's seven princesses are now
                  whittled down to a mere four: Jeanette Aw, Felicia Chin, Joanne Peh,
                  and Rui En.</p>
              <p>At last night's Star Awards 2010 Show 2 held in
                  Resorts World Singapore, Felicia Chin hinted at the possibility of
                  being next-to-go in her Top 10 Most Popular Female Artiste award
                  acceptance speech when she said, "This might be my last time standing
                  on this stage."</p>
              <p>In an interview with xinmsn, the 26-year-old
                  actress professed her nervousness and happiness in winning this award.
                  She felt particularly touched with this win because "I have not been
                  appearing on local TV screens in Singapore for a long time."</p>
              <p>"I
                  was told that my name was on the Top 10 Most Popular Female Artiste
                  listings for the past 9 weeks and I am really grateful for this," she
                  honestly quipped.</p>
              <p>Decked out in a colourful ensemble from
                  Indian designer, Manish Arora, Felicia played coy when asked about her
                  mysterious hint onstage saying, "it is hard to predict what will happen
                  in future."</p>
              <p>Currently filming an upcoming sports drama series,
                  No Limits, with Elvin Ng and Dai Yangtian, she likened the award as "a
                  very good present" and repeatedly expressed her thanks and joy.</p>
              <p>When
                  asked if she plans to leave the entertainment industry and return to
                  school -- as she previously mentioned in interviews, Felicia said
                  nothing and merely confessed that her mother "hopes for me to finish my
                  studies."</p>
              <p>"I personally hope to complete my father and
                  mother's tiny dream. I personally feel that studying is a really great
                  thing to do. It's like taking one step forward. It's not convenient for
                  me to reveal my contract details, but there might be some minor changes
                  this year.</p>
              <p>"Time will tell," the enigmatic one concluded.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"An entertainer never really leaves the entertainment business."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">With that, the winner for this year's Favourite Male Character summed up the mass exodus happening on Caldecott Hill, and reassured his fans that would be the case with him too.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Nat Ho will leave his current employer MediaCorp after his contract ends in June, joining a growing list of departing or departed artistes that include Jesseca Liu, Dawn Yeoh, Adrian Pang, Charlyn Lin, Peixuan, Jeff Wang and Fiona Xie.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But the good-looking lad tells xinmsn in an exclusive interview he'll still be around, as he pursues his "real passion" - music.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"There is a lot of stuff I want to try while I'm still young. Because of my age, I think it's the right time to leave. You know, I'm old enough, yet not too old to try other things," he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"I've an itch for singing! If I never try I'll regret it!"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Nat previously mentioned that his original intentions in signing on to MediaCorp four years ago were "to build [his] foundations and to network," which he has achieved.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The former Singapore Idol contestant will take a diploma in audio engineering "to familiarize [himself] with the ins and outs of music production," and will also venture into F&amp;B business with a cousin.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Is there no way to juggle the many hats?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Nat feels that something has got to give, but conceded that the latest contract offer by the company played a major part in his decision.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">xinmsn understands the two-year extension doesn't include a pay rise for the rising star.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"It's always a combination of factors. There were pull factors already, and then that contract came...," the 25-year-old stopped, without elaborating.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Nat first thought of leaving two years ago, but stayed on to support his family. This time, it took him a few months of consideration.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">That also meant he had already made the decision when he was voted Favourite Male Character at Star Awards 2010, leaving the mass communication diploma holder in a dizzy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"You saw I was quite emotional [when my name was announced]. There were a lot of things going through my mind. It's a really strange, heart-aching feeling, to give me this when I'm leaving."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But no, he doesn't see it as "coming too late," as reported by other local media.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"It's more a nice farewell gift."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The actor was at the press conference of his last drama serial, With You, when he broke the news. He admitted that he hadn't intended for it to be so soon, but the media event's mood caused the confession.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">At the press conference, soon-to-leave thespian Adrian Pang pleaded for "good scripts, roles, dialogue and opportunities" for local actors so that "talent won't go to waste."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">His co-stars Chen Hanwei, Chen Shucheng and May Phua followed the lead and poured their hearts out on the matter, quoting a generation of skilled artisans lost - Huang Biren, Ivy Lee, Jacelyn Tay, Phyllis Quek, Carole Lin, Joey Swee, Florence Tan and Huang Yiliang.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Other than the wage packet and his desire to explore other interests, is Nat leaving due to limited opportunities in MediaCorp?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"To be very frank, no. I never wanted to be an actor. All this came as a bonus.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Anyway, even if there's a pay rise I may still leave," he quipped.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Since the Anglo-Chinese School alum has made the decision, what will he miss the most?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"My friends here.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"People say in the entertainment circles everyone is more like colleagues, but I really consider them friends. Many of them are so warm even though we don't really know each other," he said earnestly, adding that his best friends are Elvin Ng and Felicia Chin, who herself revealed on Labour Day she'd return to her books in a few months' time if a local or overseas business school accepts her application.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In With You, Nat plays younger brother to Hanwei, a role he considers his "most challenging to date," because the ghost of his dead brother will later possess him, requiring the pretty face to 'become' Hanwei's character.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"It was hard, especially because [the ghost] is much older than me, and has a wife and kid."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Acting with the two screen kings of Hanwei and Adrian must have ensured a steep learning curve.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Channel 8 dramas are less subtle so Adrian brings something different with his background in theatre and Channel 5. The energy he gives off is also very comfortable.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Hanwei is much more technical and I learnt those aspects from him. Plus he's really passionate about what he does."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The drama will, however, not be the actor's only appearance in the coming weeks. He is doing a three-peat returning as presenter on Channel 5's National Science Challenge 2010.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">According to him, fans can see a "wackier" Nat Ho. The schools game show has also been extended to an hour long.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Finally, what does the idol want to say to his notoriously adoring fans, before we next hear from him?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Don't be sad. I'm not retiring! I hope they can continue to support whatever I do. Wo zai ni zuo you (the Chinese title for With You, literally 'I am around you')!"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">With You debuts 12 May, 9pm on Channel 8.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">"An entertainer never really leaves the entertainment
              business."</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">With that, the winner for this year's Favourite Male Character
              summed up the mass exodus happening on Caldecott Hill, and
              reassured his fans that would be the case with him too.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Nat Ho will leave his current employer MediaCorp after his contract
              ends in June, joining a growing list of departing or departed
              artistes that include Jesseca Liu, Dawn Yeoh, Adrian Pang, Charlyn
              Lin, Peixuan, Jeff Wang and Fiona Xie.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">But the good-looking lad tells xinmsn in an exclusive interview
              he'll still be around, as he pursues his "real passion" -
              music.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">"There is a lot of stuff I want to try while I'm still young.
              Because of my age, I think it's the right time to leave. You know,
              I'm old enough, yet not too old to try other things," he said.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">"I've an itch for singing! If I never try I'll regret it!"</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Nat previously mentioned that his original intentions in signing on
              to MediaCorp four years ago were "to build [his] foundations and to
              network," which he has achieved.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The former Singapore Idol contestant will take a diploma in audio
              engineering "to familiarize [himself] with the ins and outs of
              music production," and will also venture into F&amp;B business with
              a cousin.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Is there no way to juggle the many hats?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Nat feels that something has got to give, but conceded that the
              latest contract offer by the company played a major part in his
              decision.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">xinmsn understands the two-year extension doesn't include a pay
              rise for the rising star.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">"It's always a combination of factors. There were pull factors
              already, and then that contract came...," the 25-year-old stopped,
              without elaborating.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Nat first thought of leaving two years ago, but stayed on to
              support his family. This time, it took him a few months of
              consideration.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">That also meant he had already made the decision when he was voted
              Favourite Male Character at Star Awards 2010, leaving the mass
              communication diploma holder in a dizzy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">"You saw I was quite emotional [when my name was announced]. There
              were a lot of things going through my mind. It's a really strange,
              heart-aching feeling, to give me this when I'm leaving."</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">But no, he doesn't see it as "coming too late," as reported by
              other local media.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">"It's more a nice farewell gift."</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The actor was at the press conference of his last drama serial,
              With You, when he broke the news. He admitted that he hadn't
              intended for it to be so soon, but the media event's mood caused
              the confession.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">At the press conference, soon-to-leave thespian Adrian Pang pleaded
              for "good scripts, roles, dialogue and opportunities" for local
              actors so that "talent won't go to waste."</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">His co-stars Chen Hanwei, Chen Shucheng and May Phua followed the
              lead and poured their hearts out on the matter, quoting a
              generation of skilled artisans lost - Huang Biren, Ivy Lee, Jacelyn
              Tay, Phyllis Quek, Carole Lin, Joey Swee, Florence Tan and Huang
              Yiliang.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Other than the wage packet and his desire to explore other
              interests, is Nat leaving due to limited opportunities in
              MediaCorp?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">"To be very frank, no. I never wanted to be an actor. All this came
              as a bonus.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">"Anyway, even if there's a pay rise I may still leave," he
              quipped.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Since the Anglo-Chinese School alum has made the decision, what
              will he miss the most?</p>

              <p>After first appearing on our screens in 2007, the rising star has finally signed on to MediaCorp as a full-time artiste.</p>
              <p>The

              performance in Ch 8's anniversary megadrama Together as the physically
              frail yet mature-beyond-her-years Huimin.</p>
              <p>In an exclusive
              interview with xinmsn, Zhou Ying said she decided to put pen to paper
              for a two-year stint because she likes Singapore, its comfortable
              working environment, and knows that a lot of people want to see more of
              her.</p>
              <p>She took part in Star Search 2007 as one of Shanghai's
              representatives, before appearing in 2009's ping-pong drama Table of
              Glory. She is currently filming a new cop drama Unriddle, in which she
              plays a former delinquent who has abused drugs, a role that's a
              180-degree change from Huimin.</p>
              <p>But before fans can catch her
              in that, Zhou Ying will first be seen next month trying her hand at
              hosting in the variety travel show Lodge With Me.</p>
              <p>"Variety is much more intense and tiring, but I enjoyed it a lot. Every day was fruitful," she beamed.</p>
              <p>The
              petite one revealed that as the only child, her parents pampered her so
              much that she should learn to be independent now, which is why they're
              supportive of her move.</p>
              <p>Did she cry when she left her hometown?</p>
              <p>She
              laughed, "Yes, while on the phone with mum on the plane. The air
              steward wanted to stop me but hesitated when he saw me tearing!"</p>
              <p>As
              Zhou Ying only inked the deal recently, former housemate Dai Yangtian
              lamented at her lost opportunity of being nominated for Best Newcomer
              (closed this year due to lack of nominees) at this Sunday's Star Awards.</p>
              <p>To that, the optimistic 25-year-old said, "Maybe I'll still be eligible next year!"</p>
