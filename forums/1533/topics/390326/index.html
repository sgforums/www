              <p>With 'are-they-or-aren't-they' rumours still floating about his relationship with fellow actress Bernice Liu, Hong Kong TVB actor Moses Chan has fallen in love with another actress, Charmaine Sheh, the Hong Kong media reported.</p>
              <p>Neither Moses nor Bernice has ever publicly confirmed their relationship, but the pair are said to have started dating each other in 2005 after working together on a drama series. The alleged romance went downhill after Bernice had a falling out with TVB station when she decided to strike it out on her own in Hollywood.</p>
              <p>With both Moses and Charmaine apparently single and having collaborated with each other on three consecutive dramas over the past two years, the Hong Kong media reported that feelings developed between the two over time. Currently filming Arrival of Princess, they were spotted flirting with each other through short fleeting glances.</p>
              <p>Unhappy with Moses's rumoured shift in love interest, Bernice's father was said to have confronted the actor at the TV station, which Moses refuted. "The report is totally nonsensical. It is best not to involve people's fathers. Bernice's father is not from the industry, it is not nice to treat him this way."</p>
              <p>The 39-year-old expressed that he and Bernice "are still good friends" and commented on his reported feelings for Charmaine, "What feelings?! Kevin Cheng is just next door." He clarified that he shares his coffee with everyone, not only Charmaine. The actress herself has dodged numerous rumours linking her and actor Kevin Cheng.</p>
              <p>Despite Moses' clarifications, Bernice appeared unhappy and said, "I really wish him happiness and for lovers to have a happy ending."</p>
              <p>The Canadian-born former beauty queen said she "has no intention to give Moses a Valentine's Day present" and that "rarely meets him". She also said that she is not bothered by Moses being around Charmaine's company and reiterated that "we have always been friends".</p>
