              <p>They are only six and 12, but together, Chua Jin Sen and Chua Jin Chou have amassed a following of over 16,000 fans on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Drjiajia">Facebook </a>and 10,000 subscribers on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/liangjiasun?feature=watch">their YouTube channel</a>.</p>
              <p>Better known as Dr Jiajia and Big Brother, these two boys are the 
              stars of a series of "Singlish" videos that have gone viral here, 
              amassing over 3.6 million views for their hilarious take on Singapore's 
              unofficial national language.</p>
              <p>Their videos have attracted so much attention that Dr Jiajia's crinkly-eyed smiling face has now become synonymous with the <a href="http://www.das.org.sg/">Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS)</a>, and his signature "<em>Kee Chiew</em>!" (Raise your hand) move has become a talking point on forums and on the streets here.</p>
              <p>Now, Dr Jiajia is on his way to becoming a bona fide local movie star.</p>
              <p>Speaking to Yahoo! Singapore from their home in the East of Singapore
               yesterday, Dr Jiajia's parents revealed that their son will be acting 
              in an upcoming local movie as the cheeky son of a taxi-driver "<em>Ah Beng</em>", popular slang for Singapore-Chinese ruffian.</p>
              <p>"We decided to allow Jiajia to participate in this movie because they
               were willing to accomodate his schoolwork schedule and they were also 
              very sincere in their approach." said Jiajia's home-maker mother, who 
              wanted to be known only as Mrs Chua.</p>
              <p>At the moment, a confidentiality agreement prevents his parents from 
              disclosing the name of the company he will be working with but Mr Chua 
              was able to say that it was "not Jack Neo", but a smaller production 
              company.</p>
              <p>The family has also been approached by Member of Parliament Tin Pei  
              Ling, management companies, musical production units, and the team 
              behind this year's National Day Parade.</p>
              <p>In person, Dr Jiajia and Big Brother are tinier than this reporter 
              imagined them to be, but despite the interview being late in the 
              evening, were balls of energy, twisting their faces into all manner of 
              expressions and jumping in with candid replies to questions, much to 
              their parents' amused exasperation.</p>
              <p>Mr and Mrs Chua have two other younger daughters who make occasional 
              guest appearances in the videos, which are directed, scripted, and 
              edited by Mr Chua.</p>
              <p>So how has this sudden rise to fame affected the close-knit Buddhist and vegetarian family and how are they dealing with it?</p>
              <p><strong>On getting started ..</strong></p>
              <p>"Funnily, it started with us filming a video for my school project on
               speaking good english two years ago... we decided to make one on 
              Singlish and uploaded it, it got quite a lot of hits, and then we filmed
               Singlish Minister, and.. <em>boom</em>!" said Big Brother, waving his hands.</p>
              <p>"These videos help them develop their innovation and creativity, 
              something we feel the education system lacks. Its training they will 
              never get in school." said their father, who works in the IT industry.</p>
              <p>Each video is scripted by Mr Chua and Big Brother, and takes them only about an hour to film in their living room at home.</p>
              <p>Their "Singlish Minister" (below), is their most popular video to 
              date, chalking up almost 600,000 hits since it was uploaded in March.  
              It rode on the wave of frustrations from the SMRT train breakdowns, and 
              was shared thousands of times on Facebook.</p>
              <p><strong>On fans and detractors ... </strong></p>
              <p>Mrs Chua says that at least 95 per cent of the feedback they get are 
              positive and encouraging, but they have also received a fair share of 
              criticism.</p>
              <p>"They say things like, how can you teach your kids to speak Singlish,
               what kind of parents are you?" said Big Brother, "They say that 
              Singlish is the reason why we are not doing well in school."</p>
              <p>"I guess they don't know that we speak mostly Mandarin at home, 
              Singlish is just for the videos. Also, Big Brother does pretty well in 
              school. For Jiajia, he is dyslexic, and he is already doing very well 
              considering." said Mrs Chua.</p>
              <p>She added that when Jiajia received his last report card, he called 
              back saying he had "got two wrong only" and it turned out that he had 
              failed two out of his three subjects, but they were still very happy.</p>
              <p>"He passed his Mandarin, and that's already very encouraging. He has 
              abacus, taekwondo, piano, reading lessons, he already works so hard, how
               can we push him more?" said Mr Chua, "So we don't let it affect us."</p>
              <p>Most of the time, however, they get comments from fans saying that 
              their videos have brightened their days, helped them cope with stress 
              and kill their Monday blues.</p>

              <p><strong><br> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Has fame changed them? </strong></p>
              <p>"They say I cannot scold them in public anymore." joked Mrs Chua, who
               added that the pair get recognised so often by neighbours and strangers
               that they cannot discipline the active boys if they misbehave.</p>
              <p>On their recent trip to Taipei, Taiwan, they were recognised by 5 
              different groups of Singaporean tourists in Taoyuan airport, who came up
               to ask to take a photo with them.</p>
              <p>"They will exclaim, hey, its Dr Jiajia! Or, our neighbours will say, is that the newspaper boy." said Big Brother.</p>
              <p>Big Brother also prefers to leave the cheeky grins and antics to his 
              younger sibling, as he doesn't want to look foolish in front of his 
              friends.</p>
              <p>As for Jiajia, his parents say he remains very much just a little boy
               with an extremely over-active imagination and who loves eating 
              vegetarian hot dogs.</p>
              <p>In his spare time, he plays with his Lego bricks or has sword fights,
               talking to himself and pretending to be a superhero fighting invisible 
              monsters with his younger sister, affectionately nicknamed "Hello 
              Kitty".</p>
              <p>Their parents also keep them grounded by getting them involved in 
              charity work. All of their red packet money from Chinese New Year every 
              year goes to supporting a Mongolian child that they decided to sponsor a
               year ago.</p>
              <p>They are also collaborating with DAS to raise funds through the sale 
              of a red National Day Parade shirt with seven designs. Click <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.347255358676756.76057.292917917443834&amp;#38;type=3">here</a> to find out more.</p>
              <p><strong>What do they want to be when they grow up?</strong></p>
              <p>When asked who was his idol by his mother, Jiajia immediately patted 
              her hand and said "You, mummy!" but later grabbed his elder brother and 
              said in Mandarin "Of course, my Kor kor, <em>lah!</em>"</p>
              <p>In turn, Big Brother considers his father to be his role model.</p>
              <p>And what does Jiajia want to be when he grows up?</p>
              <p>"I want to be a doctor, and then, a PM (Prime Minister)!" he said</p>
              <p>But wouldn't that be a lot of work and stress?</p>
              <p>"Oh, I mean MP (Member of Parliament)!!" he quips back.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>"Because I want to <em>kee chiew</em>!!"</p>
