She reportedly refused to fasten her seat belt in the rear of the taxi in compliance with a rear seat belt law that went into effect the day before and an argument ensued. Tomoyori later allegedly assaulted and seriously injured the driver. <br><br>Recent video footage allegedly shows Makiyo participated in the attack. <br><br>Meanwhile, more than 20 taxi drivers from the Taipei Taxi Drivers' Association staged a protest outside the Interchange Association, Japan's representative office in Taiwan, on Friday. They held banners that said "Find the Truth" and "Violent Japanese Drinkers Not Welcome in Taiwan." <br><br>Although Lin's case was an isolated incident, Japan's association should say something about a Japanese national beating up a Taiwanese person in his own country, said Cheng Chuan-yi, an executive committee member of the taxi drivers' association. <br><br>He added that an apology from the association would be enough to calm things down and prevent the issue from escalating. <br><br>A representative from the Japanese association received the taxi drivers' letter of protest, but offered no comment on the incident. <br><br>(By Huang Yi-ha</span><a style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 20px;" href="http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&amp;ID=201202100029">http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&amp;ID=201202100029</a>

              <h1>Prosecutors demand 4-year prison sentence for Makiyo</h1>
              <p>TAIWAN - The Taipei Prosecutors Office is seeking a 4 year prison 
              term for entertainer Makiyo under aggravated assault charges, yesterday 
              evening, while continuing the investigation over whether the police had 
              intentionally covered up the video footage that revealed Makiyo kicking a
               taxi driver, which functioned as a key piece of evidence in the assault
               case, yesterday.</p>
              <p>The Taipei Prosecutors Office said yesterday that it is currently 
              determining whether the Taipei Xinyi District Police Office had 
              intentionally delayed turning in the crucial video footage taken by a 
              taxi driver, surnamed Chiang, who was a witness of the entire incident.</p>
              <p><strong>Police Under Fire</strong></p>
              <p>The police may be charged with offenses of destroying criminal 
              evidence and potentially of disclosing evidence to the media, it said.</p>
              <p>The video footage recorded by the onboard camera in Chiang's cab 
              seems to reveal that Makiyo in fact had joined her Japanese friend 
              Takateru Tomoyori in attacking a taxi driver, surnamed Lin, contrary to 
              her previous claims of merely watching as the dispute developed and 
              worsened.</p>
              <p>Chiang had originally handed the footage to a police officer from the
               Sanmin Branch of the Songshan District Police Office on Feb. 2, who 
              then passed it to another officer from the Shenchangli Police Station of
               the Xinyi District.</p>
              <p>The Xinyi officers had trouble reading the disc, and, figuring that 
              it must be a spare copy of footage provided by another taxi driver, 
              surnamed Yang, they never paid attention to the video until nearly one 
              week later, when local media visited the police station upon receiving a
               complaint from Chiang claiming the police had not properly handled the 
              evidence.</p>
              <p>The Xinyi District Police Office had apologized for its negligence on
               Feb. 9, and the Taipei City Police Department (TCPD) had issued 
              punishments for the Shengchangli police officers around midnight the 
              same day.</p>
              <p><strong>President Ma Concerned </strong></p>
              <p>President Ma Ying-jeou had personally contacted National Police 
              Agency (NPA) Director-General Wang Cho-chiun at around noon to inquire 
              about the Xinyi District Police Office's negligence in handling the 
              case, Presidential Office Spokesperson Fan Chiang Tai-chi said 
              yesterday.</p>
              <p>After Wang reported to Ma the punishments handed out to the police 
              officers, the president instructed that the police should learn their 
              lesson in properly handling evidence and also to lawfully unravel the 
              truth behind the case.</p>
              <p>Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin also instructed the TPCD to thoroughly
               investigate the mistakes the police officers had made in the process of
               passing on the evidence and leaving it unattended, asking for the 
              police officers involved to be harshly punished.</p>
              <p><strong>Makiyo Charged </strong></p>
              <p>With the video footage provided by Chiang as well as other audio 
              recordings of the incident provided by local convenience stores, which 
              clearly recorded Makiyo goading Tomoyori into beating Lin harder, the 
              Taipei Prosecutors Office officially indicted the two on aggravated 
              assault charges, with prosecutors seeking 4 years for Makiyo and 6 years
               for Tomoyori.</p>
              <p>Yaz and Vanessa, the local starlets who had accompanied the two 
              during the attack and had allegedly committed perjury by denying the 
              fact that Makiyo had kicked the victim, will be indicted separately, the
               Taipei Prosecutors Office said.</p>
              <p><strong>Cab Drivers Furious </strong></p>
              <p>In addition to stirring up waves of anti-Makiyo sentiment, the 
              incident of Makiyo and her Japanese friend over the attack on a taxi 
              driver has also fueled outrage among taxi drivers in Taiwan.</p>
              <p>In terms of the Japan Interchange Association (JIA) in Taipei only 
              expressing concern for the legal aspect of how Tomoyori is handled and 
              not paying attention to whether the taxi driver Tomoyori had beaten was 
              recovering in the hospital intensive care unit, "This is too much!" the 
              local taxi driver association claimed.</p>
              <p>Of the 80,000 taxies in Taiwan, 60,000 of them operate in Taipei, the
               association said, pointing out that the great number of taxi drivers 
              has made driving taxi in Taipei a very difficult way to make a living; 
              with an average hourly wage of NT$72, a taxi driver has to work for 12 
              hours a day to support his family.</p>
              <p>Lin had been working so diligently, yet the JIA had paid no attention
               at all to his livelihood, the association protested, asking the JIA to 
              solemnly apologize over the incident, and requesting the Taiwan 
              government pay taxi drivers the proper respect they deserve.</p>
              <p><strong>Injured Driver Forgives Makiyo </strong></p>
              <p>While the taxi driver association and the general public raged on the
               offenders' repeated dishonest behavior, Lin, the driver allegedly 
              seriously injured by Makiyo and Tomoyori, thought otherwise.</p>
              <p>"If Makiyo and her friends admit to their misbehaviors and tell the 
              truth, I am willing to forgive them," Lin's lawyer quoted his client as 
              saying yesterday, astonishing the public.</p>
              <p>??The incident had begun with a misunderstanding, Lin was quoted to 
              have said. Paraphrasing what Lin had revealed to him, the lawyer said 
              Makiyo had made sudden and big gestures from the backseat of the cab to 
              stop Vanessa, sitting next to Lin, from paying the taxi fee.</p>
              <p>Makiyo's motions had startled Lin, who reflexively made a blocking 
              gesture, and might have accidentally had physical contact with Makiyo. 
              Tomoyori and Yaz had already gotten out of the cab at this point and had
               not witnessed these exchanges, Lin said.</p>
              <p>Upon getting out of the taxi, Makiyo had kicked the vehicle; Lin told
               her off and started calling the police. Makiyo and Tomoyori conversed 
              in Japanese, and the Japanese man began beating him, Lin recalled. He 
              remembered that a female had also kicked him.</p>
              <p>Despite being seriously injured, Lin asserted that it is the attitude
               after making a mistake that is important. Life carries on after big 
              mistakes; face the mistakes and do not lie, and I will forgive them, Lin
               was quoted as saying.</p>
              <p>=========</p>
              <p>from the 3rd last paragraph its true makiyo did not lie about the taxi driver 'touching' her.  though its allegedly accidental.</p>

              <div class="submitted" style="padding-right: 14px; font-size: 12px; display: inline; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; line-height: 17px;">TAIPEI, February 10, 2012 (AFP) - A group of angry Taiwan taxi drivers protested on Friday to demand an apology after two Japanese -- including a female singer-actress -- were accused of badly beating up a cab driver.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; line-height: 17px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"We demand truth, we demand dignity, we demand an apology," dozens of demonstrators shouted as they rallied at Japan's de facto embassy in Taipei while delivering a protest letter to a representative for the Japanese side.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; line-height: 17px;">Taiwan used to be a Japanese colony and there are concerns the case could stir anti-Japanese sentiment.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; line-height: 17px;">Makiyo, who is known by the one name and is based in Taiwan, and a man have been questioned for allegedly attacking a taxi driver who demanded they wear seat belts.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; line-height: 17px;">She told reporters after the February 2 incident that she did not assault the driver and that her male companion was defending her after the driver touched her chest during an argument.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; line-height: 17px;">However, Makiyo came under fire after surveillance video footage appeared to show that she joined in the assault and seemed to have encouraged her friend to beat the driver.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; line-height: 17px;">The driver remains hospitalised for severe injuries to his head and has two broken ribs, according to his doctors.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; line-height: 17px;">Makiyo and the Japanese man, identified as Takateru Tomoyori, were named defendants in the assault case while two Taiwanese women who were also in the cab were accused of perjury for allegedly trying to cover up for her.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; line-height: 17px;">Taiwan was a Japanese colony until 1945 and has maintained close trade and cultural ties with Japan, although Tokyo formally recognises Beijing over Taipei.</p>

He said he hopes to deliver the money to the driver in person. <br><br>Yoshida said many Japanese feel angry about the criminal act and the attitude after the attack of the alleged offender Takateru Tomoyori, because he only tried to defend his brutal assault rather than apologizing in the first place. <br><br>Tomoyori's attempt to take all the responsibility for Makiyo and two other women allegedly involved in the case in recent days was also not a responsible way to handle the matter, Yoshida said. <br><br>Although the injured driver's condition has improved, Yoshida went on, Tomoyori and Makiyo should think about how to show their sincere remorse and help with the driver's medical care. <br><br>When asked about the controversial media coverage since the assault took place Feb. 2, Yoshida said the intense pursuit by the press helped reveal the truth about the incident, since Makiyo and Tomoyori did not give honest accounts until the true nature of the attack was exposed. <br><br>Makiyo and Tomoyori were indicted for "inflicting serious bodily harm" by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office Feb. 10. <br><br>(By Johnson Sun, Lee Hsiang-chun and Kay Liu)</span></td>

              No jail for Makiyo
              
              TAIPEI: Neither Taiwan singer-actress Makiyo nor her male Japanese friend Takateru Tomoyori will be going to jail for their attack on 55-year-old cabby Lin Yu Jun in February, reported Taiwan media.
              
              The judge presiding over the pair's cabby assault case took into account the prosecution's recommendation for probation, and on Thursday sentenced Makiyo to ten months in jail with three year's probation.
              
              Tomoyori was sentenced to one year in jail with four year's probation.
              
              This means as long as they stay out of trouble for the next few years, Makiyo and Tomoyori won't have to see the insides of a jail cell.
              
              The judge also found that the charges against the two had to be amended from causing grievous hurt to causing hurt, as their attack on Lin did not result in him suffering from any permanent injuries, and he is recovering well from the incident.
              
              Makiyo and Tomoyori had previously agreed to settle the case with Lin by paying him NT$3 million (S$128,000).
              
              In light of the settlement, prosecutors revised the penalties they sought for Makiyo and Tomoyori, and recommended that their sentences be commuted to probation.
