              <p>Zeta-Jones 'furious' at late cancer diagnosis for Douglas<br><span class="update">Posted: 03 September 2010 0830 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span class="update"><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpxae8Ki.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="267"></span></p>
              <p><span class="update">LOS ANGELES : Actress Catherine Zeta-Jones is "furious" that doctors failed to diagnose her Hollywood veteran husband Michael Douglas' throat cancer earlier, she said in an interview published Thursday. </span></p>
              <p><span class="update">But Douglas himself, who this week revealed that his cancer was more advanced than previously thought, vowed to overcome the disease, telling People magazine: "I'll beat this." </span></p>
              <p><span class="update">Douglas, 65, only recently revealed his diagnosis when he returned to the United States from a family holiday. This week he said it was a stage four cancer, but that he had an 80 per cent chance of beating it. </span></p>
              <p><span class="update">But Welsh actress Zeta-Jones, who married Douglas in 2000, voiced anger that his chances of beating the cancer are reduced because it was only diagnosed three weeks ago. </span></p>
              <p><span class="update">He had spent months seeking a cause for persistent throat and ear pain, before a walnut-sized tumour was discovered on the base of his tongue in early August, the couple said. </span></p>
              <p><span class="update">"He sought every option and nothing was found. I knew something was up. He knew something was up," Zeta-Jones told the US weekly, adding: "It makes me furious they didn't detect it earlier." </span></p>
              <p><span class="update">Douglas was more philosophical about how soon he was diagnosed, saying: "Without having to blame anybody... these things sometimes just don't show up." </span></p>
              <p><span class="update">And he was upbeat about his chances of overcoming it. "I'm treating this as a curable disease," he said. "It's a fight. I'll beat this." </span></p>
              <p><span class="update">Douglas is a pillar of Hollywood, having starred in more than 40 films, including such hits as "Fatal Attraction" (1988), "Wall Street" (1988), "War of the Roses" (1990), "Basic Instinct" (1992) and "Traffic" (2001). </span></p>
              <p><span class="update">Douglas's latest film, the sequel to the 1987 box office hit "Wall Street" called "The Money Never Sleeps," directed by Oliver Stone, is due to hit movie theaters in the United States later this month. </span></p>
              <p><span class="update">Douglas has a son from an earlier marriage, Cameron Douglas, who was sentenced in April to five years in prison for drug-trafficking. </span></p>
