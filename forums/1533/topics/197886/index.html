Prosecutors portrayed him as a sexual predator, while Jackson's lawyers insisted that he was the victim of an elaborate extortion bid by the mother of his young accuser.<br><br>The singer left his Neverland ranch near Santa Barbara in California which has now been virtually closed down. The zoo and funfair on the ranch have been mothballed and most of the staff paid off.<br><br>Bain said that as part of his financial revamp, Jackson had decided to sever ties with his business managers, Bernstein, Fox, Whitman, Goldman and Sloan, and also his Bahrain-based attorneys Qays Zu'bi and Grahame Nelson.<br><br>The spokeswoman said the singer has established The Michael Jackson Company, Inc., and plans to phase out MJJ Productions, which has dealt with most of his public affairs. Bain said that she would be general manager of the new company.<br><br>According to the spokeswoman, a New York business restructuring firm, L. Londell McMillan and The McMillan Firm, would handle legal matters in connection with his business dealings.<br><br>Jackson announced a deal in April to restructure his debts, estimated at 270 million dollars.<br><br>The financing agreement was made with the help of Sony Corporation of America. Jackson and Sony are co-owners of Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which has the rights to thousands of songs, including 251 songs by the Beatles and other major hits such as Bob Dylan's "Blowin' In the Wind".<br><br>The Los Angeles Times newspaper said that under the 325 million-dollar refinancing, Jackson would have to sell half of his 50 per cent stake in the publishing concern over the next few years to Sony Corp.
