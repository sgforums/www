              <p>Zoe Tay gives birth to third son<br>By Han Wei Chou | Posted: 06 October 2010 2210 hrs</p>
              <p> <img src="http://www.incinemas.sg/InCinemasImage/newspost/Press%20Con/Love%20Cuts%20-%2028%20July/MLoveCuts280710-000.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="412"><br>  </p>
              <p><br>SINGAPORE: MediaCorp actress Zoe Tay has given birth to her third son. The child arrived Wednesday via Caesarean section at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital.</p>
              <p>The couple already have two sons Brayden, five, and Ashton, three.</p>
              <p>According to veteran actress Pan Ling Ling, who accompanied Tay throughout the birth, Tay's third son was born under exceptional circumstances.</p>
              <p>Pan said Tay was taken by surprise when she experienced some bleeding at 9am Wednesday due to a blood clot.</p>
              <p>On hearing the news, Tay's husband, Republic of Singapore Air Force pilot Philip Chionh, rushed home to send his wife to hospital.</p>
              <p>After consulting the doctor, it was found that the Tay's situation required delivery by Caesarean section. Chionh made the decision on the spot to have the operation.</p>
              <p>The baby</p>
              <p>The Queen of Caldecott's bundle of joy arrived some time around noon, weighing in at 2.96 kilogrammes.</p>
              <p>"The baby looks like a mixture of his two older brothers," gushed Pan in a phone interview with channelnewsasia.com. "He is really cute!"</p>
              <p>"When the newborn was wheeled into the room, his older brothers were also very happy and squealed 'My younger brother! My younger brother!' and touched him."</p>
              <p>Due to the sudden arrival of the baby some three weeks earlier than expected), the newborn has not yet been named.</p>
              <p><br>"She (Tay) could not rest earlier because she opted for partial anaesthesia so she could witness the birth of her child," explained Pan.</p>
              <p>"At first, she was quite worried as this is her first Caesarean section. But after she came out [of the operating room], she said she was very happy to see that the baby is healthy."</p>
              <p>Tay, 42, who is still recovering, had asked Pan to speak on her behalf.</p>
