              <p>29-year-old singer-actress <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=foyce+le&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Foyce Le</span></a>, better known as one of the women involved in the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=jack+neo+scandal&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Jack Neo scandal</span></a>, is making headlines again.</p>
              <p>Le announced that she would be getting married on her Facebook page two weeks ago. However, the identity of her would-be suitor remains a mystery.</p>
              <p>In an interview with <em>The New Paper, </em>Le revealed that the marriage proposal she expects on her birthday on Tuesday  comes barely a month after they began dating.</p>
              <p>She tells <em>TNP, </em>“I won’t call him my boyfriend because we’ve never been together. He’s a decisive man who has told me he wants to marry me.”</p>
              <p>All that she revealed about Mr. A, her 30-year-old, 1.73m tall mystery man, is that he is an oil tycoon’s son who owns a high-end jewellery store on Orchard Road, has “three houses on Newton Road and owns many cars”.</p>
              <p>Le did not hesitate to tell the paper that she was attracted by his wealth and “high social status”.</p>
              <p>The two had lost touch with each other until earlier this year when Le made the headlines for claiming local director Jack Neo made advances on her six years ago. In the midst of the saga, Mr. A found her on Facebook and sent her a message.</p>
              <p>And so began their whirlwind month-long romance. Then just two weeks ago, he told her he would propose with a rare pink diamond ring on her birthday.</p>
              <p>So why would she think of marrying someone she’s only been seeing for a month?</p>
              <p>“I definitely would enjoy being a <em>tai tai</em> (lady of luxury). Yes Mr. A is very suited for me. We enjoy the same kind of lifestyle,” she told the paper.</p>
              <p>She also reveals that previous boyfriends dumped her because of her “princess-like” behaviour.</p>
              <p>“I expect my boyfriend to wait for me and pick me up from work often. Perhaps this is what guys mean when they complain that I am too ‘princess-like’. I also like to dress up and be wined and dined at nice places,” she explains.</p>
              <p>And yet, the singer-actress has no qualms about appearing materialistic.</p>
              <p>She says<em>, </em>“I know a lot of people will say that I’m a gold-digger but I don’t care. I have very high expectations of my partner. Let’s just say I’ve been wanting to get married for a very long time.”</p>
              <p>This is not the first time Le has made headlines. During the recent scandal earlier this year involving film-director Neo, she claimed he was invited by her then J-Team boss to a hotel room in 2004.</p>
              <p>Some accused her of cashing in on the scandal to gain fame. She also filed a police report in the wake of the scandal, claiming her life had been threatened.</p>

              <p>I dunno how true is her story on a rich guy wanting to marry her.</p>
              <p>if it is true, its not whether he wants to marry her, but whether the man's family, being a rich family , would mind her being their daugher-in-law. what about the family relatives think about her?</p>

              aiyo. why so violent. 
              
              anyway, this obviously is a lie / figment of her imagination. no self respecting rich dude who can have any beautiful woman he fancies who go for:
              
              (pls pardon my directness)
              
              a) someone of average looks
              b) someone who has been embroiled in a jack neo scandal ( i mean it's jack neo, cmon!) 
              
              anyway, her attention-hogging antics have been obvious right from the start, havent they? I mean, the scandal totally had nothing to do with her - she sadly just kept feeding the frenzy and created herself as a victim when really hmmm no one knew nor cared?
              
              poor girl.

              <p>29-year-old singer-actress <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=foyce+le&amp;amp;fr=fp-today&amp;amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Foyce Le</span></a>,
              better known as one of the women involved in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=jack+neo+scandal&amp;amp;fr=fp-today&amp;amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Jack Neo
              scandal</span></a>, is making headlines again.</p>
              <p>Le announced that she would be getting married on her Facebook
              page two weeks ago. However, the identity of her would-be suitor
              remains a mystery.</p>
              <p>In an interview with <em>The New Paper,</em> Le revealed that
              the marriage proposal she expects on her birthday on Tuesday 
              comes barely a month after they began dating.</p>
              <p>She tells <em>TNP,</em> “I won’t call him my boyfriend because
              we’ve never been together. He’s a decisive man who has told me he
              wants to marry me.”</p>
              <p>All that she revealed about Mr. A, her 30-year-old, 1.73m tall
              mystery man, is that he is an oil tycoon’s son who owns a high-end
              jewellery store on Orchard Road, has “three houses on Newton Road
              and owns many cars”.</p>
              <p>Le did not hesitate to tell the paper that she was
              attracted by his wealth and “high social status”.</p>
              <p>The two had lost touch with each other until earlier this year
              when Le made the headlines for claiming local director Jack Neo
              made advances on her six years ago. In the midst of the saga, Mr. A
              found her on Facebook and sent her a message.</p>
              <p>And so began their whirlwind month-long romance. Then just
              two weeks ago, he told her he would propose with a rare pink
              diamond ring on her birthday.</p>
              <p>So why would she think of marrying someone she’s only been
              seeing for a month?</p>
              <p>“I definitely would enjoy being a <em>tai tai</em> (lady of
              luxury). Yes Mr. A is very suited for me. We enjoy the same kind of
              lifestyle,” she told the paper.</p>
              <p>She also reveals that previous boyfriends dumped her
              because of her “princess-like” behaviour.</p>
              <p>“I expect my boyfriend to wait for me and pick me up from work
              often. Perhaps this is what guys mean when they complain that I am
              too ‘princess-like’. I also like to dress up and be wined and dined
              at nice places,” she explains.</p>
              <p>And yet, the singer-actress has no qualms about
              appearing materialistic.</p>
              <p>She says<em>,</em> “I know a lot of people will say that I’m a
              gold-digger but I don’t care. I have very high expectations of my
              partner. Let’s just say I’ve been wanting to get married for a
              very long time.”</p>
              <p>This is not the first time Le has made headlines. During
              the recent scandal earlier this year involving film-director Neo,
              she claimed he was invited by her then J-Team
              boss to a hotel room in 2004.</p>
              <p>Some accused her of cashing in on the scandal to gain fame. She
              also filed a police report in the wake of the scandal,
              claiming her life had been threatened.</p>
