But this time, it'll be in Cantonese, and will be called 'Siew Bao' (steamed buns, in Cantonese).<br><br>But more of that later.<br><br>In the movie, a period comedy called My Crazy Mother!, Will plays someone who may turn out to be the missing son of veteran Hong Kong actress Nancy Sit.<br><br>But even before anyone yells 'Camera!', the 21-year-old was already playing the missing boy role to perfection.<br><br>We were on a bus hurtling towards Guangzhou's Nanhai province from Hong Kong to start a fortnight shoot on My Crazy Mother!<br><br>We took off early Tuesday morning from the Holiday Inn in Kowloon, with cast members like actress Tien Niu and former TVB actress Natalie Wu, and of course, Will's entourage of his ever-present parents and his Cantonese language coach.<br><br>But there was a hitch: Will's parents bags had been left behind.<br><br>That was only discovered as they crossed the Hong Kong/China border and it was a hot topic of discussion between his mother and his increasingly agitated father.<br><br>While the commotion of the missing luggage went on, Will, 21, had earphones plugged to his MP3 player, and his head never moved.<br><br>From the back of the bus, this reporter observed the neatly combed head.<br><br>Rested on the headrest, he was motionless, even as his mother's jet-black curly haired head was bobbing animatedly.<br><br>Even when the bus became a near-toaster with the anaemic aircon system and oppressive heat outside and it started bouncing along to the bumpy road, his head remained still.<br><br>LOVE SCENE<br><br>Will also did not speak to anyone else during the eight-hour trip (including an hour's break for lunch in Shenzhen).<br><br>The only time he acknowledged anyone else was when he shook hands with Tien Niu's teenage daughter.<br><br>The other actors on board seemed oblivious to Will.<br><br>During lunch, when they sat together, Will sat in another table, dutifully next to his mother.<br><br>Malaysian actress Shannon Yao, who plays one of Nancy's 12 adopted daughters, widened her eyes when asked if she has a love scene with Will.<br><br>'Errr ..,' she said, smiling with visible relief, 'I don't think so.'<br><br>But Will came alive when the media was present, waving like a robot, egged on by his mother.<br><br>When we finally made it to Nanhai Movie and TV City - a massive period film studio where the movie was shot - Will was whisked off to make up. No pictures were permitted.<br><br>STRONG IMAGE<br><br>A rep from the movie said: 'Will's mother will only allow pictures after they are satisfied with how he looks. She doesn't want her son to look ugly.'<br><br>So there were only pictures during a press conference the next day.<br><br>But that's not because they were worried about Will's debut movie performance.<br><br>Director Cheng Wai Man, 41, who is helming the picture said: 'It's a comedy and that requires a strong image, like Ronald Cheng (the original choice for Will's role, according to Nancy) and Stephen Chow. And Will has that.<br><br>'Also, we had specially written the role around Will.'<br><br>But other than a request that he is nowhere near water (he has a phobia about water), Will did not change anything else in the script.<br><br>Mr Cheng said confidently: 'He'll do very well.'<br><br>A day earlier, taking a cue from the movie title, I tried unsuccessfully to ask Will if he was a mama's boy, or a daddy's boy for that matter.<br><br>All he was willing to say was: 'I won't say if I'm a mummy's boy or a daddy's boy because either way, it won't come out good. They're very proud of me, and they encourage me to do my best.'<br><br>Mama and Papa Hung are constantly by his side.<br><br>En route to Hong Kong's historic Jumbo Seafood Restaurant for an event on Monday night, Will's mother sat by his side as they went through their script.<br><br>The 21-year-old looked like a chubby-faced little boy being tutored on the art of sounding excited.<br><br>Even the always-diplomatic Nancy said: 'His parents run his career, especially his mother because she's concerned about his well-being. But Will sometimes makes firm decisions of his own.'<br><br>Will described his working relationship with his parents: 'My mother is my manager, my father is my agent. They choose the jobs which give me a good image.'<br><br>Even his minders and sponsers were protective. The sea was choppy and they held on to Will's chubby arms for dear life on the boat. Afraid that their cash cow might slip, perhaps?<br><br>He looked like an oversized doll as they gingerly maneouvered him around the small boat.<br><br>Will's return to Hong Kong after a decade was a big event for the press but a non-event for his friends.<br><br>'I haven't looked anybody up,' he revealed.<br><br>'It's been a long time, I don't think anybody remembers me.'<br><br>And why not? Didn't he make any friends or had any remarkable achievement?<br><br>To that, he replied: 'Oh, I was just a normal kid.'<br><br>Right now, Will is taking vocal lessons and Nancy said his singing has improved.<br><br>PROFESSIONAL AND SERIOUS<br><br>'He did it very professionally and seriously,' said Nancy, who recorded a duet for the movie with her new co-star.<br><br>He has his movie, an upcoming Christmas album and a concert in Singapore on Sep 12.<br><br>Not to mention lots of cash - if rumors of Will demanding money for media interviews are true. But does the man honestly think his novelty will endure?<br><br>'The American Idol producers have their own agenda, but I went for the audition like everybody else,' he said. 'Nobody knows about the future, but I'll just be positive and I'll continue to work hard.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>WILLIAM HUNG will appear as a guest artist at the Comedy 4 U show at the Esplanade on Sep 12 at 8pm.<br><br>Tickets are at $48, $58, $68 and $78 from Sistic (Tel: 6348-5555).<br><br>The concert, organised by Biz Trends Media, also features local personalities Kumar, Norleena Salim, Selena Tan, Hossan Leong, Abigail Chay and Irene Ang.<br><br>Part of the ticket proceeds will go to the Kidney Dialysis Foundation.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>WILLIAM Hung's debut movie will see him in the lead role of a boy who may or may not be Nancy Sit's son.<br><br>Popular Hong Kong actress Nancy plays a kind-hearted but deluded woman who runs a bar that provides music and food for tired souls.<br><br>She adopts a dozen girls - all fab musicians - and is always in search of her missing son.<br><br>She also has a feminine boy as a helper (Japanese newcomer Motoki Takaqi).<br><br>Will plays a simple boy who has the ability to talk to animals - and yes, sing the occasional song...<br><br>Copyright Â© 2004 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
