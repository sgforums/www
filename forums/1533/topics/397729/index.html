              <p>TALK about bling.<br><br>On Jamie Yeo's left hand now sits a 1.5-carat princess-cut diamond ring.<br><br>The ESPN Star Sports host is engaged again, as her boyfriend of about a year – Britain-born Thorsten Nolte, 35 – popped the question on her 33rd birthday a little over a week ago.<br><br>He surprised her with an impromptu getaway to Tokyo, she said on her Stomp Star Blog.<br><br>There, they were visiting a shrine when he "reached for his right pocket and took out the loveliest, most sparkly ring I'd ever seen and asked me to marry him".<br><br>She wrote: "I said yes... Of course, I said yes. I would do anything for this guy."<br><br>Yeo, speaking to my paper in a phone interview yesterday, said that she hadn't been expecting Mr Nolte to propose on their getaway together.<br><br>"The proposal really surprised me. I can't say it's a complete shock, we've talked about it before, and I knew he would pop the question sooner or later... but I didn't expect it at the moment it happened," she said.<br><br>But he'd been plotting the engagement for awhile – he'd had the ring made, and had it flown in, from San Francisco.<br><br>Why all the way from there? my paper asked.<br><br>Yeo laughed over the phone, and posed the question to Mr Nolte, who was in the room with her as she took the interview.<br><br>"He wanted a ring with a tension setting, which is hard to find here," she explained.<br><br>A tension setting holds the gem in place by pressure, and the diamond on such a ring appears to be "floating" in its setting.<br><br>Yeo first met Mr Nolte, the chief executive officer of a digital communications agency, backstage at the Prodigy concert at Fort Canning Park in early February last year. When he asked her out, she agreed.<br><br>"I wasn't really looking for anyone, but he's really good-looking, and I noticed," she said.<br><br>"I thought, 'Why not? We can just hang out'. And here we are now."<br><br>Her parents love him, she added.<br><br>"He cooks a lot, and he's always cooking for them. They get along well," she said.<br><br>She is planning for the wedding to take place this year, she said. She wants a small and cosy affair at an intimate place, like The White Rabbit restaurant.<br><br>"I want just 100 guests or so, just the friends and relatives we're really close to," she said.<br><br>When asked if she has informed her former husband, DJ Glenn Ong, about her engagement, she said simply: "No, and there's no reason to."<br><br>She and Ong started dating in 2001, and got married three years later. They divorced in February last year, with Ong announcing their much-publicised split on his morning show.<br><br>Ong was previously married to DJ Kate Reyes for three years before a divorce in 2003. He is now seeing DJ Jean Danker.</p>
              <p>On what she has learnt from her previous marriage, Yeo said: "Be honest with yourself. Ask yourself what it is you really want, and go for it."</p>

              <p>i bet it will NOT last. First she married GlennOng for the wrong 
              reasons,she did say on what she has learnt from her previous marriage, 
              she said: "Be
                                      honest with yourself. Ask yourself what it is 
              you really want, and
                                      go for it."</p>
              <p>That meant her doomed marriage
               to Glenn from start was not "honest", it wasn't LOVE, just security 
              blanket.</p>
              <p>She said she first met "Mr Nolte at Fort
                                      Canning Park in early February last year. When 
              he asked her out,
                                      she agreed." Bet she selpt with him and realized
               what she has been missing and Glenn is not the man she wanted. Bet she 
              initiates the divorce. No wonder Glenn announced that marriage kaput on 
              13Feb2009.</p>
              <p>With this new guy, Thiorsten, she falls for him 
              'cos he's good looking and satisfy her sexual needs in bed which she has
               been missing marrying to Glenn. She is after all a nymphomaniac.</p>
              <p>According
               to her chinese KUA, she is a number 1.</p>
              <p>Thorsten KUA number is 
              either 7 (if he's born 1975) or number 8(if he's born 1974)</p>
              <p>KUA 
              no.1 and KUA no.7 and 8 are NOT COMPATIBLE.</p>
              <p>IF he's born 1974, 
              he's a tiger. She is a Snake, NOT compatible.</p>
              <p>IF he's born 1975, 
              he's a rabbit, the relationship is NOT 100% blissful.</p>
              <p>They'll get 
              too irritated with one another eventually.</p>
              <p>She is an Aries, a 
              nagging creature, never satisfied, opinionated.</p>
              <p>Wonder what's his
               astrology is.</p>
              <p>Strangely Glenn KUA no. 3(1970) is compatible with
               her, BUT he's a DOG born which is not 100% compatible with a SNAKE born
               Jamie.</p>
              <p>One thing so irritating about Jaime is she likes to point out 
              number of times she studied in USA. So what? Does not make her better 
              than others who's not been living in the USA.</p>

Jamie Yeo and fiancé tell all</cite></div>
              </div>
              <div class="content" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">For a start - ladies, listen up. If you've been cracking your brains for ideas on getting your partners to pop the almighty question, we say take a cue from the soon-to-be Mrs Nolte. A formula of sorts, here goes:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Step one: tell him about your dream holiday destination, keep going at it till you're fairly certain that he gets the drift.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Step two: drop subtle hints on your preferred choice of diamond cut [engagement ring]. Point to note - this should be done over a random conversation instead of an intentional topic of discussion.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Step three: get your boss acquainted with your partner - very crucial step, if you should need a day off [work] to be whisked away to your dream holiday destination, and be proposed to (remember step one?).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Finally, timeliness is of essence. The three-step modus operandi should be timed few months ahead of your birthday season. And if all works out, you'll find yourself back on homeland, older and wiser, and with a heavier ring finger adorned with the best sparkle and brilliance.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">On marriage expectations: "I do" take #2 While it's been sometime now that news of Jamie Yeo's and her beau Thorsten Nolte's engagement have been circulated, and probably the 285th time they've been asked about their rush into matrimony - Jamie had a much-publicised split from Class95 radio deejay Glenn Ong in February last year and with the divorce proceedings still waiting to be finalized - the engaged couple are adamant that "it's the intent to get married that's important."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Jamie, 33, told xinmsn: "I'm not 23 y'know and people have to realise that divorce proceedings takes time, it will be finalized soon and our engagement doesn't mean that we've signed anything. Obviously we'll do the whole legal thing after everything is over."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Backing up his fiancée, 35-year-old Britain-born Thorsten said: "I don't follow this notion of having to set a time before you tie the knot. It's about how you feel."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Earlier newspaper reports had revealed that it won't be the first time both are walking down the aisle when they tie the knot this December after one and half years of dating - Thorsten was once married too. So, what are their expectations of a marriage, second time round?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"I think we are very compatible, and we'll always be. We give each other freedom to be who we are [and] that's very important," Jamie said. "It all boils down to compatibility."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When asked of the reasons that contributed to the breakdown of her previous marriage, Jamie, like a veteran celebrity, skirted the question in a fashionably manner, much to the amusement of her fiancé. "I don't want to exactly spell it out," she conceded.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Ultimately it's the lack of compatibility, sometimes people go on the same journey and they get different interests. When both parties don't agree on a fundamental issue, the relationship breaks down," Thorsten concluded.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Englishman mused on how being with Jamie brings out the best in him, he said: "It's cliché but when you actually find that, you can actually see it...that's certainly what Jamie did for me."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"And I do for you too, right?" Thorsten asked, looking to his wife-to-be for an affirmation. "Yes!" Jamie replied, guffawing. "Of course!"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">On fidelity Big-news celebrity break-ups over infidelity are not uncommon and a life in the spotlight is not always a glamorous one. We asked the couple on their take on commitment - would they walk or stay if their partner strays? For a start, both concurred that "when you truly love someone, you don't stray."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"I don't tolerate infidelity. If you feel the need to cheat then clearly there's something wrong, the love isn't there," Thorsten said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Jamie replied: "I think I'll walk out but I come back because I don't think I can live with anyone else but him."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">On family planning Without missing a beat, Jamie said: "Two kids, that's what we talked about so we are not holding back, no family planning here!" (Laughs)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">On future in-laws You either love them or loath them - especially mother-in-laws. According to Jamie, "treating her like a friend" is the way to stay away from discords. Even though Jamie admitted that she's yet to meet her future mother-in-law, she thinks Thorsten's mother likes her already. "His mum is very sweet, she emails me quite often," Jamie quipped.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">As for Thorsten, cooking for Jamie's parents and being tech pals with his future father-in-law pretty much scored him the brownie points. "They love him," Jamie announced with pride.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">On managing conflicts Almost on cue, Thorsten jumped in: "Jamie would just go over the point, like over and over again..."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"That's because I don't like to sleep angry but he's 'very guy' and goes like, 'whatever'. So obviously he doesn't see my point and I have to say it again," Jamie clarified at once.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Thorsten said: "You learn a lot of each other when you fight so I don't mind arguing. It's not nice at the time [of argument] but it ultimately brings you closer together."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">On sharing common interests Eating, chilling out in Gold Class cinemas and DVD marathons on the couch are the couple's favourite pastime. The lucky lady didn't just snagged herself a charming fellow but also one who loves cooking and whipping a dish or two for his ladylove. When asked to name each other after a fruit, they said:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Jamie would be a strawberry - sweet, light and juicy."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Thorsten would be a peach!" (Laughs) Sensing our puzzled expressions, Thorsten offered: "Jamie's got a thing about my buttocks." Okay.</p>
