              <p><em> Ronan Keating and Stephen Gately<br></em></p>
              <p>Boyzone singer Stephen Gately has been found dead at the age of 33, it was 
                          reported today.</p>
              <p>Gately was believed to have been holidaying in Majorca when he died yesterday, 
                          according to a newspaper.</p>
              <p>A friend of Gately's told the newspaper: "It looks like he went out for a 
                          few drinks, then got back, fell asleep and never woke up."</p>
              <p>Boyzone manager Louis Walsh told the News of the World: "We're all 
                          absolutely devastated. I'm in complete shock. I was only with him on Monday 
                          at an awards ceremony. We don't know much about what's happened yet.</p>
              <p>"I only heard after The X Factor and we will rally around each other this 
                          week. He was a great man."</p>
              <p>All four remaining members of Boyzone - Ronan Keating, Keith Duffy, Shane 
                          Lynch and Mikey Graham - will be flying to Palma, Majorca tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Boyzone star Shane Lynch told the News of the World: "Me and the boys are 
                          flying out in the morning. We just need to get over to where he's passed and 
                          work out what we need to do."</p>
              <p>Ronan Keating, who is in Chicago, has been left devastated by the death of his 
                          close friend. A pal revealed to the newspaper: "Ronan is completely 
                          distraught. No-one saw this coming.</p>
              <p>"He loved Stephen like a brother, they were so close, it's absolutely 
                          floored him.</p>
              <p>"It's a massive shock to everyone and no one can take it in yet.</p>
              <p>"He was a man in the prime of his life, and this is a huge tragedy."</p>
              <p>Gay singer Gately's coming out ten years ago caused a sensation in the pop 
                          music world. He leaves a husband Andrew Cowles, who he married in a civil 
                          union in March, 2006.</p>
              <p>Gately also became a star of theatre, TV and radio, appearing in the West End 
                          as Joseph in and The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and in the ITV show 
                          Dancing on Ice.</p>
              <p>Boyzone had 17 top five singles and four number one albums before splitting in 
                          2000. They made a comeback tour in 2007, however their recent 19-date Better 
                          tour was deemed a flop as the band played to half-filled arenas.</p>
              <p>A statement on Boyzone's official website confirmed the Irish singer's death.</p>
              <p>It said: "Stephen tragically died yesterday whilst on holiday with his partner 
                          Andrew in Majorca.</p>
              <p>"The rest of the boyz will be flying out today."</p>

              <p><strong>Boyzone’s Stephen Gately is said to have died after choking on
              his own vomit following a booze and drugs binge - while his husband was
              having sex next door. <br><br></strong></p>
              <p>The singer († 33) of successful Irish boy band ‘Boyzone’ (15 million
              sold albums), was found dead on Saturday in unusual circumstances in
              his plush Mallorca apartment.</p>
              <p>Spanish police reported that
              Stephen Gately, his life partner Andrew Cowles and several other
              friends were partying Saturday night in their apartment in the high
              class resort of Port d'Andratx.</p>
              <p><strong>Police sources also
              reported that partygoers consumed large amounts of alcohol and drugs
              while indulging in sex games until early in the morning. </strong></p>
              <p>German
              newspaper ‘B.Z’ reported that Stephen’s husband Andrew Cowles was
              having sex with ‘a friend’ for three hours in the room next to where
              the Boyzone singer was dying.</p>
              <p>Andrew called the police at 1.45 pm
              the next afternoon after finding the lifeless body of Stephen kneeling
              in front of the sofa in the apartment.</p>
              <p><strong>Stephen is thought to have been sick in his sleep and then choked on his own vomit and asphyxiated. </strong><br>Andrew
              is said to have desperately tried to revive him with mouth-to-mouth
              resuscitation, but to no avail. An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Police
              were last night looking for a mysterious third man, Giorgi Duchev, a
              25-year-old Bulgarian who Stephen and Andy met at the Black Cat
              nightclub that night and who went back to the couple’s one million
              dollar luxury apartment, according to the Daily Mail.</p>
              <p><strong>His
              bandmates, Ronan Keating (32), Keith Duffy (35), Mikey Graham (37) and
              Shane Lynch (33) flew to Mallorca shortly after hearing the news of
              Gately’s death.</strong></p>
              <p>In a post on their <a href="http://www.boyzone.net/">Boyzone official website</a> the remaining band members wrote: "We are completely devastated by the loss of our friend and brother, Stephen.</p>
              <p>"We
              have shared such wonderful times together over the years and were all
              looking forward to sharing many more. Stephen was a beautiful person in
              both body and spirit. He lit up our lives and those of the many friends
              he had all over the world. We love you and will miss you forever,
              'Steo'".</p>
