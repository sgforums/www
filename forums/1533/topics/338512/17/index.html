              <p>cost cutting measures for bad economy...hehehe</p>
              <p>Anyway, every actor has a fixed quota to fulfill every year.  So if they reuse the same actor over and over again, the other actors will be free up to do other production. </p>
              <p>Condor Heroes one was under TCS, the previous management of Mediacorp.  TCS focused a lot on quality production as they want to market their productions and artistes overseas.  Mediacorp's way is totally different.  Come to think of it, I still miss TCS productions like Doufu Street, Dong You Ji etc.</p>

              <p>Felicia chin remained single ah? I tot she wud choose Nat.. <span style="color: #3366ff;">She chose Nat mah.  You never see meh?  When they prayed to ancestors, Nat was standing next to her behind Feilicia Chin's brothers and father.</span></p>
              <p>Yu Zhu rly very pitiful.. if not for the rape case, she wud be a
              normal pretty woman now..<span style="color: #3366ff;">Ya, that's why Yueniang die die dun wan to be with Chen Xi.  She felt that if she hasn't met and fallen in love with Chen Xi, Yuzhu would have happily married to Chen Xi and lived happily ever after. Hence she chose to pretend to have died from the fire and not let Chen Xi know she's still alive.    </span></p>
              <p>And the zhen zhu so bad, she dun get any retribution? Still can
              elope with another guy..<span style="color: #3366ff;">Maybe she has eloped with some jerk who would slap her every day since she has such a bad heart and a foul mouth.</span></p>
              <p>Oya, and wad abt Chen Xi? How is he living now? Nv show at
              all.. <span style="color: #3366ff;">Never show but got mentioned mah.  He did very well in his business after that.  He married Libby and had 6 children with her.  All his children grew up to be somebody successful.  Not possible to show this cuz the whole story was about Yueniang telling the story.  Since she did not see Chen Xi after the fire, they will not show Chen Xi anymore.<br></span></p>
              <p>One word, <strong>BAD</strong> ending.  <span style="color: #3366ff;">Where got?  Not bad lah.</span></p>

              <p>The Ending i dun think its quite nice lor.. like just a very
              neutral ending.</p>
              <p>Felicia chin remained single ah? I tot she wud choose Nat..
              <span style="color: #3366ff;">She chose Nat mah.  You never
              see meh?  When they prayed to ancestors, Nat was standing next
              to her behind Feilicia Chin's brothers and father.</span></p>
              <p>Yu Zhu rly very pitiful.. if not for the rape case, she wud be a
              normal pretty woman now..<span style="color: #3366ff;">Ya, that's
              why Yueniang die die dun wan to be with Chen Xi.  She felt
              that if she hasn't met and fallen in love with Chen Xi, Yuzhu would
              have happily married to Chen Xi and lived happily ever after. Hence
              she chose to pretend to have died from the fire and not let Chen Xi
              know she's still alive.   </span></p>
              <p>And the zhen zhu so bad, she dun get any retribution? Still can
              elope with another guy..<span style="color: #3366ff;">Maybe she has
              eloped with some jerk who would slap her every day since she has
              such a bad heart and a foul mouth.</span></p>
              <p>Oya, and wad abt Chen Xi? How is he living now? Nv show at all..
              <span style="color: #3366ff;">Never show but got mentioned
              mah.  He did very well in his business after that.  He
              married Libby and had 6 children with her.  All his children
              grew up to be somebody successful.  Not possible to show this
              cuz the whole story was about Yueniang telling the story. 
              Since she did not see Chen Xi after the fire, they will not show
              Chen Xi anymore.<br></span></p>
              <p>One word, <strong>BAD</strong> ending.  <span style="color: #3366ff;">Where got?  Not bad lah.</span></p>

              <p>Oic. Thanks for explaning. Haha.</p>
              <p>Btw, there are still some loopholes:</p>
              <p>Xiujuan ran away with the 10K and she didn't touch any single bit of it, so how did she survive on her own all these years? She still can buy such a nice black dress and hat! lol.</p>
              <p>Why in the ending, i dun see Yueniang's husband (Paul) ? Is he dead or wad?</p>

              <p>Mr Ang Eng Tee, 48, the scriptwriter, wrote the ending five times
              before he decided on the final version. Here are the various options.
              Which ending do you prefer?</p>
              <p>1) Chen Xi and Yueniang eventually get married and live happily ever after.</p>
              <p>2) Chen Xi vanishes into thin air and returns many years later
              to be reunited with Yueniang. Throughout the years, the latter remains
              single.</p>
              <p>3) Chen Xi marries someone else and they have a happy life. Yueniang also marries and has her own happy life.</p>
              <p>4) Chen Xi thinks that Yueniang is dead but she still loves and
              cares for him secretly. He falls ill and almost dies. In the hospital,
              he sees Yueniang visiting him but he thinks that he is imagining
              things. She finally reveals she is still alive.</p>
              <p>5) There is a fire and Yueniang is trapped. Chen Xi saves her and end up being together.</p>
