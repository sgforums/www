              <p> </p>
              <p>The Chinese drama serial about a long-suffering Peranakan woman, The
              Little Nyonya, has chalked up a viewership rating of 26.3 per cent as
              of Monday night, beating the 22.5 per cent rating for the closing
              ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.</p>
              <p>This means one in four viewers is tuning in to the Channel 8 show
              every night. Which means as many people watch the show each night as
              they did the tense women's table-tennis team final at the Beijing
              Olympics in August, where Singapore lost to the China team.</p>
              <p>The 34-episode show is the most-watched Chinese drama serial
              in the past eight years and has beaten shows such as last year's
              top-rated drama serial Like Father Like Daughter, which had a rating of
              20.5 per cent.</p>
              <p>The show debuted on Nov 25 and the storyline spans over 70 years, starting in the 1930s.</p>
              <p>Actress Jeanette Aw plays both the lead character Yue Niang and
              her mute mother Ju Xiang. Both overcome the odds despite being
              ostracised and tortured by their relatives.</p>
              <p>Fans of the Cinderella-like serial are addicted to what they
              describe as a captivating plot and depiction of the rich Peranakan
              culture.</p>
              <p>Tax associate Kee Hui Tian, who does not usually watch local
              Chinese dramas, now schedules her appointments to end before 9pm daily
              so she can rush home to catch the show.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old says: 'This drama serial has an intense and
              complex plot which involves many different generations and I try to
              watch every episode so I won't miss any important part.'</p>
              <p>Another fan, administration executive Ong Ah Chew, 52, has
              even thought of skipping her folk dance classes on Monday and Friday
              nights so she can stay home to watch the show.</p>
              <p>She says: 'It allows me to know more about Peranakan culture,
              which is very interesting. It is a refreshing topic for a local drama
              and a huge departure from the usual modern love stories on television.'</p>
              <p>The serial has also attracted Peranakans in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Mr Peter Wee, 62, first vice-president of The Peranakan
              Association Singapore, says the younger generation of Peranakans here
              are curious about their own history and culture and are watching the
              show as it provides them with glimpses of the past.</p>
              <p>He adds: 'The show has helped to revive and raise awareness
              about aspects of the Peranakan culture, such as the beautiful costumes
              and traditional snacks, which have slowly been lost over the years.'</p>
              <p>The team responsible for the show is elated by its success.</p>
              <p>Aw says: 'I am appreciative of the chance to act in this role
              and I had put in a lot of effort. I am very happy that it is
              well-received by the public.'</p>
              <p>Scriptwriter Ang Eng Tee, 48, who had written award-winning
              local dramas Holland V (2003) and Stepping Out (1999), says: 'I came up
              with this theme because the Peranakan culture is unique to Singapore
              and Malacca and I wanted to let more people know about it.</p>
              <p>'It is a fresh subject for a local Chinese drama because we
              have not done anything like this before. I was taking a risk and now I
              am glad I did it.'</p>

              <p class="normalhead">The story begins from the 1930s, spanning over 70 years till modern day.</p>
              <p>Juxiang is born into a big Peranakan family where her mum is a mistress. She is gentle, beautiful and a fantastic cook. Born deaf-mute, she is ostracized by people. Right before the Japanese Occupation in Singapore, she is forced to marry a rich Peranakan as a mistress. Juxiang resists the marriage and runs away from home. She then meets a young Japanese photographerand after many obstacles, they finally get married and Juxiang gives birth to a daughter Yue Niang. During the World War, Juxiang is tortured and both her husband and her dies leaving behind their 8-year-old daughter.</p>
              <p>Yue Niang is passed around families and eventually ends up at her grandfather's house. Under the supervision of her grandmother, Yue Niang learns to cook Peranakan dishes and sewing. She grows up looking exactly like her mother and is exceptionally beautiful. After the war, her maternal relatives who ran away to England to seek refuge during wartime return home. Yue Niang then leads the life of her mother – always discriminated, beaten up and tortured. She puts up with all these in order to protect her grandmother.</p>
              <p>Yue Niang's pretty looks incurs jealousy from her cousin and attracted many rich Peranakans to chase after her. However, she only has eyes for penniless driver Chen Xi.</p>
              <p>Chen Xi actually comes from an educated and wealthy family. He hides his identity to be with Yue Niang. Yue Niang's kindness, pureness and persistence move Chen Xi and he loves her deeply too. Unfortunately, their relationship is filled with many obstacles and difficulties. Under pressure from his family, Chen Xi is forced to marry Yue Niang's cousin instead. Yue Niang is then sold to a butcher, Liu Yi Dao.</p>
              <p>Yue Niang is unwilling to accept the fact that her life is always manipulated by others and decides to end her own life. Yue Niang's strong personality impresses Liu Yi Dao and they become sworn siblings instead. Yue Niang decides to choose her own path in life. She begins learning how to run a business and in the process, she is framed and ousted from her business. Although she is badly hit, she manages to overcome the odds and save her declining family business. Sadly, her love life has yet to begin a new chapter with no news about her lover, Chen Xi.<br><br><a href="http://littlenyonya.mediacorptv.sg/about.htm">http://littlenyonya.mediacorptv.sg/about.htm</a></p>
