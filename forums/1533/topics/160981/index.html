We'd take the mickey out of him during dance rehearsals but he wouldn't mind."<br><br>When asked to rate the dance skills of Hee, she said with a giggle: "I wouldn't know because I didn't have many dance sequences with him. But he's very hardworking. I heard that he secretly went for classes before we started filming."<br><br>Hee, 27, said: "I play a character that is the complete opposite of me. He's hot-headed, impulsive and would give up anything for his passion to dance."<br><br>Last seen playing a mentally-challenged man in Beyond the Axis of Truth II, he will be showing off some "street punk break-dancing" moves in the show.<br><br>With a cast of regional stars, will there be plans to broadcast the drama series overseas?<br><br>Executive producer Ho Fat Ming, said: "Reaching out to a wider audience was the first thing that we had in mind before we even conceptualised the show. We've spent almost $10,000 just on dance lessons alone, and the artistes have put in more effort than ever for their roles.<br><br>"I hope to reinvent the definition of an idol with The Rainbow Connection, and make them into even bigger stars."<br><br>The Rainbow Connection airs every Mondays to Fridays beginning Nov 7, at 9pm on Channel 8<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Rainbow Connection<br>From Nov 7, every Mon-Fri @ 9pm<br><br>Six young aspiring dancers brave through multiple obstacles and heartache to attain their dreams but unwittingly find themselves embroiled in their mentorsÂ’ past feud.<br><br>Stars: Jeanette Aw, Julian Hee, Rosanne, Chen Jie, Guo Yanfu, Chen Baoyuan, Michelle Yim, Shirley Yim<br><br>Dong Hui Arts Institute is famous for its Dance Faculty. All the three male and three female protagonists aspire to become lead dancers. The competition heats up between them, especially in the face of the international audition for male and female leads conducted by the world renowned Octoko Dancing Troupe.<br><br>There is Wang Jianyi (Guo Yanfu), the diffident but extremely talented dancer; Li Tianle (Julian Hee), the extrovert who hails from a wealthy family; Zhou Dawei (Chen Baoyuan), an arrogant but exceptionally skilful dancer; Ding Yingying (Jeanette Aw) who is spontaneous and has an aptitude for dancing; Wen Xiaoqian (Chen Jie) who is diligent and nimble on her feet and Tan Meilu (Rosanne), the hardworking and adept dancer.<br><br>All of them are enrolled in Dong Hui and are working hard to excel in the varsityÂ’s dance competition, as the top 3 pairs will be able to compete at the regional level in Asia. The finalists will then go on to the Octoko Finals and the winners get a chance to take part in the Octoko World Tour for the next 10 years!<br><br>The famous dancer Cheng Mixue (Michelle Yim) returns from China to take on the position of a Chief Consultant in the faculty. She also happens to be XiaoqianÂ’s mother. All but YingyingÂ’s mother, Wei Aixue (Shirley Yim), are in awe of this internationally famous dancer. There is bad blood between Aixue and Mixue and both their daughters have become exact replicas of their mothers.<br><br>Long ago, both Mixue and Aixue were top-notch dancers and shared a sisterly love. However, in order to secure a place at Octoko, Mixue tricked Aixue into giving up her career to marry Ding Yishan. After eliminating Aixue her strongest rival, Mixue naturally became the new dancing queen. Aixue gave up her career for marriage and it was only at his deathbed that Yishan revealed MixueÂ’s scheme. As Yingying is enrolled in the faculty as well, Aixue attempts to put forth a normal front. Surprisingly, Mixue and Yingying get along very well. Mixue holds Yingying in high regard and even thinks that she is more talented than her mother.<br><br>The varsity competition draws to a close. Meilu hurts her leg and as she can no longer dance, she returns to Malaysia dejectedly. Tianle, her dancing partner is also feeling very down as there is no chemistry between him and his new female partners. After much difficulty, they switch careers and soon find their niche in stage directing work.<br><br>The regional competition in Asia is round the corner. Xiaoqian is unable to get along with Dawei and they have a fall-out, while Jianyi and Yingying cannot achieve a breakthrough, try as they might. As such, Ouyang Fei, their dancing instructor, decides that the four should switch partners.<br><br>Xiaoqian and Jianyi perform very well and are able to secure themselves a place in the finals. Yingying and Dawei are constantly at loggerheads with each other and this affected their performance. Luckily for them, they are still able to make it to the finals. Aixue concocts a plan to create a misunderstanding between Jianyi and Xiaoqian. In the end, Xiaoqian leaves Jianyi and turns to Dawei in the hope of teaming up with him again. As for Jianyi, he approaches Yingying with the offer to partner her again. Both are unaware that they have played right into the hands of Aixue.<br><br>Not long after, the long-drawn feud between Aixue and Mixue comes to a head. When Yingying learns the truth, she feels that she has been a pawn in her motherÂ’s quest for revenge and she resolutely gives up everything and takes off.<br><br>The Octoko audition finally arrives. Both the judges and audiences are wowed by the brilliant dance routines executed by all the world renowned dancers who have made their appearances. Judging by the sterling performance by Xiaoqian and Dawei, it seems that they will undoubtedly emerge the winner.<br><br>At the same time, Jianyi brings Yingying to the forest where they used to practise in the past. They are delighted to see that the two little birds of yesteryear happily chirping away, surrounded by their own offsprings. The significance of the moment is not lost on both Yingying and Jianyi. With Yingying at his side, Jianyi weaves through the heavy traffic at Orchard Road. They make it to the competition just in time but can their unrehearsed dance routine triumph over Xiaoqian and Dawei?</div>
