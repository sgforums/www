            <div class='col-md body'><br><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpC6e2R0.jpg">Different faces of Andy Lau<br><br>It's all about family for Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau.<br><br>In his latest film Wait Till You're Older, the actor takes on the role of a young man from an unhappy family, who ages rapidly from 20 to 80 after coming into contact with a potion.<br><br>With age no longer on his side, the character comes to understand the problems his parents faced in their lives, which culminated in his mother committing suicide.<br><br>Wait Till You're Older, which also stars Felix Wong and Karen Mok as Lau's father and step-mother, opens here on Sept 29.<br><br>In real life, however, the 44-year-old Lau comes from a happy family. His father was a fireman, and Lau was the fourth child in a middle-class family of seven children.<br><br>In fact, he struggled to empathise with the character's unhappy family life and needed to consult with director Teddy Chan before filming each scene.<br><br>It was Chan's tumultuous family background that was the basis for the film. Chan was estranged from his father and it was only after his father died that he regretted their strained relationship. "You know why I've been so successful in my work? It's because I have a good family behind me. I'd like to push the idea that a happy family can do so much good for you," Lau said, during a conference call from Hong Kong on Wednesday night.<br><br>Playing happy families<br><br>According to newspaper reports from Hong Kong, Lau's mother was so pleased that she proclaimed the film as the best work her son has done.<br><br>Considering Lau has also made the cult classic Infernal Affairs (2002), which is currently being remade by director Martin Scorsese, that is high praise indeed.<br><br>But it was a different matter when it came to his father. "Dad's seen my film but he didn't say much," said Lau.<br><br>"He keeps his feelings to himself. We have a great relationship but I'm from an older generation, so I wouldn't say that the relationship with my father is like the relationship I have with my friends. Instead, I've always put my father on a pedestal."<br><br>For the film, Lau endured over five hours of makeup for scenes where he had to play an old man.<br><br>Not only did he have gelatine-like fake skin applied to his face, he also had "old man" hair plastered to his scalp and wore contact lens that made his eyes water.<br><br>To top it off, Lau needed to see a dermatologist when his skin reacted to all the prosthetics."I still have to take extra care of my skin. Even now, I have to use a cream every day. But it's much better now," he said.<br><br>But as for the news that he had his face insured for HK$30 million ($6.49 million) in the film, Lau replied curtly: "That's just a rumour."<br><br>No longer forever young<br><br>Despite the torturous make up, it was acting as a 20-year-old that Lau found the most challenging.<br><br>"The most difficult part was playing a 20-year-old," he said with a laugh. "Everyone knows my age, so having to act young, people might think that's a little fake.<br><br>"It wasn't actually that hard playing an old man. Despite the heavy make up, I could move my face, although I didn't want to move too much in case I spoilt the make up."<br><br>It's certainly not the first time Lau has transformed his appearance on film.<br><br>In Love on a Diet (2001), he and co-star Sammi Cheng donned fat suits to play obese lovers, while in Running on Karma (2003), which won him a Best Lead Actor award at the Hong Kong Film Awards in 2004, he wore a muscle suit to look like a buffed up body builder.<br><br>Yet Lau claimed that the filming process for Wait Till You're Older was the toughest yet. "This film was harder to do. In Love on A Diet, the make up was thicker so you didn't have to worry about wrecking it when you moved your face," he said.<br><br>"The make up for this one was more delicate because there was a need for more facial expressions since many of the scenes were close-ups." - TODAY/sh<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The price of growing older<br>September 23, 2005<br><br>ANDY Lau's skin was nearly ruined by his latest movie Wait 'Til You Are Older.<br><br>The 44-year-old actor has been seeing a dermatologist for treatment after developing angry rashes from the special effects makeup for the movie.<br><br>Wait 'Til You Are Older is about a boy who can't wait to grow up and gets his wish when he starts turning 10 years older with every passing day.<br><br>Felix Wong plays his father while Karen Mok plays his stepmother.<br><br>It sees Andy's character age from 20 to 90.<br><br>During a phone interview with Singapore reporters yesterday, Andy said that he still has to put ointment on his face every day to help it heal.<br><br>Despite his condition, Andy still sounded perky: 'I still have to maintain my skin, but it is a lot better now.'<br><br>This is not the first movie that required Andy to go to lengths for a character.<br><br>For the 2001 romantic comedy Love On A Diet with Sammi Cheng, Andy had to don a fat suit, and in 2003's Running On Karma, he also wore a muscle suit.<br><br>But Andy says that wearing a fat suit is easier than putting on ageing makeup.<br><br>He said: 'A fat suit is just uncomfortable, but because we had to shoot a lot of close-ups to show the different ages in the movie, I had to be a lot more expressive.'<br><br>Wait 'Til You Are Older is also loosely based on director Teddy Chan's estranged relationship with his late dad.<br><br>Andy is more fortunate. He enjoys a much better relationship with his father.<br><br>He told reporters proudly: 'My career is so smooth-sailing because I come from a very stable family. It allows me to concentrate on my work. And that's why I advocate family harmony!'<br><br>Wait 'Til You Are Older opens in cinemas on 29 Sep.<br><br></div>
