King Yeon-san was ousted 12 years after his coronation.<br>King Jung-Jong (1488~1544), the 11th ruler of Chosun dynasty, mounted the throne at the age of 18. He was Yeon-sanÂ’s younger brother by a different mother.<br>(* Little Jang Geum took part in the coup without intention, which made her go to the palace as a royal kitchen maid in episode 3. )<br><br>However, King Jung-jongÂ’s first wife was also forced to be ousted by cabinet ministers who led to the coup, because her family members were related to the deposed king.<br>(* King Jung-jong was deeply grieved over losing his beloved wife, but he had no actual power to protect her. He knew that he was just a kind of puppet king appointed by ministers. )<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>1515</strong></span><br>King Jung-jongÂ’s second queen died soon after giving birth to a son. Later, the son became crown prince.<br>Â“Jo Gwang-jo (1482~1519)Â”, a famous social reformist, passed the state exam to be a government officer.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">1517</span></strong><br>King Jung-jong married his third wife, Queen Â“Mun-jeongÂ” (1501~1565).<br>(* It is the young queen who is appearing on Â“The Great Jang-geumÂ” drama.)<br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">1518</span></strong><br>Â“Jo Gwang-joÂ” eventually came into power of the government with supports of the king.<br>Jung-jong took advantage of him in order to weaken the political power of ministers as well as to strengthen his position as an absolute monarch.<br><br><span style="color: brown;"><strong>1519</strong></span><br>Ministers entrapped Jo Gwang-jo by using leaves saying Â“Jo will be a new kingÂ”.

You will save the second one, but she will die for you. The third one will kill you, but because of that, she will save thousands.<br>-  A Confucian Monk said this to Suh Chun-soo, Jang-Geum's father, in a cave where Chun-soo was recovering from his injuries from a fall. The three women mentioned in the quote are Yeonsangun's mother, Jang-geum's mother, and Jang-geum herself</strong></span><br><br>I'll tell you how to make it when we return to the Palace<br>-  Last words by Lady Han, before she died on her exile to Cheju Island over trumped up charges made by Lady Choe. Jang Geum was asking Lady Han how to make Steamed Prawns when Lady Han died.<br><br>What did I do wrong? Why must everyone treat me this way? I will not start over. My mother and now you have left me. No matter what, I will never follow your orders again.<br>-  Jang Geum, when Lady Han died on their way to Cheju Island, after they were framed by Lady Choe.<br><br>I use my [accupuncture] needles to kill people<br>-  Female Physician Jang-Deok, Jang Geum's mentor in the field of medicine, on why she is a Female Physician. She actually wanted to exact revenge on an imperial court officer who forced her mother to commit suicide during the reign of Yeongsangun. The court officer, now exiled to Cheju, tried to draft Jang-Deok's mother into the palace and become the Emperor's concubine.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does the drama reflect the actual culture and attitude of the Chosun people at that time?<br><br>If yes, i am quite impressed.<br><br>The period happened to coincide with the Ming Dynasty in China, and its well known that this is the period, where China is at its most advanced stage in terms of technology, and in the world, however, i like the way the Chosun people use those technology or knowledge.<br><br>For example, tonight episode shows how they open up medical centres, emplying women the way we employ nurses, run the medical centres the way we do with hospitals now<br><br>There are other things, like slaves who arent being treated barbarically, but were usefully employed and given much freedom to move ard. Not forgetting, that time our Chinese ancestors were totally subservient and kowtowing to the Emperor, the Chosun people arent so formal with their king.<br><br></div>

But to my surprise (and also to every audience too), female doctors are of lower rank and status than the palace girl (gong nÃ»).<br><br>Something spotted in one scene... Changjin was walking with her fellow female doctor.

But female doctors are not even if they have better skills than the male doctors.  It is because they are females.<br><br>Female doctors in the Palace have much lower status than the Palace Girls.<br>So, for Chang Jin to move from a Palace Girl's status to a doctor, it was considered a downgrade for her.<br><br>Her identity as a Government slave can be removed by the government based on good performance.</div>
