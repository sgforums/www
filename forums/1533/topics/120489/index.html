            <div class='col-md body'>March 3, 2005<br>Zoe names baby 'Brayden'<br><br>By Yvonne Kwok<br>MEDIA REPORTER<br>ZOE Tay claims she is not superstitious, but when it comes to choosing a name for her baby boy and taking care of herself, the actress is leaving nothing to chance.<br><br>'I'm not superstitious and my husband also said not to be superstitious, so that's why during my pregnancy, you didn't see me buying 4D or doing any investments,' said the MediaCorp artiste yesterday.<br><br>She gave birth to a 3.61kg boy, her firstborn, on Feb 24, two weeks early.<br><br>She said her husband, air force pilot Philip Chionh, 37, had picked an English name of Celtic origins for their son - Brayden, which means bravery.<br><br>But Tay, 37, is still mulling over several Chinese names a fortune teller had suggested based on the boy's time and date of birth.<br><br>Besides consulting a fortune teller on the child's name, she also believes in traditional confinement practices prescribed by Chinese custom.<br><br>She has not bathed since the delivery and keeps her bedroom windows closed and room draft-free.<br><br>She even refrained from having any air-conditioning despite the recent heat wave.<br><br>She believes this will prevent water retention as well as ward off any aches and pains that may occur later in life.<br><br>Tay, who wore a mint-green Marni dress and looked radiant, was speaking at a press conference held at The Pines.<br><br>She said an Indonesian masseuse is massaging her body back into shape using jamu, a traditional Indonesian herbal medicine.<br><br>Tay, whose mother and a confinement nanny are staying with her to help take care of the baby, said: 'A friend came into my bedroom and told me it was like an oven but even then I still wear socks so that I don't catch a chill.<br><br>'I've been sweating a lot every day, but I wipe myself off regularly with a towel and change my clothes at least 10 times a day.'<br><br>She dismissed talk that she was superstitious and relying on old wives' tales, saying: 'We shouldn't disbelieve what old people say. I'm still Chinese after all and we are different in mind and body from Westerners.'<br><br>Tay, who gained 15kg over the course of her pregnancy and hasn't weighed herself after the delivery, is also relying on a special post-natal girdle her husband gave her which she says will trim centimetres off her belly.<br><br>'I've worn it for a few days and even though I still have a bit of fat around the belly, it's really good for compressing the tummy.'<br><br>Although it is still early days, her managers are already in talks with several companies for potential endorsements.<br><br>Though she has agreed to endorse milk powder Similac Follow On for babies aged six months and over, she said she nurses Brayden every three hours and will continue to breastfeed him for as long as she can.<br><br>She hopes her next child will be a girl, although she is not sure when she will have another child or how many more she will have.<br><br>'I don't know if I will have my next child next year, but I can't wait too long because I'm quite old already.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ZoeÂ’s new love - baby Brayden<br>March 2, 2005<br><br><img src="http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/imagegallery/store/php7t0jTy_s.jpg"><img src="http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/imagegallery/store/php6v0deq_s.jpg"><img src="http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/imagegallery/store/phppmLCxO_s.jpg"><img src="http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/imagegallery/store/phpiJVIaE_s.jpg"><img src="http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/imagegallery/store/phpocOWVT_s.jpg"><br><br>Zoe Tay met the press this afternoon for the first time since the birth of her baby son Brayden on Feb 24! The gorgeous and radiant mum spoke to us about her labour pains, confinement period and ermÂ…how br<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>eastfeeding makes her feel like a cow!<br><br>Zoe was absolutely glowing with motherly bliss when she met more than 40 members of the press this afternoon at The Pines Club. In tune with the joyous mood, the room was specially decked out with a shimmery silver backdrop, floating silver and blue balloons, and half a dozen congratulatory Â‘ItÂ’s a Boy!Â’ balloons.<br><br>After a wait of close to an hour, the newly-crowned mummy finally appeared, swathed in a resplendent flowing turquoise Mani gown and a chunky necklace.<br><br>Apologising for her tardiness, Zoe explained she had to bring her baby to the doctorÂ’s for a routine check-up. Â“ItÂ’s the first time we brought him out, so we fumbled and took longer than we anticipated,Â” she smiled. Naturally, all is forgiven for adorable little Brayden!<br><br>Yup, dear readers, he is no longer known as just Â‘Zoe TayÂ’s sonÂ’; the most famous baby in Singapore now has a name! Meet Brayden Chionh, the week-old darling of MediaCorpÂ’s Ah Jie Zoe and her husband Philip. Brayden, meaning Â‘braveÂ’ in Gaelic, has yet to have a Chinese name.<br><br>Explaining her husbandÂ’s choice of the English name, Zoe said, Â“We hope that he will grow up to be brave, courageous and healthy. BraydenÂ’s a male, so I want him to have his own character and be decisive. We didnÂ’t decide on a name right away because we wanted to observe his character first. The doctor said the baby is strong-minded and knows what he wants because he hooks on fast during breastfeeding.Â”<br><br>The Queen of Caldecott Hill then proceeded to answer the mediaÂ’s numerous questions, laughing and waving her hands around animatedly throughout the 45-minute interview.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In labour for 11 hours!</span><br>Zoe was admitted to Thomson Medical Centre on Feb 24. She was in labour for a whopping 11 hours, not because little Brayden refused to meet the world, but because Zoe wanted to wait for Daddy Philip to reach the hospital. Unable to get an earlier flight out of Korea, Philip could only reach Singapore after midnight. Zoe hung on for as long as she could, but eventually, she took an epidural and out popped the baby.<br><br>Â“The contractions were very frequent and painful. The pain is indescribable. The labour process was quite scary, but IÂ’m glad it was smooth. I called my husband in between my contractions and because I sounded calm and at ease, he didnÂ’t believe I was in pain most of the time!Â” she smirked playfully.<br><br>Zoe was exhausted after the birth, but was still very energetic. Probably because of the excitement, she claimed. And Baby Brayden has been an absolutely darling baby so far! She said, Â“IÂ’m still adapting (to being a mother), everythingÂ’s quite good. IÂ’m not as Â‘kelan kabutÂ’ (Malay for bumbling) as I had thought I would be!Â”<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breastfeeding makes Zoe feel like a cow</span>!<br>Zoe understands fully the benefits of breastfeeding and is intent on nourishing her child this way for as long as it takes. Providing antibodies and other nutrients, Brayden will grow up faster and healthier. Mommy Zoe rattles off that breastfeeding will also help to shrink her uterus and lose weight faster, and tighten her skin.<br><br>Â“Breastfeeding helps to bond mother and child. But it keeps me very busy; I keep on feeding and I feel like a cow! I feed him every 3 hours, lasting 1 hour each time. I only have two hours left for myself,Â” she groaned, delight evident in her voice and face nevertheless.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The confinement period</span><br>Zoe will be sticking to the ways of the traditional confinement period all because of vanity! She believes this 1-month period, where mothers undergo a lifestyle and dietary change to force out the chills in their body, will strengthen her body, prevent body aches and improve her complexion.<br><br>Just how Â‘extremeÂ’ is Zoe going? She enthralled us with her current lifestyle: Â“I donÂ’t shower, but IÂ’m not smelly, donÂ’t worry! I wipe myself clean twice a day with a mixture of rice wine and herbs. I wrap myself up with no air con and no fans, so IÂ’m always carrying a handkerchief to wipe away the perspiration. I can change my attire up to 10 times a day. Friends call me crazy!Â”<br><br>Besides wearing the girdle that her husband gave her since her delivery, Zoe has also just started the traditional Indonesian massage to tighten her skin today. Diet-wise, she eats only home-cooked food, and drinks what she brought from home, like ginger tea and milk. Cold food and drinks are strictly a big no-no. Best pals and fellow artistes Pan Lingling, and Huang Shinan had also brought the traditional dish pig trotters in vinegar for Zoe.<br><br>ZoeÂ’s mum, mother-in-law, her Indonesian maid and a confinement helper are now currently assisting her in taking care of Brayden. Philip will be returning to Korea for his work duties in a few days. In the meantime, Zoe intends to fully enjoy her entitled 3 months maternity leave. She'll be endorsing Similac Follow-On milk formula. Her next baby? Oh, Zoe's not thinking about having another one now, but when the day comes, she hopes it'll be a girl to complete the perfect family!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO "Brayden" sounds nice, but not so nice written.... because of the donkey brays connection<br><br>But if they spelt it "Braden / Bradon", there'd be a confusion about pronouncing it as "brad-den".  So I guess that explains the first spelling.<br><br></div>
