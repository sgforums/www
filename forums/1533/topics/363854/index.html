              </p><div class="image_caption" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">Noriko Sakai</span></strong></p>
              </div>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">One evening in late May, Noriko Sakai was entering the luxury condominium 
              that is her home with an armful of shopping bags, followed by her son. But her 
              husband was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Over 20 successful years as a singer and actress, Sakai, popularly known as 
              Nori-P, has evolved from a young pop idol to a “mama-doru” (an idol who is also 
              a mother), appearing on the cover of parenting magazines and performing in a PR 
              film on the new jury system as a housewife.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">In 1998, Sakai married a professional surfer, the son of the owner of a 
              prominent sporting goods chain store. She learned to surf herself and used to 
              invite her friends, SMAP member Takuya Kimura and singer Shizuka Kudo, who later 
              married.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Besides her work in the entertainment industry, the singer/actress founded 
              her own fashion brand and the public image of Sakai as a good mother and wife is 
              well established.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">But a friend says, “They are the kind of couple that often quarrel but in a 
              way that usually doesn’t affect their marriage.  Recently she came to consult 
              about another fight they had… but something was different this time. It seems 
              her husband is having an affair and she kicked him out of their home.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">The husband is currently staying at their vacation house in Chiba. According 
              to his acquaintance, the husband initially said he was there to concentrate on 
              surfing, but appeared depressed and admitted that his wife asked for a 
              divorce.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">On another Sunday afternoon, Nori-P left her home with her son, driving her 
              Porsche. The husband was absent. Around 7 p.m., she came out again with her son 
              and another boy who appeared to be a friend. Sakai returned an hour later with 
              supermarket bags. The husband was not seen throughout the day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">So what’s really going on with the 11-year marriage?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">A long-time friend of the couple disclosed that the two had a huge row during 
              their trip to Okinawa during Golden Week. The husband admitted that it was his 
              fault, but also complained that he was stressed about being acknowledged only as 
              “Nori-P’s husband.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Sakai’s pet name for her husband is “An-chan,” which comes from the main 
              character in the TV drama that marked the change in her career from a pop idol 
              to an actress. Even his nickname is related to Sakai’s work in the entertainment 
              industry… perhaps having a famous idol as wife comes with its own problems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">As far as Shukan Post is aware, the couple is living separately. But the 
              representative of Sakai’s management company denied any knowledge about 
              estrangement or divorce between the couple. “I just spoke to her on the phone 
              and she laughed and said her husband was sitting next to her.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">“It’s true that the two tend to get very emotional when they quarrel, and 
              Sakai’s husband is often away to surf in Chiba. But there’s nothing new to that. 
              And people get weary of married life. It happens to anyone.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">But the husband still hasn’t been seen at their home.</span></p>
