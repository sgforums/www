              <p>Monday, November 15th, 2010<br>Mel Gibson Had To Slap His Girlfriend To Save His Baby, Says Mel Gibson</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.thefablife.com/files//2010/11/melgibsonoksanagetty.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="540"></p>

              <p><br>Details from Mel Gibson's explosive January fight with baby mama Oksana Grigorieva have been released â€“ well, his side at least.</p>
              <p>In the "Braveheart" star's sworn declaration, dated June 23 and obtained by TMZ.com, Gibson admitted to slapping his ex-girlfriend across the face, but denies that he ever punched her.</p>
              <p>Grigorieva, 40, claims the actor punched her in the temple and in the mouth - knocking out two teeth - during the fight that resulted in a domestic violence investigation by the L.A. County Sheriff's Department.</p>
              <p>However, Gibson, 54, paints a different story about what happened that night.</p>
              <p>The actor claimed Grigorieva grabbed the couple's daughter Lucia, now 1, out of her bassinet during the heated argument and screamed, "Stop yelling or you will make her into a retarded brain-damaged idiot!"</p>
              <p>She then allegedly turned and ran about 75 yards with the child into the dimly lit backyard, near thorny trees. Gibson said he pleaded with Grigorieva to bring their daughter back inside.</p>
              <p>She purportedly agreed but then ran into her older son's room, where Gibson claimed she "started swinging Lucia erratically in her arms, jerking her body from side to side to keep Lucia out of my reach."</p>
              <p>Grigorieva's "rapid movements were causing Lucia's little body to be flung from one side to the other, her head shaking violently," Gibson alleged, adding that he feared the swift motion would result in Shaken Baby Syndrome.</p>
              <p>As the "hysterical" Russian musician refused to hand the baby over, Gibson said he slapped Grigorieva "one time with an open hand in an attempt to bring her back to reality."</p>
              <p>"I did not slap her hard, I was just trying to shock her so that she would stop screaming, continuing shaking Lucia back and forth," Gibson stated in the court documents.</p>
              <p>He added, "I did not hit Oksana with a closed fist, as she alleges. I did not ever punch her in the face or in the temple or anywhere else, not then or at any other time. There was never any blood on Oksana and none of her teeth were 'broken,' although one of the false veneers from a tooth apparently did come off, I did not see that occur at the time."</p>
              <p>Photos allegedly taken one day after the couple's fight emerged in July, showing Grigorieva's face undamaged but with one chipped veneer and another one missing.</p>
              <p>"While I do not believe I handled the situation as well as I should have, I was worried about the rough way Oksana was shaking and tossing Lucia around," Gibson added. "My hand never touched any part of Lucia."</p>
              <p>Gibson's story could help in his defense in the domestic violence case because the actor said he used reasonable force to protect his child from injury.</p>
              <p>Though Grigorieva previously claimed Gibson bruised their child during the altercation, the pediatrician who examined the baby the following day saw no evidence of injury, according to TMZ.</p>
              <p>Gibson and Grigorieva came face to face last week during a courtroom showdown over custody and child support.</p>
              <p>The troubled actor was ordered to pay Grigorieva $60,000 in back child support, E! News reported. He allegedly held off on paying the money until he knew whether he could deduct the $6,000 he already was coughing up for a house where Grigorieva lives with her mom and daughter.</p>
              <p>Grigorieva was hoping to stop him from having overnight visits with Lucia, claiming she was concerned that a nanny was the primary caregiver and Lucia was isolated in her dad's big house. But the judge said he would address visitation issues at a later date - possibly next year.</p>
              <p>Gibson and Grigorieva are expected back in court Nov. 22.</p>
