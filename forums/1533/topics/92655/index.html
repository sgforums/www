So I have been moving around slowly, like an old woman. I've been doing some yoga and swimming too, to help this condition.'<br><br>Baby preparations: Evelyn is still waiting for Darren to be free to help her with the shopping.<br><br>'Right now, our house is quite child-unfriendly, so we will need to child-proof the home, buy baby items and also get a baby cot for our room, since the baby will be sleeping with us.'<br><br></div>

But, to us, as long as the baby's healthy and is ours, it doesn't matter what sex the child is.'<br><br>Baby's name: 'I'm looking for a name that would go well with my husband's surname, Kong. My favourite is Ray, which means King. So it's another way to name my son King Kong without, you know, giving him a funny name. But my husband doesn't want it!' said Sun cheekily.<br><br>Planned or accidental parenthood: Accidental.<br><br>Sun, who has suffered two miscarriages, knew about her pregnancy only when blood tests were done when she was warded for a stomach ailment in May.<br><br>Big belly blues: Because she suffered bleeding in her womb, the singer had to be confined to her bed for the first three months. She also received regular hormone injections. Her condition has stabilised recently.<br><br>The singer - who's married to City Harvest Church founder Reverend Kong Hee - said: 'I drag my feet during meal times, I always feel nauseated or about to faint. And after I vomit, I will quickly ask for something to eat, to put it back, so that my baby won't starve.'<br><br>Baby preparations: Sun, who's going to Los Angeles in a few weeks' time to record her fourth album, is going to shop for maternity and baby items there.<br><br>She said: 'I went shopping for maternity clothes the other day, but all the dresses... they are not to my taste.<br><br>'So I can't wait to get my things from LA. I'm even thinking of getting my baby cot from there. Quite ridiculous, I know.'<br><br></div>

But she hopes it's a girl 'because girls are more obedient'.<br><br>Baby's name: None yet.<br><br>Planned parenthood or accident: Planned.<br><br>Zoe said she and her hubby, airforce pilot Philip Chionh, had wanted to start a family since 2002, but his regular overseas postings disrupted their plans.<br><br>She took leave in June to fly to the US to be with him, but he was posted back instead - which gave them time to make a baby right here!<br><br>Big belly blues: Nausea all day long, and she can't stand the smell of fish and oily food.<br><br>'I'm also very sensitive to sounds and fragrances,' she said. 'When I'm at home, I like it to be super quiet... but can still play mahjong over the weekend.'<br><br>Baby preparations: Both Zoe and her hubby have been reading a lot of books.<br><br>She has also been popping supplements prescribed by the doctor, and drinking lots of milk.<br><br></div>
