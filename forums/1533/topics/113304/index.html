Tuesday.<br><br>The nuptials took place on Lamu's Shella island, off Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, guests told People magazine. Only close family members and a handful of friends were in attendance.<br><br>Anderson, 36, and Ozanne, 42, were married in a civil ceremony by the local district officer and their union was blessed by a Kenyan priest. A choir sang hymns in Swahili in the background, per People.<br><br>Anderson's 10-year-old daughter, Piper, from her first marriage to movie art director Clyde Klotz, served as her mother's bridesmaid.<br><br>After the vows were said, the couple hosted their guests at a seafood-heavy feast of lobster, crab and prawns, People reported. A fire dancer and fireworks provided the entertainment.<br><br>The couple have lived together in London since 2002, the year that Anderson wrapped a nine-year stint as Agent Dana Scully on The X-Files.<br><br>Since the show's demise, Anderson has maintained a relatively low profile, focusing primarily on stage acting.<br><br>However, the thesp has two upcoming films in the works, The Mighty Celt and Tristam Shandy and will likely soon be at work on a sequel to 1998's feature length X-Files film with creator Chris Carter and former small-screen partner David Duchovny.<br><br>"It does indeed appear that the XF movie will be underway in the next year but a lot has to happen between now and then and a lot can happen between now and then," Anderson wrote on her official Website in July. "But it looks promising. Chris does not want to reveal at this point who or what will be in it but I got the impression it's going to be one scary mother."<br><br>Earlier this month at the 10th Annual Critics' Choice Awards, Anderson's X-cohort, Duchovny, who played Agent Fox Mulder in the series, told USA Today that he had been talking with Carter about their planned Files follow-up.<br><br>"It'll be a stand-alone horror movie," Duchovny said. "Mulder and Scully investigate one particular case that has nothing to do with alien life. It has to do with supernatural stuff."<br><br>Keep your fingers crossed, X-PhilesÂ—it appears the truth may still be out there.<br><br></div>
