               Dennis Chew's face now masks  a long career struggle many do not know

              of the local  entertainment industry shares how he toiled for 23 years 
              before  belatedly finding success in 2009, ironically in the guise of a 
              woman —  Auntie Lucy. </em></p>

              <p>Popular radio and TV personality <a href="http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Chong_Qing_%28Dennis_Chew%29">Dennis Chew</a> is a man in demand these days — mostly as a woman.</p>
              <p>He returned to Singapore last Thursday (1 March) after spending two days in Kuala Lumpur promoting the <a href="http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Tong">Kelvin Tong</a>-produced movie <a href="http://http//www.moviexclusive.com/detail.php?c=53&amp;#38;desc=D&amp;#38;p=1358&amp;#38;t=dance-dance-dragon-2012_1358">"Dance Dance Dragon"</a>, in which he played the role of a spinster yearning for love.</p>
              <p>But viewers familiar with local TV will know that this is not the 
              first time Chew has crossed the male-female divide and played a woman.</p>
              <p>In 2009, he took on another cross-dressing role in the Channel 8 variety show <a href="http://http//www.facebook.com/pages/Paris-and-Milan/120942261639">"Paris and Milan" </a>that also starred funnywomen <a href="http://http//entertainment.xin.msn.com/en/celebrity/bios/Patricia-Mok.aspx">Patricia Mok</a> and <a href="http://http//www.facebook.com/pages/Michelle-Tay-%E9%83%91%E8%8D%94%E5%88%86/106322699733">Michelle Tay</a>.</p>
              <p>That role, <a href="http://https//twitter.com/#%21/auntylucyfc">Auntie Lucy</a>, transformed Chew's showbiz career and finally gave him the fame and popularity he craved.</p>
              <p>The fictitious character — in which Chew fashioned himself into a 
              bespectacled woman with a penchant for tossing back her imaginary long 
              hair and uttering the phrase "so embarrassing" — grew so popular that it
               even has its own <a href="http://http//www.facebook.com">Facebook </a>page and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter </a>account.</p>
              <p>Watch Dennis Chew as Auntie Lucy here:<br> <br> This belated fame also translated into a financial windfall for Chew. 
              Advertisers so enamoured of Auntie Lucy flocked to Chew offering 
              advertising deals for products that run the gamut from cooking oil and 
              steamboat restaurant to furniture and jewellery stores.</p>
              <p>"I have seven endorsement deals in total," Chew gleefully revealed during this interview at the <a href="http://http//www.stregissingapore.com/">St Regis Hotel</a>, where he was having a leisurely afternoon spa treatment.</p>
              <p>The six-figure income - Chew declined to reveal the exact amount - 
              from the endorsement deals has also helped to clear the debts he 
              incurred when a business venture failed in 2007.</p>
              <p>Yet, despite the many positives that Auntie Lucy brought to his life,
               Chew admitted he felt "slightly confused" in the early days of the 
              character's undoubted success.</p>
              <p>But he has since come round to it. "I realise that cross-dressing and
               being Auntie Lucy is part of my work. I'm just more special to (be able
               to) perform as both a man and a woman," he said in crisp Mandarin. "The
               fortunate thing is I know what my real self is, and that is Dennis 
              Chew."</p>
              <p>More than that, Chew is now also at peace with the seemingly 
              difficult lot life deals him at first. "Everything I want in life, I 
              have to wait very long for it. My life is typically <em>'Xian Ku Hou Tian' (</em>Chinese for tasting success after initial hardship)," he said melodramatically.</p>
              <p><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-right" style="width: 630px;"><a href="http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/blogs/singaporeshowbiz/DC2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1642" title="Chew (second from L) with his parents and younger sister when he was young (Photo courtesy of Dennis Chew)" src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/P6JmIoUYcW6KNBfONh_Q8Q--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/blogs/singaporeshowbiz/DC2.jpg" alt="Chew (second from L) with his parents and younger sister when he was young (Photo courtesy of Dennis Chew)" width="630" height="400"></a><span class="legend">Chew (second from L) with his parents and younger sister when he was young (Photo courtesy of Dennis Chew)</span></span></p>
              <p><strong>'My father hit me when he was drunk'</strong></p>
              <p>Chew may be 38 this year, but his appearance is anything but 
              middle-aged. His youthful-looking face betrays little signs of his age 
              and he came for this interview dressed like a teenager, in a boyish 
              T-shirt and bermudas and with his bowl-shaped hairstyle uncombed.</p>
              <p>Adding to his overall child-like demeanour is the admission that he 
              likes to go to game arcades and is the proud owner of a range of 
              expensive <a href="http://http//www.blythedoll.com/index-e.html">Blythe dolls</a>, a brand of Japanese collector dolls.</p>
              <p>In a way, he said, his hobbies are to make up for a childhood that is no less dramatic than his career.</p>
              <p>Born the elder of two children, Chew grew up in a one-room HDB flat 
              in Chin Swee Road to a father who was unemployed and a mother who was a 
              babysitter. His parents are now 71 and 67, respectively, while his only 
              sister, Jane, now 33, is an administrative clerk.</p>
              <p>To supplement the household's income, Chew entered the workforce when
               he was barely nine years old. "My maternal grandfather was a Chinese 
              physician, and so at that time, I would take a bus from Chin Swee road 
              to Boon Lay with a bag full of perfume and Chinese medicated oil to sell
               them from door to door," Chew recalled.</p>
              <p>During his growing up years, Chew's father drank regularly and "would hit me when he got home drunk", he shared candidly.</p>
              <p>The elderly man still enjoys taking to the bottle now despite 
              doctors' advice for him to quit. But Chew is not living with his family 
              anymore. Instead, he shares a five-room flat in Choa Chu Kang with his 
              nanny.</p>
              <p>"My job can be very stressful and I need my quiet and just stare at 
              the ceiling when I get home at night. I won't have that luxury if I live
               with my family," he explained.</p>
              <p>But he says he is not shirking his responsibility towards his 
              parents. "I still go home quite regularly, but before I go home, I will 
              call home to make sure my father hasn't been drinking. If he has, then I
               won't go back. I'm still fearful when I think of what happened to me 
              when I was young."</p>
              <p>He also foots his father's medical bills and picks up the tab from 
              his drinking habit. "He will ask me for money to pay for his drinking 
              whenever I go home," Chew said matter-of-factly.</p>
              <p>"I love my father and I hope he can change some of his bad habits, 
              like drinking. I know he can do it but just that he doesn't want to," he
               added sadly.</p>
              <p>Chew's sister described her brother as a responsible and loving elder
               sibling. She told Yahoo! Singapore: "We see my brother whenever we miss
               him. Nowadays with a phone, it's very easy to stay in touch."</p>
              <p>Talking about Chew also brought a tinge of pride to her voice. "My 
              brother has always been very independent from young. He started going to
               the market to buy things for the family when he was around nine because
               my mother had to look after me."</p>
              <p>But his mother, housewife Lim Hiang Lung, still pines for Chew to 
              move back home: "My son is a very filial boy. He will share everything 
              with me, including his work and his problems. I will be most happy if he
               moves back with me but I will let him choose what he wants."</p>

              aspiration and how a failed business venture didn't deter him from 
              trying again. </em></p>
              <p><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-right" style="width: 630px;"><a href="http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/blogs/singaporeshowbiz/DC4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1658 " title="Chew wanted to be a star from a young age (Photo courtesy of Dennis Chew)" src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/gO7eJ8qd3VeBPqB2tEip5g--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/blogs/singaporeshowbiz/DC4.jpg" alt="Chew wanted to be a star from a young age (Photo courtesy of Dennis Chew)" width="630" height="500"></a><span class="legend">Chew wanted to be a star from a young age (Photo courtesy of Dennis Chew)</span></span></p>
              <p>Despite his tumultuous childhood, Chew said he was a happy child and 
              harboured hopes of one day becoming a star from an early age.</p>
              <p>His mother attested to Chew's star aspirations, "From young he always
               liked to watch TV, whether it is Chinese, Malay or Indian programs and 
              pretend to be like the actors."</p>
              <p>His dream came true when he was picked by local theatre company <a href="http://www.practice.org.sg/">The Theatre Practice </a>to star in a musical in 1988.</p>
              <p>Although he played only a bit-part role, the experience stirred his 
              passion for theatre works. "I was envious of people who got to sing solo
               on stage and I wanted to do that too," he said in between sips of his 
              milkshake.</p>
              <p><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-right" style="width: 630px;"><a href="http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/blogs/singaporeshowbiz/DC10.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1659" title="Chew with Goh Boon Teck, director of the musical &amp;#34;881&amp;#34; (Photo courtesy of Dennis Chew)" src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/.17OG5N57JJN1.I0afPA6g--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/blogs/singaporeshowbiz/DC10.jpg" alt="Chew with Goh Boon Teck, director of the musical &amp;#34;881&amp;#34; (Photo courtesy of Dennis Chew)" width="630" height="382"></a><span class="legend">Chew with Goh Boon Teck, director of the musical "881" (Photo courtesy of Dennis Chew)</span></span></p>
              <p>Alas, his next chance at experiencing theatre in the flesh came only 
              more than 20 years later when he was approached to play a role in the 
              musical adaptation of the <a href="http://http//www.facebook.com/pages/Royston-Tan-%E9%99%88%E5%AD%90%E8%B0%A6/125988763703">Royston Tan </a>movie <a href="http://video.xin.msn.com/watch/video/881/1hy2w1tzo">"881"</a> last year.</p>
              <p>"When <a href="http://http//gohboonteck.com/index.html">Goh Boon Teck</a> (the musical's director) called me, my thoughts were 'Why do I always 
              have to wait so long?'" he said, tears welling up in his eyes.</p>
              <p>Likewise, belated recognition on the small screen arrived for Chew only in broadcaster <a href="http://http//www.mediacorp.sg/en/home">MediaCorp's</a> annual <a href="http://http//starawards2010.mediacorptv.sg/">Star Awards in 2010, </a>after Auntie Lucy became a TV sensation.</p>
              <p>He was named one of the Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes for the 
              first time despite making the shortlist on a few previous occasions.</p>
              <p>"There is an old Chinese saying <em>'Xin Xiang Shi Chen'</em> which 
              means when you keep thinking about something, it might come true one 
              day. I think it really applies to me," he mused, while again on the

              <p>Chew's career story certainly reads like the script of a Channel 8 drama series.</p>
              <p>In 1989, a year after starring in his first play, the then 
              16-year-old took his first stab at stardom when he signed up in a 
              hosting competition organised by the former Singapore Broadcasting 
              Corporation (SBC).</p>
              <p>While he did not win the contest, his flair did not go unnoticed and 
              he was soon offered a stint at hosting a TV program once a week.</p>
              <p>One day while he was in Caldecott Hill for the TV recording, an 
              executive overheard him talking in the lift and liked his voice enough 
              to offer him a chance at becoming a radio DJ.</p>
              <p>"When he brought me to the radio studio, I was amazed and thought to 
              myself this is the job I want to do. It is more challenging than TV 
              because I can only rely on my voice. I could wear singlet and slippers 
              to work. I thought it was so cool," he said, breaking into a loud 
              guffaw.</p>
              <p>The next thing he knew, Chew was hosting a youth program on <a href="http://http//www.facebook.com/capital958">95.8 Capital FM</a>. He soon moved to the more youthful <a href="http://http//www.mediacorpradio.sg/hearsee.htm">93.3 FM </a>station, where the popular DJ, known to listeners by his Chinese name Zhou Chongqing, has remained since.</p>

              <p><strong>A second shot at business</strong></p>
              <p>These days, while Auntie Lucy only makes the occasional appearances in TV commercials, Chew's visibility remains high.</p>
              <p>He recently wrapped up filming another movie that is scheduled for release in May.</p>
              <p>In the film "Ghost On Air", Chew plays a radio DJ who hosts a ghost 
              storytelling program on air — a reference to his real-life popular "Zhou
               Gong Jiang Gui" (Grandpa Zhou Talks About Ghosts) segment that ended 
              its run on 93.3 recently.</p>
              <p>The movie is directed by <a href="http://http//www.facebook.com/pages/Cheng-Ding-An/113200255357001">Cheng Ding An</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMWzNi9taGk">"Kallang Roar"</a>) and also stars former Miss Singapore <a href="http://http//www.euniceolsen.com/">Eunice Olsen</a>.</p>
              <p>Last July, Chew also became a boss — again — when he invested 
              $100,000 to open a restaurant in Tanjong Katong with three partners. 
              This new venture came after a failed attempt at entrepreneurship in 
              2005, when he invested $300,000 in a bridal business.</p>
              <p>Then, tried as he might — he even offered free emcee-ing service with
               the wedding packages — Chew could not keep the business afloat and when
               the shop finally closed in 2007, he found himself saddled with a 
              $160,000 debt, which he returned to a relative only after Auntie Lucy 
              shot to popularity in 2009.</p>
              <p>"On hindsight, I realised I went into the bridal business without 
              first learning about it. I didn't know how to design bridal gowns and 
              had to rely on people to help with every aspect of the shop.</p>
              <p>"When my bridal business failed, I told myself I would never go into 
              business again. But last year, I said 'nothing ventured, nothing gained'
               and decided to give it another shot," Chew explained.</p>
              <p>Chew said the restaurant is closed "for the time being" since 29 February, as one of the partners withdrew his share recently.</p>
              <p>"The rest of us thought that since he left, we might as well close 
              the restaurant first and look for a bigger space in town, as location is
               important," Chew explained.</p>
              <p>He added that he made "only a slight loss" on his initial outlay, but declined to reveal the exact amount.</p>
              <p>With the estimated six-figure income from his various endorsement 
              deals sitting pretty in his bank account, Chew started to acquire a 
              taste in expensive, designer products. In his wardrobe now are branded 
              bags from Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, Hermes , Hugo Boss and Christian Dior.</p>
              <p>He has also invested in stocks, which he said are performing "quite 
              well". He declined to reveal more details about his investments.</p>
              <p><strong>'My life story should be able to motivate a few people'</strong></p>
              <p>While Chew is grateful for the success he now has, he said he could 
              be a role-model for people facing difficulties in their lives.</p>
              <p>"Look at me. I am not handsome, neither am I tall and yet I can be a 
              host and a lead actor in movies," he said. "My point is sometimes when 
              you have a dream, try your best and go for it. Don't be easily 
              discouraged. Dreams can come true if you work hard."</p>
              <p>His mother had the last words: "I will always pray for him that he 
              will be happy and successful in what he does. He is a very good boy."</p>
