Karthik, a man who waited five hours to see the film, was quoted as saying.<br><br>Tickets to all 800 seats in Kuala Lumpur's landmark Coliseum cinema sold out within an hour, enraging people who had queued for up to four hours.<br><br>The film's distributors said heavy rains disrupted delivery of some prints to theatres while others were held up by delays in receiving passwords for Internet downloads -- a strategy meant to frustrate Malaysia's notorious movie pirates, the Star said.<br><br>The movie was made for more than $15 million, a huge budget by Indian standards, and is that country's most expensive film.<br><br>Rajnikanth, 57, a flamboyant regional star who is the film's hero, has almost a cult following in India's southern states, where tickets have been sold out for weeks.<br><br>(source: <a href="http://news.asiaone.com.sg/a1news/20070616_story8_1.html" rel="nofollow">AsiaOne</a>)</div>
