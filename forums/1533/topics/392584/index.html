              <p>I so sad my favourite singer is not a good role model. He is rumoured to have sex with a then 16 year old girl.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i73/uniszero/devin.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200">Devin Wu Pei Shan å�´ä½©ç�Š</p>
              <p class="highlight-text strong">After making the headlines for all the wrong reasons, Taiwanese multi-talented artiste Jay Chou had strong words for the individuals involved.</p>
              <p class="highlight-text">Through no fault of his, the R&amp;B prince has taken the spotlight these past few days not for his TV directorial debut Pandamen but for allegations made by former label-mate Devin Wu and a verbal attack from Taiwanese rapper Dog G.</p>
              <p class="highlight-text">Singer-songwriter Devin recently revealed that Jay is her 'first man' and that she gave her virginity to him when she was just 16. Although their relationship was never made known, the two were believed to be friends.</p>
              <p>Devin and Jay entered the industry together in 1998 through the same talent contest, ran by hosting juggernaut Jacky Wu. She later became part of the now-defunct girl group One-Fifth and had an acting role in the pioneering Taiwanese idol drama Meteor Garden.</p>
              <p>The cast of Jay's self-directed superhero drama Pandamen, including Zhan Yuhao, Devon Song, Will Liu and Jiu Kong, appeared at a charity event last weekend, and reporters were eager to catch the superstar's response to the latest headlines.</p>
              <p>'Has she gone crazy?', was Jay's no-holds-barred answer.</p>
              <p>Jay argued that they were friends but 'never dated'.</p>
              <p>In other related news, after the word got out that Jay's ex-girlfriend Patty Hou is still a virgin, the 31-year-old's relationship with the host was mocked by hip-hop artiste Dog G. The rapper questioned Jay's manliness and his 'barren relationship' with Patty.</p>
              <p>An infuriated Jay shot back at these accusations and called Dog G 'insignificant' and 'a scum of the society'.</p>

              <p>I think going public about what they did in their past is inapprioriate and unnecessary. Unless there's a hidden agenda with benefits behind it, otherwise they have to be really crazy to do a tell-it-all coverage.</p>
              <p>At least she claimed that she "GAVE" her virginity to him, and not he "STOLE" her virginity or she was "ROBBED" of her virginity.</p>
