              SINGAPORE: She is celebrating her 20th anniversary as a musician and is a mother to a 14-year-old; however, this 34-year-old "Queen of J-Pop" still looks like she is in her twenties.
              
              So, what exactly is Japanese R&amp;B Namie Amuro's elixir of youth?
              
              The doll-like singer giggled and shook her head profusely when she got complimented about her youthful appearance.
              
              "Just relax!" said the petite singer, who is best known for her hits such as "Can You Celebrate?" and "Chase the Chance".
              
              "When I'm tired, I have a half-bath in a tub to get my sweat out and that really relaxes me.
              
              "And when I'm not working, I really do nothing but just relax at home," shared Amuro, who was all smiles when she met reporters in Singapore at Marina Bay Sands' KU DÃ‰ TA lounge on Friday, to promote her new album "Uncontrolled" and her big 20th anniversary concert tour in Japan.
              
              This being her maiden visit to Singapore, the J-Pop queen could not hide her excitement when she talked about the local delicacies and tourists' attractions.
              
              "I'll be having chili crab for dinner!" said Amuro, who confessed to having heard a lot about this local dish that many other foreign celebrities love.
              
              "Many of us (Amuro and her staff) want to visit the Night Safari too," she added before cordially asking the media for more recommendations on other places of interest in Singapore.
              
              Amuro was amicable and unguarded during the media conference, and appeared to be unaffected by the events in her dramatic life.
              
              From her shotgun marriage to Japanese boy band TRF member Sam at the peak of her career in 1997, to her mother's murder by a family member two years later and her divorce with Sam in 2002, which left her a single parent to her son Haruto, her life over the past 20 years has been like a roller-coaster ride.
              
              But Amuro was calm and composed when she responded to questions about her experiences, as well as what her most difficult times and her biggest sacrifices in the past two decades were.
              
              "Of course there were difficult periods but I just tell myself, 'Well, that's life â€“ there's good and bad times!' and it was with that attitude that I managed to come this far.
              
              "These 20 years have been a very enjoyable time for me and I don't think there was any sacrifice to speak of," said Amuro.
              
              The star also added that she merely "tried to meet the expectations" of her staff and fans who have supported her throughout the 20 years.
              
              "Fans are a really, really important presence in my life," said Amuro, emphasizing that without her supportive fans, she would not be able to hold any concerts at all.
              
              Speaking to her Singapore fans, Amuro said, "I would really love to hold a concert in Singapore!
              
              "If that really happens, I really hope all of you can come to my concert," she added while looking at the 20 lucky screaming fans, who were picked from the hundreds of fans that applied for the chance to join the media conference.
