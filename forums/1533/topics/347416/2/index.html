              <p><span class="headline style23">Playing big brother at dad's funeral </span></p>
              <p><span class="headline style23">
              </span></p><p> </p>
              <p>IT WAS a quiet, low-key send-off for Christopher Lee's father in their Malacca hometown yesterday.</p>
              <p>There wasn't the usual fanfare one would have expected from a man who has made it the Ah Ge (big brother) status in Singapore showbiz.</p>
              <p>No dazzling presence of celebrities. Not even a representative from Christopher's employer MediaCorp - though the leading man told The New Paper on Sunday that the company had sent a wreath.</p>
              <p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" width="300" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              </p>
              <p>Christopher's girlfriend, fellow actress Fann Wong, also did not manage to make it to the funeral. (See report on facing page.)</p>
              <p>There was also no boisterous band playing evergreens and the latest pop hits. Instead, the band was from neighbourhood school, Yok Bin National Type Secondary School.</p>
              <p>Everything was typical of the kampung boy who found fame (and for a while, infamy) in the bright city.</p>
              <p>Christopher, 37, had returned to his roots - and it was clear he was most comfortable in his home.</p>
              <p>At the wake on Friday night at Jalan Teratai, he pointed out to a group of about 20 men seated at a table and said: 'See them, they've grown up together with my brothers and I.'</p>
              <p>Many of these men would return the following morning and accompany Christopher as he and his family sent their father off - on his last journey - to the Melaka Memorial Park Crematorium.</p>
              <p>His father died on Tuesday morning after battling chronic heart disease for nearly two years.</p>
              <p>As the monk performed the Buddhist rites, Christopher and his family members struggled to keep their composure.</p>
              <p>But when it came for the final viewing before the coffin cover was closed, loud wails could be heard from the living room of the two-storey family home.</p>
              <p>Christopher's mother, who also suffers from health problems and is unable to walk fully, was seated on a sofa a little further away.</p>
              <p>As she watched her children calling out to their father, she too broke down quietly.</p>
              <p><strong>Man in the family</strong></p>
              <p>In the end, it was Christopher who assumed the role of the man in the family - one that he has always been accustomed to.</p>
              <p>He has an elder sister, who is married, and two younger brothers.</p>
              <p>As Christopher had told this newspaper in an earlier interview: 'I used to do all the housework and I helped to take care of my brothers.</p>
              <p>'That's what being in a family is all about - you should never be calculative.'</p>
              <p>Something that youngest brother, Mingzhong, 33, appreciates and cherishes.</p>
              <p>At the crematorium, he had broken down so badly that Christopher had to hold on to and comfort him.</p>
              <p>Mingzhong, who is also an actor but working in Kuala Lumpur, told The New Paper on Sunday: 'That's the way Christopher has always been - he's always there for us.</p>
              <p>'We can go to him for anything - be it to seek his advice or just to confide in him. And no matter how busy he is, he'd always find time for us.'</p>
              <p>Mingzhong added: 'And in some ways, there's comfort in knowing that Christopher will continue to assume the big brother role - and now, the protective father figure.'</p>
              <p>Whether it is in Singapore, at home or even in the quiet town he grew up, Christopher's big brother status remained undisputed.</p>
              <p>As the funeral procession made its way down Jalan Ujong Pasir, several neighbours, shopkeepers and stall assistants stopped to watch them from a distance.</p>
              <p>At a cofffee shop several metres away, some stall assistants were discussing the likeness in looks between Christopher and Mingzhong.</p>
              <p>One of the women, who wanted to be known only as Madam Chia, said: 'That's our Meng Soon. He's the one who made Malacca famous. Long before The Little Nyonya.'</p>
              <p>Christopher had clearly endeared himself to his neighbours, even though the family moved into the area only about seven years ago.</p>
              <p>Madam Agnes Khoo, 55, said: 'It's his humility despite his star status that appeals.</p>
              <p>'He never fails to flash that boyish grin and friendly nod whenever he meets anyone of us.'</p>
              <p>And it is possibly because of this humility that Christopher did not seem bothered by the lack of fanfare.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I really just want my dad to leave in peace, knowing that we will take care of ourselves.</p>
              <p>'And that he will continue to live in our hearts. Nothing else matters.'</p>

It was too risky for her to drive all the way here in the middle of the night.'<br><br>Christopher said he was also saddened by the public reaction - especially when he and his family members fully understood the situation.<br><br>He said: 'My family members - including my grandmother and my mum - are behind us all the way.<br><br>'No one's blamed her for not being able to make it.'<br><br>Christopher added: 'It really does not matter.

              <p>Father of MediaCorp actor Christopher Lee died in Malacca of heart attack on Feb 10. He was 68 years old. Chris was back in Malacca for the Chinese New Year when it happened; however, his wife-to-be, Fann Wong, was busy with filming in Singapore and unable to get to Malacca. In a phone interview with Xin.sg from Malacca, Chris was clearly choked with sobs as he spoke of his father's sudden death.<br><br>Chris said he had returned to Malacca on the third day of Chinese New Year for reunion dinner with his family and that was an unforgettable night for him. "Everyone was very happy that day. Perhaps we were overjoyed and he forgot to watch his diet," Chris said.<br><br>His father was admitted to the hospital at midnight on the fourth day of Chinese New Year with respiratory problems resulting from fluid in the lungs. He said his father had been admitted twice previously for the same condition and did not expect this to take his life.<br><br>Chris remembers his father to be an independent and forgiving person whom he looks up to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While his fiancée, Fann, had applied for leave to attend his father's wake, Chris revealed to have dissuaded her from doing so.<br><br>"She can definitely travel and get to Malacca by 11pm that night, but after visiting, she has to rush back to Singapore because she has to start work again at 9am the next morning. I am worried about her being on the road in the middle of the night, so I told her not to come," Chris said. Though Fann is unable to attend her future father-in-law's wake, her parents made the trip on her behalf.<br><br>When asked about their wedding which was supposed to take place in September, Chris expressed regret that his father could not witness his eldest son's marriage. Chris said he will only think about his wedding matters after his father's funeral.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">A wedding day regret<br><br></span></strong>By May Seah, TODAY | <br><br>SINGAPORE: While Christopher Lee copes with the loss of his father in Malacca, his fiancee, MediaCorp artiste Fann Wong, wishes he didn't have to go through it without her love and support. <br><br>At the age of 71, Christopher's father, Lee Soo Kim, suffered a heart attack and died on Tuesday morning. <br><br>When TODAY spoke to Fann over the telephone on Wednesday, the actress sounded distraught and found it difficult to phrase her sentences clearly. She said that she very much wants to be at the wake in Malacca, but is tied up filming the upcoming blockbuster Channel 8 drama, "The Ultimatum", production for which is running behind schedule. <br><br>"I tried applying for urgent leave, but ... I have filming schedules back to back. I want to go up there and support him, but I can't just go MIA (missing in action) on production. Right now it's very tough for me because my whole family is in Malacca, and it just breaks my heart that I can't be there for him, too." <br><br>The funeral will be held on Saturday, but Fann doesn't know if she will be able to attend. <br><br>Earlier on Wednesday, Christopher had told TODAY that both he and his brother are taking care of the funeral arrangements, but that he felt a great sense of responsibility as the oldest son. <br><br>"He gave us a lot of freedom," said the 37-year-old actor of his father. "He didn't try to constrain us or control our lives - what we wanted to study in school, what sport we wanted to play or where we wanted to go. He gave us the scope to be independent." <br><br>Fann remembers Mr Lee as a "quiet man, but he was a very sweet person". <br><br>"Every time I visited their house in Malacca, his dad would be the first one to open the gate and welcome us. You could tell from the joy on his face that he was really happy to see us," said the 38-year-old star of "The Wedding Game". <br><br>"When he was unconscious in the hospital, I asked Chris to let me talk to him on the phone. Chris was telling me that even though he was unconscious, whenever I spoke to him, he would have some reaction." <br><br>Fann's future father-in-law had been eagerly awaiting her and Christopher's wedding day, but, tragically, the event will take place months too late for him to witness. About whether the older Lee's death will affect her September wedding plans, Fann said: "I'm not thinking about that right now because it just wouldn't be right." <br><br>Choking back tears, Fann barely managed to tell TODAY: "I'm sure Chris wanted to have his dad watch him walk down the aisle with me. And I'm sure his father always wanted to see his firstborn son get married. <br><br>"It definitely will be something I'll regret on my wedding day."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Fann Wong 'OK' to stop filming but future in-laws were worried</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpl6EQ7W.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="200"></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: MediaCorp actress Fann Wong was given the green-light to stop filming and attend the wake in Malacca of her to-be father-in-law who died on Tuesday of a heart attack. <br><br>Clarifying articles regarding Fann which were published in Singapore Press Holding Chinese presses, MediaCorp said the actress immediately informed Artiste Management her intention to attend the wakes on learning about the unfortunate incident. <br><br>"Artiste Management then discussed with Production on the possibility of taking Fann out from the set, for her to attend the wakes in Malacca" said Andrew Cheng, Senior Vice President of MediaCorp's Artiste Management &amp; Production Resource. <br><br>In a statement released Friday evening, Cheng said that despite the very tight schedule, it was agreed that Fann would be released on Wednesday 11 February and filming would be delayed till noon on Thursday 12 February. <br><br>"When Christopher and Fann’s mom learnt about this, they were concerned that Fann would be tired after her shoot. <br><br>"Also, it would be dangerous for her to drive up alone at night and having to rush back the following morning. Consequently, they managed to persuade Fann not to attend the wakes” said Cheng in the statement. <br><br>Fann is currently filming "The Ultimatum", a Channel 8 drama. <br><br>She is set to wed in September fellow MediaCorp actor, Christopher Lee who was her co-star in the movie "The Wedding Game" which is currently enjoying a successful run at local theatres.</p>
