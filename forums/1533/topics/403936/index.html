              <p>Korean actor and singer Park Yong Ha was found dead in Seoul Nonhyundong
               on the 30th (KST), hanging lifeless from a cell phone charging cable at
               his own house.<br> <br> According to police, Park Yong Ha was discovered dead at around 5:30 AM 
              by his mother. The cause of death is likely suicide, but further details
               are still under wraps. Although this news was just announced, 'Park 
              Yong Ha' immediately took the number one spot on Naver and other search 
              engines across Korea.<br> <br> It's also been reported that Mr. Park was seen walking to his room after
               massaging his father's legs and back at around 0:40 AM. Park Yong Ha 
              was repeatedly saying "I am sorry" to his family and his father, who is 
              suffering from terminal stomach cancer.<br> <br> Park Yong Ha is well-known for his roles in many hit dramas, including 
              Winter Sonata, Men's Story and On Air. Thanks to those successful roles,
               Park Yong Ha was quite famous in Japan as well. He was also set to play
               the lead role in Love Song, an upcoming Korean drama adaptation of the 
              Chinese movie Chum Mil Mil (ç”›èœœèœœ), alongside Yoon Eun Hye.<br> <br> It's a tragedy to lose such a talented actor so early in his life; our 
              condolences go out to Park Yong Ha's family</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>esp the young ones... education there is hell brutal. Gosh you guys should see how their education system works. night cram schools.</p>
              <p>you think tuition in sg is excessive, the koreans there force their kids into cram schools overnight. literally 20hrs of studying, 4hrs of sleep, and nothing else...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dun believe what kbs, mbc, sbs or the other broadcasting firms in korea show about korean youths being gamers. that is just a small percenta%e.</p>
