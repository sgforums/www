              <p>Suave and charming Raymond Lam is the object of many fan-girls' fantasies. It's hard to imagine that the Hong Kong TVB heartthrob, is less than confident about his looks.</p>
              <p>In town recently for Bio-essence's Nugeno Men Cool's product event, Raymond revealed that he has always lacked confidence. (Video: Raymond talks about his lack of confidence).</p>
              <p>"When on stage I'm just doing what I enjoy; my confidence comes from the fans and audience."</p>
              <p>Raymond also said that while he is not satisfied with the way he looks, he is not bothered by it.</p>
              <p>"I am an actor, so the main focus is on my acting. Whether or not I portray a character well depends on my acting skills and understanding of the character, not on my looks."</p>
              <p>Despite his glamourous appearance, Raymond revealed that he is very casual when not at work. A T-shirt, shorts, slippers and a cap (so he doesn't have to comb his hair) and off he goes, without any fear of the paparazzi taking his 'unglam' photos.</p>
              <p>Raymond, however, is not always so easygoing with the press. Being the son of a property tycoon, media reports often focus on his background, which he hates.</p>
              <p>"I'm fine with reports about me; after all, I'm a celebrity so I'll just treat it as a form of entertainment and promotion."</p>
              <p>"But I've been in the business for 12 years, with a lot of results to show, yet reporters always go back to the same old story about my family background. I feel that since the public already knows who I am, there's no point in talking about it anymore."</p>
              <p>When asked if he would consider refuting media reports through online channels, like what other artistes have done, Raymond replied that he would rather do his job well and let time clear his name.</p>
              <p>The hard-working actor is now busy with an upcoming album in mid-July and a concert at the end of the month. It was also announced earlier that singer Joey Yung would be one of the special guests for Raymond's concert.</p>
              <p>When asked if there would be any intimate interactions between the two of them on-stage, Raymond gave a cheeky reply.</p>
              <p>"She requested for it! And I don't have a problem with it either."</p>
