              <p><strong>'Let people say what they like... We just want to be happy'</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.asiaone.com/a1media/news/04Apr10/20100408.105027_marcus.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>LAST year, he raised eyebrows when news broke that he was dating his personal assistant, who is less than half his age.</p>
              <p>Now, local TV host and radio deejay Marcus Chin's girlfriend, Miss Eileen Cheah, is four months pregnant.</p>
              <p>The proud father-to-be confirmed the pregnancy (it's a girl!) when asked about it at a press conference yesterday.</p>
              <p>He took her to the press conference, for household products brand, V. Care, where he was unveiled as its spokesman.</p>
              <p>They even posed for pictures together.</p>
              <p>Chin, 57, had behaved very differently earlier.</p>
              <p>When The New Paper approached him and his 25-year-old girlfriend for interviews in mid-February to ask them about the burgeoning romance and the rumoured pregnancy, he was reserved and politely turned us down.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Chin seemed bolder and a lot more comfortable at opening up about his relationship with a girl 32 years younger.</p>
              <p>And he had no problems with having Miss Cheah in the limelight.</p>
              <p>With a visible bulge in her tummy, the Malaysian-born lass accompanied him throughout the product launch.</p>
              <p>Although she declined to speak to us, she gamely posed for pictures with her doting boyfriend.</p>
              <p>A picture of domestic bliss, the soon-to-be-father revealed that he was "extremely happy" to have finally fulfilled his ailing mum's wish to see him have a kid of his own.</p>
              <p>His 94-year-old mother, who suffers from slight dementia, had been griping for a long time about his childless state, said Chin.</p>
              <p>"My mum was so elated after I told her the news (Miss Cheah's pregnancy) that even without eating anything, she already felt full. It is probably from too much happiness!" he added.</p>
              <p>It is true love that they share, said Chin.</p>
              <p>While he and Miss Cheah were talking about having kids one day, he asked her: I'm so old, do you really want to have a baby with me?"</p>
              <p>Her response touched him immensely.</p>
              <p>"Not only did she say "yes" without hesitating, she wrote it down in black and white, so that both of us would remember that particular moment," he said.</p>
              <p>Chin had rocked the town last year with news of his divorce, after 23 years of marriage.</p>
              <p>He and his ex-wife, retired Taiwanese singer Ms Murong Ying, 53, are now legally separated.</p>
              <p>The couple do not have children.</p>
              <p>In an interview last November with The New Paper, Ms Murong shared with us the "beautiful beginning" of their relationship.</p>
              <p>They were singing colleagues who subsequently became lovebirds. After one-and-a-half years of dating, they got hitched in 1986.</p>
              <p>Ms Murong could not be reached for her comments on Miss Cheah's pregnancy at press time.</p>
              <p>While Chin basks in his new-found happiness, he acknowledges candidly that he has detractors ever since he went public with his current relationship.</p>
              <p>"Eileen's a young woman solely interested in my money, blah blah, I've heard all that," he said with a look of resignation.</p>
              <p>"If she was indeed only after my money, why would she want to have a kid with me?"</p>
              <p>Taking a serious tone, he explained that certain unique traits in Miss Cheah helped ease any problems their age gap might have thrown up.</p>
              <p>"She might be young, but she doesn't like to go out and have fun like her peers," said Chin.</p>
              <p>"I guess I'm very fortunate in that aspect."</p>
              <p>He added that she helps him in "doing paperwork and handling accounts".</p>
              <p>"If she was the "playing type", I guess we wouldn't have worked out so well.</p>
              <p>"Give her a computer and she'd be very happy to sit in front of it for hours."</p>
              <p>Asked if he is worried about not being able to keep up with his little one when she's born, he said: "Actually, I don't feel old at all.</p>
              <p>"Age is a state of mind, I'm still very young at heart!"</p>
              <p>Marriage is not on the cards for them, as Chin is still in the midst of divorce proceedings with his ex-wife.</p>
              <p>"There are still some details we have to work out before it's finalised," he said.</p>
              <p>He isn't worried about whether Miss Cheah's pregnancy will complicate matters.</p>
              <p>Even if it means paying a hefty alimony to his former spouse.</p>
              <p>"Things will work out fine in the end. That's what I believe," said Chin.</p>
              <p>"I've been in situations where I needed money desperately and money eventually appeared.</p>
              <p>"So, don't worry, I won't die."</p>
              <p>He also takes the derogatory "old cow eats young grass" label - a literal translation of a Chinese colloquial phrase the media has been using to refer to him and Miss Cheah - in his stride, preferring to see the funny side of it.</p>
              <p>Indeed, he is so comfortable with it that he didn't bat an eyelid when print advertisements for health supplement and energy booster Cool Man, of which is he is the spokesman, came out bearing the tag line earlier this year.</p>
              <p>Does it make him sound er, lustful?</p>
              <p>"It's okay, they can write what they want, I don't mind," he said, then proceeded to whip out his name card, which carried the logo of a cow feeding on grass.</p>
              <p>"Let people say what they like, at this age of mine, there is nothing that can hurt my ego any more," said Chin.</p>
              <p>"We just want to be happy."</p>
