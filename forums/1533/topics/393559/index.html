              <div class="content">
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Beleaguered movie director Jack Neo who was embroiled in a series of sensational sex scandals lately had lashed out at a former employee Foyce Le Xuan for accusing him of sexual harrassment.</p>
              <p>Foyce had earlier told the media that Jack had made numerous sexual advances towards her during her stint with his entertainment group. including inviting her to a hotel room to share “personal” and “quiet” moments with him.</p>
              <p>She also claimed that she was gradually dropped from acting assignments and projects because she had rejected all sexual overtures from Jack.</p>
              <p>Speaking to Lianhe Wanbao yesterday, Foyce said she had kept the SMSes Jack had sent her as evidence.</p>
              <p><em>“It makes no sense that so many women besides me have accused him of sexual harrassment too. Jack’s denial shows that he still has not realized his mistake and remain unrepentant,”</em> she added.</p>
              <p>In an interview with Shin Min Daily today, Jack now counter-accused Foyce of lying.</p>
              <p>He said that both of them meet up regularly as they belong to the same church (City Harvest) and questioned why she only came forward with her story now after six years.</p>
              <p><em>“She really has no other motives? Where is the evidence? Can those few SMSes be used as evidence?”</em> Jack questioned.</p>
              <p>He also dismissed the allegations made by a 16 year old girl Maelle Meurzec that he had made sexual overtures towards her.</p>
              <p><em>“How I can go after a 16 year old girl? I will never do that. Her mother even brought her daughter out (to the media spotlight). What is the motive? She said so much? Got any proof?”</em></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Shin Min Daily, 14 March 2010]</strong></p>
              <p>Insiders from the entertainment industry disputed Jack’s defence of himself as it is impossible to provide concrete evidence in such cases.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, both Foyce and Maelle have nothing to gain by sharing their encounters with the media. After all, it is not exactly a proud moment for the women to savor by admitting that they were sexually harrased by a man.</p>
              <p>Jack Neo was reported to be a close friend of Foreign Minister George Yeo who issued a call on Singaporeans to “rally” around him immediately after the scandal erupted.</p>
              <p>He might be having regrets now after seeing how his buddy has handled the saga so far. With Jack coming forward with his story, the media appeared to be less harsh on him and swaying to his side now to lessen the damage from the fallout which is hardly surprising since Jack is closely associated with the PAP.</p>
