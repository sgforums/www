              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>LOS ANGELES: The Church of Scientology denied sending anyone to 
              follow Katie Holmes after she filed for divorce from Tom Cruise, amid 
              reports she feared her husband's plans for their daughter.<br><br>A 
              lawyer for the church also dismissed reports that Cruise -- a prominent 
              Scientologist -- wanted their six-year-old daughter Suri to join the Sea
               Organization, described as a boot camp for the controversial religion.<br><br>"There
               is no truth whatsoever to the TMZ.com report (or any other report) that
               the Church of Scientology has sent anyone to follow or surveil Katie 
              Holmes," lawyer Gary Soter told AFP in an emailed letter.<br><br>"The 
              allegation about a 6-year-old joining the Sea Org is similarly untrue," 
              added Soter, who described himself as counsel for the Church of 
              Scientology International.<br><br>Celebrity news website TMZ reported 
              that Holmes, who announced on Friday that she was filing for divorce, 
              feared that he wanted their daughter to join the Sea Org in the near 
              future.<br><br>But it cited the Scientologist's lawyer as saying nobody 
              under the age of 16 can join the elite body, adding that minors must 
              have the "consent of both parents and/or all legal guardians" to become 
              members.<br><br>TMZ also cited sources close to Holmes as saying she 
              believes the Church of Scientology views her as a threat to the 
              organization, and has put a team on her tail, with "mysterious" men and 
              vehicles tailing her in recent weeks.<br><br>The attorney's statement came after 33-year-old Holmes was spotted in New York on Monday without her wedding ring.<br><br>She
               left a shoot for a television series in Times Square, her hair pulled 
              back conservatively in a sleek pony tail and wearing a navy ensemble. 
              Throngs of television satellite trucks and paparazzi were camped outside
               the Manhattan building where she was staying.<br><br>Cruise, who turns 
              50 on Tuesday, wed Holmes in a storybook Italian castle in November 2006
               after declaring his love for the former "Dawson's Creek" star live on 
              "Oprah" -- famously jumping up and down on a couch in the studio.<br><br>It was Holmes's first marriage and Cruise's third.<br><br>Holmes'
               announcement that she was filing for divorce reportedly took Cruise by 
              surprise. A spokeswoman said on Friday that he was "deeply saddened" by 
              the move to end their five-year marriage.<br><br>Cruise is among the many celebrity members of the Church of Scientology.<br><br>American
               Scientology leader David Miscavige was said to have officiated at the 
              event, arguably the most high-profile Scientology wedding to date, in a 
              ceremony that lasted no more than 15 minutes.<br><br>Tabloids, shadowing
               the couple since the get-go, have speculated for some time that the 
              relationship was on the rocks after the pair was not seen together for 
              months. Cruise has also won two lawsuits against publications alleging 
              he is gay.<br><br>Reports at the time of Holmes's marriage to Cruise 
              said that under the prenuptial agreement, Holmes -- who converted to 
              Scientology -- would receive $3 million for every year of the marriage 
              plus ownership of a California mansion if they split.<br><br>Holmes has 
              admitted to having a teenage crush on Cruise, even saying she had put up
               a poster of the "Top Gun" star in her bedroom.<br><br>In an interview 
              with Playboy magazine in May, Cruise said he would be spending his 
              birthday on Tuesday shooting a film in Iceland -- without his 
              significant other.<br><br>- AFP/al</span> </span></p>

              <p>LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Tom Cruise was named the 
              highest paid actor in Hollywood on Tuesday, on his 50th birthday - but 
              the Mission Impossible star has little to celebrate.</p>
              <p>Days after his wife filed for divorce, 
              apparently taking him by surprise, questions are stacking up about the 
              role of his controversial Scientologist faith at the end of his 
              five-year marriage to Katie Holmes.</p>
              <p>The Top Gun actor - who has been in Iceland shooting 
              his latest movie ahead of the landmark birthday, according to reports - 
              has remained tightlipped since his wife's bombshell announcement last 
              week.</p>
              <p>'Tom is deeply saddened and is 
              concentrating on his three children,' his spokesman said on Friday, 
              adding nothing since despite mounting speculation about what led to 
              Holmes's decision.</p>
