              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You need to be flawed to solve crime. It's a law of TV. Brilliant mind, blighted character.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">   We've had addicts, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) sufferers, arrogant souls and even a serial killer all on the side of justice. Now, add to that a paranoid schizophrenic.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">   According to crime drama Perception, this particular mental affliction is not a problem. It's a positive.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">   Watching it, I almost wish I had paranoid schizophrenia like the main character, Dr Daniel Pierce, played by Eric McCormack. In the world of Perception, it's essentially a cool superpower.</p>
              <p>   But he has a cool sideline - consultant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, solving the cases too difficult for their more well-balanced agents.</p>
              <p>   Pierce is brilliant because of his paranoid schizophrenia - seeing and hearing people who aren't actually there who point out clues out to him. How handy.</p>
              <p>   Yes, the good professor is the latest brilliant but damaged eccentric playing part-time detective.</p>
              <p>   The strategy has worked for so many shows - House, The Mentalist, Monk and of course Sherlock, spring to mind - so why shouldn't the creators build on this familiar formula?</p>
              <p>   Well, it depend where your boundaries of taste lie. Monk's OCD wasn't so bad, but Perceptions' premise is as ridiculous as ghosts coming to help solve crime.</p>
              <p>   This is the cuddly TV side of mental disorders. They aren't as serious as they can be in real life.</p>
              <p>   Everyone knows of Pierce's condition. But because it's TV, getting a conviction based on a man's damaged imagination is no problem.</p>
              <p>   In fact, Piece's visions keep him company and deliver solutions to him on a silver platter.</p>
              <p>   It's like the misguided notion that someone who is blind has all his other senses heightened.</p>
              <p>   McCormack's Pierce is a likeable guy and just like his lead character in Will &amp; Grace, Pierce is socially awkward, but exudes an offbeat charm.</p>
              <p>   He's far from an outcast who talks to himself - everybody loves him.</p>
              <p>   When Pierce gives a lecture, his students look to him like he's some kind of guru; some obviously want to get it on with him.</p>
              <p>   Unlike Russell Crowe's portrayal of John Nash, who battled with his illusions in A Beautiful Mind, Pierce gets along with his delusions.</p>
              <p>   Like the old joke goes "you're never alone with schizophrenia".</p>
              <p>   Friendly "visitors" who give the best advice and soothe emotional bruises? I wouldn't mind that.</p>
              <p>   <span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: red; font-size: 14pt;         '>Then again, you might need special mental powers to solve the oh-so-convoluted crimes on this show.</span></p>
              <p>   The first instalment - which aired yesterday - left me utterly befuddled. It had a murder, an attempted murder, corporate intrigue and a love triangle all tangled up in the one episode.</p>
              <p>   The writers try too hard. Even McCormack's charms can't save it.</p>
              <p>   That said, the writers have certainly done their research.</p>
              <p>   Each episode features other characters with other mental disorders I've never heard of - people who can't recognise faces, or act as human lie detectors.</p>
              <p>   It would be great to explore this mental treasure trove but it's a pity that most of them are wheeled out just for Pierce to identify their condition.</p>
              <p>   In fact, it's all about Pierce. Secondary characters don't really get fleshed out.</p>
              <p>   For example, Pierce's friend Natalie (Kelly Rowan) is perpetually waiting to keep him company and ever-willing to be his counsellor.</p>
              <p>   Her main function seems to be letting Pierce explain his feelings and she seems somewhat detached from the rest of the world. No prizes for guessing her secret.</p>
              <p>   Using mental illness as a gimmick is arguably in bad taste. But what do I know?</p>
              <p>   It's been picked up for a second season in the US. Now that's madness.</p>
              <p> </p>
