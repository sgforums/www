              <p><br>Exactly!!! - if she has thought about it, thought about the implications of having a child, planned for it, understood that type of influences that may impact the child from a single parent family - and based from all the above make a decision that she feels would be favourable to her AND her child - then why not?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is what i mean that a woman should not decide based merely on what SHE wants. She needs to understand how the decision will influence the child as well, and the child should not be simply brought to birth to satisfy a wilful desire just to 'have a child.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Afterall, shouldnt the basic requirement for 'motherhood' be the ability to think about someone else besides your own self? Not all women manage to achieve that though i think many of our mothers try their best to.</p>

              <p>So are you saying they never considered the implications at all ? If it is really such a burden.. there's always abortion for the truly irresponsible person.</p>
              <p>So my single parents friends are also dim wits issit ? You think it's playing tikam raising a child ? Since she already has one.. you think she don't know what it's like to raise a kid ?</p>
              <p>If having a child should be based on financial ability.. then why are the poor families still having kids ? Why not go persecute them instead ?</p>
              <p>The only so called "crux" here is that she got pregnant with a man out of wedlock.</p>
              <p>If she got pregnant through a donor sperm .. will people still call her a slut ?</p>

              haha i agree with limywv. these kind of stuff is really listen once,ur heart and mind both tells you whether its right or wrong.
              
              i see maia talking about how great her sex life is how she hangs out at club get happy, drunk and make out and stuff.
              
              she's a mother already mind you. she should bring up the child and inculcate proper values to her child.
              
              personally i believe the status of a woman UPs when she becomes a mother. Mothers are the very people that I, personally believe, shape the character of society.
              
              So its time Maia understands what it takes to be a mother.
