              <p>one of the reason why i refuse to condemn her.. is because my church have 1 case like that. pregnant at 18, single mum, but raised a good kid. and she's a great friend and really a pillar of grace and love. i really respect her alot.</p>
              <p>the kid's now a teenager. real cool too, definitely a gift.. crafted from a mistake. so who knows right? maybe maia might turn out to be a great mum, and it'd be all well.</p>
              <p>then i'll be here sneering at those who condemn her and shooting off words like "her brains are in her panties", especially more so, when they themselves get someone pregnant by mistake.</p>

              <p>shrugs. it's definitely not out of care and concern. i'm just thinking, if i was in her shoes now. now already feel like shit, don't really need reminding about it.</p>
              <p>and nobody can say that they won't ever fall into it. if you're willing to point an accusing finger at people like her.. i think it's only apt that if you do fall, you should point one at yourself too.</p>
              <p>let's just say i don't want to point a finger at her, then one day having to point that same finger at myself.</p>
