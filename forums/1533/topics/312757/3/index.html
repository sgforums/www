              <p>true.. but i try not to condemn people like her la.. i don't know if what i'd do in her situation, i might have gone for abortion rather than face the shame, which is even worse. so no stones to throw at her for me.</p>
              <p>at least she walks the talk. she didn't abort because she is anti-abortion (right?)</p>
