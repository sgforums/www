              <p><br> edison chen had the mightier than thou attitude (sure he thinks he

                  attitude. </p>
              <p>Well, with regards to edison chen, that was a really
                  entertaining piece of news revealing what some
                  individuals the entertainment industry really are, aint
                  it?  well, it sure entertained and kept me occupied for a
                  while.</p>
              <p>Like i said, live and let live.  If they want to condemn,
                  let them be.  I dont condemn edison chen, but i really find
                  him stupid.  how would he even think that it is safe to bring
                  his laptop (containing so many porn pics of so many stars) for
                  repair?  REally stupid guy. </p>
              <p>Well, but im sure he is gifted in other ways!  He is
                  capable of making so many stars stripped and posed in front of the
                  camera for him!  Really lucky guy!</p>

              <p>i think you're refering to maia's comment about her at least not aborting her babies right. it sounded more like a self consoling statement than a "holier than thou" thing to me.</p>
              <p>nah.. i can't have that live and let live mentality. it just isn't me.</p>

              <p>ok, let's assume that people actually hate her because of her attitude. so that would just mean that they're barking up the wrong tree isn't it. since they're hounding her because of her pregnancy, but actually it's a mask because they're angry with her attitude. so why don't they just attack her for the attitude, instead of barking about the pregnancy? it's so.... it's not hypocrisy, but it's so.... i don't have the word.</p>
              <p>angelina jolie got pregnant too right? i don't see them raving that she's a slut. and i don't see them raving about maia's attitude until she got pregnant. it's just so... illogical</p>

              <p><br>i understand what you mean when you said "since they're hounding her because of her pregnancy, but actually it's a mask because they're angry with her attitude. so why don't they just attack her for the attitude, instead of barking about the pregnancy? it's so.... it's not hypocrisy, but it's so.... i don't have the word."  Perhaps, like you, they cant find right word to condemn her attitude too?  i dunno and i shall not presume.</p>
              <p>For me, i will think that such publicity about her pregnancy sends a signal to the society.  We know that the young picks up things fast and they usually learn from celebrities.  If such behaviour is not condemned by the public, the young will think "oh, that is normal", and that will become a norm for our society.  If that happens one day, it would be disastrous.  I cant imagine my unmarried daughter coming back to me saying  indignantly "im pregnant and no, im not getting married.  oh, whats wrong with getting pregnant?  giving birth when i m not married?  thats the norm of the society! and everyone is doing it!"</p>
              <p>If that day comes and everyone does this, it will be disastrous.  Thus, as much as we should not condemn anyone, we need to teach the young the right way.</p>
              <p>And no, please do not compare with angelina jolie, cos we are chinese!</p>

              <p>haha i don't know. i think getting married in a loveless relationship might be even worse than singlehandedly raising the kid. i said b4, anyone can be a father, but it takes a really special someone to be a dad.</p>
              <p>like my friends.. the mum's a single mum, and the husband is from marraige. the child isn't his, but he loves the kid like his very own. takes the family to zoo thousands of time, dance with the kid in church during worship, takes them out for meals, does homework with the kid... and cheering when the kid could count to 10 on her own.</p>
              <p>he may not be the father, but he's definitely the dad.</p>
              <p>i think it might be better that way sometimes, than to force a marraige then the father don't fulfil his duty of love to the kid.</p>
              <p>anyway i agree with you. the family structure is very important for a healthy society.</p>

              <p>haha i don't know. i think getting married in a loveless relationship might be even worse than singlehandedly raising the kid. i said b4, anyone can be a father, but it takes a really special someone to be a dad.</p>
              <p>like my friends.. the mum's a single mum, and the husband is from marraige. the child isn't his, but he loves the kid like his very own. takes the family to zoo thousands of time, dance with the kid in church during worship, takes them out for meals, does homework with the kid... and cheering when the kid could count to 10 on her own.</p>
              <p>he may not be the father, but he's definitely the dad.</p>
              <p>i think it might be better that way sometimes, than to force a marraige then the father don't fulfil his duty of love to the kid.</p>
              <p>anyway i agree with you. the family structure is very important for a healthy society.</p>

              <p>Marriage is not just about love, it is about responsibility and commitment too.  Yes, i do agree that it is pretty meaningless to stay in a loveless marriage, but before one calls it quit, he has to consider all factors including the children's and spouse's welfare and feelings.</p>
              <p>Our feeling is not the only thing important in this world.  We need to be mindful of the welfare and feelings of our love ones too.</p>
