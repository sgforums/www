              yea, the child will have a hard life..
              When the child is small. ppl will talk behind her especially at school
              when the child grows up, ppl will still talk bout the mom behind at office..
              sure is hard life..
              and the child will never know the father.
              all of these is bcuz of irresponsible mother.. damn ..

              <p>Perhaps you are mistaken.  Like i said above, "seriously, i do not care about her".  And you may ask, why am i posting.  Perhaps i just thought i would attempt to explain you and some others why the general unfavourable criticisms against her.  Have i muttered a word of badness towards her?</p>
              <p>My intention here is not like yours.  You have been going around slamming others for being judgemental and hypocritical, while perhaps you are the greatest hypocrite around for judging everyone else for judging? </p>
              <p>I shant decide or comment. You be your own judge.  I stick to my belief, live and let live.</p>

              <p>no. i am slamming others for writing people like them off as trash not even worth spitting on. i'm slamming others for assuming that they're never going to change, and they're forever going to be "sluts" and "whores". i'm slamming others for assuming that they're never going to make that mistake that the people they pointed at made.</p>
              <p>how does that make me a hypocrite, seeing that a hypocrite says one thing and does another. i would be a hypocrite if i sing a different tune and start writing people off as trash.</p>

              <p>and the reason why i fight so hard here, is because i know people who made such mistakes but they've changed but yet they still bear that critisizm from the general public. but thankfully, they're so strong inside, and they've raised beautiful kids.</p>

              <p>lol, they win meh? the way i see it, they only appear
              hypocritical and shallow, thinking that they're better than those
              who made mistakes, but not wise enough to know that they might fall
              into it the same way.</p>
              <p>no temptation has seized you except what is common to man.</p>
              <p>we're all subjected to the same temptations in life, and
              potentially we could all fall, so i rather not point an ugly finger
              then a few years later get someone pregnant when i lose control.
              not only will i feel as shitty as the victim i previously pointed a
              finger at, but i will bear the burden of being a hypocrite, for
              pointing the finger first.</p>
              <p>now, saying that, i definitely don't agree with everything maia
              said. and i do agree that she should really start thinking like a
              mum and not as a 16 year old teenager. but i'm more disagreeable
              with the general comments and finger wagging and pointing and
              conceited opinions on people who messed up their lives and thus
              written off as society's trash and hopeless.</p>
              <p>if such actions actually do work to prevent unwanted pregnancy,
              sure! why not! i'll be the first to go out to the streets and start
              critisizing at every pregnant teenager and calling her a slut and
              how she love to happy happy open leg. i'll even recommend it to
              every teenage pregnancy hotline.</p>
              <p>but the fact is that they don't. they only serve to entrap the
              victims in hopelessness and low esteem. and with that low esteem,
              they're forced to repeat the same mistakes again and again.</p>
              <p>"after all, i'm a slut wat, everyone said i'm a slut, who cares
              if i make an effort to change? who cares if i get pregnant again,
              everyone expects that of me isn't it?" - would be their
              mindset.</p>
              <p>and the key to victory is breaking out of that mindset which is
              the prison of the soul.</p>
              <p>and that's the same for drug addicts, gangsters, students doing
              badly in school because they can't seem to study well..</p>
              <p>it's not these people who disgust me. rather, it's those
              so-called "elitists" who put me off. "elitists" who think that
              they're the creme ala creme but yet can't type a decent sentence
              without that  ah-lian style of spelling.</p>

              <p>ok, let's assume that people actually hate her because of her attitude. so that would just mean that they're barking up the wrong tree isn't it. since they're hounding her because of her pregnancy, but actually it's a mask because they're angry with her attitude. so why don't they just attack her for the attitude, instead of barking about the pregnancy? it's so.... it's not hypocrisy, but it's so.... i don't have the word.</p>
              <p>angelina jolie got pregnant too right? i don't see them raving that she's a slut. and i don't see them raving about maia's attitude until she got pregnant. it's just so... illogical</p>

              <p>Like i said, live and let live.  If they want to condemn, let them be.  I dont condemn edison chen, but i really find him stupid.  how would he even think that it is safe to bring his laptop (containing so many porn pics of so many stars) for repair?  REally stupid guy. </p>
              <p>Well, but im sure he is gifted in other ways!  He is capable of making so many stars stripped and posed in front of the camera for him!  Really lucky guy!</p>
