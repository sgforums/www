              <p>My father and me .. he pays for my expenses, spends time with me

                      because he is not married to my mom.. doesn't means he is a bad

              <p>On the other hand.. my brother's biological father.. dissapeared
                      when my mother got pregnant.. and he refused to acknowledge his
                      son. According to my grandparents, he insisted my mom abort the
                      child. This what A LOT of Singaporean men do to their teenage
                      pregnant gf ok ? You go the abortion clinic and see... most of them

              <p>Zid don't want to marry Maia.. is likely he doesn't really want
                      to be the stepfather of her first child. But since it's not so nice
                      to publicly say such a thing, they just used " Just friends" to

              <p>hmm. personally. to me, anyone can be a father. but not everyone can be a dad.</p>
              <p>why marry someone if he's not going to be a good dad, and there's no real love in the relationship? would the child be any better off to have a superficial father figure? imagine, if they marry, and the dad continues to date other ladies, or have affairs. would it be any better for the kid? personally, if that's the case, i think the kids are kinda better off being raised by a single mum.</p>
              <p>and i use this nick because it's cute, it's hopefully ironic, and it's a good alibi when i really do something dumb.</p>
              <p>anyway i am confused. you called buffered a mother's boy, but yet agree with what i said about the bond of a parent. aren't you contradicting yourself?</p>

              <p>Well you see, then that is a difference between a responsible father like your father, and Maia's unborned child's father.  Your father paid for ur expenses, spent time with u whenever he was free, brought u go gai gai when he had his vacations.</p>
              <p>But what did Maia's good friend said? </p>
              <p>1)He said he will be there there for the "baby's birth and to register his name on the birth certificate." --  Seriously, i am not sure if he can put his name in the kid's birth cert as a father since they are not married.  I think in singapore, this cannot be done.  Not so sure, can someone praytell?</p>
              <p>2)He added that he would like to be involved in the baby's life 'as much as possible' and that he would like to 'see it a lot' after it is born. But he has no immediate plans to move to Singapore</p>
              <p>He in Thailand, the baby and mother in Singapore, how to see the baby alot?  I seriously hope it is not empty words.</p>
              <p>3)"Even though Zidov hasn't given Maia any money for pregnancy-related medical expenses, he said he is open to providing financial support in future and will discuss it further with her next month."</p>
              <p>I hope he really will provide financial support for the kid.  Maia herself already have a kid, now 2nd one.  We all know that how expensive singapore is a place to live in and to raise kids, I wonder has she considered how she is going to support her 2 kids' education when she is 'willing to sacrifice her career'!  I hope she has other means!</p>

              <p>then we should be crucifying the Zid right?</p>
              <p>let's hope that he will see the bigger picture and be willing to sacrifice lor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but i notice girls are generally like that when they are in the thrall of love. i was catching up with some friends when the topic somehow diverted to sex, and they were saying that everytime they have sex with their girlfriends, the girls will suddenly tell them that it's ok to come inside them, and somemore lock their legs around their waists.</p>
              <p>kinda like asking for it right? maybe to girls, risking pregnancy for that special connection is their sign of love? and that's how maia got pregnant 2 times? sometimes it's not accidental, but she's just clouded by ecstacy and love and it affected her judgement.</p>

              <p>then we should be crucifying the Zid right?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>but i notice girls are generally like that when they are in the thrall of love. i was catching up with some friends when the topic somehow diverted to sex, and they were saying that everytime they have sex with their girlfriends, the girls will suddenly tell them that it's ok to come inside them, and somemore lock their legs around their waists.</p>
              <p>kinda like asking for it right? maybe to girls, risking pregnancy for that special connection is their sign of love? and that's how maia got pregnant 2 times? sometimes it's not accidental, but she's just clouded by ecstacy and love and it affected her judgement.</p>

              <p><br>Why are we not crucifying Zid, while everyone is putting maia under the magnifying glass?</p>
              <p>Because Zid did not do a one/two-page interview in the newspapers telling the whole world that he had made his good friend pregnant and they are not getting married. </p>
              <p>And he did not proudly announce to the whole world that this is the second time that he made the blunder. </p>
              <p>He did not tell the whole world in the mightier than thou attitude that the fact that they are going to have the baby, they are so much better than those 'loose women' who choose to have obortion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are asians afterall.  Pregnancy out of wedlock are still not widely accepted.  Yes i agree with you that when one makes a mistake, he/she should be given the chance to repent and amend.  But as for Maia, did she even think that she make a mistake?  Hell no, she had that mightier than thou attitude and i bet she is indignant about it.  If she doesnt think she is wrong, will she amend?  Will you rule that that she will have the 3rd kid out of wedlock since she thinks there is nothing wrong about it?</p>

              <p>hmm. i think i said it before. that there're only 2 ways you can react after knowing u're pregnant. either you hang your head in shame and live life in self condemnation, or you lift your head high and move on. i think she did just that.</p>
              <p>i won't rule it. but that's not our concern already isn't it.. for me. my only concern is not to become a potential hypocrite by condemning someone, then later on in life, making that same mistake. i'm just pointing out that everyone who points a finger at her, potentially becomes a hypocrite.</p>

              <p>lol, they win meh? the way i see it, they only appear hypocritical and shallow, thinking that they're better than those who made mistakes, but not wise enough to know that they might fall into it the same way.</p>
              <p>no temptation has seized you except what is common to man.</p>
              <p>we're all subjected to the same temptations in life, and potentially we could all fall, so i rather not point an ugly finger then a few years later get someone pregnant when i lose control. not only will i feel as shitty as the victim i previously pointed a finger at, but i will bear the burden of being a hypocrite, for pointing the finger first.</p>
              <p>now, saying that, i definitely don't agree with everything maia said. and i do agree that she should really start thinking like a mum and not as a 16 year old teenager. but i'm more disagreeable with the general comments and finger wagging and pointing and conceited opinions on people who messed up their lives and thus written off as society's trash and hopeless.</p>
              <p>if such actions actually do work to prevent unwanted pregnancy, sure! why not! i'll be the first to go out to the streets and start critisizing at every pregnant teenager and calling her a slut and how she love to happy happy open leg. i'll even recommend it to every teenage pregnancy hotline.</p>
              <p>but the fact is that they don't. they only serve to entrap the victims in hopelessness and low esteem. and with that low esteem, they're forced to repeat the same mistakes again and again.</p>
              <p>"after all, i'm a slut wat, everyone said i'm a slut, who cares if i make an effort to change? who cares if i get pregnant again, everyone expects that of me isn't it?" - would be their mindset.</p>
              <p>and the key to victory is breaking out of that mindset which is the prison of the soul.</p>
              <p>and that's the same for drug addicts, gangsters, students doing badly in school because they can't seem to study well..</p>
              <p>it's not these people who disgust me. rather, it's those so-called "elitists" who put me off. "elitists" who think that they're the creme ala creme but yet can't type a decent sentence without that  ah-lian style of spelling.</p>

              <p>and that sentence contradicts with this one:</p>
              <p>Why are we not crucifying Zid, while everyone is putting maia under
                                          the magnifying glass?</p>
              <p>Because Zid did not do a one/two-page interview in the
                                          newspapers telling the whole world that he had made his good friend
                                          pregnant and they are not getting married. </p>
              <p>And he did not proudly announce to the whole world that this is
                                          the second time that he made the blunder. </p>
              <p>He did not tell the whole world in the mightier than thou
                                          attitude that the fact that they are going to have the baby, they
                                          are so much better than those 'loose women' who choose to have
                                          obortion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are asians afterall.  Pregnancy out of wedlock are still
                                          not widely accepted.  Yes i agree with you that when one makes
                                          a mistake, he/she should be given the chance to repent and
                                          amend.  But as for Maia, did she even think that she make a
                                          mistake?  Hell no, she had that mightier than thou attitude
                                          and i bet she is indignant about it.  If she doesnt think she
                                          is wrong, will she amend?  Will you rule that that she will
                                          have the 3rd kid out of wedlock since she thinks there is nothing
                                          wrong about it?</p>

              <p>nothing wrong if you choose to live by that quote. but you can't have double standard and choose who it applies to right?</p>
              <p>oh, it's ok to let others live the way they live, if all they're doing is pointing fingers and passing degrading remarks.</p>
              <p>but it's not ok, if someone sleeps around, clubs alot, get drunk all the time and being a totally inept mother.</p>
