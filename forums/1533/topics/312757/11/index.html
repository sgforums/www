              <p>anyway i am confused. you called buffered a mother's boy, but
              yet agree with what i said about the bond of a parent. aren't you

              <p>Ah.. you testing me har ? ....</p>
              <p>Having a close bond with your parent does not means you are a mommy's boy hor.</p>
              <p>You can still have independent thinking.</p>
              <p>Being a mommy's boy does indeed shows you have a close relationship with your mother lah. But the only difference is... that you just go " Yesh mommy." "Yesh mommy".. without thinking .. because you 100% believe whatever she says is like bible to you lah...</p>
              <p>Buffered's mother has indeed taught him to respect herself lah.. but she forgot to teach him how to respect other people's mother leh.</p>
