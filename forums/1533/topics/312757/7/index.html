              <p>So are you saying they never considered the implications at all
              ? If it is really such a burden.. there's always abortion for the
              truly irresponsible person.</p>
              <p>So my single parents friends are also dim wits issit ? You think
              it's playing tikam raising a child ? Since she already has one..
              you think she don't know what it's like to raise a kid ?</p>
              <p>If having a child should be based on financial ability.. then
              why are the poor families still having kids ? Why not go persecute
              them instead ?</p>
              <p>The only so called "crux" here is that she got pregnant with a
              man out of wedlock.</p>
              <p>If she got pregnant through a donor sperm .. will people still
              call her a slut ?</p>

              <p>-abortion is an extreme measure: you may injure the mum not just physically but emotionally as well.</p>
              <p>-i've never said they were dim witted did i. im pointing out that you SHOULD be ready to raise a child before ATTEMPTING so. yea, she has one, of course she knows how difficult it is to raise one, so you think she really wanted the baby?</p>
              <p>-having children SHOULD be based on financial ability. poor families continue to have kids because of an assortment of reasons:</p>
              <p>1. lack of contraceptives- be it lack of avaibility or education in its function</p>
              <p>2. the poor families NEED children as they rely on the children as a form of free labour, think farmers and extra hands.</p>
              <p>3.religious or political reasons: china's one child policy/ catholics abhoring the use of contraceptives</p>
              <p>4.lack of women's rights</p>
              <p>so on. i won't persercute them because for one im not malthesian and two, its unenthical no?</p>
              <p>-the crux of the matter is not her getting preganant out of wedlock, rather her actions in choosing to engage in unprotected sex without proper ascertaining the implications.</p>
              <p>-getting pregnant through donor sperm is a diff story since the mother-to-be is prepared emotionally and financially to conceive and raise a baby to the best of her ability.</p>
              <p>*i can't believe you can be so blunt to miss all these.</p>

              <p>ok.. so we write off these ppl as trash, and when one day they really do want to better themselves, they find no open doors to give them motivation to continue fighting their inner demons. this feels so much like what hitler would do.</p>
              <p>don't like the jews? let's just write them off as trash and eradicate them from society.</p>
              <p>i dunno la. i mean compared to maia, i'm more irritated by gangsters. at least she don't go around chopping people up, being a real threat to the peace and safety of the society.</p>

              <p>haha i agree with limywv. these kind of stuff is really listen
                  once,ur heart and mind both tells you whether its right or
                  wrong.</p>
              <p>i see maia talking about how great her sex life is how she hangs
                  out at club get happy, drunk and make out and stuff.</p>
              <p>she’s a mother already mind you. she should bring up the child
                  and inculcate proper values to her child.</p>
              <p>personally i believe the status of a woman UPs when she becomes
                  a mother. Mothers are the very people that I, personally believe,
                  shape the character of society.</p>
              <p>So its time Maia understands what it takes to be a mother.</p>

              <p>Yah lah dumbdumb, you lealli is not so dumb.. why you use this nick ?</p>
              <p>Just because the guy Zid whatever name.. doesn't marry Maia .. it doesn't means he is not going to be a good dad to his child.</p>
              <p>My father and me .. he pays for my expenses, spends time with me whenever he is free, brings me go gai gai when he has his vacations. We are very close father -dotter relationship. Just because he is not married to my mom.. doesn't means he is a bad dad.</p>
              <p>On the other hand.. my brother's biological father.. dissapeared when my mother got pregnant.. and he refused to acknowledge his son. According to my grandparents, he insisted my mom abort the child. This what A LOT of Singaporean men do to their teenage pregnant gf ok ? You go the abortion clinic and see... most of them teenager girls who come and abort.. their BF are not there one ok ?</p>
              <p>If Zid and Maia already discussed this together , and both came to a consensus to bring up the baby together.. then what's the big problem ?</p>
              <p>Zid don't want to marry Maia.. is likely he doesn't really want to be the stepfather of her first child. But since it's not so nice to publicly say such a thing, they just used " Just friends" to justify not getting married.</p>
