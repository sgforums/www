              <p>What a whirlwind the past few months have been for ex-deejay and celebrity host Jamie Yeo.</p>
              <p>Shortly after telling Yahoo! Singapore in March this year that she
              was “happily in love” with Englishman Thorsten Nolte, the 33-year-old
              babe is now preparing to be a new mum.</p>
              <p><em>The New Paper</em> now reports that she is already 14 weeks
              pregnant with a girl and that she’s already gotten hitched to her hubby
              in a low-key ceremony.</p>
              <p>Her ex-husband, Class 95 deejay Glenn Ong — who is currently dating
              fellow deejay Jean Danker — confirmed the news when he said Yeo had
              informed him of the pregnancy via SMS on Monday.</p>
              <p>“She also apologised for the things she did that hurt me because I’m
              a good person and said it is the one regret in her life,” said Ong, who
              refused to elaborate. He also accepted her apology and sincerely wished
              the newly married couple “all the best”.</p>
              <p>In March, Yeo spoke to Yahoo! Singapore about her <a href="http://sg.video.yahoo.com/watch/7202596/18763575">much-publicised and bitter divorce with Ong </a>and
              said she didn’t care much for what people thought as long as her family
              and friends knew the real reasons behind her split with Ong.</p>
              <p>“You just look at the person who loves you and you know that it
              really doesn’t matter. Even people who are gossiping and saying stuff,
              they’re going to talk about you for about five minutes and they’re
              going to move on with their life so why be bothered about the things
              somebody says when they don’t even know you,” she said.</p>
              <p>At the time, she also hinted she was awaiting Nolte’s proposal and
              laughingly joked that he would get his chance “if he played his cards
              right”.</p>
              <p>That proposal arrived when Nolte flew Yeo to Tokyo in May where he
              proposed to her near a wishing well. Then, she told reporters that they
              planned to invite 100 guests to their wedding.</p>
              <p>And now with the news that Yeo is already 14 weeks pregnant, it’s safe to say Nolte did indeed play his cards right – and early.</p>
