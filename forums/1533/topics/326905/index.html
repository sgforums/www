              <p><span id="lw_1218291468_4" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: medium none; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 50%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Actor/comedian Bernie Mac</span> passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a
                  Chicago area hospital," his publicist, Danica Smith, said in a
                  statement from Los Angeles.</p>
              <p>She said no other details were available and asked that his family's privacy be respected.</p>
              <p>The comedian suffered from <span id="lw_1218291468_5" class="yshortcuts">sarcoidosis</span>,
                  an inflammatory lung disease that produces tiny lumps of cells in the
                  body's organs, but had said the condition went into remission in 2005.
                  He recently was hospitalized and treated for pneumonia, which his
                  publicist said was not related to the disease.</p>
              <p>Recently, Mac's brand of comedy caught him flack when he was heckled
                  during a surprise appearance at a July fundraiser for Democratic
                  presidential candidate and fellow Chicagoan <span id="lw_1218291468_6" class="yshortcuts">Barack Obama</span>.</p>
              <p>Toward the end of a 10-minute standup routine, Mac joked about
                  menopause, sexual infidelity and promiscuity, and used occasional crude
                  language. The performance earned him a rebuke from Obama's campaign.</p>
              <p>But despite controversy or difficulties, in his words, Mac was always a performer.</p>
              <p>"Wherever I am, I have to play," he said in 2002. "I have to put on a good show."</p>
              <p>Mac worked his way to Hollywood success from an impoverished upbringing on <span id="lw_1218291468_7" class="yshortcuts">Chicago's South Side</span>. He began doing standup as a child, and his film career started with a small role as a club doorman in the <span id="lw_1218291468_8" class="yshortcuts">Damon Wayans comedy</span> "<span id="lw_1218291468_9" class="yshortcuts">Mo' Money</span>" in 1992. In 1996, he appeared in the Spike Lee drama "Get on the Bus."</p>
              <p>He was one of "<span id="lw_1218291468_10" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">The Original Kings of Comedy</span>" in the 2000 documentary of that title that brought a new generation of black standup comedy stars to a wider audience.</p>
              <p>Mac went on to star in the hugely popular "<span id="lw_1218291468_11" class="yshortcuts">Ocean's Eleven</span>" franchise with <span id="lw_1218291468_12" class="yshortcuts">Brad Pitt</span> and <span id="lw_1218291468_13" class="yshortcuts">George Clooney</span>.</p>
              <p>His turn with <span id="lw_1218291468_14" class="yshortcuts">Ashton Kutcher</span> in 2005's "<span id="lw_1218291468_15" class="yshortcuts">Guess Who</span>" topped the box office. It was a comedy remake of the classic <span id="lw_1218291468_16" class="yshortcuts">Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn</span> drama "<span id="lw_1218291468_17" class="yshortcuts">Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</span>?" — with Mac as the black dad who's shocked that his daughter is marrying a white man.</p>
              <p>Mac also had starring roles in "<span id="lw_1218291468_18" class="yshortcuts">Bad Santa</span>," "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle" and "Transformers."</p>
              <p>In the late 1990s, he had a recurring role in "Moesha," the UPN network comedy starring pop star Brandy.</p>
              <p>The comedian drew critical and popular acclaim with his Fox television series "<span id="lw_1218291468_19" class="yshortcuts">The Bernie Mac Show</span>," which aired more than <span id="lw_1218291468_20" class="yshortcuts">100 episodes</span> from 2001 to 2006.</p>
              <p>The series about a man's adventures raising his sister's three children, won a <span id="lw_1218291468_21" class="yshortcuts">Peabody Award</span> in 2002. At the time, judges wrote they chose the sitcom for
                  transcending "race and class while lifting viewers with laughter,
                  compassion — and cool."</p>
              <p>The show garnered Golden Globe and Emmy nominations for Mac.</p>
              <p>"But television handcuffs you, man," he said in a 2001 Associated
                  Press interview. "Now everyone telling me what I CAN'T do, what I CAN
                  say, what I SHOULD do, and asking, `Are blacks gonna be mad at you? Are
                  whites gonna accept you?'"</p>
              <p>He also was nominated for a Grammy award for best comedy album in 2001 along with his "<span id="lw_1218291468_22" class="yshortcuts">The Original Kings of Comedy</span>" co-stars, <span id="lw_1218291468_23" class="yshortcuts">Steve Harvey</span>, <span id="lw_1218291468_24" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">D.L. Hughley</span> and <span id="lw_1218291468_25" class="yshortcuts">Cedric The Entertainer</span>.</p>
              <p>In 2007, Mac told <span id="lw_1218291468_26" class="yshortcuts">David Letterman</span> on CBS' "Late Show" that he planned to retire soon.</p>
              <p>"I'm going to still do my producing, my films, but I want to
                  enjoy my life a little bit," Mac told Letterman. "I missed a lot of
                  things, you know. I was a street performer for two years. I went into
                  clubs in 1977."</p>
              <p>Mac was born Bernard Jeffrey McCullough on Oct. 5, 1957, in Chicago. He grew up on the city'<span id="lw_1218291468_27" class="yshortcuts">s South Side</span>, living with his mother and grandparents. His grandfather was the deacon of a Baptist church.</p>
              <p>In his 2004 memoir, "Maybe You Never Cry Again," Mac wrote about
                  having a poor childhood — eating bologna for dinner — and a strict,
                  no-nonsense upbringing.</p>
              <p>"I came from a place where there wasn't a lot of joy," Mac told
                  the AP in 2001. "I decided to try to make other people laugh when there
                  wasn't a lot of things to laugh about."</p>
              <p>Mac's mother died of cancer when he was 16. In his book, Mac
                  said she was a support for him and told him he would surprise everyone
                  when he grew up.</p>
              <p>"Woman believed in me," he wrote. "She believed in me long before I believed."</p>
