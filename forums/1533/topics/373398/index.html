              <p>A love triangle spanning 20  years involving Hong Kong celebrities Tony Leung, Carina Lau and Maggie Cheung has recently resurfaced and is back into the spotlight.<br><br>Long-time friends and frequent co-stars, Leung and Cheung recently met up secretly in Hong Kong only to be confronted by Lau whom Leung is married to. It was rumoured that Lau rushed to the scene and cursed angrily at Cheung.<br><br>The long-running feud between love rivals Lau and Cheung, 45, over Leung is no secret and the recent rendezvous between Leung and Cheung reignited rumours of the love triangle.<br><br>According to reports, the love triangle traces back to 20 years ago when the three were filming Hong Kong television series, "Police Cadet". Leung and Cheung had developed feelings for each other then.<br><br>Although Leung eventually fell in love with Lau, their 19-year long courtship saw endless break-ups which might have led to Leung getting involved with Cheung.<br><br>Leung and Cheung have openly expressed their mutual admiration for each other on several occasions and things naturally became uncomfortable for Lau who had insisted that Cheung was not to be invited to their Bhutan wedding last year.<br><br>A mutual friend of Lau and Cheung, publisher Li Guan, did not believe that Lau would confront Cheung publicly and maintained that “both ladies have a cordial relationship and are friends”.<br><br>When asked if Cheung and her current boyfriend, architect Ole Scheeren, were facing problems, Li said that he had not met the actress for some time and was unable to comment.<br><br>Leung previously said that while he and Cheung shared similar outlooks on life and ideas, and “is a good friend” whom he got along well with, he described Lau as “a godsend from heaven”.<br><br>He added that Lau helped him to “exorcise his inner demons” and that “her laughter and her words help bring me back to reality each time after filming”.<br><br>When Leung co-starred with Cheung in Wong Kar Wai’s “In the Mood for Love” in 2000, he admitted that they “understood each other very much and had plenty to chat about”.<br><br>Leung once told the Taiwanese media that he would often exchange the ups and downs of being an actor with Cheung instead of Lau.<br><br>Shortly after filming for “In the Mood for Love” completed, Cheung announced her divorce from French director Olivier Assayas in 2001.<br><br>“Filming for 15 months have greatly affected my marriage as I did not have the time to fly back to Paris to be with my husband,” said Cheung in an interview then which seemed to suggest that Leung was the reason behind her divorce.<br><br>- CNA/nc</p>
