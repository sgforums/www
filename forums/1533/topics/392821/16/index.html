              <p>Saw it.</p>
              <p>Press conference well orchestrated to suit their need.  None on the scene questioned Jack, why was jack shouting at the reporters?   Why was the gangster so garung?     I have seen both the west and east on apology through press conference on their infidelity, jack neo's press conference cannot make it to a pass, thumbs down.    Those I saw, the public figures did not shout at anyone, they were so composed, got EQ, so polite.   </p>
              <p>The wife looked so unnatural, fake it to act.    Was her fainting real or fake?  </p>

              <p>The press conference, can you even call that a press conference? It looks like hooligans and gangsters running the place... The reporters should be damn upset, asked to go early in the morning and not allowed to ask any questions? Just say he want to give a speech rather than call it a press conference... And I don't understand how they could take being threatened by that gangster?</p>
              <p>It is strange to see MP and Ministers giving support to him... I just don't understand it... Just because he is a "Prominent grassroots leader" and movie director, they rally around him even if he has done wrong? What's going on?</p>
              <p>And while all this going is on for the past few days, I am just curious why the AWARE ladies have not come out to say a thing on this issue yet? Why are they so quiet? I really like to hear their opinion on this since they always seem to have one on most things concerning women... Here a 16 yrs old and others have been sexually harass, don't they have anything to say on this?</p>
              <p>And didn't I say earlier, Jack Neo is an actor, so we can expect to see him coming out to "act" a very touching scene in the next few days... And he sure did... and there was tears from his eyes as well like I predicted earlier... lol.  Oh man, what a con-artist...</p>

              <p><br>The press conference is just an excuse to ease the tension and shut mouths.   No sense of sincerity from the start to the end of the press conference.</p>
              <p>Jack Neo was downright rude.   </p>
              <p>I have never paid to see his movie.  The only time I watched was my sis gave me a treat.  </p>

              <p><strong>'I did not mean to hurt anyone'</strong></p>
              <p>The second woman to speak up in the Jack Neo scandal, Foyce Le Xuan, broke down this afternoon during an interview with Straits Times' RazorTV.<br><br>While she seemed calm and collected at the start of the interview, she was visibly emotional as she watched the recording of this morning's brief but dramatic press conference held by Jack Neo and his wife, Irene Kng.<br><br>Referring to Kng as "shi mu" (a respectful term meaning 'mentor's wife' in Mandarin), Foyce told RazorTV that Kng was someone she "respects very much", and is also a "fantastic manager".<br><br>When asked if she thought the 'drama' that unfolded was genuine, she said she believed that it was 'real at this point'.<br><br><strong>She wanted to expose his "character flaws"</strong><br><br>Asked if she has forgiven Neo for his unwelcome advances, Foyce told RazorTV that her intention was not to hurt or flame him, as the event had occurred six years ago and there was really nothing to forgive.<br><br>She said she did not need Neo to apologise to her, but she exposed his "character flaws" in the hopes that he would change.<br><br>Later in the interview, she also spoke about how she deals with critics who accuse her of "rubbing salt on the wound" by speaking up.<br><br>However, she also cited that she is heartened by the support of people who "know what kind of person she is". She said singer Eric Moo's brother had texted her, saying she was "brave" to have exposed Neo and the "dark side of showbiz". "The message also said, 'sooner or later, people will know what you did is right'."<br><br>Refuting claims that she spoke to the press for the publicity, Foyce said the publicity may have a negative impact on her career as a recording artiste.<br><br>Her publicist and song producer, both based in Taiwan, had warned her that Singaporeans are not as 'open' and may not be able to accept such scandals associated with Singaporean artistes.<br><br><strong>Mark Lee made sarcastic remarks</strong><br><br>When asked if anyone in J Team (Neo's film and entertainment company) six years ago had suspected Neo was showering her with special attention, she said actor-comedian Mark Lee seemed to have noticed. He often made sarcastic remarks to her, suggesting "something was going on between us," "but that may just be his character".<br><br>However, said it would be hypocritical of those closest to him in the company, like Mark Lee and Henry Thia to profess that they did not to know about Neo's "flirtatious character".<br><br>She also revealed that after herself, she knew of two others in the company who were "harassed" by Neo, but refused to divulged their names.<br><br>Responding to the question of whether she would have accepted Neo if he were single then, she said that she had been touched and flattered six years ago, and admitted the 'possibility' of believing that his sweet-nothings were genuine, if he had been a single man.<br><br><strong>'I wanted to air injustice'</strong><br><br>In the interview, Foyce also revealed that she is a member of the same church as Neo and Kng and used to see them regularly, but had never spoken to him directly about the harassment.<br><br>She said she never considered confronting Neo, nor telling Kng, as she was young then and "afraid of offending people".<br><br>She told RazorTV that amidst the chaos, she is most impressed by Kng and salutes her for "being so strong".<br><br>"However, I sincerely apologise for what I have done. I did not mean to hurt anyone, all I wanted was to air the injustice done towards me."<br><br>Asked if there was anything she would like to say to Neo, Foyce said her wish is that he will still be fine after this scandal has blown over.<br><br>She said: "You are still a good and talented director who's irreplaceable. All your previous achievements will not be ignored. You should stand up and repent, and aim for another (career) breakthrough. Use your talent and prove that you are still a great person."</p>
