              <p>What is the difference between "Rape" and "deceiving into consenting to sex"? The objective is almost the same, the first approach is normally using physical force and the second approach is to cheat and give false hope and promise.</p>

              <p>Wah, Jack Neo becoming like Tiger Woods and John Terry... I normally don't comment much on things that doesn't involved football but this is beginning to look funnier by the day...</p>
              <p>First day 1 mistress, by 2nd day got 2 mistresses... Then by 3rd to 4th day become 11th mistresses ! My goodness... And to add all the ingredience to make a good rojak news story, we have a all powerful Minister who readily gives his support to this cheating rat, a silly wife trying to play it cool to the public... and what else? Oh his good friend Mark Lee already thinking of a name change for their company (From J-Team to Huang whatever...) cos J-Team is already stained with Jack's sperm all over and no aspiring actress will want to join them in future... lol...</p>
              <p>There is no two ways about it. Jack Neo is a cheating rat and deserve to be condemn... Some of these girls are young and impressionable... Being exposed to the entertainment industry for the first time at such a young age they were easy prey for him. And he made used of his standing to get them into bed or car whichever suited him...</p>
              <p>I feel George Yeo, for no reason now have a problem on his hands... Did Jack told him everything? or only bit parts of it? Cos he have openly came out to support him when there was only ONE mistress... But now there are ELEVEN... What does he think about it now? Still support or backtrack? Stay tune to find out but I am guessing the latter...</p>
              <p>What I feel the ladies have done is totally correct... But it needed one brave chick to stand up after being used and bullied by this rat. The rest probably thought people wouldn't believe them had they came out earlier as Jack was seen as Mr Nice Guy all these years... But when mistress no.1 informed a reporter of her arranged meeting with Mrs Neo, I guess the reporter started to believe her story too. They have shamed him for his years of misdeeds that he thought he could get away... Looks like the chickens have finally come home to roost for Jack... He doesn't deserve any sympathy in my opinion... Cos he is a sick man.</p>
              <p>The only saving grace for Jack in this whole sickening episode is, he didn't bang Mark Lee's wife... Had he done so, he would be worse than an animal... But how many belief Mark Lee wasn't aware of this in the first place? After so many years with him? Not a chance...</p>
              <p>Jack Neo is an actor, we can expect to see him coming out to "act" a very touching scene in the next few days... Sorry to this, sorry to that and sorry to so and so... We may even see tears from his eyes... But whatever he says, he won't be getting any sympathy from me. Cos the guy have all along been a con-artist...</p>

              <p>Don't be so sure that JN never goes after other people's wife, we may be very surprised. Let's petition all the women (or Governement shall consider of providing them anonymity) who had been preyed, disturbed and abused by JN to come out in the open and expose him. The next prominent person who wants to do the same thing will think twice in future. We should salute and encourage the first two women who dare to expose JN; otherwise, all of us would be fooled by him forever.</p>

              <p>The funny thing is that Minister George Yeo supported this Jack Neo.</p>
              <p>I was dumbfounded for that.</p>
              <p>To me, it is a big mistake to support him.</p>
              <p>As a Minister, as a public figure, as a man, a father, a husband, I dont understand how he can stupidly support Jack Neo just on the account of a personal friendship.</p>
              <p>Would he be supporting a murderer? A corrupter ? Why should he be supporting him ? Almost the same.</p>
              <p>How can he overlook a very serious integrity problem and put a personal friendship at the fore.</p>
              <p>I am surprised and disappointed with George Yeo.</p>
              <p>But I believe he did this mistake on a good intention. Jack Neo must have sweet talked him and deceived him with a good impression, just like the way he did it to the girls.</p>

              <p>Anyone with conscience or being father, husband or son will not support a sex maniac who preys on women, especially young, innocent and inexperienced for their sexual appetite. When can we find out more truth and the actual number of victims? I fully agree the views of God.Luv.U but giving JN a big slab is too lenient to him; he deserves more than that. Recently, our court sentenced a rapist who raped his ex-girl friend's mother to 25 years jail, we applaude that.</p>

              <p>In today's TNP, five years Jack Neo apparently had hit on a French girl who was only 16 then.</p>
              <p>So with this news, we can conclude once and for all that this isn't all a publicity stunt for his latest movie, because the news of a forty-something uncle trying to seduce a 16 year old girl is very, VERY detrimental publicity which will only hurt him in the long run.</p>
              <p>Can we also get this straight please: so far the only confirmed mistress is the first girl (Wendy Chong). As for Foyce Le and the French girl, those were sexual harassment cases instead of outright adultery, for those two girls didn't take the bait.</p>

              <p>The funny thing is that Minister George Yeo supported this Jack Neo.</p>
              <p>I was dumbfounded for that.</p>
              <p>To me, it is a big mistake to support him.</p>
              <p>As a Minister, as a public figure, as a man, a father, a husband, I dont understand how he can stupidly support Jack Neo just on the account of a personal friendship.</p>
              <p>Would he be supporting a murderer? A corrupter ? Why should he be supporting him ? Almost the same.</p>
              <p>How can he overlook a very serious integrity problem and put a personal friendship at the fore.</p>
              <p>I am surprised and disappointed with George Yeo.</p>
              <p>But I believe he did this mistake on a good intention. Jack Neo must have sweet talked him and deceived him with a good impression, just like the way he did it to the girls.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">French girl spills on Neo</h1>
              <p>A YOUNG French student is the latest to claim that film-maker Jack
                                      Neo hit on her - when she was only 16 more than five years ago.</p>
              <p>Maelle
                                      Meurzec, now 21, told The New Paper in an interview at her Upper East
                                      Coast road home on Tuesday night, that the 50-year-old movie director
                                      hit on her while she was acting in his movie I Do I Do in Nov 2004.</p>
              <p>From
                                      what she thought was a 'friendly' wrap around her shoulders on the
                                      first day they met, she claimed that Neo continued to make more
                                      aggressive advances on her even after the filming had ended, including
                                      sending her 30 SMSes, and repeated attempts to take her out to dinner
                                      at hotels.</p>
              <p>The pretty Singaporean citizen of
                                      French descent, then a model with MC Models, did not mince her words in
                                      the TNP interview, calling Neo 'a bit of a creep', 'a sleazebag' and 'a
                                      jerk'.</p>
              <p>The final straw came on Christmas Day 2004
                                      when Neo sent her an SMS, saying that he wished they could be together.
                                      Upset, Maelle told her mother, Ms Agnes Meurzec, 51, about it. The
                                      family also decided to make a police report if Neo continue to harass
                                      the girl.</p>
              <p>Neo stopped messaging her and they
                                      never met again. Neo's daughter, the eldest of his four children, is
                                      two years younger than Maelle.</p>
              <p>At least 10 more
                                      women are reported to have been linked to Neo since his affair with
                                      22-year-old Wendy Chong first broke last weekend when the freelance
                                      model showed up at his Pasir Ris semi-detached house last Friday,
                                      demanding to see his wife, Madam Irene Kng, 46.</p>
              <p>--------</p>
              <p>In an interview with The New Paper, Malle claimed that Jack Neo
                                      put his arms around her shoulders on the first day they met and
                                      continued to make aggressive advances on her after the filming ended
                                      such as sending her SMSes repeatedly and asking her out for dinner at
                                      hotels five weeks after they met during filming.</p>
              <p><em>“It’s wrong because of so many factors. He’s old enough to be my
                                      father. He’s a director and I’m supposed to be one of his staff. You
                                      look to people like him to protect you,”</em> Maelle was quoted as saying in TNP.</p>
              <p>She told her mother about Jack Neo who threatened to make a
                                      police report against him if he continues to harass the girl after he
                                      sent her a SMS on Christmas Day 2004 saying that he wished to be together with her.</p>
              <p>They now have a good laugh every time they saw him on advertisements.</p>
              <p><em>“This guy is supposedly promoting family values but he can’t
                                      even hold himself back from sending SMSes to a 16 year old. I thought
                                      he’s a bit of a creep, a sleaze-bag,”</em> Maelle added.</p>
