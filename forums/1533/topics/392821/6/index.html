              She claims that she had sex with Jack Neo in his car just one month after meeting him</p>
              <p>Wendy said that after they met, Jack Neo sent her invitations to a
                  production house located in Outram Park to see how movies were edited.</p>
              <p>In her interview, she stated that during one of these visits, Jack
                  Neo offered to send her home in his Toyota Alphard after she had
                  watched him direct the movie.</p>
              <p>However, once inside his Toyota Alphard, Wendy claimed that things started to get hot and heavy.</p>
              <p>Speaking of the interior of his car, she said that Jack Neo's car
                  "has curtains and the windows are tinted, so even though we had sex, it
                  was safe."</p>
              <p>She claims that Jack was also extremely careful to erase all evidence of their tryst.</p>
              <p>According to her, Jack Neo said that "no strands of hair should be
                  found and the inclination of the car seats should be adjusted back to
                  where it was."</p>
              <p>Wendy said that this incident was the beginning of a three-month relationship with Jack Neo.</p>
              <p>She claims that while they were together, they would have sex twice a week.</p>
              <p>When asked about the locations at which they had sex in his car, she
                  reveals that "sometimes he would drive to my neighbourhood in Yishun.
                  At times, he drove to the carpark of Orchid Country Club."</p>
              <p>Although they initially had sex in his car, Wendy said that they soon progressed to making love in hotels instead.</p>
              <p>Speaking of the hotel, she added that "It was a hotel in Tiong Bahru
                  and Jack knew one of the employees. Before checking in, Jack called to
                  make sure that person was on duty."</p>

              <p>FREELANCE model Wendy Chong has regretted letting her affair with Jack Neo drag on for two years.</p>
              <p>She told Shin Min Daily News in an interview: 'The last two
                      years has been tumultuous for us, ending with both of us deeply hurt
                      and scarred.</p>
              <p>'I feel I have grown up a lot overnight. Previously, I didn't
                      give a damn to anything else in the pursuit of love. I just wanted to
                      possess him, regardless of whether I was right or wrong. And I got
                      myself into a mess.</p>
              <p>'I now realise I was wrong and I have hurt many people. I
                      shouldn't have gone into an affair in the first place, shouldn't have
                      fallen in love with him.</p>
              <p>'It's like taking drugs, you think you have control of your
                      feelings and yourself, but in the end, I couldn't get out of the mess.
                      I just got myself more and tangled and eventually found myself at a
                      dead end.'</p>

              <p>THE 22-year-old model who spilled her two-year affair with filmmaker Jack Neo said she won't return to him again.</p>
              <p>Wendy
                      Chong told Shin Min Daily News: 'Disappointment and sadness have
                      replaced my love for him. Even if there was a shot at a second chance,
                      I wouldn't want it. Even if he wanted to return, I wouldn't accept it.</p>
              <p>'But I know Jack. He won't turn back. He is probably feeling very remorseful and guilty about his actions.'</p>
              <p>In
                      an interview with the Chinese evening daily, Chong also expressed guilt
                      and regrets for alerting a reporter to the meeting with Neo and his
                      wife last Friday at Changi Airport's Crowne Plaza Hotel, after she
                      showed up at his Paris Ris home.</p>
              <p>'I was a little
                      rash and wonder if I have caused harm to innocent children. But the
                      next day, after reading the reports, my guilt subsided. Because Jack
                      Neo lied. He told me that besides me and his wife, there weren't any
                      other women.</p>
              <p>'He also swore to god countless times, that if he had other women, he would be hit by a car, and asked me to believe him.'</p>
              <p>'But
                      later I found out that even his wife knew that there Jack Neo had
                      trysts with other women. Looks like I came out looking sillier in this
                      incident.'</p>
              <p>Chong also apologised to Neo's wife,
                      Madam Irene Kng, 46, and her four children, as well as to her own
                      parents for causing them embarrassment.</p>
              <p>She advised other 'third-party' women to cease their affairs with married men as 'it's tough to be a mistress.'</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><br>"The
                      other day, Jack told me that he was going on a trip with his wife. For
                      some reason, my instinct told me that he was lying." said Chong.<br><br>"I
                      went to his home to double check only to find his wife Mdm Irene Kng
                      Meifan car park there and later saw Jack drove home by himself.  So I
                      decided to confront him on why he lied to me. He told me he went to see
                      his pastor and was afraid that I will get angry so he did not tell me
                      about it.  At that moment, I was very angry and told Jack I wanted to
                      go inside the house to let his wife know about our relationship.<br><br>When he heard that, he told me since I want to go to his home to expose our relationship.. please come in.<br><br>I asked him why when he hugged me last night he still said he loved me but why lied to me so soon?<br><br>Jack did not responded and told me to wait until his wife came down from upstairs before discussing. <br><br>Irene
                      came down from upstairs already dressed to go out with her handbag. 
                      She then said to me, "Miss, my kids are upstairs, lets us go outside to
                      talk?"<br><br><strong>At the hotel or inside the car?</strong><br>I followed her out of the house and into her car.  At that time, my guts feeling told me that she was already prepared for me.<br><br>Irene asked me whether I preferred to talk inside the car or at the hotel. <br><br>On
                      the way to the hotel, Irene asked me where I am a Singaporean. I told
                      her yes and she asked me why as a Singaporean that I did not know that
                      Jack Neo was a married man?  Why having a relationship with a married
                      man?<br><br>I did not reply to her then.  Irene commented that her
                      husband must had sweet talked me into the relationship.  She said she
                      do not mind who her husband spent his time with, as long as in the end,
                      he goes back to his wife.<br><br>I told Irene the reason why I wanted
                      to see Neo was to clarify why the night before, Neo still make love
                      with me and today he lied to me.<br><br>On hearing this, she asked me, "Really, where did you both make-out? At the hotel? Or inside the car?" <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Having sex five days before</strong><br><br>Jack
                      told reporters that he wanted to broke it off with me but he forgot
                      (the fact that) he still hugged me the night before and told me he
                      loved me.  Furthermore, five days before this incident, we had sex. But
                      that was also the last time (we did it).<br><br>Neo’s  feeling for me
                      had changed. I felt he had changed since we came back from Italy. 
                      While we were together before, he always asked me "if one day, you
                      leave me, what should I do?" but since (our) Italy (trip) his attitude
                      has changed, instead he would ask me "don’t you think our relationship
                      has no future?"<br><br>Every time he asked me this question, I would
                      told him " let’s see how long it will last, if one day I met someone
                      that I liked and wanted to get married, I will leave...<br><br>I cherished our relationship very much that is why I kept it going.<br><br>But I am very upset that since the news broke, Jack told reporters that I wanted to expose him to destroy him.<br><br>But,
                      I cherished and protected our relationship. No particular reason,
                      because I love him, I wanted to be with him.  I knew that if his wife
                      found out about our affairs, our relationship will be over; we can no
                      longer be together.<br><br>Therefore, every time we went overseas and
                      took pictures together, I would delete those pictures when we came back
                      because I wanted to protect him.<br><br>On Chinese New Year eve, I was outside his home for almost half a day.<br><br>On
                      Chinese New Year eve, I visited his house because he had gone to Hong
                      Kong and did not turn on his mobile phone.  I knew he will be back on
                      the night of New Year eve. I waited outside his house from the
                      afternoon until he came home at night.<br><br>However, I waited for him
                      to come home.  Did I go into his home to expose our relationship then? 
                      I did not.  I only called him.  He told me everything was fine and
                      asked me to let him spend a good Chinese New Year.<br><br>During the
                      Chinese New Year, we did not meet. He spent a good New Year but what
                      about me?  I spent a very unhappy New Year but I did not go to his home
                      to make a scene.<br><br>On the day of the incident, I went to his house to ask him out to talk but he chose to let his wife know about our affairs.<br><br>I am wooed by other men<br>The
                      reason why I am speaking out now to tell my side of the story is
                      because I am not happy about the lies that Neo said to the reporters. <br><br>Two other men had tried to woo me but both were discouraged by Jack.<br><br>Jack
                      told reporter that he wanted to break it off with me one year ago and
                      that I threatened to either commit suicide or to tell his wife so as to
                      keep him in fear and from breaking up with me.<br> <br>In fact, this
                      whole relationship was started by Neo.  If not for his persistence
                      wooing and numerous pleads, I would not have been in such deep
                      involvement.<br><br>When I first met Jack, I was only 20. Two other
                      boys were wooing me then.  When Jack found out about it, he told me
                      that since I am joining the entertainment circle, I should not have
                      boyfriends too early.<br><br>Also, when I asked one of Jack's employees
                      to help introduce some entertainment jobs to me, Jack found out about
                      it and told me that the person was a "wolf" and had made some girl
                      pregnant before.  Actually there was no such thing, Jack just don’t
                      want me to get to know other men.<br><br>Once, Jack told me that if I wanted to meet other men, I should go to dating agency but please don't leave him.<br><br>I had Jack's wife mobile number, if I wanted to exposed our relationship, I don’t need to wait until today.<br><br>Jack
                      told reporters that because I threaten to expose our relationship to
                      his wife; he could not break it off with me.  But, Jack knew deep down
                      that I was did not want to expose him.<br><br>Every time I threw temper
                      and threaten to tell his wife about us, he knew I was only being
                      childish, all he needed to do was to pampered and let me know how much
                      he loved me and I will be fine.  This has became part of our
                      relationship norms.  He was definitely not threatening by it.<br><br>I always had Jack's wife mobile number.  If I wanted to expose him, I need not wait until today."<br> <br>Chong told her side of the story to the reporters when interviewed.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Jack Neo asked for sex from aspiring actress</strong><br><br>WanBao reported that they have managed to track down and interviewed a person that had been sexually harassed by Jack Neo, Singapore famous movie producer and celebrity.<br><br>Ms Le Xuan, a 22 year old aspiring actress reviewed to WanBao that Jack Neo used a scheme and promises that he will promote her to be the second Fann Wong if she has sex with him at the hotel room after she signed on with Jack Neo's production company.  However, she did not go to the hotel.<br><br> "After reading the WanBao newspaper report, I thought of the incident that happens to me.  I used to be one of Jack Neo production team.  Jack's method of chasing girls is the same, first asked for telephone number, then SMS.  Anyone that Jack was interested; he will sweet talk the person."<br><br>Le claimed that once you get into Jack’s car, his hands and mouth will be all over the places with you.  Taking a ride in Jack’s car has caused the break-up with her boyfriend.<br><br>She also claimed that while Jack’s wife madam Irene Kng was having their 4th child, Jack was actively wooing her with over 30 sexual SMS a day.<br><br>She told reporter that because she was unwilling to “sacrifice”, she was not given any movie role as such she  asked for an early termination of her contract.<br><br>----------------<br><br>HE WOOED her with the promise of grooming her into 'Fann Wong No. 2', and even booked a hotel room so they could get to know each other better.<br><br>This claim was made by a second woman who has decided to speak out on Singaporean filmmaker Jack Neo, just days after a 22-year-old freelance model Wendy Chong broke the news of her two-year fling with the Cultural Medallion recipient.<br><br>Lianhe Wanbao on Monday identified the latest woman as 25-year-old Foyce Le Xuan, who alleged in an interview with the Chinese evening daily that Neo had sexually harassed her when she was a member of the Liang Jia Ban (Neo's Family Group).<br><br>Ms Le, described by the Chinese daily as 'sexy and beautiful' and drew comparisons with Hong Kong pop star Coco Lee, was a member of Liang Jia Ban for a year from 2004.<br><br>In the interview with Wanbao, she claimed that Neo wooed her aggresively after she joined his entertainment group. Once, he allegedly told her that he had made a reservation at a hotel and was waiting for her so that they could spend 'quiet and private' time together to 'get to know each other better'. She did not show up.<br><br>She also said that when she first started out at Liang Jia Ban, Neo offered to send her home as she lived in Tampines, which was near his Pasir Ris home. But these rides turned out to be more than innocent, she claimed.<br><br>Shortly after, she alleged that Neo tried to hit on her. She said once in his car, Neo grabbed her hand and said, 'I want to groom you into 'Fann Wong No. 2'. I will direct a film and make you the lead actress.'<br><br>'At that time, I was only 20, just a small girl... I didn't dare to speak out... When he held my hand tight, I didn't even dare to resist,' she told Wanbao.<br><br>On her decision to go public with the affair, Ms Le said: 'After reading the reports on Wendy Chong in Wanbao, I was reminded of a very unpleasant period in my life. Jack Neo's wooing methods are the same. He asks for your number, sends you an SMS, and says all sorts of sweet things to his 'prey'.<br><br>She added that she 'admired Wendy Chong for standing out to reveal the truth'. This, she hoped, would prevent similar incidents from happening.<br>------------------</p>

              <p><br>yeah, in fact he is already hinting us his affair on tv long ago. it is we who are stupid  who don't get it and still support him. anyway, i have never like his films, no standard at all. his movies only locals can understand, his films always talk about dirty things like shit, urine etc. can't stand it, no class at all.</p>
