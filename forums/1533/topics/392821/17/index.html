              <p>In Hollywood &amp; Bollywood almost everyone has to sleep with someone even gay producers and directors to be where they are maybe this is part of a mutual arrangement in the show business  circle that outsiders like us wont understand but movie making in Singapore havent even reach that kind of level yet so Jack should go fark himself la.I dont like the fact that he used his wife as damage control showing his cowardice side.BIll Clinton tried to save the presidency,Tiger Woods his $$$ and Jack Neo???

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>The mother of 22 year old model Wendy Chong who was involved in a 2 year affair with Singapore’s famous movie director Jack Neo had expressed her concerns that her daughter may commit suicide.</p>
              <p>According to a Lianhe Wanbao report, Wendy’s mood was purportedly “very low” now and her mother had sent her to live with her relatives for a few days till the storm finally blows over.</p>
              <p>Wendy shocked the entire nation when she leaked to the press that she had been a mistress of Jack Neo for 2 years including lurid details of her having sex with him in his car and various hotels.</p>
              <p><em>“I hope the saga will end soon. Wendy’s father still need to work to support the family. We have a 80 year old mother to take care of,”</em> Wendy’s mother was quoted as saying.</p>
              <p>While many Singaporeans have lampooned Jack Neo for his infidelity, some also accused of Wendy of being a “willing” party and seeking instant fame.</p>
              <p>Jack Neo has since apologized during a 3-minute conference this morning with clarifying on the current status of his relationship with Wendy.</p>

              <p><strong>'I did not mean to hurt anyone'</strong></p>
              <p>The second woman to speak up in the Jack Neo scandal, Foyce Le
              Xuan, broke down this afternoon during an interview with Straits
              Times' RazorTV.<br> <br> While she seemed calm and collected at the start of the interview,
              she was visibly emotional as she watched the recording of this
              morning's brief but dramatic press conference held by Jack Neo and
              his wife, Irene Kng.<br> <br> Referring to Kng as "shi mu" (a respectful term meaning 'mentor's
              wife' in Mandarin), Foyce told RazorTV that Kng was someone she
              "respects very much", and is also a "fantastic manager".<br> <br> When asked if she thought the 'drama' that unfolded was genuine,
              she said she believed that it was 'real at this point'.<br> <br> <strong>She wanted to expose his "character flaws"</strong><br> <br> Asked if she has forgiven Neo for his unwelcome advances, Foyce
              told RazorTV that her intention was not to hurt or flame him, as
              the event had occurred six years ago and there was really nothing
              to forgive.<br> <br> She said she did not need Neo to apologise to her, but she exposed
              his "character flaws" in the hopes that he would change.<br> <br> Later in the interview, she also spoke about how she deals with
              critics who accuse her of "rubbing salt on the wound" by speaking
              up.<br> <br> However, she also cited that she is heartened by the support of
              people who "know what kind of person she is". She said singer Eric
              Moo's brother had texted her, saying she was "brave" to have
              exposed Neo and the "dark side of showbiz". "The message also said,
              'sooner or later, people will know what you did is right'."<br> <br> Refuting claims that she spoke to the press for the publicity,
              Foyce said the publicity may have a negative impact on her career
              as a recording artiste.<br> <br> Her publicist and song producer, both based in Taiwan, had warned
              her that Singaporeans are not as 'open' and may not be able to
              accept such scandals associated with Singaporean artistes.<br> <br> <strong>Mark Lee made sarcastic remarks</strong><br> <br> When asked if anyone in J Team (Neo's film and entertainment
              company) six years ago had suspected Neo was showering her with
              special attention, she said actor-comedian Mark Lee seemed to have
              noticed. He often made sarcastic remarks to her, suggesting
              "something was going on between us," "but that may just be his
              character".<br> <br> However, said it would be hypocritical of those closest to him in
              the company, like Mark Lee and Henry Thia to profess that they did
              not to know about Neo's "flirtatious character".<br> <br> She also revealed that after herself, she knew of two others in the
              company who were "harassed" by Neo, but refused to divulged their
              names.<br> <br> Responding to the question of whether she would have accepted Neo
              if he were single then, she said that she had been touched and
              flattered six years ago, and admitted the 'possibility' of
              believing that his sweet-nothings were genuine, if he had been a
              single man.<br> <br> <strong>'I wanted to air injustice'</strong><br> <br> In the interview, Foyce also revealed that she is a member of the
              same church as Neo and Kng and used to see them regularly, but had
              never spoken to him directly about the harassment.<br> <br> She said she never considered confronting Neo, nor telling Kng, as
              she was young then and "afraid of offending people".<br> <br> She told RazorTV that amidst the chaos, she is most impressed by
              Kng and salutes her for "being so strong".<br> <br> "However, I sincerely apologise for what I have done. I did not
              mean to hurt anyone, all I wanted was to air the injustice done
              towards me."<br> <br> Asked if there was anything she would like to say to Neo, Foyce
              said her wish is that he will still be fine after this scandal has
              blown over.<br> <br> She said: "You are still a good and talented director who's
              irreplaceable. All your previous achievements will not be ignored.
              You should stand up and repent, and aim for another (career)
              breakthrough. Use your talent and prove that you are still a great
              person."</p>
