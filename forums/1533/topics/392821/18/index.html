              <p>actually jack neo shouldn't ask his wife to sit for the press conference. The wife looks really domesticated, seems to be one who listens and depends wholly on the husband.</p>
              <p>it is already freaking embarassing for the wife to wear the green hat, not once but countless times. He should have been a real man and faced all this alone. He should have clarified each affair one by one and let all cans of worms be opened. After all, that's what real sincere PR is about, isn't it? Let only the truth be known in order to put all demons of doubt and malice to death.</p>
              <p>I seriously feel sorry for the wife, she should never have appeared under the glare of the media at all. I think I will boycott his stupid movies from now on.</p>
