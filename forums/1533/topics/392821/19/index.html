              Hi to All Forumers
              
              Uncle english is not that well written, plse rectifiend and shou xia liu qin..
              
              Xie Xie Ni Men,
              
              Jack Neo, he can leave her ex wife when she is ill sick, she will  be doing the same thing to Irene Kng her present wife if she also got the serious sickness. 100 percent lay my 1k if anyone dont believe uncle me.
              
              Why i say that, if a good hubby he should stayed and comfort the illness wife not just to leave her die and shout her in a hospital.  This news media after reading it, i feel sorry to the ex-wife and i believe "bao ying".  You all can share with your point of view, I am welcome all of your heart talk..
              
              If i am the wife of Jack Neo, i can easily feel that since he is already so popular and cheeky man.  A press for today paper is just only a acting to let audience and supporter know they are acting and what they have now is alot of money to spend the rest of their lives.
              
              Do you think they just want to say public apologise, like tiger woods did.  Tiger woods is 100 percent much better off than Jack Neo.  He is a horrible old man. Young and teenage girl also want to have sex affair.  Disgrace to us as a Uncle.  I will no longer supporting his movies at all.
              
              So, i hope all of you dont think of Jack Neo and pity him, he got more money than anyone else in the forums.  He just want to act only like liang po po wu wu. Ni men shi da ben Dang woo... woo...
              
              The only person are those girls that either jilted by him or fear to admit the affairs. i can tell you more of the female and teenage girl is involved in his affairs.
              
              What can i say a cheeky man die also die as a cheeky man stage.

              <div class="quote_from">Yes, he is such a sick and heartless man. He can dump any woman for his own benefits. To the best of my knowledge, Christians believe that God will forgive all his sins if he can repent in front of a pastor. Possibly, he is prepared to do that before his last breath on earth, Other than fame, money, this crook played dirty tricks on those women around him. More than just boycotting his film, he should be condemned for his acts if our prevailing laws cannot punish him.</div>

              <p>SINGAPORE – Columnists and bloggers are calling him Singapore's Tiger Woods _ not for his golfing skills but for an extramarital affair that has tarnished the image of the city-state's most beloved film director.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, in a news conference reminiscent of Wood's confession on live television last month, director Jack Neo, admitted to cheating on his wife, culminating a week of revelations about a two-year relationship Neo had with a 22-year-old model.</p>
              <p>Other aspiring actresses and models, including a 16-year-old, have told local tabloids this week that Neo aggressively tried seducing them, including promising to make them stars in his movies.</p>
              <p>"It's all my fault," Neo, 50, said before covering his face with his hands and crying. "Please give us a chance."</p>
              <p>Neo's wife of 27 years, Irene, was by his side. She said she forgave her husband and would stay with him. She broke down after speaking and collapsed while walking away. She had to be carried from the stage amid a blaze of photographer's flash lights.</p>
              <p>"I've already been hurt," she said through tears. "I really need your blessings."</p>
              <p>Neo gained fame as a comedian on Singapore television in the 1990s and later directed popular Chinese and English-language movies _ such as "Money No Enough" and "I Not Stupid" _ that celebrated the importance of family among other topics.</p>
              <p>His latest, "Being Human," opened in Singapore last week.</p>
              <p>The government has recognized Neo with public service and cultural awards and he shares a blog with Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo, who wrote on Sunday that Singaporeans should "rally around Jack, his wife and his children."</p>
              <p>Others have been quick to distance themselves from Neo. Mitsubishi Electric Asia on Wednesday dropped Neo as a spokesman for the company's StarMex air conditioners.</p>
              <p>"It amounts to Singapore's very own version of the Tiger Woods sex scandal," said Chia Han Keong, a columnist at newspaper My Paper. "Just like Woods, his act of unfaithfulness to his wife has elicited far more reprehension than perhaps he would have expected."</p>
              <p>Woods ended three months of silence last month and confirmed he had extramaritial affairs, at a televised public statement not attended by his wife, Elin. The golf superstar lost a number of advertising sponsors and says he is taking leave from the sport while working to save his marriage.</p>
              <p>Neo's saga began Saturday when Wendy Chong, a model who had small roles in two Neo movies, told a Chinese-language tabloid she has been his girlfriend for two years and confronted Neo's wife last week.</p>
              <p>"Aw come on, that girl is young enough to be your daughter," wrote blogger Victor Koo. "Jack seems to be playing Tiger Woods."</p>
              <p>Newspapers have published allegations of more affairs and quoted actresses who say they spurned his advances.</p>
              <p>Maelle Meurzec, 21, said that after a small role in Neo's 2004 movie I Do I Do, he bombarded her with text messages and told her to meet him at hotels.</p>
              <p>She turned him down.</p>
              <p>"This guy is supposedly promoting family values but he can't even hold himself back from sending text messages to a 16-year-old," Meurzec told the New Paper.</p>

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Beleaguered PBM Jack Neo, who continued to be flamed mercilessly by the media and netizens alike for his “insincere” press conference now claimed (via Mark Lee) that he was forced to cut the press conference short “when his wife became too upset.”</p>
              <p>Jack was embroiled in a series of sensational sex scandals when it was leaked to the press last week that a mistress of his had gone to his place at Pasir Ris to confront him and his wife.</p>
              <p>The 22 year old model Wendy Chong subsequently alerted the media of a meeting held at Crowne Plaza between her family and the couple.</p>
              <p>Following the stunning relevation which drew an immediate response from Foreign Minister George Yeo who called on Singaporeans to “rally” around his good friend Jack Neo, more and more women stepped forward to accuse Jack of “sexual harrassment” including a 16 year old girl of French descent.</p>
              <p>The much anticipated press conference was held yesterday morning for Jack to explain his actions and clarify matters to the public, but it ended even before it began.</p>
              <p>Soon after Jack’s wife Irene Kng finished her speech, she stood up to leave before “fainting” on her way out. Jack was holding her and heard shouting to the journalists following them to “go away”.</p>
              <p>Jack was nowhere to be seen or heard after the “aborted” press conference, but sent his pal Mark Lee to deal with the media instead.</p>
              <p>Mark Lee was earlier rapped by netizens for employing large number of PRC workers at his “Old Town White Coffee” chains.</p>
              <p>In an interview with Straits Times, Mark claimed that Jack was planning to apologize, but he “couldn’t do it” because his wife stood up to leave.</p>
              <p><em>“Jack told me in the car this morning that he was prepared to apologise to his fans, his parents, his siblings, his father-in-law, his church friends, the parents of the women and everyone who has been affected in any way by this,”</em> he said.</p>
              <p>Though Jack admitted his fault in the entire fracas, he did not offer a public apology to his wife or fans.</p>
              <p><em>“He knew that Ah Bu stood up because she could not take it any more. The pressure and all the camera flashes were too much for her. So when she wanted to leave, Jack had to accompany her,”</em> Mark Lee added.</p>
              <p>The dramatic press conference leaves more questions than answers as the “fainting” episode becomes a major talking point among Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>As your correspondent was watching the Channel 8 News last evening at a neighborhood kopitiam, an Ah Pek sitting nearby exclaimed – “Gei (fake in hokkien) lah! Pian (deceive) gin lan (children) ah!” drawing a round of laughter from the surrounding spectators as the scene was shown.</p>
              <p>Whether the drama was staged or not, PBM Jack Neo remains a crowd-puller even when he himself is embroiled in a scandal in real life.</p>
              <p>Perhaps he can derive some inspiration from his own personal misfortune in the next movie – “Sex No Enough” which will surely be a box office hit.</p>

              <p>I hate people like you who like to order other people around, telling them to STFU on a forum.</p>
              <p>This is an open forum and everyone can talk about whatever they like. If you are unhappy, you are welcome to go away.</p>
              <p>You said people are complaining like he had a scandal with their mom. How about you, you seem to be particularly disturbed by it and ask people to stop. Is he your dad?</p>
              <p>Now GTFO.</p>
