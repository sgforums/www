              <p><strong>"Entirely to blame" says Jack Neo at drama-filled news conference</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Jack Neo apologised for his actions at a news conference held on Thursday morning.
              <br> <br> He arrived at the news conference hand in hand with his wife, Irene Kng, and said he was entirely to blame and began crying.
              <br> <br> Earlier reports said he had an affair with a 22-year-old model.
              <br> <br> The news conference ended when Mdm Kng started crying. As she was
              walking off the stage, she fainted. And the photographers and cameramen
              swamped to the stage to take her photos.
              <br> <br> Neo screamed at them to stop filming and get away from her.
              <br> <br> One of Neo's colleagues Ah Nan rushed to the stage and also yelled at the photographers and cameramen to get away from Mdm Kng.
              <br> <br> Neo's entourage then cordoned them and helped them exit the conference room. </span></p>
              <p>================</p>
              <h1>Jack Neo and wife Irene Kng broke down in tears during press conference on 11 March 2010</h1>
              <p>Beleaguered Jack Neo, who was rocked by a series of sex scandals
              since last Saturday after his mistress alerted the media of his sexual
              exploits, finally broke his silence on the saga.</p>
              <p>The press conference venue at ä¸œæ–¹å¤©è�Žå¤§æ¥¼ was already swarmed by reporters from both SPH and Mediacorp 10 minutes before it began.</p>
              <p>As the media waited in anticipation, Jack Neo’s manager went on
              stage and reminded everybody present that this will be the one and only
              press conference given by Jack and here will be no further comments on
              this matter. There will also not be a Q&amp;A session much to the
              disappointment of the crowd.</p>
              <p>Jack and his wife arrived at 10.15am and was seen walking to the stage holding hands together.</p>
              <p>Jack began by saying in mandarin:</p>
              <p>“Dear friends of the media, thanks for your concern over the last
              few days. I would like to stress that all that had happened is solely
              the fault of mine and does not involve anybody else. I feel very
              fortunate today that my wife has forgiven me.”</p>
              <p>Halfway through the press conference, Jack Neo broke down and cried.</p>
              <p>“My wife has suffered more pain than any woman in this world. I am
              very sorry for what has happened. This is my last time speaking to the
              media.”</p>
              <p>Jack then passed the mike to his wife, who said:</p>
              <p>“I do not know how to handle the media…..All I want to say is that I
              have forgiven Jack.  I treasure Jack Neo, my marriage and my children.
              I have been hurt alot. I ask the media to let us off and give us some
              space and your blessings. Thank you,” she cried.</p>
              <p>The press conference ended abruptly before it began. As Jack and his
              wife left the stage, the journalists rushed to surround them for
              further questions which caused a stir when members from Jack’s
              production team shouted at them to leave the couple alone.</p>
              <p>Jack’s wife was reported to have fainted upon leaving the press conference.</p>
              <p>================</p>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">'It's all my fault'</h1>
              <p>A CONTRITE Jack Neo faced the media briefly on Thursday morning and
              apologised for his affairs with several young women, which have hogged
              the headlines for over five days after his mistress went public.</p>
              <p>'It's
              all my fault,' Singapore's most successful film-maker, 50, told a
              packed press conference held at an auditorium in Scorpio East Building
              on Paya Lebar Road, where his production house is based.</p>
              <p>Dressed
              in a black and white checked shirt, a grim-looking Neo, with his wife
              Irene Kng, 46, by his side, said in Mandarin: 'This has nothing to do
              with anyone else.</p>
              <p>'I am lucky my wife has forgiven me. I am sorry she has to put up with the pain which no other woman could have gone through.'</p>
              <p>At this point, he broke down and cried, burying his face in his hands.</p>
              <p>When
              he regained his composure, he urged the media to give him 'a second
              chance', adding: 'I hope this is the last time we will speak to the
              press.'</p>
              <p>His wife then spoke up.</p>
              <p>'I love Jack. I love my marriage and I love my family,' said a sad-looking Madam Kng, dressed in a purple top and jeans.</p>
              <p>Her voice choking, she added: 'I need your support. I really need your blessings.'</p>
              <p>She,
              too, broke down and sobbed, and had to be helped off the stage by
              friends. When her knees gave way slightly, the pack of photographers
              rushed forward. Neo quickly dashed to his wife's side and shouted: 'Get
              away!'</p>
              <p>The whole press conference was over in just over five minutes.</p>

              <p><br>I used to say that also 'Real man no cry' but that is just a figure of speech cuz as a fighting soldier you have to be strong for your comrades and vice versa otherwise all sit down and cry for wat? In this case,Jack Neo deserve a firing squad ,let him shout 'READY AIM' and then his wife can have the last word 'FIRE!'</p>
