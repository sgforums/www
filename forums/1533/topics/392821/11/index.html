              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>In an interview with Lianhe Wanbao, the wife of PBM Jack Neo Irene Kng  who had been maintaining a dignified silence all along in the face of a series of stunning revelation of the sexual exploits of her husband, said she still loves Jack.</p>
              <p>When asked by the reporter on how she is feeling now, she replied:</p>
              <p><em>“We are very good, really very good. Of course I must watch over my hubby. He is like my ‘baby’ now. I will ’sayang’ him everyday,”</em> she giggled.</p>
              <p>She added that she is not angry with Jack and that this is a learning experience for him.</p>
              <p>Throughout the interview, Irene did not show any signs of bitterness or anger towards Jack’s mistresses. She claimed that she is bothered by what they told the media and is still working from morning till night as per normal.</p>
              <p>Irene also revealed that she spoke to Foreign Minister George Yeo over the phone who had earlier urged Singaporeans to rally around Jack and his family.</p>
              <p>She thanked Singaporeans for their kind support and she believed that the saga will be over soon.</p>
              <p>One of PBM Jack Neo’s mistresses Wendy Chong had tried to confront Irene last Saturday at their home in Pasir Ris and was shocked by her calm demeanour.</p>
              <p>Irene had already known about Jack’s many flings and affairs and chose to “open one eye and close one eye” at them.</p>
              <p>Jack is indeed fortunate to have such a loving and understanding wife which makes one wonder why he strayed in the first place.</p>

              <p>The funny thing is that Minister George Yeo supported this Jack Neo.</p>
              <p>I was dumbfounded for that.</p>
              <p>To me, it is a big mistake to support him.</p>
              <p>As a Minister, as a public figure, as a man, a father, a husband, I dont understand how he can stupidly support Jack Neo just on the account of a personal friendship.</p>
              <p>Would he be supporting a murderer? A corrupter ? Why should he be supporting him ? Almost the same.</p>
              <p>How can he overlook a very serious integrity problem and put a personal friendship at the fore.</p>
              <p>I am surprised and disappointed with George Yeo.</p>
              <p>But I believe he did this mistake on a good intention. Jack Neo must have sweet talked him and deceived him with a good impression, just like the way he did it to the girls.</p>

              mistress are not surprising since ancient times. However, young girls nowadays
              are so appalling, even young graduates in their early twenties would do exactly
              what Wendy Chong had done with their rich boss of the company to climb up the
              corporate ladder, worst of all, they do so in the guise of being a professional
              executive with a degree....good image projection but in actuality is no
              different as a slut! Only boils down to one thing, our youngster are so
              materialistic nowadays that sleeping around is nothing to get to the top, be
              they a Ah Lian or so call educated professional...I know of a 23 year old who
              became a General Manager in just 4 months after employment in the company as
              just an Executive upon graduation! She gets faraway holiday trips in the name
              of business trips with<strong> fantasies of money, fame and power...</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>Don't forget that JN's wife is part of the business team, yearned to make money and more money. After all, they are good actor and actress and we really can't tell their mind. If contents reported are genuine, then JN is a super dangerous person and any woman, irrespective of age must keep a distance from him. Is our police goind to investigate the matter to make our society safer?</p>
