But I was surprised to read in ST today that Foreign Minister made a call to all to rally for JN and his family.   FM forgot about the young women he had affairs with.

              <p>--------------------------</p>
              <p><strong><span>Sex no enough</span></strong></p>
              <p>Renowned Singaporean actor/director/producer Jack Neo started having
              sex with 22-year-old model Wendy Chong after knowing her for only one
              month, reported China Press.</p>
              <p>Chong revealed this in a tell-all interview with Singapore's Lianhe Wanbao.</p>
              <p>"He sent me home one night after I visited him at his set (two years ago) and we ended up having sex in his car."</p>
              <p>"There's a curtain on his car window while the windows are tinted. So no one could see what we did inside."</p>
              <p>The model claimed that Neo was very particular about not leaving behind any evidence after sex.</p>
              <p>"He's very careful. He said we could not leave a single hair in the
              car and that the seats had to be readjusted to the original positions.
              He looked like he was very familiar with doing that. So I asked him
              whether he had done that many times before but he denied it."</p>
              <p>"My instinct told me that he was not to be trusted. So I asked to
              break up with him the next day. I told him that I thought he was not
              being serious with me."</p>
              <p>In return, Neo requested to date her for another three months, claimed Chong, to see whether he was merely after sex.</p>
              <p>"He managed to convince me and I soon found myself falling in love with him," she admitted.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the Straits Times reported that the Neo family has moved to a hotel in a move to escape media attention.</p>
              <p>The reporters who swarmed to Neo's residence right after news on
              Chong's turning up at Neo's Pantai Ris house to confront his wife was
              widely-reported, found only his maid in his home.</p>
              <p>His neighbour, Dai, 53, who stays in touch with the director on the
              phone, told the reporters that Neo hoped the media could give him space
              to breathe and save his marriage.</p>
              <p>Lianhe Wanbao reported that it was not Neo's first extra-marital
              affair. Described as a womanizer, his prey ranged from hot teenagers to
              sexy mature ladies.</p>
              <p>"When he's shooting a movie, he likes to get the numbers of female
              newcomers or extras who are willing to do anything to get famous. He
              will then text them suggestive messages or even date them," a source
              told Lianhe Wanbao.</p>
              <p>His wife, Irene Kng, 46, who has eyes and ears everywhere, was
              angered by his infidelity and wanted to divorce him but chose to
              forgive him every time he strayed.</p>
              <p>New Paper reported that Neo's best friend actor-comedian Mark Lee
              was so furious after finding out that Neo was having an affair with a
              22-year-old model that he wanted to slap his good friend and mentor.</p>
              <p>He was shocked and admitted that he never thought his best buddy had the time to have an affair.</p>
              <p>The two of them are responsible for box office hits like Money No
              Enough and Ah Long Pte Ltd and have known each other for more than 10
              years.</p>
              <p>Mark described Jack's mistress, Wendy Chong, as a "normal young girl" who was his co-star in Jack's latest movie, Being Human.</p>
              <p>In hindsight, Mark said it's possible that Wendy got her role in
              Being Human because of her relationship with Jack, but added that Wendy
              did not receive preferential treatment from Jack on the set.</p>
              <p>He believes that Jack and his wife of 26 years, Irene will not hide
              from the public for long. He thinks that after settling their family
              issues, the couple will step out to make a public statement, New Paper
              reported.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Jack's manager, Tang Wing Fai told Straits Times that the film director would tell all "once the dust is settled".</p>
              <p>"Jack's priority is to make peace with his wife and children," Tang was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>----------------------------</p>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">We wanted to shame him</h1>
              <p>THE two young women who have come forward to reveal their trysts
              with film-maker Jack Neo in the local media said they wanted to shame
              him and warned others that he is a 'serial cheater'.</p>
              <p>Freelance
              model Wendy Chong, 22, and actress-hostess Foyce Le Xuan, 25, who were
              involved with Neo, 50, several years ago but decided to speak up now,
              said they didn't dare to reject his advances because they were then new
              to the industry and both were flattered to get the attention of the
              hot-shot movie director.</p>
              <p>Expressing regrets and
              guilt over their involvement with the married man and father of four,
              they told the Chinese media and The New Paper in separate interviews in
              the last two days that they now realise that it was lust and not love
              that Neo hit on them.</p>
              <p>Chong, who broke the news
              of her affair with Neo last Saturday after she showed up at his Pasir
              Ris home a day earlier, demanding to see Neo's wife, Madam Irene Kng,
              46, told TNP on Monday: 'I wanted to shame him - so that he cannot do
              this to another victim.'</p>
              <p>And why did Le wait six years to tell her story?</p>
              <p>'I want people to know that Jack is a serial cheater,' she said.</p>
              <p>'A
              lot of the reports now are skewed towards him and his family. He said
              he still loves his family, and the public pities his wife and blames
              Wendy Chong. Then this experience will have no effect on Jack and girls
              will continue to be conned by him.'</p>
              <p>Chong, who
              blamed herself for getting into a mess with Neo, said: 'I was stupid
              lor. I can only say, ya lah, I made the mistake.'</p>
              <p>Her
              family did not know about about the affair until last weekend. She said
              she had kept it a closed secret because 'I knew the only way to be with
              him, that we can still be together, is without anyone finding out.'</p>
              <p>In
              an interview with Shin Daily News published on Monday, Chong said: 'I
              now realise I was wrong and I have hurt many people. I shouldn't have
              gone into an affair in the first place, shouldn't have fallen in love
              with him.</p>
              <p>'It's like taking drugs, you think you
              have control of your feelings and yourself, but in the end, I couldn't
              get out of the mess. I just got myself more and tangled and eventually
              found myself at a dead end.</p>
              <p>'Previously, I
              didn't give a damn to anything else in the pursuit of love. I just
              wanted to possess him, regardless of whether I was right or wrong. And
              I got myself into a mess.'</p>
              <p>She said the this episode has made her realise that 'it's only your family who will stand by you.'</p>

              <p><strong>J Team may dissolve, Mark Lee to set up own company</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore funnyman Mark Lee intends to set up his own
              production company, Huang Production Pte Ltd, in January next year
              after his contract with disgraced director Jack Neo's firm, J Team
              Productions, expires at the end of 2010, said online news site Xin.sg.
              <br> <br>Lee's revelation comes amidst rumours that J Team Productions may
              dissolve after company founder Neo's affair with 22-year-old model
              Wendy Chong was exposed over the weekend.
              <br> <br> Lee, 41, reportedly said that "J Team exists only in name" after this incident.
              <br> <br>He explained that J Team Productions' current leader, Neo's wife,
              Madam Irene Kng, had said in a recent meeting that she had a hard time
              caring for her four children. As a result, she was not up to the task
              of managing the firm's many artistes and intends to let the artistes
              go.
              <br> <br> Lee pointed out that it was not the artistes who were abandoning Neo, but the other way round.
              <br> <br>Like abandoned orphans, they were told to fend for themselves once
              their contract expires, hence his decision to start his own firm.
              <br> <br>Lee expressed that he will not be terminating his contract early
              but prefers to leave gracefully when it expires. He added that he will
              not poach talents from J Team Productions.
              <br> <br>"I don't want people to call me a traitor, but if my brothers and

              willing to 'take them in'," he said.
              <br> <br> Apart from Lee, comedian Henry Thia and actress Tay Yin Yin's contracts will also expire at the end of the year.
              <br> <br>When contacted, Neo's manager was said to have confirmed that there
              were indeed a few artistes who intend to start their own firm but added
              that he was unclear what the rest planned to do at this point. </span></p>

              based on date of birth and the 8 characters of the Chinese
              horoscope), Jack Neo's fortune started to decline from April 2009

              to turn his calamities into blessings.<br> <br> "Master Hui Jie also advised that for Jack to turn his fortune
              around and to avoid further scandals, he should install in his
              house a miniature fountain or a fish pond.<br> <br> "I hope Jack Neo will consider listening to the advice to turn his
