              <p class="first" style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;"><strong>22 Dec</strong> – Former actress Yammie Nam recently surprised many by revealing that she was raped during her blooming career in the 1980s.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">As reported on Mingpao, the actress, who is now infamous for her erratic behaviour and mental issues, revealed in an interview that she was raped before – a statement that was previously talked about by her closest celebrity friend, singer Mary Yeung.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">In the interview, Yammie revealed that almost thirty years ago, she was sexually-harassed by two men in the Hong Kong film industry. Although the names of both men were removed from the clip, it was revealed that one of them has passed away while the other raped her while they were in Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">Yammie stated that while they were in the country to visit a film set, the said man, who was drunk at the time, stole her bedroom key and violated her.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">The actress stated that while she was psychologically harmed by the abuse, she decided not to file a report to the police, thinking that it was unintentional due to his drunkenness. However, she did obtain a medical check-up afterwards.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">Yammie stated that though there were no physical repercussions, she was mentally disturbed by it and even attempted suicide several times. She even showed her wrists that were covered with slit marks from being sliced with razor blades.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">Meanwhile, Carina Lau, who also experienced a devastating incident when she was kidnapped back in the 1990s, was gutted upon hearing Yammie's story, and expressed, "I am very worried about her condition. I have talked to her a while back and she was in poor shape even back then."</p>
