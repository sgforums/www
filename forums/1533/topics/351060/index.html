Police confirmed that the starlet had committed suicide. <br><br>According to local police, Jang, who was best known for her role in "Boys Before Flowers", had hung herself from a railing along the stairs in her home. She was discovered at around 7.34pm that same day by her sister who then called the police. <br><br>The police revealed that her approximate time of death was around 4.30pm and have ruled out any forms of foul play. Jang’s family did not want an autopsy performed. <br><br>No will of any sort was left behind by the actress. <br><br>The suicide of the actress has sent shockwaves across Korea, with many speculating over the reasons behind her doing so. Some attributed it to contractual woes with her management and limited airtime on "Boys Before Flowers", but close friends of the actress revealed that the main reason was probably depression. <br><br>In a phone call to her friend earlier that day, Jang said she was very tired and wanted to die. <br><br>Jang's sister said the 27-year-old actress had been suffering from depression since their parents' death in a car accident ten years ago. While she appeared cheerful and bubbly, Jang was scared to be left alone. <br><br>Her depression took a turn for the worse recently and prior to her suicide, Jang often cooped herself in her room, her sister said. <br><br>The staff and crew of "Boys Before Flowers" revealed that Jang, who played the dim-witted "Sunny" on the show, was "always bright and positive, with a lot of passion for acting." <br><br>Things seemed to be looking up for the up and coming starlet who had earned recognition for her minor roles in several movies and dramas. She had recently walked the red carpet at the 45th Baeksang Awards, and was going to debut on the big screen with two new upcoming movies. <br><br>Jang joins a growing list of Korean celebrities such as Choi Jin-shil and Ahn Jae-hwan, who have committed suicide in recent years. <br><br>- CNA/ap </span></p></div>

She also stated that she was beaten, forced to serve drinks as well as act as an escort at golf matches.<br><br>"Having read part of the document Jang wrote before she died, there were names of some persons who seem to be related to sexual coercion that Jang was put under. There is a possibility that another list exists," a police spokesman said.<br><br>The former manager of the "Boys Before Flowers" actress had made public her alleged handwritten letters.<br><br>Police seized over 200 items including computers and contracts in Sunday's raid. The head of the management company, identified as Kim, had used the building in Samseoung-dong as his office until October 2008.<br><br>The ground floor of the building was remodelled to look like an upscale bar while the second floor was used as the office. The third floor has a bedroom, shower and karaoke facilities. Police suspect it was here that Jang was allegedly forced to entertain senior public figures.<br><br>"We found a secret room on the third floor, which has a shower and a bed," chief investigator Oh Ji-yong said. "But how the room was used is yet to be verified."<br><br>Investigators will do a thorough investigation which includes going through CCTV recordings, calls Jang made and received, and recalling deleted text messages, in order to retrace her steps leading up to the suicide.<br><br>Jang’s family members, who were initially against revealing the contents of her suicide note, have given the police the green-light to pursue investigations.<br><br>The late actress' elder brother has already filed law suits against three people for defaming Jang, along with four others, including the CEO of Jang’s management agency for sexual coercion.<br><br>Jang was found dead in her home in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province, by her sister on March 8. Close friends of the actress had thought Jang had committed suicide due to depression.<br><br>- CNA/ap<br><br></span></p>
