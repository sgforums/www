              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>While Myolie Wu is away, Bosco Wong goes out to play</strong></span><br> <span class="update">Posted: 08 February 2012 1508 hrs </span><br><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>HONG KONG: Hong Kong
               actor Bosco Wong was photographed partying at a club and getting dead 
              drunk over the weekend, while girlfriend Myolie Wu was away in China for
               work, reported Hong Kong media.<br><br>The series of photographs, which
               were published in a Hong Kong tabloid recently, showed Wong slipping 
              away from a number of sexily-dressed women who had approached him for 
              photographs.<br><br>The photos also showed his friends helping Wong, who appeared dead drunk, out of the club at 4am on Sunday.<br><br>When
               asked about his weekend escapade, Wong said he was simply being a good 
              host to his friends from Malaysia and had brought them out for a night 
              on the town.<br><br>"Because I have some friends from Malaysia over, so I went out with them. <br><br>"We
               haven't gone out to party for a long time," said Wong, before going on 
              to explain that he only became drunk because his friends forced him to 
              drink.<br><br>"I was indeed made drunk, but I have so many friends around at the time that I wasn't worried," said Wong.<br><br>He
               added that he was not worried Wu, whom he had been dating for seven 
              years, would become upset as she too knew the friends he went out with 
              that night.</span></span></p>

              <p>Is there trouble in paradise for lovebirds Bosco Wong and Myolie Wu?</p>
              <p>When
               Bosco was spotted hugging another night club, Myolie took the news in 
              her stride and calmly commented that she "understood" and "did not 
              mind".</p>
              <p>However she quickly cut short all questions on her 
              boyfriend, and chose to comment instead on the food in Suzhou, China 
              where she is currently filming,</p>
              <p>It was rumoured that Myolie was so mad with Bosco's actions, that she had given him the cold shoulder.</p>
              <p>There
               were also talks that Myolie got along very well with her co-star Eric 
              Huang and the pair had been going out for meals together. Eric and 
              Myolie would also keep contact through their microblogs, when the 
              actress returned to Hong Kong for promotional events.</p>
              <p>According to
               a member of the production crew, "There are many actresses in this 
              drama, but he cares for Myolie the most. The two of them get together 
              often. We'd think they are a couple, if Myolie doesn't have a 
              boyfriend."</p>
              <p>While filming an outdoor scene two days ago, reporters approached the pair regarding the supposed dates.</p>
              <p>Myolie
               admitted to having gone on the dates with Eric, and also complimented 
              her co-star, saying that everyone on the drama adored him.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>No.. pls Myolie... Bosco very cute.  Don't do that to him :(</p>
