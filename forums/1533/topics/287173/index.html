            <div class='col-md body'>Ho Yeow Sun Opens Fourth School in Henan, China<br>(October 2007)<br><br>International pop star Ho Yeow Sun (also known as Sun Ho) is active in her profession as both recording artist and humanitarian. Even after gaining significant success in both the Asian and western music scene, the philanthropist at heart has recently extended her charitable causes into China. Over the past few years, the singer has been channeling her album royalties into building schools in various outskirts of the country.<br><br>For someone who believes in the importance of education, especially for the younger generation, SunÂ’s aim of contributing to the ongoing education in China remains clear and focused. To date, she has built four schools in China: Chong Qing, Gui Zhou, Liao Ning (where she also sponsored a computer lab) and Henan.<br><br>Her most recent project took place in Henan Province where her donation of RMB$350,000 (S$70,000) went into building a new block of classrooms for an existing primary school in Sha Ping village, which is located in the town of Liu Dian within Luo Yang county. The population here consists of just 3,300 people, most of whom have little or no formal education. The average annual salary of a villager is about RMB$1,500 (S$300).<br><br>The primary school was originally constructed in 1989 and had a capacity of 516 students in 12 classes. But due to a lack of architectural expertise during building, cracks started to appear and problems of water leakage also ensued. The rundown building began to pose danger to teachers and pupils, and was subsequently classified as D-grade.<br><br>Hence, the authorities in Liu Dian proposed to improve the current conditions of the school which prompted the singer to do something for the people in that village.<br><br>With careful planning and close collaboration with the relevant authorities, SunÂ’s altruistic efforts paid off in October at the official opening ceremony, six months after construction began in April this year. Among the list of luminaries who graced the event were Hu Guang Kun (China Communist Party Luoyang Municipal Party Committee Member), Zong Ting Xuan (Vice-Chairman of Luoyang Political Consultative Committee), Wang Zi Wen (Mayor of Ruyang Municipal PeopleÂ’s Government), Tong Yu Peng (Deputy Mayor of Ruyang Municipal PeopleÂ’s Government), Zong Yan Xuan (Chairman of Luo Yang Municipality Political Consultative Committee) and other officials from Ru Yang County and Liu Dian Rural Administrative Division.<br><br>The new building covers a total gross area of 1,530sqm. It boasts 16 classrooms over three levels which can accommodate up to 800 students, thus being able to increase its yearly intake from now on. With the schoolÂ’s expanded facilities, the move will benefit some 900 families in the village. On top of the additional classrooms, the construction project also includes the purchase of teaching facilities such as library resources and multimedia teaching equipment.<br><br></div>
