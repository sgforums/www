I think the thing that is most interesting is that 20 years ago, they only saw us a lot on TV, and they didnÂ’t have the close relationship like in the concert, because we would go on tour maybe once a year or something like this. And then, we would not come to Asia too often whereas now, we are travelling all the timeÂ… so people have the privilege and the pleasure to hear you sing the songs live,Â” she said.<br><br>And just like ABBA, they too have a hugely successful musical based on their music. "Daddy Cool" which tells the story of 'Sunny' - a young man who lives for his music - is currently playing in London.<br><br>But Boney M are not only famous for their catchy tunes and happy music, their colourful costumes are also a huge draw.<br><br>Â“People would say that if they were in the kitchen doing something and Boney M was on TV, they would drop what they were doing just to come and look because it was so pleasing to see us in our coloursÂ… but I do believe that the songs is whatÂ’s lasted until today and itÂ’s the songs that brings the joy to the hearts of people, and IÂ’m glad for that,Â” said Mitchell.<br><br>And if you canÂ’t get enough of the disco legends, be sure to catch them live at the Boney M Christmas Concert on 15 and 16 December 2006. <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">Over already </span></span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> - CNA<br><br>Now...here are some links of their MTVs...<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q6fpgp6CJo" rel="nofollow">Daddy Cool</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ovJo9WgEEg" rel="nofollow">Rivers of Babylon</a></div>
