Of course, I've felt terrible that she should carry a burden that is no fault of hers. The burden is mine and no one else's," he said.<br><br>Shetty shot to international fame after appearing in the British TV programme and winning after being subjected to alleged racist bullying.<br><br>Describing the way he kissed Shetty, Gere said the step was a copy from his movie "Shall We Dance".<br><br>"My clumsy attempt at a 'Shall We Dance' move was a naive misread of Indian customs and I assure you nothing more."<br><br>Shetty had appealed for calm after the kissing incident.<br><br>"Nothing of the sort happened about which I should feel bad or any other Indian should feel bad," said Shetty.<br><br>Gere, who left India soon after the event, is a frequent visitor as a follower of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who lives in northern India in exile.<br><br>He also visits India in his capacity as an AIDS awareness campaigner.<br><br>India has the largest number of HIV-AIDS cases in the world, with 5.7 million people infected, according to UNAIDS.<br><br>Several Indian lawyers have voiced outrage over the arrest warrant and said it should be withdrawn.<br><br>"Magistrates should not behave like the Taliban moral police. The order is unsustainable and makes us looks ridiculous," former Indian attorney general Soli Sorabjee said.<br><br>(source: <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/070427/1/485ec.html" rel="nofollow">Yahoo News</a>)</div>
