              <p class="articleabstract">Hong Kong singer-actress Gigi Leung announced her split from French boyfriend, Sly, of four years on her blog.</p>
              <p>After four years of blissful courtship, Hong Kong Cantopop singer Gigi Leung announced her split from French designer boyfriend, Sly, on her blog a few days ago. She subtly hinted that their relationship was met with severe disapproval from her mother.</p>
              <p>"After talking about things in a positive manner, we decided that we won't be lovers anymore. But we'll be a pair of even better friends," she wrote on her blog.</p>
              <p>The 34-year-old broke up with fellow Hong Kong singer-actor Ekin Cheng in 2006 and subsequently got together with Sly the very same year. They announced their intentions to get married in Paris this year and even visited Gigi's mother together last year.</p>
              <p>Gigi once openly expressed that her parents are unable to accept her foreigner-boyfriend and that created a lot of unhappiness for Sly. Caught in the middle of her loved ones and lover, the songbird attempted to bridge the gap between both parties and bought her mother an apartment in her housing estate.</p>
              <p>Despite their efforts, Gigi's mother remained adamant and disapproved of their relationship. That was the last straw and Sly initiated for a breakup.</p>
              <p>Although they have since gone separate ways, Gigi revealed that they have been "meeting up every week" and still remain supportive of each other.</p>
              <p>She says, "I have always loved and cherish my family, I hope that everyone can live closer together since it'll be easier to take care of each other. They will soon be moving out. There are some true and untrue reports circulating around. I'm using my blog to reply to these queries. Thanks for the concern."</p>
              <p>When reporters interviewed Cherrie Ying, a bosom pal of Gigi's, for her opinion on this matter, the latter replied, "It's a private matter of a good friend, I will not comment on this."</p>
