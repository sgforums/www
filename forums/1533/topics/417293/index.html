               at the opening of the Asia Television Forum, Information, 
              Communications and the Arts Minister Lui Tuck Yew said the move would 
              attract other local and overseas industry players involved across the 
              value chain -- such as creation, production and post-production -- to 
              Mediapolis, and to participate in collaborative projects with MediaCorp.<br><br>The
               broadcaster could also extend its facilities and services to other 
              production houses "for greater synergies and possible cost benefits".<br><br>He said this would contribute further to the growth of the media landscape. <br><br>Mr
               Lui also said he hoped the infocomm infrastructure at Mediapolis, which
               includes a high-speed network and high density storage systems, would 
              be a lure for digital content companies.<br><br>MediaCorp CEO Lucas Chow welcomes the decision. <br><br>He said the group looks forward to playing a catalytic role in attracting new and foreign media players to Mediapolis.<br><br>In
               2006, MediaCorp had announced its decision to relocate to a site at 
              Bukit Batok, but the plan was shelved due to high construction costs and
               the onset of the economic crisis.<br><br>But it said in a statement 
              that the move to a new campus gained traction as the economy improved 
              and new options presented themselves.<br><br>The design of MediaCorp's 
              new complex is yet to be decided, but the company said it would be 
              high-rise in nature, with television studios and theatres occupying the 
              lower floors.<br><br>The move to one-north will be carried out in phases, and is expected to be completed by mid-2015.<br><br>Separately,
               MediaCorp and the Media Development Authority are working together to 
              support independent production houses in creating made-in-Singapore 
              content exclusively for online viewing.<br><br>The regulator will 
              co-invest up to half of the production budget, and the finished products
