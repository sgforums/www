              <p>VETERAN actress Yang Lina died suddenly last Saturday night. She had 
              been suffering from cervical cancer.</p>
              <p>The 47-year-old, who was last seen in The Perfect Cut 2, a 2009 
              Channel U television series, had apparently been diagnosed with the 
              illness three or four years ago but kept the news from the public, said a
               report by Lianhe Wanbao.</p>
              <p>Yang was admitted to the hospital for treatment shortly after filming
               for the show wrapped, added the report, as her condition had worsened.</p>
              <p>The show's producer, Mr Liu Jian Cai, told the paper that he had an 
              intuition that she was not feeling well, but the crew did not probe 
              further because they wanted to give her privacy.</p>
              <p>They did not know how severe the illness was. Yang did not show any 
              signs of discomfort, and her work was not affected, Zaobao reported Mr 
              Liu as saying.</p>
              <p>Last Saturday night, her illness took a turn for the worse, and she 
              died at the house of her younger sister, Yang Libing.</p>
              <p>Yang, who owned a hair salon with fellow actress and sister Libing, 
              45, entered the acting industry in 1983. She was in and out of the 
              acting circle after giving birth to her two daughters, aged 18 and 13. 
              She left behind her daughters and husband, make-up artist Chau Kim Wa.</p>
              <p>The report also said that the former actress had undergone a 
              minimally invasive procedure to treat the cancer, but the operation was 
              not successful.</p>
              <p>Her body took another beating when she had to undergo surgery last 
              February her second of this nature to remove part of her large 
              intestines after they developed abnormalities.</p>
              <p>She had to remove 25cm on each occasion, according to the report. She
               lost over 3kg after the operation, it said.</p>
              <p>However, industry sources said that Yang remained optimistic, telling
               others that she had to face challenges head on.</p>
              <p>Actress Hong Huifang, 50, told Shin Min Daily that she was shocked to
               hear the news. She had spoken to Yang over the telephone in August last
               year, and Yang had told her she was better, said Hong.</p>
              <p>Hong also bumped into Yang last year at a shopping mall, and she did 
              not look like she was sick, said Hong.</p>
              <p>On online forums, netizens have been expressing disbelief at the news
               of the actress' sudden death.</p>
              <p>"Omg.. RIP. This news is so sudden," wrote 19-year-old xhkuek on one 
              local forum.</p>
              <p>Another netizen, autowil, said: "So sad... Never knew she had 
              cancer... She'll be missed."</p>
