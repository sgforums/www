She died in Malaysia in 1987 at the age of 62, after a long battle with breast cancer.<br><br>Raintree's chief executive officer Daniel Yun had been developing the project with film-maker Eric Khoo. The two will now co-produce Tan's film.<br><br>Mr Yun announced the project yesterday at a thank-you lunch to celebrate the box-office success of 881.<br><br>The musical, co-produced by Raintree and Zhao Wei with the support of the Media Development Authority of Singapore, Infinite Frameworks, Golden Village and Scorpio East, has grossed $1.25 million after two weeks at the box office.<br><br>Mr Yun said that he was very happy with the success of 881, hence the new collaboration with Tan and Khoo.<br><br>Tan, who said he was told he was directing the project only two days ago, is still elated over the box-office performance of 881, his most commercially successful film so far.<br><br>But he is not selling out totally for mainstream projects from now on. He added: 'I've still got a lot of edgy stories to tell. But mainstream movies are a good way for audiences to get to know me.'<br><br>On Rose Chan, he said: 'I know she was a very famous stripper. She was a rebel, but she also gave money to charities and orphanages.'<br><br>The movie he will make, he said, will give an '881 spin' to her life.<br><br>Ong Sor Fern</div>
