              <p>screwed!- you're so sick la. i don't think she is really hot (and AI is not about looks anyway! read: fantasia, taylor hicks), and she has no personality anyway. didn't you see after her song "jolene" she was "pretending" to be more lively... totally no response from the crowd. she's lucky to even be here already. honestly.</p>
              <p>Bayje: I mean, there's reports that Adam is gay and most probably is, (can't be bothered to confirm the news too). But he's been spotlighted by the media obviously since he's quite an explosive singer with personality.</p>
              <p>megan unique but unique can only get you this far. AI is more about the singing chops. which is why she'll NEVER win AI, even if she's unique. she's hasn't proven she's THAT good yet...</p>
              <p>I support MATT GIRAUD the most! Most talented and most underrated, MOST AUTHENTIC. The others, less Danny, Alison, Kris Adam, are damn boring... I mean, we've seen tons of better lil rounds (fantasia, syesha, latoya, jen hudson), scott is like weilian over again *roll eyes* and.. i dont even remember who are the rest.</p>

              <p>i also agree that megan wouldnt win. but its kinda boring that everytime AI winners can only sing good and does not exude a great personality.</p>
              <p>i also like matt. both matt and megan have personalities and personalities play a big part in this industry. but ppl just kip on talking about danny and adam. which is so irritating and boring.</p>
              <p>danny just looks like another taylor hicks. his album sure gonna flop. lol</p>
              <p>adam. ewwwwwwwwww</p>
              <p>but i betcha adam and danny got higher chances to advance to the finals. which i hate it.</p>

              <p>i think it's both a combination of good vocals and personality. I mean, personality can only also  get you so far. Taylor Hicks for instance, seems great on the show, but...CMI in the real recording world.</p>
              <p>Matt is seriously my favourite definitely. Originality at its best. You can see he's not JUST a singer, which most AI turns out to be. He's a musician. So far his two song ,Human Nature and So Small, are excellent covers la. I managed to find the studio recordings and they sound just as great. I mean, he's only sitting down and playing the piano and the crowd gets aroused by the song he sings, that's gotta count for something when Adam and Danny are plainly powering their vocals just to show off.</p>
              <p>I totally agree with u on danny, he won't be able to survive in the real world. Only Adam and Matt (maybe.... Alison) looks like they have the ability to stay in the industry.</p>
              <p>I'm really hoping Danny loses his touch and the crowd gets bored with him asap. And people start to realise Matt's potential like what the judges are (sadly) slowly beginning to see.</p>
