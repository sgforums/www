He was pronounced dead at about 1pm.<br><br>The cause of death had yet to be established as of press time: The police said he had no prior medical history and foul play was not suspected. Other reports say he was given the all-clear in a recent medical check-up.<br><br>Friends rushed to the hospital on hearing the news, including actors Huang Shinan, Rayson Tan and Carol Lin.<br><br>Mr Huang, who owns an events company, told TODAY he was shocked because he had been on the phone with Mr Nah the night before, and nothing had seemed amiss.<br><br>"He was always so full of zeal, always on the lookout for opportunities," he said, adding that he had never heard Mr Nah complain of tiredness even after a hard day's filming.<br><br>"He was a source of motivation and would encourage me whenever I had problems in my business."<br><br>Ms Teo said Mr Nah's mother called him a filial child and was the elder of two sons.<br><br>Besides acting, Mr Nah was a part-time radio deejay and an events host. Fans also remember him from the Comedy Night shows in the 1990s, which he hosted with Mr Neo and Mr Mark Lee.<br><br>News of Mr Nah's death spread quickly, with fans flooding online forums with their condolences and bewilderment that he died so young.<br><br>Cleaner Ms Ang Hua, 59, told TODAY: "I have been watching him on television since the day he entered the industry and I really liked him. He was entertaining and funny."<br><br>Film-maker Mr Neo wrote on his blog: "I still cannot believe he has left ... I wish what I am writing now is just a script or a bad dream, and that all this never happened."<br><br>Himself an avid blogger, Mr Nah posted photos that he took of fellow celebrities, and almost every entry ended with a short video-clip of the day's events. His last post was on Dec 31, in which he listed his wishes for the new year.<br><br>Said Mr Huang: "We had plans to work together again, but now he is gone. Life is so unpredictable."<br><br></div>
