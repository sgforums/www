Evidently! That's why they are so upset about not being able to work here.  If our new policy stops their children from schooling, by all means, they can protest.  But we are just stopping them from working.  In the first place, our job market doesn't need them and they don't even have the basic skills to contribute to the local workforce (namely speaking proper english).<br><br>Allowing them to work here will only created a Lose-Win situation (we lose our job opportunity, they gain our job and income).  Our Govt is just doing the right thing.  Given the same situation, I'm sure the PRC govt will do the same.</div>

However, it was found that their main motive was to earn as much as possible as they deemed possible in their so-called 'Land of Opportunity'...<br><br>Maybe we should bring forth the very fact that their livelihood and expenditure are not the liabilities and pesponsibilities of Singapore Government, and the hard fact is if they can't cope, off they should go...</div></blockquote>If you watched last Mon's Crossfire, you would have seen that the Sg mom commented that if the PRC mom has no money, she should not have sent the child here.  Immediately the PRC mom was so defensive and AGGRESSIVE!  Which part of the Sg Mom's comment was wrong??  None.  In fact, the Sg Mom was absolutely right.<br><br>Likewise, we go USA to study, we will not go there empty handed or no money in our pocket.<br><br>Watch out for tomorrow's one.  More drama to come.</div>

Now, these PRCs, along with PDMMs, are demanding we provide jobs.
