            <div class='col-md body'>Study Mums Should Not Be Permitted to Work?<br>Tonight at 9.30pm and repeat telecast at 11.30pm<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;"><span class="large">CHANNEL U</span></span></strong><br><br>Crossfire is a forum-styled current affairs programme that aims to capture the interest of the post-independence generation of Singaporeans and PMEBs. It will be an excellent avenue for this new generation of non-conformist and introspective executives and professionals to share their views and debate about matters affecting local and even foreign current affairs. Issues discussed can range from politics, economics, health, education, culture and social issues to new societal trends such as casinos, 'one-night stands' and even extramarital affairs.In each episode, there will be three guests from various professions who will form the panelists of the forum. Panelists will voice their opinions spontaneously without the host directing questions at them. The host will then adopt a role as a mediator of the forum to facilitate discussions, gather and adjust conflicting views from all parties.<br><br></div>

Well, if they can't afford, they should not send their kids here. If all Singaporeans have the same kind of attitude, we will all be flooding the universities in UK, USA and Australia and their job markets.<br><br>They want to send their kids here. It's their choice. We don't force them. But when they have no money and no job here, they should not be blaming our government. We don't owe them a living.<br><br>What about letting them work in food courts etc? Well, currently, we have Singaporeans and Malaysians working in those places. We do not need the Study Mums to contribute to our workforce. Besides, they can't speak English and we are a multi cultural society.
