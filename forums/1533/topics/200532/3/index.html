I don't mean to dislike them but it is an honest fact that they are very aggressive.  I will be stupid to hire somebody who talks louder and argues more fiercely than me.<br><br>I worked with PRC before and kenna sabo like nobody's business cuz the PRC colleague feared that I will snatch her ricebowl, when I was hired to help her out.<br><br>I gave business to a shop owned by PRC when I signed a foot reflexology + shoulder/back massage package with the shop.  The PRC shop owner was so greedy.  While I still had half the package to go, he insisted that I renewed.  He even bowed down to me and begged me (see!  no pride at all when comes to grabbing money).  I refused and said "I'm broke today.  Will renew after I cleared the last 5 sessions".  To my horror, the PRC said "I heard that your family very rich one hor!"  Gosh!  Just because I registered a private apt address in the form, he wanted to kuh tok me.<br><br>I met a PRC girl in Shanghai who can blatantly lied thru her teeth just to get into my good book.  She actually said that I was the prettiest Singapore girl she has ever met.  Oh pls lah!  That's supposed to be flattering, but I felt insulted that she thinks I'm stupid.  What a BLATANT lie!<br><br>To be very honest... from the bottom of my heart... I have never met a good PRC person.  Really, honestly!  I am not being brainwashed or influenced by the bad media or rumours.  See my above encounters.  They were just a few that I can recall right now.  There are actually many more horrible ones that I have come across and none I've met so far has earned or deserves my respect.<br><br>If I only have 1 or 2 bad encounters, you can say I suay only.  But it's more than that.  It's literally every single one of them has got something bad about them for me to talk about.<br><br>And after seeing all those PDMMs and especially after seeing reports on them borrowing children to come here, I'm sorry that my ancestors came from there.  But I am glad and proud that my parents are born here and they brought me up here.  It sounds arrogant, but at least I have pride.<br><br>I fully understand why they are like that.  You see, they went thru poverty in their younger days (the communist days) and they don't want to go back to that.  They have to be aggressive to survive and they feel they have the right to, even at the expense of others.  But they have to also understand they we have the right to protect ourselves, our people and our children by imposing stricter policy on them.  Whether they like it or not... THIS IS OUR LAND!</div>

And the way they defend themselves is already justified as a motive of money, not for the child's future... "I need money to live! What do you expect me to do? I've broke my connection in China and my husband has found another woman!" mentioned, but when retorted, "My government is not obliged to give a job and take care of you!" She kept quiet and tried to shed tears to gain sympathy...<br><br>Me ever come across two PRC nationals on the MRT during one of my trips to work in the morning, they were talking how stupid and gullible Singaporean were, and how superior they were... Me didn't like that tone and dressing-down of my countrymen... Me just stood up and told them off: "If you were so superior, why do you choose to come here at all? You can jolly well stay in your country and enjoy your superiority!"<br><br>Guess what? Both of them didn't even understand what me've said cos they replied back in stupidous broken English, mixed with Mandrain... Sucks! And this is what they called superiority...</div>
