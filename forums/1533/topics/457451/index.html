              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>Phyllis Diller, who has died aged 95, was a raucous, zany 
              comedian, with a special line in self-deprecation bordering on flat-out 
              self-mockery. In old age she described herself as a sex symbol for men 
              who don't give a damn, and she treasured Bob Hope's remark that she was 
              so ugly that a peeping Tom once threw up on her windowsill.</p>
              <p>She patented this frank, outspoken line in female bodily imperfections well ahead of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Joan Rivers" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/joan-rivers">Joan Rivers</a> but, unlike Rivers, who appeared on stage without props or wacky wigs, 
              more or less as herself, with Diller it was all an act. She created a 
              comic persona – wild hair, flailing cigarette holder, splayed feet, 
              absurd costume, loud, cackling laugh – when in fact she was a housewife 
              from Ohio.</p>
              <p>Although she made dozens of movies, including three in 
              the 1960s with Bob Hope (who also described her as "a Warhol mobile of 
              spare parts picked up along a freeway"), she was not really known in 
              Britain, except by reputation. She made a splash on Broadway when she 
              took over the lead in Hello, Dolly! for three months in the 1960s.</p>
              <p>Her natural habitat was the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Comedy" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/comedy">comedy</a> and cabaret club, with stand-up appearances on US TV on the Tonight 
              Show and later the Ed Sullivan Show, where she developed a huge cult 
              following for her outrageous one-liners. You can still catch a flavour 
              of it all on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGD7TNnDeSQ">YouTube clips where she auditions for the Spice Girls</a> ("I want to be 65 again; the way I looked when I was 30") or takes part in that bizarre <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on US television" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/us-television">US television</a> habit of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_G0fZO2SXU">"roasting" a much-loved celebrity</a> ("Joan Collins was so popular as a teenager, she was 21 before she 
              discovered that cars had front seats; since then, she's had 15 husbands,
               four of her own"). She was the past master of the addled look, the slow
               burn, the dry put-down.</p>
              <p>She did channel her distinctive comedy 
              schtick into a popular television sitcom, broadcast in the UK in 1967, 
              The Pruitts of Southampton (Southampton, Long Island, that is). The 
              Guardian television critic of the time, Stanley Reynolds, noted a 
              performer who struck him as a cross between<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/jun/07/guardianobituaries2"> Imogene Coca</a> (a zany stalwart of Sid Caesar's and Carl Reiner's Your Show of Shows) 
              and Lucille Ball. Her character was a matriarch in a family fallen on 
              hard times: "Things are so tough, my daughter is thinking of getting 
              married just for the rice."</p>
              <p>Born Phyllis Driver in Lima, Ohio, 
              where her father was an insurance agent, she was educated at Lima 
              central high school and studied the piano at the Sherwood Conservatory 
              in Chicago before moving on to Bluffton College in Ohio with the 
              intention of becoming a music teacher. There she met Sherwood Diller and
               they married in 1939.</p>
              <p>The Dillers moved to California and 
              struggled to make a living, Sherwood in a variety of jobs, Phyllis in 
              local newspapers and as an advertising copywriter, moving on to PR jobs 
              and finally regaling private parties with barbed accounts of life in the
               kitchen. She made her professional debut at the Purple Onion, a San 
              Francisco nightclub, in 1955. By this time she thought she could be as 
              funny as the men she was watching on television. She achieved a national
               breakthrough on Jack Paar's Tonight Show in 1958, after battering at 
              his door for a couple of years.</p>
              <p>The Dillers divorced in 1965 and 
              she married Warde Donovan in the same year. While continuing as a 
              stand-up on stage and small screen, she developed a humorous musical act
               as the pianist Dame Illya Dillya, appearing from 1971 for 10 years with
               symphony orchestras across the US. She played for laughs, but also for 
              real, garnering fair reviews for her keyboard technique.</p>
              <p>Her 
              second marriage ended in divorce within a year, and she had to settle 
              out of court with her first husband's family over accusations that she 
              was libelling them in her act. Her routine included a fictional husband 
              called Fang, whose idea of a seven-course dinner was a six-pack and a 
              bologna sandwich: "The last time I said let's eat out, we ate in the 
              garage." From 1985 until his death in 1996, she was the partner of Bob 
              Hastings. She is survived by her son, Perry, and daughters, Suzanne and 
              Sally.</p>
              <p>Diller's later life was dogged with medical problems, 
              including a heart attack in 1999. Her last big-time stand-up appearance 
              was in Las Vegas in 2002, and she was asked three years later if she 
              missed performing: "I don't miss the travel," she said. "I miss the 
              laughter. I do miss the actual hour … that hour is a high; it's as good 
              as you can feel. A wonderful, wonderful happiness, and great power."</p>
