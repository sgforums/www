              <p><span id="editPageForm:contentsText"> A bikini found in Hong Kong actor Ronald Cheng's room has resulted in his girlfriend Charlene Choi splitting up with him.<br><br>The couple, who have been together for six years, officially announced their separation last week.</span></p>
              <p>The announcement came barely 24 hours after the media speculated that they had secretly registered their marriage in 2006.</p>
              <p>When asked about the rumour, Choi - who was in Beijing for the premiere of her latest movie <em>Beauty On Duty</em> - suddenly choked back her tears and said they had broken up.</p>
              <p>Choi, 28, said she chose to reveal the state of her relationship with Cheng to end the speculation.</p>
              <p>In Chengdu on the same day, 38-year-old Cheng was promoting his new comedy <em>Just Another Pandora’s Box</em>.</p>
              <p>He responded to Charlene's announcement by saying: "Yes, we broke up some time ago."</p>
              <p>Choi denied that the break-up had anything to do with a third party or pressure to marry.</p>
              <p><em>Oriental Sunday</em> magazine, however, reported that the cause of the split was a bikini that Choi found in the boyfriend's room.</p>
              <p>She cried and complained about it to her friends. Eventually, Choi lost her trust in Cheng and decided to split with him six months ago.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong media reported that Cheng was "very close" with several beauties who appeared in the popular variety show <em>Beautiful Cooking</em> co-hosted by him.</p>
              <p>There was also speculation that he dated them and also went on holidays to Macau with them.</p>
              <p>Choi, however, chose to "close one eye" about the rumours until she found the "evidence".</p>
              <p>Choi is a member of popular Cantopop group Twins. The group split after another member Gillian Chung took a break following her involvment in Edison Chen's sex scandal, but they have regrouped recently.</p>
              <p>She and Cheng started dating in 2004 after starring as lovers in the film <em>Hidden Heroes</em>.</p>
