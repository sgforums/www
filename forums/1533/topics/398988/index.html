              <p>Change is the only constant, and it can't be more fitting for Show Luo and Rainie Yang.</p>
              <p>Once at loggerheads with each other, they behaved so intimately onstage last Saturday it was easy to mistake them for lovers.</p>
              <p>Taiwanese
              singer, host and actor Show invited his former nemesis to be guest
              performer at his Hong Kong concert after featuring Singaporean songbird
              Stefanie Sun in the first show. Known for her cutie-pie image, Rainie
              was unusually decked out in a sexy, revealing outfit, though
              temperatures shot up further during the duet.</p>
              <p>At one point
              during their song 'In Your Eyes', Show pointed at Rainie with his
              finger and, unexpectedly, the latter bit and held on to it. Show then
              moved forward, held both of her hands and kissed her on the cheek,
              sending fans wild.</p>
              <p>The two, both famous for their strong
              personalities, were not on good terms due to a misunderstanding years
              ago. According to them, Show finally approached Rainie one day seeking
              to clear the air. Following their lead roles in smash idol drama Hi My
              Sweetheart, they became good friends.</p>
              <p>When introducing his
              newfound friend, Show said, "This is a singer I like a lot. We were
              once on bad terms, but we got to know each other again."</p>
              <p>Rainie
              later said, "I wasn't afraid, since we've kissed before on [Hi My
              Sweetheart]," but admitted his action took her by surprise.</p>
              <p>"He just wanted to make his fans happy."</p>
              <p>The singer-actress also gave the thumbs-up to her outfit, although she was visibly uncomfortable onstage.</p>
              <p>"I
              asked them what I should wear inside, and they said just a bra would
              do. The audience won't be able to see much. Although Show is taller
              than me, we're so close already, it's okay."</p>
