              Sharon Stone is a trash. The Earth-quake region is the place for Tibetant people. The Karma for Dalai Lama? 
              
              The earthquake-hit areas are called Ethnic Tibetant Autonomous Region, which is near to Tibet. In March, this region was hit by riots organized by Dalai Lama's organization. In May, it was hit by natural disater. 
              
              According to Tibetant religion, Lama should hold some ceremony for the dead people; now Panchen Lama is leading all the lamas to pray for the dead people in China. Panchen Lama is another spiritual leader for Tibetant people, a highly respected Lama in China. He lives in China now. 
              
              But Dalai Lama is visiting Europe to enjoy his political life and also meet Sharon to tell her the earthquake is a karma. 
              
              Sharon is an American trash. How Dalai Lama has such brainless friend who damages Dalai's image.?

              I feel,Sharon Stone is drunk while she is out of crotch to saying such evil words. Dalai Lama must have forgotten to tell her that the earthquake-hit place is where Tibetant live.
              
              Now Chinese army are sparing no efforts to save these poor Tibetants.But their spiritual leader jusr stayed with Sharon Stone.I think, Chinese army now is Tibetants' spuritual support.

              I once travelled to the earthquake-hit area. Where I met a Tibetant girl who invited me to her home to drink some tea, to be frank, I didn't like that tea, but I liked her and her family's warmth.
              
              Today when I heard Sharon Stone said earthquake is a Karma; I was angry. 
              
              I don't like Dalai Lama though he charms the west; he loses the hearts of Chinese people,including Tibetant people in Tibet. 
              
              It is a pity that Dalai Lama just have friends like Sharon Stone, or Richrd Gear etc. These brainless people only brings trouble for Dalai.We can judge a person partly from the friend he/she makes, can't we?
              
              In HK, a unviversity girl student claimed she supported Dalai and even protested,highly-sounding,when the Olympic Torch passed HK. Later HK newspaper reported her dirty private life with dirty pictures by herself....HK people all say, "Woo,only such people support Dalai!!"
