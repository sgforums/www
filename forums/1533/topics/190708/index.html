He silenced his critics who criticised his slow speed by producing quality music. He carefully selects his movies and directors<br>In the summer of 1992, A unique and strange soundtrack was circulating well in audio shops and radio waves in India. it did not exibit the characteristics of a typical Indian song<br>A song opens with a "fairy Dust" mesmerising sound effect...<br>ALmost magical disney -like<br>Months later this album and its creator won the State NAtional Award .<br>India's equivalent of a nobel prize.

As he contines his life long philosophy<br>" "If a music artiste wants to blossom into a fully-fledged<br>person, it's not enough if he only knows classical<br>music or if he's well versed only in ragas and<br>techniques. He should be interested in life and<br>philosophy. In his personal life there should be, at<br>least in some corner of his heart, a tinge of<br>lingering sorrow".</div>
