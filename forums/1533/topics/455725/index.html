              Hollywood A-lister Sylvester Stallone was described as "devastated" 
              Friday after his 36-year-old son Sage, also an actor, was found dead, 
              reportedly following a drug overdose.<br><br>Sage Moonblood Stallone, 
              who appeared in the 1990 film "Rocky V" as Rocky Balboa Jr, the son of 
              his father's title character, was found dead at his Hollywood home by a 
              housemaid, according to local media.<br><br>"Sylvester Stallone is 
              devastated and grief-stricken over the sudden loss of his son, Sage 
              Stallone .. His loss will be felt forever," said a statement issued by 
              his publicist, Michelle Bega.<br><br>"His compassion and thoughts are 
              with Sage's mother, Sasha," the statement added, referring to the 
              "Rocky" star's first wife. "Sage was a very talented and wonderful young
               man."<br><br>"Rocky" icon Stallone, who is currently promoting his 
              latest movie "Expendables 2," was a "wreck," celebrity news website TMZ 
              reported, adding that paramedics were called but Sage was pronounced 
              dead at the scene.<br><br>TMZ cited unidentified sources as saying that 
              he had died of an overdose of pills, adding that authorities were trying
               to establish whether the death was intentional or accidental.<br><br>Sage Stallone's attorney George Braunstein said the young actor was not known to be depressed.<br><br>"I
               got a terrible call a few hours ago ... when the housekeeper opened the
               door and they found what had happened," he told NBC 4 television, 
              adding: "I'm personally devastated. It's just a tragic, tragic loss.<br><br>"He
               was an extremely good actor, a good writer/director, really one of 
              those people who was extremely respectful of Hollywood. He loved his mom
               and dad. He was a talented, talented person."<br><br>He added to the 
              New York Post: "He was in good spirits, and working on all kinds of 
              projects ... He was planning on getting married. I am just devastated. 
              He was an extremely wonderful, loving guy. This is a tragedy."<br><br>A 
              spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner's office, reported to be 
              handling the case, told AFP: "We are in the initial stages of our 
              investigation" but gave no further details.<br><br>A spokesman for the 
              LA Police Department (LAPD) said he could not confirm the death, adding:
               "There's a death investigation, they're waiting for the coroner to 
              identify the body."<br><br>Sage also acted with his father in the 1996 
              movie "Daylight," and is credited with 13 big-screen roles including his
               first, in "Rocky V," according to the IMDb movie industry website.<br><br>He was also credited as producer on three films, including the 2006 short "Vic" which he also wrote and directed.<br><br>"He
               wasn't depressed. He was thinking about getting married. He just had 
              his whole life ahead of him," Braunstein told the Los Angeles Times.<br><br>- AFP/wm</span></span></p>

               ANGELES (AP) — Sylvester Stallone's son Sage died at age 36 from 
              natural causes due to a heart condition, coroner's officials said 
              Thursday.</p>
              <p>Sage Stallone's death on July 13 was attributed to a 
              condition that causes blockage of the arteries, and no other factors 
              were involved. It has been classified a natural death.</p>
              <p>The actor 
              and film director's sudden death stunned his family and friends. 
              Sylvester Stallone's publicist described him as "devastated and 
              grief-stricken" and the actor skipped several promotional events for his
               film "The Expendables 2."</p>
              <p>Sage Moonblood Stallone was the oldest 
              of Sylvester Stallone's children and co-starred with his father in two 
              films. He also became involved in moviemaking, directing the 2006 short 
              "Vic," which screened at the Palm Springs Film Festival.</p>
              <p>He made his acting debut in 1990's "Rocky V" and appeared with his father in 1996's "Daylight."</p>
              <p>Also
               in 1996, Sage Stallone and veteran film editor Bob Murawski co-founded 
              Grindhouse Releasing, a company dedicated to preserving and promoting 
              the B-movies and exploitation films of the 1970s and 80s.</p>
              <p>He was 
              found dead in his home by an employee and a relative. No foul play had 
              been suspected, and toxicology results showed only a minimal amount of 
              hydrocodone in his system.</p>
