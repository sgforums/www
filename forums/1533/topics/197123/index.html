"We've been hassled by media calls all day."<br><br>Kidman, 39, and Urban, 38, met in January 2005 at a black-tie dinner in Los Angeles sponsored by the Australian government. The actress, who was previously married to Hollywood heavyweight Tom Cruise, confirmed their engagement last month.<br><br>A phalanx of Hollywood stars, including Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, Naomi Watts and director Baz Luhrmann are expected to attend, as well as media mogul Rupert Murdoch.<br><br>Urban, who has sold five million albums and is regarded as one of the hottest country music stars in the United States, is reportedly in charge of entertainment at the reception and may even sing to his guests.

She cried, everyone cried."<br><br>The song ends with the lines: 'And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you; And I'll earn your trust makin' memories of us'."<br><br>"It was sensational, it was so beautiful, I felt privileged to be there," Rowe said.<br><br>Kidman, who wore an ivory empire-line silk organza and lace dress by Nicolas Ghesquiere for Balenciaga, also cried during her vows, according to the priest who presided over the ceremony, Reverend Father Paul Coleman.<br><br>Kidman had "just a bit of a tear," he said. "But she got through her vows beautifully and so did Keith, but it was just such a human, touching, solemn, uplifting moment. That is the best way I can describe it," he told commercial television.<br><br>Entertainment at the reception, held in a marquee on the grounds, included songs by Hugh Jackman and Neil Finn, who sang The Crowded House hit "Fall At Your Feet."<br><br>The wedding, attended by Kidman's two adopted children with her former husband Tom Cruise, attracted thousands of onlookers who lined the streets to the estate in hopes of catching a glimpse of the bride.<br><br>The couple, who met at an Australian government-sponsored dinner in Los Angeles in January 2005, issued a statement late Sunday thanking people for their support.<br><br>"We just want to thank everyone in Australia and around the world who have sent us their warm wishes," they said.<br><br>Kidman, 39, and Urban, 38, are expected to fly to Fiji this week for their honeymoon.<br><br>Kidman, who won an Oscar for her role in "The Hours", is well-loved in Australia. Urban, one of the hottest country stars in the United States where he has lived since 1992, is a comparative unknown at home. - AFP<br><br></div>
