              Songnian (Chen Shu Cheng), the boss of Phoenix Corporation, raped his
              employee, Zheng Wenyu (Hong Hui Fang), who was already pregnant with
              her husband's child at that time. A few months later, both Wenyu and
              Songnian's second wife, Suzhen (Lin Mei Jiao), gave birth to daughters
              in the same hospital and due to the nurses' negligence, the identities
              of the baby girls were swapped. Wenyu realizes that her biological
              daughter suffers from congenital heart disease, and out of a mother's
              desire for her child to receive the best medical care coupled with
              hatred towards Songnian, she decided to capitalize on the situation by
              perpetuating the mistake. Thus, Ye Yuchen (Zoe Tay) and Fang Songqiao
              (Fann Wong), whose identities were swapped, grew up in 2 disparate
              environments.<br> <br>Wenyu vents her hatred towards Songnian on
              Songqiao, whose childhood was filled with unhappiness. She was often
              scolded and beaten for every little mistakes made. Songqiao bears with
              it in silence and grows up to be a lawyer. In his old age, Songnian
              goes into semi-retirement, having handed the running of his company to
              his god-sister Jiang Ruolin (Constance Song) and sons Renxiao (Benedict
              Goh) and Renyi (Elvin Ng). Ruolin's son, Rende (Jerry Yeo), works in
              Songnian's company. Yuchen also holds the position of an AVP. On the
              surface, the family seems to be a harmonious. However, beneath this
              facade, everyone is eying Songnian's position, clamoring to gain
              Songnian's favour so that they might be entrusted with an important
              role in the company, so that they can take control of it. Having grown
              up in such a scheming and manipulative environment, Yuchen's survival
              instincts are honed. <br><br>When Songqiaio was young, she had an
              extraordinary encounter with a boy, Sun Jie (Tay Ping Hui). Sun Jie's
              father, Sun Nanhai (Li Wen Hai), had been a conman and was made a
              scapegoat in a kidnap. The young Sun Jie resorted to theft to support
              his younger sister, Sun Min (Felicia Chin), till he became Songnian's
              foster son. He and Yuchen get along very well.<br> <br>Over 20 years
              later, in 2008, the girls whose identities had been swapped at birth
              gets acquainted through a petty case of molestation.<br> <br>Yuchen's
              god-brother, Rende, molests an employee, Anqi. Out of a sense of
              righteousness, Songqiao takes Rende to court. Ruolin is worried that
              Songnian might be alerted on the case. Thus, Yuchen volunteered to
              resolve the issue. Yuchen initiates an out-of-court settlement and
              demands a huge compensation but Songqiao is persistent on hauling Rende
              to court. Though on opposing ends, the girls could not help but admire
              the other's strength and character.<br> <br>Phoenix Corporation has
              grown into a conglomerate over the years; its business includes
              overseas casinos and luxurious cruise. The aged Songnian is undecided
              who should be his successor. Songnian's oldest son had been killed in a
              botched-up kidnap years ago (unknown to all, this has been Ruolin's
              doing). Second son, Renxiao, is secretly obsessed with Ruolin and
              blindly supports everything she does, pushing for Rende's succession of
              Songnian's empire and treating his own wife, Yuki (Lynn Poh), coldly.
              Suzhen's son with Songnian, Renyi, is ambitious but incapable, often
              messing up what he sets out to achieve. Fortunately for him, Yuchen is
              always at hand to help clear his mess, enabling him to preserve his
              position and allowing him to meet Rende as an equal.<br><br>Ye Yuchen
              grew up in an environment of distrust and she is constantly embroiled
              in vicious struggles (which have already escalated beyond reprieve)
              with Ruolin’s clique. Due to her ability to keep her cool and turn
              situations around, she finally gains her father’s trust and becomes the
              CEO of Phoenix Corporation. Yuchen had had an unforgettable
              relationship. Three years ago, she met the famous Zhang Feng (Li Nan
              Xing), dubbed as God of Gamblers, in Macau and had planned to marry
              him. However, he suddenly vanished on the eve of their wedding, and was
              never seen again. Rumour has it that he has been killed by his enemies.
              Yuchen refuses to believe those rumours and she continues to harbour
              the hope of his return. She meets Zhou Dazhi (Li Nan Xing), who bears
              more than an uncanny resemblance to Zhang Feng (though the two are
              polar opposites in all other areas), and is convinced that the two are
              actually the same person.<br><br>A-Da is a bona fide gambling addict
              who is skilled in all forms of the vice and has problems staying on a
              job for long. Helpless, his wife A-Bao (Cynthia Koh) recommends him for
              the job of a cleaner at the café where she works. Yuchen is convinced
              that A-Da is Zhang Feng, who might have suffered from amnesia due to
              some accident, but the latter doesn’t even know her. At this time, Sun
              Min appears.<br><br>Sun Min is Sun Jie’s younger sister, and has been a
              fan of the art of gambling since she was young. She had aspired to
              learn from the God of Gamblers and upon a chance encounter with A-Da,
              becomes obstinately convinced (like Yuchen) that A-Da is the God of
              Gamblers. To her, this is God-sent and knowing that the God of Gamblers
              doesn’t accept female disciples, she hits upon the crazy idea of male
              impersonation, entering the cafés’ service disguised as a man hoping to
              learn gambling from A-Da.<br><br>The master baker at the café is Fang
              Songqing (Zhang Zhen Huan), Songqiao’s younger brother, who has been
              nicknamed Prince Cake because of his strapping good looks.
              “Infiltrating” the café as a guy, Sun Min thinks otherwise. To her, he
              is no more than a simple and honest guy whose world revolves around
              cakes. Unknowingly, they start to develop subtle sentiments. As
              Songqing has yet to realize Sun Min’s gender, hilarious situations
              occur.<br><br>A-Da starts to become confused. He’s been directionless
              all his life, and due to Yuchen and Sun Min’s persistence (they’ve been
              recounting his supposed glorious past as well as his influential status
              as the God of Gambler incessantly) in helping him to remember, makes
              him start to suspect his own identity. He starts to believe he might be
              the God of Gamblers, and that he had suffered from amnesia due to an
              accident and that A-Bao had rescued him and brought him to Singapore to
              escape the feud in Macau. He subconsciously eases into the role of the
              God of Gamblers, losing himself…<br><br>Songqiao meets Sun Jie again
              and the latter falls in love with her. Songqiao is unaware that Sun Jie
              is a prodigious thief until the appearance of the Interpol, He Chaoqun
              (Terence Cao). He Chaoqun is seemingly interested in Songqiao, and is
              determined to nab Sun Jie. Songqiao makes the painful decision of
              ending her budding relationship with Sun Jie upon realization of his
              identity. Sun Jie loses his “gift for theft” to a hand injury during an
              accident, plunging him into the abyss of despair.<br><br>After
              exchanging her daughter for Songnian’s all those years back, Wenyu has
              been secretly concerned about her daughter to the extent of trying to
              get close to Yuchen. Unable to contain her emotions any longer, she
              finally blurts out Yuchen’s real identity, much to Yuchen’s shock.
              After regaining her composure, Yuchen is thrust into an emotional
              turmoil. For the power and status that she has fought so hard to gain,
              she cannot reveal her real identity, especially to the Ye family. She
              schemes to prevent Wenyu from divulging the secret and at the same
              time, fends against Songqiao, trying to obviate her contact with
              Songnian. She even causes Wenyu’s death accidentally in her attempt to
              stop the latter from telling the truth. Hence, her life starts to go
              into turmoil. <br><br>In the course of Chaoqun’s investigation into
              Wenyu’s death leads to the unraveling of her rape by Songnian. Songqiao
              vows to bring Songnian to justice, but stumbles upon the shocking
              revelation of her true parentage and is comfused. Yuchen’s true colours
              are revealed and this kindles Songqiao’s suspicion that the former had
              been behind the deaths of Wenyu and Renyi.<br><br>A-Da cannot bear to
              see Yuchen isolated and steeped in her criminal ways. Thus, he chooses
              to stay guard by her side though deep inside, he knows that Yuchen
              would ultimately trudge upon the path of no return. <a style="white-space: nowrap;" href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=logo#"></a></div>
