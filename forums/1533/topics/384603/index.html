              <blockquote>
              <p>Synopsis taken from wiki<br><br>During the mid 1820s, a natural disaster hit the city of Nantong. Running out of food supply for the citizens, governor Hong Chi-wing (Wong Wai Leung) used the city's military food supply to feed the citizens. A few days after the disaster, an official from Beijing arrived to the city to check the military supply. Seeing an empty trailer, the Hong family were sentenced to death. Hong Po-yin (Sheren Tang) escaped from punishment and became a maid in the Prince's mansion with the name Hong Po-kei.<br><br>Twenty years later, Po-kei meets the rich rice merchant Chiang Kiu (Elliot Ngok) in Wuxi, whom she was betrothed to before the disaster, at his manor while the Prince was there for a visit. Chiang Kiu's wife, Yan Fung-yee (Susan Tse) recognizes her and reveals her identity to the Prince. Chiang Kiu manages to convince the Prince to free her, and marries Po-kei as his fourth wife. He appreciates Po-kei's wisdom and persistence, and decides to entrust his business to her, telling her to find a suitable successor for him before he dies.<br><br>Hungry for power and eager to keep tradition, Fung-yee finds every opportunity for her son, the eldest child Chiang Bit-man (Pierre Ngo) to be the only heir of the family business. She tries to strip Po-kei from power even when Chiang Kiu's final will reads that Po-kei should be the full owner of the business.<br><br>Despite attacks from the family, Po-kei manages to keep the business in good shape. She is impressed with second son Chiang Bit-ching (Ron Ng) and guides him to become the successor, but her efforts are met with Chai Kau's (Wayne Lai) challenges. Chai Kau seeks vengeance for being mistreated and wants a pay back from Bit-Man and the Chiang's family uncle, Pang Hang (Lee Shing-Cheung). After rounds of battle wits and fights, Po-kei and Chai Kau develop a deep friendship.<br><br>Chai Kau appreciates Po-kei's work ethics and pledges his loyalty to her. With their excellent cooperation and quick thinking, the business manages to survive through the locusts disasters and the Taiping Rebellion. Meanwhile third wife, Lau Fong (Kara Hui) and Po-kei become good friends and sisters, to the point that Lau Fong even sacrifices her life to protect Po-kei.</p>
