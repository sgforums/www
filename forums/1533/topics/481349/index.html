              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">NEW YORK- Fashion designer L'Wren Scott, the girlfriend of Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger, was found dead from an apparent suicide in her Manhattan apartment, police said on Monday.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Scott, a former model whose slim-fitting, dresses were favourites among Hollywood's A-list stars such as Nicole Kidman, Amy Adams and Penelope Cruz, was found hanging from a scarf.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">"We are investigating it as a suicide," said New York police Detective Kelly Ort.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Police said they had preliminary information that Scott was 49, although that had not been confirmed by her family.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Jagger, 70, said through a spokesperson that he was "completely shocked and devastated." Scott's family issued a statement asking for privacy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">The glamorous pair had been dating since 2001 and were often seen at celebrity events, with the 6-foot, 3-inch tall, raven-haired Scott towering over her rock-star boyfriend.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">The news of Scott's death stunned friends, clients and fellow designers. Kidman, a friend of 25 years, was "heartbroken and in shock right now and unable to say anything," her spokeswoman said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Her death followed the untimely deaths of two giants in fashion who succumbed to suicide: British designer Alexander McQueen, who had suffered from depression, died in London in February 2010 at the age of 40, while his close friend, British fashion editor Isabella Blow, died in 2007 at the age of 48.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Scott became one of New York's most famous designers over the last decade, with a sensibility that catered to women's desire to feel powerful and sleek.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">"She pushed aside interest in what was happening in fashion trends and on the runways, and designed for women, to give them confidence with their bodies in looks that were so beautiful," said Eric Wilson, the fashion news director at InStyle magazine.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">FASHION, MUSIC WORLDS GRIEVE</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Police said a female was found "unconscious and unresponsive" in an apartment building in the upscale Chelsea neighbourhood. Fire officials, who responded to a cardiac arrest call, said the woman was dead when they arrived.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Julie Bolcer, of the city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, said the office had not received the body nor begun work to determine the manner of death.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">"Given the timing, that individual will probably be examined tomorrow and if everything is straightforward, the cause and manner of death would be available by tomorrow," she said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Foul play was not suspected, police said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">A single bouquet of yellow daffodils was placed in front of the glass-fronted, high-rise building where Scott lived. Police cordoned off its entrance as a swarm of media gathered across the street.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">The Rolling Stones were on tour, currently in Perth, Australia. It was not known whether they would cancel their concert there, scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Musician and fashion friends of the couple took to Twitter to express their grief.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">"Devastated to have lost my friend," tweeted rocker Bryan Adams, who has photographed Scott. "Rest in peace my dear I'm gonna miss you. Condolences to all that were close to her."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Jagger's first wife, Bianca, said she was "heartbroken to learn of the loss of the lovely and talented L'Wren Scott. My thoughts and prayers are with her family."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">American fashion designer Marc Jacobs said: "You'll forever be missed."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">The British Fashion Council described Scott as a woman who inspired many.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">"She will leave behind an exceptional legacy however we are so proud to have had her in our midst. At this sad time our thoughts are with her friends and family," it said in a statement.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">KNOWING WHAT WOMEN WANT</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Scott, born Luann Bambrough, was raised in Utah by adoptive parents. The dark-haired beauty started her career as a model in Paris before becoming a stylist and designer.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Her love of fashion began when she made her own clothes as a teenager, according to her website. As a model in Paris, Scott became more interested in making clothes than modelling them.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">After moving to Los Angeles, she worked as a stylist and designed privately before creating her own collection.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Her styling background was important to who she was as a designer and she was constantly shopping for the women she dressed, Wilson said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">"That experience gave her an incredible amount of ammunition when she started designing her own clothes. She knew what worked best for all body types," he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">It was unclear if Scott had shown any signs in her work or personal life that foreshadowed her death.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">She cancelled a planned show for her fashion label at London Fashion Week last month.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">The last collection that she showed in September 2013 was inspired by Japanese culture and featured embroidery and sleek lines: white below-the-knee dresses belted at the waist; red, black and white skirts, shorts and jackets; a bold yellow dress and pants.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Scott collaborated with many in the fashion and beauty industry, including Lancome for her first makeup collection, and designed Italian-made shoes, handbags, eyewear and a small holiday collection for Banana Republic last year.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; line-height: 19.375200271606445px;"><strong>Police stand guard outside designer L'Wren Scott's home in the Manhattan borough of New York March 17, 2014</strong></span></p>

              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">The singer and the iconic Vogue editor have joined many in remembering the stylist and fashion designer, who was found dead from apparent suicide at her home in New York this morning (17.03.14).</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Anna wrote on Vogue.com: ''I am deeply saddened by the loss of L'Wren Scott. L'Wren was a total perfectionist, someone who absolutely embodied everything her marvelous clothes stood for: strength of character combined with a confident and powerful style.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">''In person, L'Wren was always unbelievably generous, gracious, kind, and so much fun. Her old world American manners and charm were from another time, but her sensibility was always fiercely modern. We will all miss her.''</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Expressing her grief at the designer's passing at the age of 49, Madonna said: ''This is a horrible and tragic loss. I'm so upset. I loved L'Wren's work and she was always so generous with me.''</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">The tributes comes as pictures have emerged of L'Wren's partner of 13 years, Sir Mick Jagger, just moments after he had been told she had been found dead. The Rolling Stones singer looked visibly distraught as he left Coco's restaurant in Perth, Australia, where he has recently landed with the band to start a tour.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Others to pay tribute include model Naomi Campbell, who said: ''I am deeply shocked and devastated by the news.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">''L'Wren was someone I knew since I was 17. We travelled the world together many times. L'Wren was someone I always loved. She was the epitome of elegance and femininity yet still had a girlish quality.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">''I will miss her honesty and I will miss her friendship. My heart goes out to Mick and all who loved her and were loved by her. May she rest in peace.''</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Pop singer Lily Allen wrote in Twitter: ''I have just got off a plane and heard the sad news of L'Wrens passing. What a terrible tragedy, I'm in shock. I saw her at the hairdressers only the other day.''</p>

              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">Bianca Jagger has led tributes to L'Wren Scott.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">The 49-year-old fashion designer was found dead this morning (17.03.14) appearing to have taken her own life and Bianca - the former wife of Sir Mick Jagger, who had been L'Wren's partner for the past 13 years - was among the first to pay respects.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">She wrote on Twitter: ''Heartbroken to learn of the loss of the lovely and talented L'Wren Scott. My thoughts and prayers are with her family. May she rest in peace.''</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">Former model L'Wren was a sought after stylist and her clothing brand was very popular among celebrities, with fans including Nicole Kidman, Penelope Cruz and Michelle Obama, ensuring tributes were quick to flood in.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">Khloe Kardashian - who had previously worn one of L'Wren's designs to appear on the cover of Glamour magazine - exclusively told BANG Showbiz: ''Oh my god that's horrible! When anyone passes away it's so tragic and horrible. I just pray for her family.''</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">Rocker turned photographer Bryan Adams, who was a friend of the designer, tweeted: ''Devastated to have lost my friend L'wren. @lwrenscott Rest in peace my dear I'm gonna miss you. Condolences to all that were close to her (sic).''</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">Bette Midler wrote: ''Just got news of the beautiful L'wren Scott's death perhaps by her own hand. I am devastated. A rare, wonderful, talented soul. Goodbye (sic).''</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">Actress Olivia Wilde said: ''L'wren Scott was brilliant, elegant, kind, and generous. S**t. My heart goes out to her loved ones. What a tragedy (sic).''</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">From the fashion world, designer and close friend Marc Jacobs wrote: ''Rest in peace, L'Wren Scott. You'll forever be missed.''</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">A friend close of L'Wren said there had been no outward signs she was unhappy before her tragic passing at her apartment in New York.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">The source told the New York Post that at Christmas ''she was perfectly normal, she was giving out advice.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">''I've never known her to say anything to me like 'I'm sad'. Everybody who knows L'Wren and Mick are totally and completely shocked.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.333em;">''Neither of them drink and do drugs, and they were always really affectionate with each other. There were no signs of problems in their relationship.''</p>

              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Sir Mick Jagger is ''completely shocked'' by the death of L'Wren Scott.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">The Rolling Stones singer was on tour with the band in Australia when he was informed his partner of 13 years has died of an apparent suicide today (17.03.14).</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">His spokesperson said: ''He is completely shocked and devastated by the news.''</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Fashion designer L'Wren was found hanging from a scarf on a doorknob in her home in Manhattan, New York, by her assistant at around 10 o'clock this morning.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">The assistant went to the apartment and let herself in after receiving instructions to do so by text message from L'Wren.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">A New York police department spokesperson said: ''At approximately 10.05 hours police responded to 200 11th avenue.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">''Upon arrival, officers discovered a 49-year-old female, unconscious and unresponsive. Emergency Medical Services also responded and pronounced the aided DOA [Dead On Arrival] at the scene. The investigation is ongoing and the medical examiner will determine the cause of death.''</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">New York Police have also said there is no suspicion of foul play connected to the death, but they are awaiting the examiner's formal report.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">L'Wren - a former model, who stands at 6' 3'' - had met Mick on a photo shoot in 2001 when she was working as a stylist. They started dating, but didn't appear together publicly until 2005, when they attended the Golden Globes ceremony. In recent years they had divided their time between New York and London - where she has a design studio - and also owned a flat in Paris together.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">After years as a successful model and stylist, L'Wren launched her own brand in 2006, which became a favourite of many celebrities, including Sarah Jessica Parker, Michelle Obama and Christina Hendricks.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Her friend, actress Nicole Kidman, said of her clothing: ''She knows what aspects to accentuate in a woman, and is able to make you feel incredibly sexy and sophisticated when you are in one of her exquisite designs.''</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">L'Wren was born Luann Bambrough in Utah and raised by adoptive parents before moving to Paris while still a teenager to work as a model.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Her fashion career also included designing costumes for films, including 1996's 'Diabolique', 'Ocean's Thirteen', 'Eyes Wide Shut' and 'Shine a Light', a documentary about The Rolling Stones.</p>

              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">L'Wren Scott's former maid says she ''sacrificed a lot'' to be with Sir Mick Jagger.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">The fashion designer's tragic death from apparent suicide was discovered in New York this morning (17.03.14), and her former maid, Lupe Montufar - who served L'Wren from 1993 until 2009 - says her 13-year relationship with The Rolling Stones frontman came at a price.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Although she made clear she doesn't know what drove L'Wren to take her own life, Lupe told the New York Daily News newspaper: ''She would tell me she wanted to get married and have a family, but she didn't want to get her hopes up or say it out loud to Mick. She didn't want to pressure him.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">''She always dreamed about having fame, fortune and money. She had all that in her hands with him.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">''She sacrificed a lot to be with him. A few years ago, she thought she'd be with him forever and have a family.''</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">It has emerged that L'Wren's fashion company was in debt at the time of her death, but friends say she was always too headstrong to ask her famous partner for financial help.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Mick, 70, was said to be ''completely shocked and devastated'' by L'Wren's passing and is thought to be heading from Australia, where he was due to start a tour, to New York.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Lupe, 57, stopped working for L'Wren when she sold her Los Angeles home in 2009 to spent more time in New York and Europe.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">She added: ''She was very loud and fun when she was young, but with Mick she turned more quiet. She used to yell 'Lupe' in a fun, boisterous voice, but later it was much softer and more reserved. He had her under his spell.''</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17.993711471557617px;">L'Wren Scott's fashion company was £3.5 million in debt when she was found dead after apparently taking her own life.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">L'Wren Scott was £3.5 million in debt when she died.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">The fashion designer was found in her New York apartment this morning (17.03.14) having apparently taking her own life, leaving her friends, family and partner - The Rolling Stones singer Sir Mick Jagger - devastated.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">According to accounts for her business, LS Fashion LTD, which were filed in the UK in October 2013, the company was in trouble, with a deficit of £3,546,000 and the designer owing creditors £4,593,000.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Friends have said the former model - known for her headstrong ways - had always refused financial help from her multi-millionaire partner of 13 years.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">Speaking about L'Wren's fashion label, which she started in 2006, a source told MailOnline.co.uk: ''L'Wren was in a lot of financial trouble. She was unable to pay her staff and her suppliers and it had been going on for a very long period of time.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.333em; font-size: 12px; color: #333333;">''She wanted so badly for things to be a success. Whereas she got her outfits on a number of high profile people, the clothes were not a commercial hit and didn't fly off the shelves. It was a huge burden on her and she didn't want to fail.</p>

But she didn't. Things were left a long time and she spent the past few months struggling to pay the vast amount of her outgoings. It was a tragic situation and she kept it from everyone.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">NEW YORK  - Fashion designer L'Wren Scott, found dead in her high-rise Manhattan apartment on Monday, committed suicide by hanging, the New York City medical examiner's office said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Police had been treating the death of the 49-year-old former model and stylist who was the girlfriend of Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger as an apparent suicide after finding the her body with a scarf around her neck.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">The Medical Examiner did not release any more details about her death. Her family has yet to announce funeral arrangements.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">In a posting on his official website, Jagger, who had dated Scott since 2001 and was in Australia when he received news of her death, spoke of his distress and sorrow.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">"I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way," he said in the post on mickjagger.com. "She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me."</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">The Rolling Stones postponed concerts in Australia and New Zealand after learning of her death. The group had been due to start the seven-concert leg of their world tour on Wednesday in Perth, Australia. Fans were told to keep their tickets until further information was released.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Scott's sleek, sexy designs were popular among Hollywood stars such as First Lady Michelle Obama and Nicole Kidman, who was also Scott's friend.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">Although her gowns were featured regularly on red carpets, her company faced mounting debts. Last October in accounts filed in London her firm, LS Fashion Ltd, reported a loss of 4.3 million euros (US$5.99 million) in 2012, an increase from 3.0 million euros the previous year.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">American fashion critic Cathy Horyn, who had known Scott since the mid-1990s when she worked as a stylist for photographer Herb Ritts, said Scott was planning to close her business and was going to make an announcement this week.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.464000701904297px;">"Still, as painful as the decision must have been for her, I wouldn't draw any conclusions from it about her state of mind. Nor should any credence be given to reports of a breakup with Mick. It's rubbish," she wrote in The New York Times, where she was fashion critic from 1999 to earlier this year.</p>
