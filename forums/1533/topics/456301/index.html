              magically heal their fractured relationship. The British actor has moved out of
              their Los Angeles home after news broke that she cheated with a married
              director.</p>
              <p>Wednesday afternoon, Stewart – looking worse for the wear in a white Adidas
              T-shirt, rolled up and frayed gray gym shorts, and black shoes – was
              photographed on a Los Angeles street appearing distraught. She wiped tears from
              her eye, rubbed her head, and held her crossed arms to her stomach. Well, there
              seems to be a good reason behind those tears: <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20615110,00.html">People</a> magazine reports
              that Pattinson, 26, has packed his bags and left the home he shared with
              Stewart, 22. The "heartbroken and angry" actor is "in
              seclusion" and "not in contact" with his girlfriend of three
              years.</p>

              <p>"I'm not sure they'll be able to recover from this," a source said
              to <em>People </em>about the “Twilight” sweethearts.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday evening, <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kristen-stewart-robert-pattinson-rupert-sanders-2012247">Us Weekly </a>posted their cover story about Stewart
              cheating with her "Snow White and the Huntsman" director Rupert
              Sanders. In the latest issue of the magazine, there are a series of photos,
              taken July 17, of Stewart and Sanders kissing each other in the actress' MINI
              Cooper and then a secluded park-like area called Pacific View Trail, which
              overlooks the Hollywood sign. According to the story, Stewart left the
              three-bedroom home that she has shared with Pattinson since September 2011 to
              rendezvous with Sanders. During the tryst, she was wearing Pattinson’s blue
              L.A. Dodgers baseball cap. Stewart later dropped off the director three blocks
              from the home he shares with his model/actress wife, Liberty Ross, and their
              two children. Stewart then sped off, returning home to Pattinson.</p>

              <p>After the magazine hit newsstands Wednesday, Stewart admitted to cheating
              and issued a public apology. "I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and
              embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has
              affected," she said in a statement to <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20614722,00.html">People</a>. "This momentary
              indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I
              love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry."</p>
              <p>Sanders – whose wife Ross played Stewart's mother in "SWATH" –
              issued his own statement, telling <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20614764,00.html">People</a>, "I am utterly distraught about the
              pain I have caused my family. My beautiful wife and heavenly children are all I
              have in this world. I love them with all my heart. I am praying that we can get
              through this together."</p>
              <p>In an interview Ross gave two weeks ago to <em>YOU </em>Magazine (excerpted
              on the<em> Daily Mail</em>), she talked about "hard times" she and
              Sanders endured after moving to L.A. to launch his career as a director. 
              "I would never say out loud that I am raising my children alone, but a lot
              of the time it has felt like that," Ross told the magazine. However,
              things had started to turn around. "That's why everything feels so amazing
              now," she said. "We rode through the really hard times and we stuck
              it out."</p>
              <p>While Pattinson has yet to comment on the cheating scandal, his decision to
              pack up and leave the home he shares with Stewart speaks volumes.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span>LOS ANGELES: 
              Public displays of affection gave way to public displays of apology 
              Wednesday as "Twilight" star Kristen Stewart and the director of her 
              latest movie candidly admitted they've had an illicit affair.
              <br> <br> Stewart, 22, the most bankable actress in Hollywood, was first to take 
              the plunge, confessing via People magazine that she had cheated on 
              longtime boyfriend and "Twilight" co-star Robert Pattinson, 26.
              <br> <br> "I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those 
              close to me and everyone this has affected," said Stewart, whose new 
              film "Snow White and the Huntsman" hit US theaters in June.
              <br> <br> "This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in
               my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I 
              love him, I'm so sorry."
              <br> <br> Then came "Snow White" director Rupert Sanders with his own statement, 
              saying he was "utterly distraught about the pain I have caused" to his 
              wife of seven years, model Liberty Ross, 33, and their two young 
              children.
              <br> <br> "My beautiful wife and heavenly children are all I have in this world. I
               love them with all my heart. I am praying that we can get through this 
              together," said Sanders, who is English.
              <br> <br> Prompting both apologies was Us magazine, which revealed Tuesday it 
              would be running "exclusive photos" of Stewart and Sanders "packing on 
              the PDA" (public displays of affection in gossip talk) in its next 
              issue.
              <br> <br> It said the photos were snapped in Los Angeles on July 17.
              <br> <br> News of the affair comes less than three weeks after Hollywood star 
              couple Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes reached a "private" divorce 
              settlement after five years of marriage.
              <br> <br> People magazine said Stewart and Pattinson have been increasingly open 
              about their four-year relationship, while E! Online quoted a source as 
              saying the Stewart-Sanders fling occurred after the filming of "Snow 
              White" was finished.
              <br> <br> The second half of "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn" is scheduled to 
              hit theaters in November, after part one helped Stewart earn $34.5 
              million in the year to May, more than any other Hollywood actress, 
              according to a Forbes list.

              <p class="first">Kristen Stewart is feeling “down and lonely” following her fling with director Rupert Sanders.</p>
              <p>The
               actress, who was said to be in hiding following the revelation of her 
              tryst with the married Snow White and the Huntsman filmmaker, has been 
              pictured in public for the first time since boyfriend Robert Pattinson 
              reportedly broke up with her.</p>
              <p>Looking pale and preoccupied, the 
              Twilight star wore a low-key outfit consisting of a baseball cap, 
              cropped T-shirt and grey skinny jeans as she carried a bunch of flowers 
              in Los Angeles yesterday.</p>
              <p>“Of course she is down and lonely,” a 
              source told UK magazine Grazia. “She’s terrified of the reaction to her 
              actions. She doesn’t feel she should be the only one to suffer for 
              something both her and Rupert had an equal part in. She knows she’s made
               a mistake and she’s sorry.”</p>
              <p>Since the news of Kristen and 
              Rupert’s alleged affair broke, it has been reported that the actress has
               been dropped from the planned sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman. 
              Universal later denied she had been axed, simply stating they were 
              "exploring all options”.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Robert has apparently been invited to spend time with fellow Hollywood heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>
              <p>The 37-year-old has reportedly asked the Cosmopolis star to join him in Puerto Rico.</p>
              <p>It
               is believed that mutual friend Reese Witherspoon put the two hunks in 
              touch after Leonardo expressed his concerns for the 26-year-old.</p>
              <p>"Leo
               has been one of Rob's role models for years, and Rob was totally taken
