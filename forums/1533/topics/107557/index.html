            <div class='col-md body'><br>December 15, 2004<br><br>Four baby boys will be born to 3 MediaCorp actresses by March next year. How are Zoe Tay, May Phua and Ivy Lee handling their pregnancies?<br><br>Kwok Kar Peng<br><br>For first-time mummies Zoe Tay and May Phua, pregnancy is a beautiful experience for them. The process has been more difficult for Best Actress Ivy Lee, who had to carry twin boys and film Double Happiness II for several months. This is IvyÂ’s second pregnancy; she has a young daughter already in primary school.<br><br><strong>May PhuaÂ’s thoughts on pregnancy</strong><br><br>May: Yes, IÂ’m starting to be nervous and scared! IÂ’ve been told itÂ’ll be very painful as itÂ’s my firstborn and the labour pains will be longer. IÂ’m slightly anaemic so I faint easier, especially recently since I entered my last trimester.<br><br>My hubby and friends tell me to have someone with me at all times in case I faint or have an early delivery, but I love going out shopping or to the movies, and IÂ’m alone during these excursions. I havenÂ’t been recognized in my baseball cap so far.<br><br>ItÂ’s been a very good rest; though IÂ’m a bit bored. Motherhood is a new challenge and also a major role for me. IÂ’ve never expected to be pregnant so soon, but since the babyÂ’s here, IÂ’m going to make sure I do it well. How many kids? Haha I donÂ’t know, but I wonÂ’t stop at one!<br><br><strong>Ivy Lee on working on Double Happiness II during pregnancy</strong><br>Ivy: I think IÂ’ve an affinity with things that come in two: like Double Happiness, my twins, and even my seat number in the TV Theatre for Star Awards was 11. Maybe my babies brought me good luck and I won Best Actress; people who are superstitious will think so, but I believe I worked hard too.<br><br>It was tough filming Double Happiness II; when I think back on it, I think I was pretty gungho. Being pregnant is tedious enough, but imagine being pregnant with twins and continue filming at the same time. I didnÂ’t want to reveal earlier that IÂ’m carrying twins because the scriptwriters had already changed the script for me, I didnÂ’t want the production crew to get too stressed up on my condition..<br><br><strong>How Ivy felt when she found out sheÂ’s carrying twins </strong>I was very surprised! I went for my pap smear not knowing I was pregnant. I missed my menstruation but I did a pregnancy test kit and it was negative. It was only after my doctor did my pap smear that I found out I was pregnant with not one, but two babies! I never expected it. I do worry about having twin boys, since boys are harder to bring up. But I think my daughter, whoÂ’s in primary school, can help me with them.<br><br><strong><br>Zoe TayÂ’s thoughts on her pregnancy</strong><br>Zoe: The pregnancy process is fun; I never thought being pregnant will be so enjoyable! I experience something new at every stage and every day. I feel very happy, and IÂ’m basking in this miracle. Even though my husband is working overseas, I still feel very contented and satisfied with my baby with me.<br><br>My baby is beginning to respond like kicking, and IÂ’m learning how to communicate with him. I learn that a baby can do somersaults in the motherÂ’s womb, about his sleeping hours, how to comfort him, and how he responds to the voices and music around himÂ…<br><br>I play classical music to my baby and talk and sing songs like The More We Are Together in Mandarin and English to him. It doesnÂ’t matter if he understands; whatÂ’s important is that babies can feel their motherÂ’s voice.<br><br>Friends like Ivy Lee, Pan Lingling and Hong Huifang now tease me that I can finally join in their mummy group. Previously, when they invite me out on their family outings, IÂ’d say Â‘No no no, youÂ’re bringing your kid along, so troublesome. You guys go ahead, donÂ’t ask me along. End up go theme park lah, then the kids want to have their nap, so boring.Â’ Now they are laughing at me and welcoming me.<br><br>But IÂ’m looking forward to it! ItÂ’s a different lifestyle and experience. The whole pregnancy process has been very fun and IÂ’m very happy.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>May Phua</strong></span><br>Sex :  Boy Due date January 18<br>Name : Haven't thought of it yet; will ask a feng-shui master to think of a name when the baby is born.<br>Weight gained : 13 kg (went from size 4 to size 10) 16kg 10kg<br>Endorsements : Keeping her fingers crossed None 3<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ivy Lee</strong></span><br>Sex : Twin boys<br>Due date : February (around Chinese New Year)<br>Name  : Not yet; will ask a feng-shui master to think of a name when the babies are born.

How are Zoe Tay, May Phua and Ivy Lee handling their pregnancies?<br><br>Kwok Kar Peng<br><br>For first-time mummies Zoe Tay and May Phua, pregnancy is a beautiful experience for them. The process has been more difficult for Best Actress Ivy Lee, who had to carry twin boys and film Double Happiness II for several months. This is IvyÂ’s second pregnancy; she has a young daughter already in primary school.<br><br>[b]May PhuaÂ’s thoughts on pregnancy</strong><br><br>May: Yes, IÂ’m starting to be nervous and scared! IÂ’ve been told itÂ’ll be very painful as itÂ’s my firstborn and the labour pains will be longer. IÂ’m slightly anaemic so I faint easier, especially recently since I entered my last trimester.<br><br>My hubby and friends tell me to have someone with me at all times in case I faint or have an early delivery, but I love going out shopping or to the movies, and IÂ’m alone during these excursions. I havenÂ’t been recognized in my baseball cap so far.<br><br>ItÂ’s been a very good rest; though IÂ’m a bit bored. Motherhood is a new challenge and also a major role for me. IÂ’ve never expected to be pregnant so soon, but since the babyÂ’s here, IÂ’m going to make sure I do it well. How many kids? Haha I donÂ’t know, but I wonÂ’t stop at one!<br><br><strong>Ivy Lee on working on Double Happiness II during pregnancy</strong><br>Ivy: I think IÂ’ve an affinity with things that come in two: like Double Happiness, my twins, and even my seat number in the TV Theatre for Star Awards was 11. Maybe my babies brought me good luck and I won Best Actress; people who are superstitious will think so, but I believe I worked hard too.<br><br>It was tough filming Double Happiness II; when I think back on it, I think I was pretty gungho. Being pregnant is tedious enough, but imagine being pregnant with twins and continue filming at the same time. I didnÂ’t want to reveal earlier that IÂ’m carrying twins because the scriptwriters had already changed the script for me, I didnÂ’t want the production crew to get too stressed up on my condition..<br><br><strong>How Ivy felt when she found out sheÂ’s carrying twins </strong>I was very surprised! I went for my pap smear not knowing I was pregnant. I missed my menstruation but I did a pregnancy test kit and it was negative. It was only after my doctor did my pap smear that I found out I was pregnant with not one, but two babies! I never expected it. I do worry about having twin boys, since boys are harder to bring up. But I think my daughter, whoÂ’s in primary school, can help me with them.<br><br><strong><br>Zoe TayÂ’s thoughts on her pregnancy</strong><br>Zoe: The pregnancy process is fun; I never thought being pregnant will be so enjoyable! I experience something new at every stage and every day. I feel very happy, and IÂ’m basking in this miracle. Even though my husband is working overseas, I still feel very contented and satisfied with my baby with me.<br><br>My baby is beginning to respond like kicking, and IÂ’m learning how to communicate with him. I learn that a baby can do somersaults in the motherÂ’s womb, about his sleeping hours, how to comfort him, and how he responds to the voices and music around himÂ…<br><br>I play classical music to my baby and talk and sing songs like The More We Are Together in Mandarin and English to him. It doesnÂ’t matter if he understands; whatÂ’s important is that babies can feel their motherÂ’s voice.<br><br>Friends like Ivy Lee, Pan Lingling and Hong Huifang now tease me that I can finally join in their mummy group. Previously, when they invite me out on their family outings, IÂ’d say Â‘No no no, youÂ’re bringing your kid along, so troublesome. You guys go ahead, donÂ’t ask me along. End up go theme park lah, then the kids want to have their nap, so boring.Â’ Now they are laughing at me and welcoming me.<br><br>But IÂ’m looking forward to it! ItÂ’s a different lifestyle and experience. The whole pregnancy process has been very fun and IÂ’m very happy.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>May Phua</strong></span><br>Sex :  Boy Due date January 18<br>Name : Haven't thought of it yet; will ask a feng-shui master to think of a name when the baby is born.<br>Weight gained : 13 kg (went from size 4 to size 10) 16kg 10kg<br>Endorsements : Keeping her fingers crossed None 3<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ivy Lee</strong></span><br>Sex : Twin boys<br>Due date : February (around Chinese New Year)<br>Name  : Not yet; will ask a feng-shui master to think of a name when the babies are born.
