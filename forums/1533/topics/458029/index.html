              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>When people talk 
              about Jazreel Low, they usually talk about how she was a model before 
              she went into acting, after she became the second runner-up in the very 
              first Star Search in 1988.<br></span></span></p>
              <p><br><img id="_Ath_Slide" src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/components/display_image.php?id=504521" alt='Jazreel Low meets the media at a press event for "Taxi Taxi!".' width="240" height="200"><img id="_Ath_Slide" src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/components/display_image.php?id=504522" alt="&quot;Taxi Taxi!&quot; is Low's first film role since she left showbiz over a decade ago." width="240" height="200"><br><br><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>What they </span><em>don't</em><span> talk about and probably don't </span><em>know</em><span> about is the life she led before all that.<br><br>Low revealed in a recent interview that she had done all sorts of part-time jobs in school prior to becoming a model.<br><br>"I was giving tuition since I was secondary one. My family wasn't very well off at the time so I try to help out any way I can. <br><br>"I've
               worked in a florist, take calls, make bookings … I worked in the hamper
               store, during all the school holidays, I always had a part time job," 
              recounted Low.<br><br>It was tough, but Low explained that she is not 
              the sort to complain but someone who adapts to whatever situation life 
              throws her way.<br><br>"Sometimes you have to adjust your expectations and what you want, but you can still live through the whole thing," said Low.<br><br>That was why she jumped at the chance to work on "Taxi Taxi!", a film inspired by the 2010 book "Diary Of A Taxi Driver".<br><br>The book documents the experiences of Dr Cai Mingjie, a biologist that became a cabbie after he lost his job in 2008.<br><br>Low explained that she deeply identified with Cai, who, like her, readily adapted to his circumstances.<br><br>She described "Taxi Taxi!" as being a very meaningful project because it is about "life … not a fictitious type of story."<br><br>"I
               want to shoot something about real life … and with a cast like that; 
              I'm going to have a lot of fun!" said Low, gesturing at the film's two 
              leads, Singapore actor-comedians Gurmit Singh and Mark Lee.<br><br>But there are still some challenges she has to deal with.<br><br>"I'm very, very rusty," said Low, pointing out that this will be her first acting role in over a decade.<br><br>"We did a script reading a couple of weeks ago, and I found it really hard to get into character."<br><br>"I haven't been speaking Mandarin, and I have to speak Mandarin in the show. <br><br>"So
               during the rehearsal when he (Singh) speaks in English, naturally I'll 
              reply in English, then I remember I have to speak in Mandarin, and I 
              stutter," said Low, shaking her head before bursting into laughter.<br><br>That's not her only problem.</span></span><br><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span><br>Low,
               who has been running a chain of spas for the past 13 years, had 
              recently opened another spa at the Fullerton Hotel and there is much 
              work to do.<br><br>However, Low expressed that she will juggle filming 
              for "Taxi Taxi!" with her work commitments, and adapt like she has 
              always done.<br><br>-CNA/ha<br>www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainmentfeatures/view/1217764/1/.html<br></span></span></p>
