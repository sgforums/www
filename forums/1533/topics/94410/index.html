Britney Spears faked her wedding amid pre-nup row: US magazine</strong></span></span><br><span class="small">Thursday September 23, 5:28 AM </span><br><br>US teen queen Britney Spears, who stunned fans with her secret wedding last weekend, faked the marriage amid a row over her pre-nuptial contract with her fiance, Us magazine said.<br><br><img src="http://sg.yimg.com/xp/afp/20040923/127805796.jpg"><br><br>The American weekly claimed in its October 4 edition that it had obtained documents signed by the 22-year-old pop diva and her beau Kevin Federline, 26, stating that Saturday's marriage was held as a "faux wedding."<br><br>"Britney Spears and Kevin Federline ... agree that they intend to participate in a 'faux' wedding with one another on September 18, 2004," a document signed by the pair on September 14 states, according to Us magazine.<br><br>"However they do not intend to and shall not validly marry one another on said date," the four-page document reportedly said.<br><br>US quoted a draft copy of a pre-nuptial contract between the pair that said they intend to marry -- for real -- on October 16.<br><br>Spears representatives were not immediately available for comment on the report that said the couple had not yet filed a marriage licence with Los Angeles authorities following the wedding at a friend's home.<br><br>But rival People magazine, which had excusive US rights to photographs of the Spears-Federline wedding, however insisted that the marriage was the real thing.<br><br>The wedding was billed as the singing sensation's second in just nine-months, following an impromptu 55-hour Las Vegas marriage to a childhood friend in January that was soon annulled.<br><br>But Us claimed that the multi-millionairess pop idol and her reportedly impoverished back-up dancer fiance, who announced their engagement in June, decided to put it off marrying until they could hammer out a mutually acceptable legal agreement over how to share their assets.<br><br>Under California law, couples can be forced to split their wealth 50-50 when they divorce unless a pre-nuptial contract divvying it up in a different way is signed before they wed.<br><br>The magazine said it had obtained a draft of a pre-nuptial contract stipulating that if the couple split, Federline would only be entitled to 300,000 dollars a year for exactly half the term of the marriage, instead of 50 percent of Spears' total wealth.<br><br>Under the draft contract, Spears, who is worth anywhere from 32 to 100 million dollars according to various reports, would also not be financially responsible for Federline's two young children by another woman.<br><br>Us magazine claimed that in addition to the wrangling over the pre-nuptial agreement, that Spears had reportedly been loath to make Federline sign, Spears wanted to avoid possible leaks by Federline's relatives to the press ahead of her real wedding next month.<br><br>(source: <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/040922/1/3nats.html" rel="nofollow">Yahoo News</a>)</div>
