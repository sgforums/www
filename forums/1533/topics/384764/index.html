              <p>Just asking - why does every person/post that deviate towards a liking for Caucasians seems to get a "pui pui spitting" reply in return? You also insult anyone in the most illogical way of drawing the conclusion that simply because they do not hate "ang mohs", therefore they "worship" them? Stop swinging that shit too much bro, it makes you look more stupid than you already are.</p>

              <p>maxsee...you are effectively forcing your views on other, no, not views, but your opinion of their character. You claimed Xiaxue to be an SPG, which she has still proven to be not. Seems to me that you are unable to take people's comments on your bullshit cool - now you even claim that I "worship" ang mohs on your personal profile page? Lol. Besides, you claimed me to be an "ang moh worshipper" quite some time ago, when I simply commented that being chinese is disgraceful because of the animal abuse that goes on unstopped in mainland China. What you have said on the above goes directly back to you. Now...grow some brai..eh no, get mature, manchild.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I DID "pinpoint on the topic" (LOL). Or did your optic nerve get severed the moment you saw someone against your bullshit theory that you swing, to not read my comment on the thread directly below that post which got you hopping mad? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Also, you said that everyone is entitled to their opinion, which I honestly believe in as well. Kudos to you, we finally have something in common. But hey, my opinion of you is that you are an immature manchild, unable to handle the fact that people do not despise "ang mohs" as much as you do. I can only guess why. Is it because girls often swarm to Caucasian guys in clubs more than they do to you? Perhaps you can try to show yourself as a more successful individual and exude more confidence that a manchild like yourself can.</p>
              <p>Good luck, max. Really. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>EDIT: I look forward to your next correspondence. Preferably in chit chat, where all forumers can come together to see for themselves how silly you are, if you need help to double check whether my opinion of your disposition is correct.</p>

              <p>True, I think she isn't really attractive without all the makeup..even with the makeup, it kind of turns me off.</p>
              <p>The problem is not with her marrying an American. My problem is with maxsee, whose lesser intelligence prompts him to "like ang moh lah, SPG lah, ang moh worshipper lah, pui pui lah". You see, I've gotten bullshitted by him once, and it seems that he uses the above quote rather indiscriminately. You are welcome to check his posting history for more info. Other than that...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>But really, they've been together for 4 years, it is quite long, no? On the other hand, some of it (I do not know how much) was carried out as a LDR. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

Sad to say, I was on his side of anti-westerners, but for completely different reasons lar.

              <p>Do I have to pull out the old thread and put it in front of your face?</p>
              <p>And my previous profile was an old one. I edited it just yesterday.</p>
              <p>Now, on topic - your comments.</p>
              <p>Why am I pathetic? Simply because I go around criticizing people on their comments? Now, lets see, you don't criticize people on their comments, but your criticize people of their real life, where all you have is the inane tripe that you draw random conclusions from. See where this is going? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>An example, "I'm ashamed to be chinese", and you automatically pounced on that opportunity to state "ang moh worshipper". Slow down, max, and take a good look because the way you read things prompt a trip to the opthalmologist and a psychologist for evaluation. I don't mind getting criticized. Not even by you, if your criticism is honest and sincere. But if you give decide to step out of your position <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"> to hurl personal insults like telling me to bleach myself white, I will not hesitate to shove that bottle of bleach if your mouth and into your hollow skull.</p>
              <p>The second para: Fine. I will dig up the old thread, and shall quote you exactly.</p>
              <p>http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1796/topics/376486</p>
              <p>"most likely u must be one of
                                              those white ppl worshippers....go buy urself a bottle of bleach and
                                              bleach urself white la....pui pui"</p>
              <p>I quote you exactly. Is it not a fact that you posted that? I think it is. Really.</p>
              <p>Eh...let me try to recall what I posted on my profile page. I posted a
                  quote from you before telling you to go fertilize your fecal excrement
                  with sperm..?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Despite that, there is no need for me to post anything on my profile page, it was my mistake earlier on, and <strong>I apologize for that</strong>. I would like to settle this head on instead. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Your profile page really cracks me up. An eye for an eye! Good, this is exactly the way I wanted this be. Now, if you would <strong>please</strong> just reply me, because if you leave things hanging like this, it doesn't lend credibility to you, nor your wonderfully thought up profile description. When compared to "life is a mystrey~!!" anyway.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have absolutely no need for "sympathy votes", simply because you contradict yourself in the same posting. Simply by looking at your replies, it appears that you stumble over your own feet quite a bit. Coordination problems, max?</p>
              <p>Empty vessels make the most noise! A quote that I've learn in primary school! How wonderful! Sadly, you must have misconstrued the meaning of "noise" in that context - looking at your posts and mine, I can't help but think that you suffer from verbal diarrhoea. So, who exactly is the making the most noise and hence the empty vessel? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>The rest of the insults do not make any sense, and they are
                      unsubstantiated. Go ahead, post more, and I will see to it that your
                      foolishness be exploited for my personal pleasure.</p>

              <p>Seriously, your preconceived notions of pagan worship of another fellow human bring is skewed and delusional. She has got the guts to overcome cultural and personal differences to see this relationship to fruition, while typical, inept fools like you shoot your mouth off on anonymous grounds, thinking that everybody shares the exact delusional mindset as you.</p>
              <p>Know something? By acknowledging that such a stereotype of "ang moh worshipper" exists, YOU are contributing to the stereotype that the Caucasian man would gladly accept and enforce, against you.</p>
