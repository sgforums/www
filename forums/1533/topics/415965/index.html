              <p>TWENTY days is definitely not too short a period to fall head over heels in love with someone and accept his hand in marriage.</p>
              <p>At least, that scenario seemed totally plausible for Taiwanese model-actress Lin Chi-Ling, star of wuxia epic Red Cliff and the Indiana Jones-inspired actioner The Treasure Hunter.</p>
              <p>The 35-year-old beauty was in town last Friday to grace the official opening of Swiss luxury watch brand Longines' swanky new boutique at Marina Bay Sands.</p>
              <p>While on the topic of her good pal and fellow Taiwanese artiste Barbie Hsu's whirlwind engagement to wealthy restaurant heir Wang Xiaofei, Lin showed unequivocal support.</p>
              <p>"I think she is a very courageous girl," Lin told The New Paper.</p>
              <p>"When I learnt she was going to get married, I congratulated her and told her jokingly, 'Now, you're starting to give us (referring to herself and other single friends) a lot of pressure!'"</p>
              <p>Last month, Hsu, 34, announced her engagement to 29-year-old Wang after meeting him just four times over 20 days.</p>
              <p>The couple will throw wedding banquets in Taiwan and China's Hainan Island next March.</p>
              <p>Lin reiterated her support for Hsu as she shared her personal philosophy on love.</p>
              <p>"Falling in love should be an act of spontaneity...one should never be too rational," she said. "It's about holding on to that blissful moment when you know you've found the right person."</p>
              <p>That said, Lin added that though she believes "it's possible to develop true feelings for a person in 20days", like any other relationship, "one has to work hard at it after marriage".</p>
              <p><strong>Making the first move</strong></p>
              <p>At this stage in her life, the bachelorette has no qualms "making the first move" in a courtship. "Three years ago, I wouldn't have dared to," Lin said with a chuckle.</p>
              <p>"I was a lot more passive, the sort who clings to the belief that fate would one day come knocking on my door."</p>
              <p>Today, she is a sassy, independent woman who would not hesitate to pursue the man of her dreams.</p>
              <p>"If he happens to make my heart skip a beat, I'd strive hard to make that relationship work."</p>
              <p>But Lin kept mum on her ex-beau, 33-year-old Taiwanese actor Jerry Yan.</p>
              <p>According to Chinese news portal Sina.com, she broke down uncontrollably last month while on variety talk show Happy Camp in Hunan.</p>
              <p>Its hosts had reportedly read out loud a love memoir penned by Yan, which brought back memories of their time shared together.</p>
              <p>Lin's watchful minders took great pains to make sure nothing was asked about Yan during her interview with The New Paper.</p>
              <p>They were equally aggressive in deflecting questions about her recent lacklustre performances on both big and small screens.</p>
              <p>The Treasure Hunter, released last December and co-starring Mandopop superstar Jay Chou, failed to live up to the hype and bombed at the Asian box office.</p>
              <p>Lin's debut Japanese drama series, Moon Lovers, which paired her with heart-throb Takuya Kimura and shown in Japan in May, was panned by critics.</p>
              <p>But Lin did provide some insight into the way she chooses her projects.</p>
              <p>"I tend to be very rational when it comes to work, it's quite different from the emotional side I display when it comes to love," she said.</p>
              <p>"Familiarity is important to me at work; I'd take on films of directors and producers I know. "Also, I won't give up those rare opportunities that come by once in a lifetime."Â </p>
