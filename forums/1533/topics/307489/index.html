              <p>One thing that came out in the Edison "scandal" is during one video, Edison was asking Gillian Chung who was the better lover- him, Jackie Chan or Albert Yeung. Now Albert Yeung is a triad and head honcho of a very dominant entertainment company in HK.</p>
              <p>Edison's question to Gillian suggests to me that it's pretty common for the female celebs to have sex with Albert Yeung. Given he's an old man, and a triad, that's pretty disgusting imho. Just think of every female celeb in HK or worked in HK (may include anyone from China, Taiwan, SIngapore etc) and it's very likely that they had to f**k Albert to get a gig.</p>
              <p>In fact, since Jackie Chan was also mentioned, it's possible that Fann Wong may have gotten her role over the much better known Lucy Liu via doing the dirty too (tho I'm guessing, of course).</p>
