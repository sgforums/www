              <p>Both were involved in the scandal.  Both broke their silence. </p>
              <p>But Cecilia's tearful face won her many sympathy votes from viewers while Gillian Chung is getting a completely different reaction.</p>
              <p>How come like that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> The Electric New Paper :<br>Edison Chen was her 'greatest love'<br>But Gillian Chung says she expects an apology from him as she seeks closure<br>SHE too wants an apology from Edison Chen<br>09 March 2009<br><br>SHE too wants an apology from Edison Chen<br><br>Pop star Gillian Chung, one of the four women embroiled in the Edison Chen sex-photos scandal, has echoed actress Cecilia Cheung's sentiments in a TV interview.<br><br>Days earlier, Cecilia, a fellow victim, had accused Edison of not coming forward with a personal apology to the four women who were photographed in intimate acts with him.<br><br>In an interview on TVB's Be My Guest series, in which she broke her silence after more than a year after the scandal erupted, Gillian said she wants an explanation and apology from Edison, even though she doubts she would ever see him again.<br><br>'I've been under so much pressure. I want an apology or some kind of consolation, but there's nothing,' Gillian, one half of Cantopop duo Twins, said.<br><br>The 28-year-old singer added that she was deeply bothered that Edison, who is now overseas, had not tried to contact her, reported the South China Morning Post.<br><br>'What he said in public does not matter. But at least, he should have talked to us...,' she said.<br><br>'When it happened, when I wanted to make sure what had actually happened, of course he was the one to talk to. But I could not find him. I felt so helpless.'<br><br>The interview was previewed to the Hong Kong media on Friday night. The full interview will be aired today.<br><br>On and off<br><br>Gillian said Edison had been stringing her along on and off for nearly five years, ever since her showbiz career was launched in 2000.<br><br>Her singing partner, Charlene Choi, had warned her that Edison was a bad guy, she added, but she turned a deaf ear to the former's words.<br><br>She described Edison as her greatest love, and said he had a huge influence on her.<br><br>Was it that same influence that led her to allowing him to take photos of them having sex?<br><br>Gillian said she did not want to lose Edison. He had also assured her that the pictures were for his own pleasure and that no one else would see them.<br><br>Gillian then talked about Edison not apologising again.<br><br>'I thought why didn't (he) call to apologise. Or why didn't he explain the whole thing to me?' she said.<br><br>'But I have had nothing to do with him any more, so whether I forgive him does not matter... I think I will not see him again.'<br><br>In February last year, when the scandal was at its peak, Gillian had made a brief statement saying she had been naive and silly about her love for Edison.<br><br>Her remarks in February led to criticism from those who said her response was in stark contrast to her tearful reaction to being secretly photographed while changing her clothes in Malaysia.<br><br>'I was angry. I felt that I had been raped,' she said.<br><br>'But those (Malaysian) photos... it was unfortunate they were leaked. There's a big difference between voluntary and involuntary actions.'<br><br>Gillian said the Edison scandal, of which Bobo Chan and Rachel Ngan were also victims, drove her to the brink of suicide. She also thought of quitting showbiz.<br><br>But she chose to persevere, largely for the sake of her family - her sister, mother and grandparents.<br><br>'I'm in this business for my family. I want to give them a better life. So I don't want to give up just like that,' she said.<br><br>After a year out of the spotlight, Gillian will make an official return on Tuesday at a press conference for Hong Kong fashion chain Bauhaus' Tough Jeansmith, a jeans brand she endorsed.<br><br>How will the press and the public take to her return?<br><br>She confessed that she was afraid of the press, but insisted she would not run away.<br><br>'(The scandal) was so long ago and all I hope is that people can at least give me some dignity,' she said.<br><br>'I do not expect people to forgive me... I know the future will be tough but I will not give up.'<br><br>No sympathy from public<br><br>Judging by response to the clips of the interview that were aired on Thursday night, it appears Gillian has a lot more work to do to regain the public support she lost because of the scandal.<br><br>After clips of her interview were aired on Thursday night, the Hong Kong Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority received 215 complaints from viewers. (See story right.)<br><br>A computer technician in Hong Kong has been charged with illegally posting the photos online.<br><br><br><br><br> The Electric New Paper :<br>Viewers: Get her off the air<br>WHERE is the love?<br>09 March 2009<br><br>WHERE is the love?<br><br>When photo scandal victim Cecilia Chung appeared on the air to slam Edison Chen for failing to protect her privacy, the actress' tearful face won her many sympathy votes from viewers.<br><br>Now, just days later, singer Gillian Chung is getting a completely different reaction.<br><br>Her interview on TVB's Be My Guest series is due to be aired today, but a segment of the session was broadcast on Hong Kong television on Thursday.<br><br>Instead of taking Gillian's side, viewers clamoured for her to get off the air.<br><br>After the interview segment was shown on the 6.30pm news slot and on an infotainment programme, the Hong Kong Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority received 215 complaints from viewers, reported Apple Daily.<br><br>TVB also got calls from members of the public who wanted to express their disgust, while Cable Television received about 60 calls from viewers who felt that the interview should not have been shown during the news slot.<br><br>Some added that they felt Gillian would be a bad influence on young people, and would instill the wrong values.<br><br>Cable Television also received calls from 28 viewers who wanted to offer their support. Some callers said that everyone makes mistakes, and Gillian should be given another chance.<br><br>Netizens have also chimed in, slamming the singer for continuing to play the 'innocent and naive' card.<br><br>Besides giving their comments on Gillian, a number of callers criticised the station for using the interview as a selling point. Viewership for the time slot during which her interview was aired went up by two points.<br><br>A spokesman for Cable Television said that the news slot was chosen because the Edison photo scandal was a hot topic in Hong Kong and an issue of interest to Chinese people around the world.<br><br>When Cheung's interview was screened earlier, there were only three complaints received.<br><br>The actress has also received very public support from husband Nicholas Tse and her parents-in-law.<br><br>Nicholas' sister, Jennifer Tse, who attended an event on 5 Mar, said: 'Our family will support Cecilia unconditionally no matter what happens. I love her very much and I can see she really loves her child. She is my brother's wife, so our love is unconditional.'<br><br></p>
