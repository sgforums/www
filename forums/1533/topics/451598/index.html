              though i m not a fan...but i believe her time travel romances could be more successful for a period of time....
              
              time romances are usually unrealistic....it can become a passing fad...in fact no writers can stay on chart forever...readers' tastes often shift..

              Haha. You're very motherly and thanks for your concern. :)
              
              Da Mo Yao is set in Western Han Dynasty (founded by Liu Bang after defeating Xiang Yu, hence the Emperors of that dynasty all carried the surname Liu), the novel is dense in actual political history, with one of the main characters that is General Huo Qu Bing an actual historical figure. Though Tong Hua takes tons of liberties with her characters and historical accuracy, she uses the general crux of the geo-political warfare during that era as the backdrop for her story.
              
              Here's the synopsis of Da Mo Yao:
              A wolf girl grows up amongst the wolf pack of the Xi Yu desert region of Western China, where many different tribes existed which sought to remain independent from the encroaching military forces of the Western Han empire. This wolf girl saves a man dying of thirst in the desert, and he in turn kidnaps her. A Han scholar who is an advisor to the Dan Yu (Leader) of the Xiong Nu tribe, this man becomes this feral wolf girlâ€™s adoptive father. He forces this child of 7 or 8 to learn to walk upright, speak the human language, and live amongst the people, namely the Xiong Nu tribe. He names her Yu Jin. She resists initially, howling at the moon to be freed, but she eventually settles into the human world and grows up amongst the sons, daughters, and tribesman of the Xiong Nu.
              
              Yu Jin is but a child of 12 when she is forced to face the grim reality of the ruthlessness of political succession as there is a change of leadership within the Xiong Nu. With her father dead, Yu Jin manages to return to her wolf tribe, were she is welcomed back and finds solace in the leader of the wolf pack, whom she calls Brother Wolf. They roam the plains together, with Yu Jin a girl who is no longer completely a wolf, but cannot return to the human world because the only one she knows is gone. A few years pass before one day, Yu Jin decides to steal some supplies from a traveling caravan. She is caught, but the leader of the caravan is a young man whose beauty and serenity captivates Yu Jin. He offers her the supplies she wants, but because sheâ€™s been wearing the same tattered clothes for the last few years, she asks for a skirt if they have one. The young man gives her a beautiful Luo Lan (another ethnic tribe) outfit.
              
              As Yu Jin continues to roam the plans with Brother Wolf, she runs into another group of travelers, this one seeking her assistance in getting out of the Xi Yu desert. In the group is another young man, with twinkling eyes and a piercing gaze. Yu Jin leads them to the edge of the desert, and she demands payment of coins for her services. Meeting these two groups finally convinces Yu Jin that she canâ€™t hide in the desert forever. Her adoptive dad wanted her to learn Han history and language, because he was a Han citizen and wanted her to become one. Yu Jin decides to use the coins to travel to Chang An, the capital city of the Han dynasty. There she will not run into the Xiong Nu, and she can finally fulfill her dadâ€™s wish for her to return to her motherland.
              
              Yu Jin arrives in Chang An and hereby starts her story which will span years with so much colorful and stunning trial and tribulations. She changes her name to Jin Yu (her loved ones call her Yu Er or Xiao Yu) and tries to forge ahead with just her brains, derring do, and audacity. She runs into the two young men she met in the desert â€“ the man who gave her the Luo Lan outfit is Meng Jiu (real name Meng Xi Mo), the reserved and contemplative owner of the largest business in the city, and the other guy is Huo Qu Bing, the all-around brash and decisive young general who is also nephew to the Emperor. Jin Yuâ€™s life in Chang An takes her into close orbit with both men, and with it develops a love story fraught with choice, unwavering commitment, and sacrifice.

              Here's a background tidbit of "Secrets Hidden in Time":
              
              It is written in the first person narrative, with the heroine Su Man (her English name is Freya, but she later pretends to be a girl named Amanda) being introduced as a thirty-years old independent and successful white collar worker in the financial industry in Beijing. Society considers her as left on-the-shelf which doesn't matter to her. Instead she is relatively happy with her life which consists of her parents, her work, and her best friend Ma La Tang (the nickname means spicy soup, but her real name is Xu Ling Shuang). The only thing Su Man has ever wanted in her entire life was a boy she crushed on back in high school and college, Song Yi. This novel doesn't entice me though as weâ€™re subjected to paragraphs upon paragraphs about how he dazzled her innocent self with his splendor and charm, so much so she has never let the dream of him go. I was already headdesking by this point. Seriously, I'm quite disappointed with the whole story plot and how it unravel to be of another emotional turmoil novel.
