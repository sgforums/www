At least 10 suffered bruises and cuts," said AFP photographer R. Raveendran, who was nursing a bleeding thumb.<br><br>"The police and security people were also roughing up locals, who started shouting 'Go home Liz'," Raveendran said. Afterwards a security representative of the couple apologised to the journalists, he said.<br><br>Exclusive media rights were sold to British celebrity magazine Hello! for a sum reported to cover the seven-figure cost of the nuptials, which capped three days of non-stop partying in the desert state.<br><br>The couple was only able to take four turns around a ritual sacred wedding fire instead of the customary seven because their clothes kept getting entangled, the Times of India reported.<br><br>Hurley was dressed in a traditional Indian sari designed by the so-called "bad boy" of Indian fashion, Rohit Bal. She had her hands painted in intricate henna designs.<br><br>The couple, who held a set of pre-wedding parties in Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital, were reportedly planning to head back to the city for post-wedding celebrations.<br><br>The guests, numbering around 250, were flown into this city of palaces aboard seven chartered flights, airport officials said.<br><br>(source: <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/070310/1/476r8.html" rel="nofollow">Yahoo News</a>)</div>
