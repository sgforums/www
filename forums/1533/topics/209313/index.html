That celebrity has translated into power inside the walls. Other inmates, even murderers, defer to Abruzzi in prison-related business. While the correctional officers enforce the rules, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that John Abruzzi runs the prison.<br><br>Abruzzi was finally convicted of two counts of murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit murder after decades of eluding punishment from Illinois district attorneys. Otto Fibonacci provided eyewitness testimony at Abruzzi's trial, which convinced the jury to convict Abruzzi of rubbing out two rival gangsters. Abruzzi subsequently put a hit out on Fibonacci, forcing Fibonacci to enter the Witness Protection Program. Abruzzi has been overheard expressing how desperately he would like to know Fibonacci's whereabouts.<br><br>ADDITIONAL NOTES:<br>Inmate has logged visits from Philip Falzone, a "business associate;" Anthony Smallhouse, another "business associate;" Mary Abruzzi, his wife; Nicole Abruzzi, his daughter; and John Abruzzi, Jr., his son.

Sucre's mother felt he was destined to a life spent in and out of prison, so in an effort to save him, she sent him to live with his aunt in New York to hopefully give him a fresh start.<br><br>In New York, Sucre's life began to turn around. He got a steady job as a parking lot attendant and met the love of his life, Maricruz Delgado. Most importantly, he was avoiding trouble and keeping his record clean.<br><br>Then Sucre came back to Humboldt Park for a visit and what began as a night out with his old friends turned into a conviction for aggravated robbery when they held up two liquor stores with an unloaded firearm.<br><br>Since coming to Fox River, Sucre has been a model prisoner. He has expressed interest in serving the shortest possible sentence so he can get out and be with his girlfriend.<br><br>ADDITIONAL NOTES:<br>Inmate has logged visits from Maricruz Delgado his girlfriend. Inmate is approved for monthly conjugal visits with Maricruz Delgado. Inmate is rated Grade C and is approved for work on Prison Industries.<br><br></div>

Now a lawyer, appealing for Lincoln)<br><br>Veronica Donovan grew up in the violent Fuller Park neighborhood in Chicago's South Side.<br><br>Despite dating youthful offender Lincoln Burrows all throughout high school, Donovan never let the street life seduce her. An over-achiever, she received a full academic scholarship to the University of Illinois in Champaign where she graduated with a B.A. in political science, then went on to earn her juris doctorate from Baylor Law School.<br><br>After graduating from Baylor, Donovan moved back to Chicago to practice real estate law at the offices of Bianchi and Guthrie.<br><br>Despite her success, Donovan never forgot her roots. Although she had no experience in criminal law, she recently defended childhood friend Michael Scofield against a charge of armed robbery after he refused the assistance of all court appointed attorneys.<br><br>Donovan is currently engaged to investment banker, Sebastian Balfour.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>DR. SARA TANCREDI (The pretty doctor working in the prison)<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Honeybunzkills/prisonbreak/24.jpg"><br><br>Doctor Sara Tancredi lives her life by one simple maxim: "Be the change you want to see in the world."<br><br>From an early age, Sara knew that she wanted to be a doctor. Growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, she always hoped to work in a hospital or private practice, someplace nice, sheltered.<br><br>Those desires changed during her freshman year at Northwestern University when Tancredi was introduced to the writings of Mahatma Gandhi. Her worldview was immediately and irrevocably altered. Being a traditional doctor was no longer enough for her and she decided that she must follow a more humanitarian path.<br><br>Ironically, Gandhi's views on non-violence convinced Doctor Tancredi to pursue a career in the most violent of all environments: Fox River Penitentiary.<br><br>As one of the few doctors on staff, Sara is responsible for everything from administering physicals to performing emergency surgery. And while her work is noble (she has won multiple humanitarian awards), it is also dangerous. Every day, she interacts with rapists and murderers who haven't so much as touched another woman in years.<br><br>Though Sara doesn't think twice about the risks she puts herself in every day, it is a constant source of stress for her father, Illinois Governor "Frontier Justice" Frank Tancredi. That, along with their vastly different political beliefs, has cooled their relationship significantly in recent years.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Characters</span></strong><br><br>Meet the Prison Staff<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Honeybunzkills/prisonbreak/26.jpg"><br>CAPTAIN BRAD BELLICK (the bad prison officer)<br><br>Captain Bellick passed the Correctional Officer Exam the autumn after he graduated high school and has been at Fox River Penitentiary ever since. In that time, he has slowly and steadily climbed up the C.O. ranks.<br><br>Three years ago, despite several claims of inmate abuse (none of which could ever be corroborated), Bellick was promoted to the position of captain, the highest rank a C.O. can earn. Today, his duties include: aiding in the transportation of death row inmates to the electric chair, supervising Fox River's prison industries program and overseeing the day-to-day operations of all the inmates in general population.<br><br>Bellick is what's known as a C.O.'s C.O.. His view is there is no such thing as a "good convict," and the main purpose of a prison is punishment, not rehabilitation.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Honeybunzkills/prisonbreak/28.jpg"><br><br>WARDEN HENRY POPE (the good guy)<br><br>Conventional wisdom says that prisons are built to punish offenders. Warden Pope does not subscribe to that school of thought.<br><br>Warden Pope has been in charge of Fox River Penitentiary for the past eighteen years with an aim towards rehabilitation, so that when his inmates are released, they will be less likely to commit another crime. For that purpose, he has established an exhaustive prison industries program to help his inmates gain real world training in fields as diverse as painting, landscaping and various industrial vocations. Warden Pope also runs an award-winning educational program to help his inmates gain high school equivalency diplomas and, in rare cases, even bachelor degrees. And as he nears retirement, he seeks a successor who would run Fox River in a similar manner.<br><br>Warden Pope and his wife, Judith, have been married thirty nine years.<br></div>
