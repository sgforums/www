              <p>Imagine a 15-year-old girl all alone in a foreign land.</p>
              <p>To local songbird Olivia Ong, it is a no-brainer one would cry into the night often, she argued.</p>
              <p>The singer moved to Japan at 15 to further her studies and music career after winning a singing contest. After a short stint as part of the Japanese pop trio Mirai, Olivia released her solo bossa nova album at the age of 19, one that received rave reviews.</p>
              <p>The voice behind hit drama The Little Nyonya's theme song 'Like Swallows' told xinmsn in an exclusive interview that the journey was extremely tough and tears were aplenty.</p>
              <p>Appearing at a Kose roadshow, the cosmetic brand's first non-Japanese spokesperson said, "I had to face many things being alone in Japan. My family wasn't around, and I felt lonely, so of course I'd cry!"</p>
              <p>It did not help that her idea of stardom is way off the mark.</p>
              <p>"I had always thought, one song would be enough to make a singer famous, but it's not so easy. In fact, there are so many things to face."</p>
              <p>Comfortable in both English and Japanese, Olivia is now taking on the Taiwanese market singing in Mandarin. But what the 24-year-old soul singer is most afraid of are the infamously wacky variety shows there.</p>
              <p>Known for her cool, classy image, she said, "My company and myself both feel such game shows are not suitable for my image, so I haven't appeared in any."</p>
              <p>Hong Kong and China will be her next destinations for promoting her English album Olivia in April and May.</p>
              <p>At a recent event, Taiwanese host Ah Ken waxed lyrical about her through a specially-prepared English poem. But she was quick to dismiss a budding romance.</p>
              <p>So which male star would make her perfect man?</p>
              <p>"I admire Jang Dong-gun a lot. He has a very attractive quality," she gushed.</p>
