He was apparently scheduled to have a massage in his apartment this afternoon.<br><br>Sources tell CBS 2's Scott Weinberger the death may be drug-related and that there were pills, possibly a very strong over-the-counter medication, scattered around the room.<br><br>Police do not suspect foul play.<br><br>Ledger had recently separated from actress Michelle Williams, who he met while filming "Brokeback Mountain" and became engaged to last year. The couple had an apartment in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn and had one daughter, Matilda, who was born in 2005.<br><br>Before marrying Williams, Ledger had also dated actress Naomi Watts and Heather Graham.<br><br>Most currently, Ledger was featured in the Bob Dylan biography film "I'm Not There."<br><br>He is also appearing in the next installment of the "Batman" movie opposite Christian Bale as the infamous "Joker" -- becoming the first non-American to take on the role -- and was in the midst of filming "The Imaginarium Of Dr. Parnassus."<br><br>Of the most well-known 15 films Ledger appeared in: "The Patriot," "A Knight's Tale," and "Monster's Ball." He was also nominated for a Golden Globe for his role in "Brokeback Mountain."<br><br>In 2001, People magazine named him as one of their "50 Most Beautiful People."<br><br>Ledger grew up in Perth, and began doing amateur theater at age 10. At 16, he moved to Sydney to pursue an acting career, quickly landing TV movie roles and guest spots on Australian television.<br><br>After several independent films and a starring role in the short-lived Fox TV series "Roar," Ledger moved to Los Angeles and costarred in "10 Things I Hate About You," a teen comedy reworking of "The Taming of the Shrew."<br><br>Offers for other teen flicks came his way, but Ledger turned them down, preferring to remain idle than sign on for projects he didn't like.<br><br>Ledger used to shop at a neighborhood home store and children's store owned by a company called Calypso. Michelle Vella, a buyer there, said she had frequently seen Ledger with his daughter -- carrying the toddler on his shoulders, or having ice cream with her.<br><br>"It's so sad. They were really close," said Vella. "He's a very down to earth guy and an amazing father."<br><br>She said Ledger once bought a bookcase at the home store, and purchased stuffed animals and dresses for his daughter at the children's store.<br><br>He would have turned 29 on April 4.<br><br>(source: <a href="http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/heath.ledger.dead.2.635530.html" rel="nofollow">WCBSTV.com</a>)</div>
