              <p>Fann Wong recovering from appendicitis operation<br>Posted: 16 June 2010 1639 hrs</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SHANGHAI: MediaCorp actress Fann Wong missed a press event for her upcoming film "Yi Bu Liu Shen" Tuesday at the Shanghai Film Festival and the cause was acute appendicitis that saw the actress in the intensive care unit said Chinese media.</p>
              <p>"Things were fine two days ago and we exchanged SMSes and she said she will be in Shanghai early this morning" said film's director Liang Chao.</p>
              <p>"I didn't expect that when I got to the press event, I would receive the news that she had acute appendicitis and was in the intensive care unit," explained the Chinese director when asked about Wong's absence.</p>
              <p>Later he clarified that he was "unclear about the details".</p>
              <p>However, a spokesperson from MediaCorp denied reports that the Singapore actress was suffering from anything serious although it was verified that Wong's appendix had been a problem.</p>
              <p>"The reports were exaggerated. She (Wong) was supposed to attend the Shanghai Film Festival but she had this pain in her stomach and later realized it was her appendix," said the spokesperson.</p>
              <p>"She had a minor operation and she is out already. She has recovered and she is back home resting."</p>
              <p>Wong and Chinese actress Miao Pu play the female leads in "Yi Bu Liu Shen", a Chinese comedy about a poverty-stricken farmer whose life is changed by a series of unexpected events. -CNA/ha</p>
