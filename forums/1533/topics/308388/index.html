              <h1>Nicholas Tse Discovers Cecilia Cheung Cheated During Marriage</h1>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 100%;">Reports have
                  confirmed that Cecilia Cheung was cheating on Nicholas Tse with three
                  other men just before they married, and while they were engaged she
                  took the shocking pictures with Edison Chen<br><br>Now even more
                  shocking allegations and rumors have surfaced. Not just one, but two
                  men, are now rumored to have been having an affair with Cecilia during
                  her marriage to Nicholas Tse. Nicholas had said he was not upset about
                  the pictures with Edison Chen. It is rumored that Nicholas and Cecilia
                  have separated, and will divorce legally after one year, because
                  Nicholas allegedly found out about Cecilia’s cheating during their
                  marriage, and Nicholas allegedly can no longer trust Cecilia to remain
                  faithful. One of the men who was having an affair with Cecilia is
                  rumored to have threatened to show pictures he took of Cecilia if she
                  did not leave Nicholas for him<br><br>A source close to the couple
                  said they were considering marriage counseling just before rumors of
                  Cecilia cheating became known by Nicholas and his family. Nicholas will
                  need a lot of support if he is to calm his mind, and forgive Cecilia
                  for the sake of their son Lucas</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 100%;">A source close to
                  Nicholas says he found out about Cecilia’s cheating during their
                  marriage, and Nicolas can no longer trust Celilia to remain faithful.
                  Nicholas and Cecilia are trying to keep things civil between them
                  however, for the sake of their son Lucas<br><br>Nicholas is also very
                  concerned that Lucas may not be his biological son, and a source says
                  this is breaking Nicholas’ heart. First there was the feeling of
                  betrayal after discovering his wife cheated with several men before
                  their marriage, then rumors that Cecilia cheated during the marriage,
                  and now heart breaking doubts that Lucas may not be his son. Nicholas
                  is said to be demanding a paternity test for Lucas to be sure he is his
                  son. If the test confirms Nicholas is the father, then he may consider
                  working things out, and forgiving Cecilia … for Lucas<br><br>Making
                  this worse for Cecilia however, is a rumor that Ceclilia may be once
                  again pregnant, and not with Nicholas’ baby. Hopefully Cecilia is not
                  pregnant. Their marriage cannot take anymore stress, or it will break
                  to pieces. Cecilia is working again, shooting ads to try to return to a
                  normal life<br><br>When Lucas was born the elder Tse grandfather, who
                  is 71 years-old, told Apple Daily that the baby Lucas has dimples and
                  lively eyes. He added, “I fear he might be too popular with girls when
                  he grows up. When he is old enough to walk, I will buy him sunglasses
                  to shield him from women”<br><br>Perhaps Lucas could use those sunglasses now to shield his eyes from the trouble his parents are facing</span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Source: Extract from hollywoodgrind.com</span></p>
