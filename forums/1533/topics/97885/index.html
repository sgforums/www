It's very sad and worrying. All their friends are concerned about whether they can make their marriage work for them again," a close friend of the family said.<br><br>"At the moment it's not looking good. Brad and Angelina are so into each other and stayed in connecting hotel rooms during the filming of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I think Jennifer's worried about his closeness with Jolie."<br><br>(source: <a href="http://www.southflorida.com/news/sfl-aswnsnecm10oct10,0,7990796.story?coll=sfe-news-wire" rel="nofollow">www.southflorida.com</a>)</div>

This decision is the result of much thoughtful consideration.'<br><br>The couple didn't indicate if they planned to file for divorce, and Ms Guagenti declined to comment beyond the statement.<br><br>The separation, first reported on People magazine's website, comes 4 1/2 years after the couple's Malibu wedding and after months of speculation that their marriage was in trouble.<br><br>In their statement, they asked for the public's 'sensitivity in the coming months'.<br><br>Aniston has recently been photographed in public without her diamond-studded wedding ring, according to People, although the magazine said the couple had spent the New Year's weekend together on the Caribbean island of Anguilla with Aniston's former Friends co-star Courteney Cox and her husband, actor David Arquette.<br><br>Pitt, 41, and Aniston, 35, have been together since being set up on a blind date in 1998. They were married in 2000 in a lavish wedding at a Malibu estate overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Some 200 people attended the wedding that included four bands, a gospel choir, fireworks and tens of thousands of flowers.<br><br>Part of Pacific Coast Highway was shut down to accommodate the influx of guests, which included actress Cameron Diaz and most of Aniston's Friends co-stars. It was the first marriage for both.<br><br>Since their wedding, they have been touted not only as one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples but also one of the film industry's most powerful. They are co-owners of Plan B production company with producer Brad Grey, who earlier this week was hired to replace Sherry Lansing as head of the Paramount studio. -- AP<br><br></div>
