              <p>I don't recall artists being restricted to any kind of music or song's to perform. If the programme did no list any titles, one would assume that it is up to the discretion of the artist. Hell, there may even be an acapella or a barber shop quartet ! lol</p>
              <p>I think people got peeved when he started to propogate Christianity rather than just singing songs. Many famous celebrities sang a hymm or two in thier tours and you don't hear people raging about it.</p>

              But you went to HIS concert to hear HIM sing and you got what you paid for, right? I mean there is no stipulation that he can only sing secular songs, is there? Don't get me wrong. I did not go to the concert and neither am I his fan, but I do know about the circumstances of his conversion and how his life has changed dramatically. The singer has a life too and he wishes to sing about it. If you are his fan then try to share in his life too and exercise some tolerance and forbearance. Or do we want to do things the usual way and complain and get big govt to intervene and enforce that all public concerts be secular and no mention of God or anything remotely religious?

              <p>Yes, you are right. Why must we pay for someone who propagates his religion which we have no interest in. Money is hard earned. Furthermore, there's law in Singapore that no one can preach in public as we are multi-religious country. If this is allowed, then every singers will start propagating their own religion during their concert. We go to concert for entertainment. If we wish to listen to religious songs, we go to the correct venues like temples or churches.</p>
