            <div class='col-md body'>Chinese New Year coming.<br><br>Here are some things about Chinese New Year.<br><br>Damn. I give out culture module answers liao <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>On second thought, decided not to give it.<br>_________________________________________________________________________<br><br><strong>Taboo</strong><br><br>House Cleaning<br><br>The entire house should be cleaned before New Year's Day. On New Year's Eve, all brooms, brushes, dusters, dust pans and other cleaning equipment are put away. Sweeping or dusting should not be done on New Year's Day for fear that good fortune will be swept away. After New Year's Day, the floors may be swept. Beginning at the door, the dust and rubbish are swept to the middle of the parlor, then placed in the corners and not taken or thrown out until the fifth day. At no time should the rubbish in the corners be trampled upon. In sweeping, there is a superstition that if you sweep the dirt out over the threshold, you will sweep one of the family away. Also, to sweep the dust and dirt out of your house by the front entrance is to sweep away the good fortune of the family; it must always be swept inwards and then carried out, then no harm will follow. All dirt and rubbish must be taken out the back door.<br><br>Bringing In the New Year and Expelling the Old<br><br>Shooting off firecrackers on New Year's Eve is the Chinese way of sending out the old year and welcoming in the New Year. On the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, every door in the house, and even windows, have to be open to allow the old year to go out. Firecrackers is only shoot off in Chinatown.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>New Year Activities Set Precendent<br><br>All debts had to paid by this time. Nothing should be lent on this day, as anyone who does so will be lending all the year. Back when tinder and flint were used, no one would lend them on this day or give a light to others.<br><br>Everyone should refrain from using foul language and bad or unlucky words. Negative terms and the word "four" (Ssu), which sounds like the word for death, are not to be uttered. Death and dying are never mentioned and ghost stories are totally taboo. References to the past year are also avoided as everything should be turned toward the New Year and a new beginning.<br><br>If you cry on New Year's day, you will cry all through the year. Therefore, children are tolerated and are not spanked, even though they are mischievous.<br><br>Personal Appearance and Cleanliness<br><br>On New Year's Day, we are not suppose to wash our hair because it would mean we would have washed away good luck for the New Year. Red clothing is preferred during this festive occasion. Red is considered a bright, happy color, sure to bring the wearer a sunny and bright future. It is believed that appearance and attitude during New Year's sets the tone for the rest of the year. Children and unmarried friends, as well as close relatives are given lai see, little red envelopes with crisp one dollar bills inserted, for good fortune.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Decorations</strong><br><br>Prior to New Year's Day, Chinese families decorate their living rooms with vases of pretty blossoms, platters of oranges and tangerines and a candy tray with eight varieties of dried sweet fruit. On walls and doors are poetic couplets, happy wishes written on red paper. These messages sound better than the typical fortune cookie messages. For instance, "May you enjoy continuous good health" and "May the Star of Happiness, the Star of Wealth and the Star of Longevity shine on you" are especially positive couplets.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plants and Flowers</span><br><br>Every traditional Chinese household should also have live blooming plants to symbolize rebirth and new growth. Flowers are believed to be symbolic of wealth and high positions in one's career. Lucky is the home with a plant that blooms on New Year's Day, for that foretells a year of prosperity. In more elaborate settings, plum blossoms just starting to bloom are arranged with bamboo and pine sprigs, the grouping symbolizing friends &amp;endash; the plum blossom also signifies reliability and perseverance; the bamboo is known for its compatibility, its utility and its flexible stems for furniture and other articles;the evergreen pine evokes longevity and steadiness. Other highly prized flowers are the pussy willow,azalea, peony and water lily or narcissus.<br><br>The Chinese firmly believe that without flowers, there would be no formation of any fruits. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to have flowers and floral decorations.<br><br>They are the emblems of reawakening of nature, they are also intimately connected with superstition and with the wish for happiness during the ensuing year.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oranges and Tangerines</span><br><br>Etiquette dictates that you must bring a bag of oranges and tangerines and enclose a lai see when visiting family or friends anytime during the two-week long Chinese New Year celebration. Tangerines with leaves intact assure that one's relationship with the other remains secure. For newlyweds, this represents the branching of the couple into a family with many children. Oranges and tangerines are symbols for abundant happiness.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Candy Tray</span><br><br>The candy tray arranged in either a circle or octagon is called "The Tray of Togetherness" and has a dazzling array of candy to start the New Year sweetly. After taking several pieces of candy from the tray, adults places a red envelope (lai see) on the center compartment of the tray. Each item represents some kind of good fortune.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Traditions</strong><br><br>Traditionally, red packets (Mandarin: 'hong bao'); Hokkien: 'ang pow'; Hakka: 'fung bao'; Cantonese: 'lai see') are passed out during the Chinese New Year's celebrations, from married couples to unmarried people (usually children). Chinese New Year is celebrated with firecrackers, dragon dances and lion dances.<br><br><strong>Reunion dinner</strong><br><br>A reunion dinner is held on New Year's Eve where members of the family, near and far, get together for celebration. The New Year's Eve dinner is very large and traditionally includes chicken. Fish is included, but not eaten up completely (and the remaining stored overnight), as the Chinese phrase  "every year there is fish/leftover" ) is a homophone for phrases which could mean "be blessed every year" or "have profit every year", since "yÃº" is also the pronunciation for "profit". A type of black hair-like algae, pronounced "fat choy" in Cantonese, is also featured in many dishes since its name sounds similar to "prosperity". Hakka will serve "kiu nyuk" and "ngiong tiu fu". Because the things sound alike, the belief is that having one will lead to the other, like the old child's aphorism "step on a crack, break your mother's back".<br><br><strong>First day of the new year</strong><br><br>New Year's day is also celebrated within the family. Usually family members gather on the morning of New Year's Day. It is at this gathering that red packets are given to unmarried members of the family. The age of the recipient is not material to receiving the packets. Married couples usually give out two red packets on the first new year after being married. This is because the wife presents one and the husband presents one. In subsequent years they may give one as a couple.<br><br>Back then red packets were given away by people to pay off loans. Red packets traditionally consisted of amounts which were considered multiples. Amounts like $2 (one piece of $2 note), or $20 were acceptable. The gift was originally a token amount but these days it is not uncommon to receive large sums in affluent families. In some families this tradition has evolved into the practice to substituting money-like instruments (stocks, bonds, unit trust) in place of large sums of cash.<br><br>Red packets are also given to unmarried visitors but the sums are often smaller than the packets given to family members or close friends.<br><br><strong>Second day of the new year</strong><br><br>The second day of the new year is usually for visiting the family of the wife if a couple is married. A large feast is also typically held on the second day of the new year.<br><br><strong>Seventh day of the new year</strong><br><br>The seventh day traditionally is known as the common man's birthday, the day when everyone grows one year older. It is also the day when tossed fish salad, yusheng, is eaten. People get together to toss the colourful salad and make wishes for continued wealth and prosperity. This is celebrated primarily amongst the Chinese in Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia and Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Food</strong><br><br>Niangao Â— The Chinese word nian, meaning "sticky", is identical in sound to nian, meaning "year", and the word gao, meaning "cake" is identical in sound to gao, meaning "high". As such, eating niangao has the symbolism of raising oneself higher in each coming year (nian nian gao sheng). Chinese families who practise Chinese traditional religion also offer niangao to the kitchen god, Zao Jun. It is believed that all the household gods go off to heaven to report on a family during the new year. Serving niangao to the kitchen god is believed to help him provide a sweet report on the family because he will be satisfied and not inclined to deliver criticism Â— or that his lips are so sticky from the cakes that he is unable to make too much of a report.<br><br>Fagao Â— Literally translated as "Prosperity Cake", fagao is made with wheat flour, water, sugar and leavened with either yeast or baking powder. Fagao batter is steamed until it rises and splits open at the top. The sound "fa" means either "to raise/generate" or "be prosperous", hence its well intending secondary meaning.<br><br>Jiaozi Â— Dumplings, are small or large mounds of dough that are usually dropped into a liquid mixture (such as soup or stew) and cooked until done, some are stuffed with meat and/or vegetables.<br><br>Yusheng Â— a salad of raw fish and shredded crunchy vegetables (such as carrots, jicama, pickled ginger and pomelo) in a plum sauce dressing. Although commonly served in China throughout the year, it was popularised as a Chinese New Year dish in Singapore and Malaysia, a practice which has since spread to other Chinese communities. Originally served only on the seventh day of the new year, it is now eaten on any day, sometimes as early as two weeks prior to the commencement of the new year.<br><br>Mandarin oranges Â— a symbol of wealth and good fortune). The Cantonese word for these oranges is a homonym for gold.<br><br>Red Jujubes Â— symbolize the gaining of prosperity<br><br>Whole steamed fish Â— (a symbol of long life and good fortune). This can be seen in wall decorations of fish themes. The word yu, meaning "fish", shares the same pronunciation with the word yu, meaning "surplus" (e.g. having money left over from covering expenses). The common greeting for the new year "nian nian you yu" can mean to enjoy a surplus, i.e. financial security, year after year.<br><br>Uncut noodles Â— (a symbol of longevity)<br><br>Baked goods with seeds Â— (a symbol of fertility)</div>
