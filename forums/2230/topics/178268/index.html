            <div class='col-md body'>Total Defence Day is coming soon, one day after Valentine's Day. Here's some information about Total Defence.<br><br>Summary of Total Defence:<br><br>Total Defence consists of five aspects:<br><br><ol type="1">Military Defence</ol><ol type="2">Civil Defence</ol><ol type="3">Economic Defence</ol><ol type="4">Social Defence</ol><ol type="5">Psycological Defence</ol><br><br>Each aspect can be strengthened at both the individual and national levels, and both are closely linked.<br><br>At the national level are the plans, policies and programmes put in place by the government, organizations and agencies.<br><br>At the individual level are the attitudes and actions of each of us has towards those plans and programmes. So Total Defence is not just a plan we roll out only during wartime. While there are some things we carry out only in wartime, there are other things we can do everyday that help strengthen certain aspects of Total Defence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Civil Defence</strong><br><br>As Singapore has a small land area and is heavily built up, buildings are likely to get hit during a war or conflict. People will get hurt. Food, water and electrical supplies could also be cut off. Rescue work would be required. Life as we know will come to a standstill. This is where Civil Defence comes in.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At National level</span><br><br>At the national level, Civil Defence provides for the safety and basic needs of Singaporeans during emergencies or wartime so that life can go on as normally as possible. Civil Defence goes hand-in-hand with Military Defence. Our soldiers will be able to fight better if they know their loved ones are taken care of at home. Leading the Civil Defence effort is the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) in the Ministry of Home Affairs. The SCDF trains the civilian population in rescue work, evacuation, first aid and damage control. It makes sure that we are familiar with arrangements for relief services and emergency supply of critical items like blood, water and food. The SCDF also works with volunteers to help organize exercises for water and food rationing, bomb shelteres and public warning systems.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At individual level</span><br><br>At the individual level, Singaporeans should know what to do during an emergency. It is important that Singaporeans participate actively in Civil Defence exercises, be it water/food rationing, bomb shelter or public warning systems exercises, so that we are prepared for any emergency. So the next time a Civil Defence exercise is organized in your constituency, do try to participate. Also encourage your family members and friends to participate so that they know what to do during an emergency.<br><br>More Singaporeans should also learn life-saving skills such as first aid, CPR or fire fighting so that they will be able to help their friends and loved ones during an emergency.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Economic Defence</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At National level</span><br><br>At the national level, Economic Defence has two main dimensions. One, it involves developing emergency plans and organizing ourselves in such a way that our economy does not break down in war. It means having enough stockpiles of essential items such as food and water. It also means having a system to mobilize and share resources between the private and public sectors. During an emergency, our offices and factories must be able to carry on even when men and equipment are mobilized. Two, our economy has to be strong enough to withstand external shocks. This means having sound economic policies, managing our finances wisely and having a well-trained labour force.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At individual level</span><br><br>At the individual level, Economic Defence means lifelong learning and continual skills upgrading in this rapidly changing world, we need to constantly update ourselves with new skills and knowledge. This is something all of you can do - equip yourselves with the relevant skills and knowledge throughout your lives. It will go a long way towards strengthening our Economic Defence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Social Defence</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At National level</span><br><br>Social Defence is about Singaporeans of all races adn religions living and working together in harmony. We will be able to do so if we practise racial and religious tolerance, provide opportunities for all regardless of their race, language or religion, and help the less fortunate. On 21 July each year, we commemorate Racial Harmony Day to remind Singaporeans never to take racial and religious harmony for granted. We are also encouraging Singaporeans to be more active in volunteer work.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At individual level</span><br><br>Social Defence at the individual level means showing tolerance and respect for other races, cultures, religions and lifestyles. In our daily lives, we could make time to learn about the foods, costumes, cultures and heritage of the different races in Singapore. As we progress in life, we must never forget our social responsibilities - we have to show care and concern for the less fortunate and underprivileged. Most of you may alraedy be doing so when you take part in the Community Involvement Programme. Make it part of your life even after you leave school.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Psycological Defence</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At National level</span><br><br>Some say Psycological Defence is the most important, but also the most difficult to promote. It is about our loyalty and commitment to our country and our confidence iin Singapore's future. Only when Singaporeans stay united will we be able to stand up for our rights and defend what is ours. We have to strengthen our "heartware" so that we have a stronger sense of attachment and belonging to our home. That is why we have National Education in our schools and other nation-building efforts such as promoting our national symbols, national songs and National Day celebrations.<br><br>Through the Singapore 21 vision, we hope to involve Singaporeans in creating the type of society that they would like Singapore to be.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At individual level</span><br><br>At the individual level, Psycological Defence is actually a matter of the heart. What does Singapore mean to us? How do we feel towards it? Do we see it as our home or simply a big hotel? Is Singapore worth fighting for and even dying for? A Singaporean summed it up very well when he said "whatever you can't defend doesn't belong to you". There is no magic formula to strengthening our Psycological Defence. It is an ongoing process that will take time. We are after all still a young nation. However, we take pride in being Singaporean by knowing our history, and how we have managed to overcome the odds to be where we are today.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Household Shelters (HS)</strong><br><br>The Household Shelter (HS) in a dwelling unit is typically the store cum pantry with its walls, floor and ceiling strengthened with increased thickness. The walls are set back by specified distances from the building exterior and the entrance to the HS is installed with an SCDF-approved light protective steel door. The HS gives protection to the shelterees against weapon effects such as blast and fragments during an emergency.<br><br>Under the CD Shelter Act 1997, new dwelling units (both houses and flats) are required to have household / storey shelters incorporated in the developments.<br><br>With effect from 1 May 98, applications for planning permissions for new flats or houses submitted to or lodged with URA are required to incorporate household or storey shelters.<br><br>If an application for outline permission, or an application for written permission (if no outline permission is made) for a residential development is made before 1 May 98 and the permission was still valid as at 1 May 98, the CD Shelter Act would not apply to that development. In addition, any subsequent submission for this same development will be deemed as re-submission and not new submission for the purpose of the CD Shelter Act as long as any permission granted by URA arising from this said application has not lapsed or become invalid.<br><br>Typically, architects design storerooms and pantries with the required protection specified by SCDF so that they can also serve as shelters for occupants of the dwelling units.<br><br>The household / storey shelter has the advantage of being easily accessible to residents of the house or flat the apartment occupants when the need arises. Life during an emergency can thus be close to normalcy. In the case of a residential block of flats, it It is also economical because the void deck space otherwise occupied by a public shelter can be freed for other recreational and social uses, and maintenance cost is minimal.<br><br>For residents living in dwelling units without shelters, SCDF will advise them how they can improvise some cover in their homes using available household and furniture items. Such an improvised cover would provide a considerable degree of protection against flying debris and glass splinters which generally are the cause of the majority of casualties in bomb explosion incidents. In fact, it will be relatively safer to stay at home under some improvised cover during an attack than being out in the open trying to get to a public shelter.<br><br><img src="http://www.scdf.gov.sg/images/info/cdshelter/HS_artistic.jpg"></div>

Don't touch anything made of metals. It will burn your hands.<br><br>3) Turn gas mains off and call for help - If you are near the gas mains, turn them off. This is to prevent explosion. Call 995 for the SCDF.<br><br>4) Fight fire without endangering self - If you know how to fight a fire (you have learnt from SCDF), you may do so, but not the expense of your life or other lives.<br><br><img src="http://www.nfpc.gov.sg/images/firepage/fire%20safety/what%20to%20do%20if%20a%20fire%20breaks%20out/tio01.jpg"></div>
