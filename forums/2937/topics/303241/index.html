            <div class='col-md body'>Let's discuss about the betrayal during the three kingdoms era. This is a free for all discussion. No hard feeling..<br><br>State the person and state the reason why.<br><br>Firstly, the person that I wanted to say is Liu Bei! When in times of trouble, he cries.. after crying, there will be a lot of strong warriors fighting for him..<br><br>He is hypocrite.. I said that because at the Bai Men Lou where Cao Cao captured Lu Bu, Lu Bu asked Liu Bei for help and he agreed.. After Cao Cao came back and asked Liu Bei for advice, Liu Bei betrayed him.<br><br>Why did he promised Lu Bu first then betrayed him later? Is there a need to put this show for Cao Cao?<br><br>Liu Bei had forgotten that it was Lu Bu that save him from a battle with Ji Ling. (Lu Bu's stop the battle by shooting an arrow through his weapon.)<br><br>Furthermore,  Lu Bu attacked Xia Pi when Liu Bei was away, it was Zhang Fei that started it. Of course Liu Bei wont blamed his brother... ok no problem with that.. but if he really want to blame a person, pushed the blame to Chen Gong. Lu Bu actually dont want to attack but Chen Gong keep persisting.<br><br>Alright, in a man of honor... let say Liu Bei forgotten about Lu Bu saving him, and even forgot about the blame to be taken by Chen Gong, so my question is this: Why he agreed Lu Bu that he will say something nice in front of Cao Cao and after that changed his words???<br><br>Obvious betrayal there...<br><br>Anyway, keep the list going...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 798:</div><div class="quote_body">anyone remembered there was a capable general by the name of wei yan in liu bei's camp?<br><br>he only revolt after zhuge liang died, but failed becos before zhuge liang died, he warned his followers beforehand dat wei yan might rebel.</div></blockquote>Yeah.. that's why he isnt included in the Five Tiger General of Shu. Actually, I think why he rebel is because of Zhuge Liang. The Romance protray Zhuge Liang as good guy hence making Wei Yan as bad one. It's because he became Zhuge Liang's hates after he killed his lord and serve Liu Bei.<br><br>Think about this, how loyal can a man be if someone is making his life hard and added to the hate list?<br><br>Zhuge Liang ordered Ma Su to beheaded him from behind after hearing him scream 'Who dare to kill me?' Which I personally think that this is a truth or dare thing.... If you are capable general and a peon dare you to say something to prove your worth, wouldnt you simply said it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wor? Even such subtle things abt Liu Bei betraying, you can also point it out? Wah... I used to assume Lu Bu is the most outright traitor.<br><br>Come to think of it - EVERYBODY is betrayed and a betrayal in some sense.<br><br>But... its my pt of view, so can take it wif pince or pounds of salt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
