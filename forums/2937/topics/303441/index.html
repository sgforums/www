            <div class='col-md body'>I had been thinking this everytime and it eventually lead to many other event.. but of course, the paths can be altered though.<br><br>From what I think, the starter of three kingdoms and how the story developed is all because of one person... ---&gt; An old hermit &lt;---<br><br>(Some people might not know him, but he is what people's said.. a follower of god.. or rather an old Saint Hermit of the Southern Land)<br><br>Here goes.. : If he didnt appear, he wont be giving Zhang Jiao 'The way of Peace', If he didnt give that book to Zhang Jiao, Zhang Jiao would not have the power to start Yellow Turbun, If he didnt start Yellow Turbun, the emperor of Han would not be threatened, If the emperor is not threatened, he wont call for the lords from all over the country to oppose Zhang Jiao, If the emperor didnt call for the lords, Liu Bei will still selling his straw hat; Guan Yu will be running throughout the country from the authority and Zhang Fei will still be a butcher, If these people didnt appear, they wont form the oath brothers, If they didnt form the oath brother, there wont be any voluntary army, If there isnt any voluntary army, Liu Bei wont meet Cao Cao in battlefield, If they didnt meet each other....<br><br>I'll stop here for now... let's make it interesting, for those who know the 3 kingdoms storyline well.. mind continue the story? (If you know what would happen next..)</div>

The reason that Sun Jian give is that he is trying to help Yuan Shu to take revenge on Dong Zhuo as his family/relatives were killed by Dong Zhuo. So in the end Sun Jian managed to win Dong Zhuo but he died when he was attacking JingZhuo who was under Liu Biao's charge.<br><br>After Dong Zhuo died, Lu Bu went into exile. He tried following Yuan Shu but he got rejected. He joined Yuan Shao but only for a while as Yuan Shao see him as a threat after that. In the end, Lu Bu was executed by Cao Cao when Cao Cao capture Xiapi.<br><br>So now, in the north, Cao Cao and Yuan Shao begins to expand their territories while Yuan Shu in the south declared himself emperor. Eventually, many people under Yuan Shu left him, including Sun Ce(Sun Jian's eldest son) as at that time he was seen as a traitor( I think) as the current emperor is still around at Cao Cao's side at that time.<br><br>Sun Ce, in the south, begin to build up his base while Yuan Shu died soon after he declare himself emperor.<br><br>As for the north, everything went well for Yuan Shao and Cao Cao until when Yuan Shao delcare war on Cao Cao. Cao Cao, at that time, was thought that he will lose to Yuan Shao due to the HUGE difference in troop's size. But in the end at the Battle of Guandu he defeated Yuan Shao and from then onwards north part of china was controlled by Cao Cao. This makes him turn attention to the south. Jingzhou then was controlled by Liu Biao and Liu Bei was under him.<br><br>But when Cao Cao attacked Jingzhou, Liu Biao died and his 2 sons Liu Qi and Liu Cong take over. Liu Cong on hearing that Cao Cao is attacking JingZhou, surrendered to Cao Cao without informing Liu Bei who was in the north confronting Cao Cao soon.<br><br>So when Liu Bei knows of the news, he quickly fled south with the peasants to meet Liu Qi. But Cao Cao's troops managed to catch up with Liu Bei at Changban Slope. Liu Bei, though defeated, managed to escape and meet Liu Qi. He also try to make an alliance with Sun Quan (he took over Sun Ce when Sun Ce died). With the help of Zhuge Liang(who joined Liu Bei when he was in JingZhou), the alliance against Cao Cao was formed.<br><br>The Battle of Red Cliff was fought next when Cao Cao tried to conquer furthur. But, he was defeated although he was superior in numbers. Some of the reasons(that I think/read) for his defeat was that<br>1)his troops are not used to living in boats and so Cao Cao had the boats chained up. But this prove fatal as fire was easily spread around due to the close proximity of the ships and the south eastern wind(unforeseen) which happens to blow during that time.<br>2)Huang Gai make a 'fake surrender' to Cao Cao and Cao Cao accepts it. But what was Huang Gai doing is that he is trying to make a surprise attack on Cao Cao by sending ships that were set on fire to ram Cao Cao's boats.<br>3) Epidemic was spreading in Cao Cao's troops and so his troops cannot perform well.<br><br>After Cao Cao's defeat, he stopped his conquest at the south for a while. Soon after this battle, Liu Qi died and Liu Bei took over the remaining Jing Zhou.<br><br>Cao Cao then turned his attention to Zhang Lu who was at Hanzhong (Western part of China). This was also a motive to allow Cao Cao to attack Ma Chao and Han Sui at Guanzhong as Cao Cao needs to cross over their territory to attack Zhang Lu.<br><br>Of course, Ma Chao and Han Sui refused Cao Cao's entry and they formed an alliance against Cao Cao but in the end Cao Cao defeated them and take control of Hanzhong and Guanzhong.<br><br>Hmm...after much writing i begin to feel that I post this in the wrong thread as what I was trying to write out here is the actual history of the Three Kingdoms Period(San Guo Zhi).
