              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>More ERP gantries, higher ERP rates to ease congestion</strong></span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE : More electronic road pricing (or ERP) gantries will be put
              up and some ERP rates will be raised as part of the government’s wide
              ranging move to ease traffic congestion.</p>
              <p>In addition, the rate of annual vehicle growth will be moderated but road taxes will be cut.</p>
              <p>In
              the last of three major announcements on changes to the land transport
              system, Transport Minister Raymond Lim says even as public transport is
              being improved, firm steps must be taken to curb excessive car travel
              demand.</p>
              <p>So the incremental ERP charge will be raised from 50 cents to S$1 progressively from July.</p>
              <p>At
              the same time, the ERP base charge, which is the starting charge for a
              new ERP gantry point, will be increased from S$1 to S$2.</p>
              <p>The number of vehicles on the road is also set to go down.</p>
              <p>From May 2009, the rate of annual vehicle growth will be halved — from 3 percent to 1.5 percent.</p>
              <p>But
              road taxes will be reduced by 15 percent from July this year as part of
              the general move towards taxing based on usage, rather than ownership.</p>
              <p>To
              lower the upfront cost of car ownership, the Additional Registration
              Fee (or ARF) will be lowered from 110 percent of the Open Market Value
              (or OMV) to 100 percent from March.</p>
              <p>On the new gantries, 16 will come up in phases during the year.</p>
              <p>On
              April 7, the gantries at Upper Bukit Timah Road, Toa Payoh Lorong 6,
              Upper Boon Keng Road, Geylang Bahru Road and Kallang Bahru Road will be
              switched on.</p>
              <p>On July 7, five new gantries will run along the
              Singapore River line — from Clemenceau Avenue to Fullerton Road — at Eu
              Tong Sen Street, New Bridge Road, South Bridge Road and Fullerton Road.</p>
              <p>Then
              on November 3, six new gantries will come up — at Commonwealth Avenue,
              Jalan Bukit Merah, Alexandra Road, AYE (westbound) and PIE (westbound)
              near Eunos and Serangoon Road.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim explained that the ERP
              system has largely remained unchanged since it was introduced 10 years
              ago so it has to be enhanced to address current and future traffic
              conditions.</p>

              <p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">More ERP gantries, higher ERP rates, but motorists to get road tax cuts</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE : More ERP gantries, higher ERP rates, and halving the annual
              vehicle growth rate to 1.5% — these are some of the main announcements
              by Transport Minister Raymond Lim in the final instalment of changes
              under the land transport review.</p>
              <p>But the bitter pill of more ERP was accompanied by some sweeteners,
              such as a permanent 15% cut in road tax for all vehicles and a
              multi—billion dollar improvement programme for expressways.</p>
              <p>Singapore
              has the same problem faced by many other growing cities in the world —
              an insatiable appetite for cars, leading to congestion and possible
              gridlock. Singapore transport officials said congestion has climbed 25%
              since 1999.</p>
              <p>Drawing out the future road map, the transport minister said the problems made three things certain.</p>
              <p>"First,
              not everybody can drive to and from work, it’s just not possible. Two,
              the trade—offs that we face will become sharper. The more cars that we
              put on the road, the higher your ERP charges will be and the more
              extensive the ERP coverage will have to be," said the Transport
              Minister.</p>
              <p>"Three, even if we have higher ERP charges and more
              extensive ERP coverage, given where the car population is today and
              that road growth is trending down, we will still have to moderate our
              vehicle population growth," Mr Lim continued.</p>
              <p>So, ERP coverage will be expanded, where 16 more gantries will be activated this year, adding to the current 55.</p>
              <p>On
              April 7, the gantries at Upper Bukit Timah Road, Toa Payoh Lorong 6,
              Upper Boon Keng Road, Geylang Bahru and Kallang Bahru will be activated.</p>
              <p>On
              July 7, there will be five new gantries on roads along the Singapore
              River area. These are at Eu Tong Sen Street, New Bridge Road, South
              Bridge Road and both sides of Fullerton Road.</p>
              <p>On November 3,
              there will be six more gantries at Commonwealth Avenue, Jalan Bukit
              Merah, Alexandra Road, AYE (westbound) and PIE (westbound) and
              Serangoon Road.</p>
              <p>While these gantries kick in this year, solid
              public transport improvements are still some years away, so interim
              measures will be implemented immediately.</p>
              <p>The frequency of basic
              bus services along ERP—affected corridors will be increased from 15
              minutes to 12 minutes by June, and 10 minutes by next August. The
              frequency of feeder services will also go up.</p>
              <p>And for the first time, buses will be allowed to duplicate services along mature rail lines.</p>
              <p>Premium
              bus services will also be expanded from the current 42 to 72 by June,
              with priority for areas affected by the ERP expansion. — CNA /ls</p>

              <h1 class="clr">New ERP gantries catch some motorists by surprise</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Some motorists were not aware that five new Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) gantries were activated on Monday.</p>
              <p>At 8am, four new ERP gantries were switched on, but the fifth one was activated half an hour later.</p>
              <p>It was a quiet scene at Geylang Bahru, with little traffic at the start of the ERP operating hours.</p>
              <p>But at Toa Payoh, a few motorists were taken by surprise.</p>
              <p>Upon
              seeing the gantry, some stopped in the middle of road to insert their
              CashCards while others got off the road, causing traffic behind to
              build up.</p>
              <p>"I didn’t know there was a gantry here. I couldn’t remember," said a motorist.</p>
              <p>A few motorcyclists got off their motorcycles and took a detour to avoid paying the toll charge.</p>
              <p>Motorists had mixed reactions to the new gantries.</p>
              <p>Some
              did not see a real cut in their usual travelling time at the Toa Payoh
              stretch while others felt it was a slightly smoother ride.</p>
              <p>But there were other issues.</p>
              <p>A member of the public said: "Definitely it’s troublesome for residents staying around here. It’s added cost for us."</p>
              <p>Another
              complained: "It brings a lot of inconvenience for all of us here... We
              have to buy (something), but we purposely... wait until after 9... to
              come here and buy (it)."</p>
              <p>Other more enterprising motorists, however, have figured out a plan.</p>
              <p>A motorist said: "Ever since they erected the ERP (gantry), people... have managed to find... other routes."</p>
              <p>The
              five new gantries are located at Upper Bukit Timah Road, Toa Payoh
              Lorong 6, Upper Boon Keng Road, Geylang Bahru and Kallang Bahru.</p>
              <p>In
              a statement issued on Monday evening, the Land Transport Authority
              (LTA) said traffic volumes went down at the five gantry locations on
              the first day of operation. This led to an 8—25 per cent increase in
              travelling speed on the affected roads. — CNA/ac</p>

              <h1 class="clr">ERP rate for Bukit Timah Expressway gantry to be revised</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: From 5 May, the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) rate for the
                  Bukit Timah Expressway gantry will be increased by 50 cents to S$1.50.</p>
              <p>The change will apply for the period between 7.30am and 8.00am.</p>
              <p>There will be no changes to the ERP rates for other gantries.</p>
              <p>The
                  Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it is revising the rate after it
                  has completed its quarterly review of traffic conditions on ERP—priced
                  roads and expressways.</p>
              <p>LTA said this is to ensure optimal traffic flow on Singapore’s roads. — CNA/so</p>

              <p><strong>Lower ERP rates for June holidays</strong></p>
              <p>IN anticipation of lower vehicle volumes and thus smoother flowing
                  traffic during the June school holidays, electronic road-pricing rates
                  at several gantries will be reduced by 50 cents per pass per car.</p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority said on Tuesday that the reduction
                  applies to the following gantries: Ayer Rajah Expressway (eastbound)
                  from 9am to 9.30am.</p>

              <p><strong>Relocation Of ERP Gantry Along Central Boulevard</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1.     To facilitate the construction of
              Downtown Line Stage 1, the current ERP gantry on Central Boulevard will be
              relocated about 180 metres further up the road. The relocation is necessary to
              facilitate construction works from Landmark Station to Cross Street Station.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2.     The columns for the new gantry will
              be installed on Thursday, 12 June 08 and the gantry installation will be
              completed on Thursday, 19 June 2008.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3.     During the gantry installation on
              19 June, the affected stretch of Central Boulevard between the access road from
              Maxwell Road / East Coast Parkway (eastbound) to Shenton Way / Cross Street will
              be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> closed to traffic from 0001hrs to 0500hrs</span>.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4.     During the temporary road closure,
              motorists will be diverted to Rochor Road via the ECP (eastbound).
              Alternatively, motorists can make a detour to Prince Edward Road via Marina
              Station Road. The road will be re-opened after 0500hrs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5.     The switch over of the ERP gantry
              operation will be carried out on Monday, 28 July 2008. The new gantry will be in
              operation until Central Boulevard is re-aligned at the end of 2012. The current
              gantry will be dismantled by Sunday, 17 August 2008.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6.     Existing ERP rates and operating
              hours apply. Informational signboards will be displayed at the slip road of ECP
              and at Central Boulevard to inform motorists of the relocation of the ERP
              gantry.</span></p>

              <h1 class="clr">New ERP Gantries</h1>
              <p>For drivers who have lost track of changes to the Electronic Road
              Pricing (ERP)system and are clueless about new gantry locations and
              their graduated charges, help is at hand.</p>
              <p>Online driving guide Oneshift.com has come up with an interactive
              map (which can be seen at www.oneshift.com/erp) displaying the ERP
              gantries in Singapore, including those that will come into operation
              today, next month and in November.</p>
              <p>Users can click on a gantry
              for a pop—up speech bubble displaying its operating hours and charges.
              Using Google Maps technology, there will also be a tool that allows
              drivers to plot the route to their destinations.</p>
              <p>“More often than
              not, people are unsure where the gantries are until they actually
              encounter them. By then, it’s too late and they would have to pay,”
              said Oneshift’s founder and managing director Evan Lee, 32.</p>
              <p>Oneshift,
              set up in 2006, is an online motoring magazine and its new function,
              launched on June 28, was a “natural progression” from the site’s
              merchant database search function. It was also spurred on by the
              “mushrooming” of ERP gantries.</p>
              <p>Going forward, more improvements
              are in the pipeline. These include enabling the pop—up bubble to move
              in tandem with any shifting of the map, allowing users to plot
              alternative routes to their destinations, and a function that tabulates
              drivers’ ERP costs when they drive at a certain time of the day.</p>

              is also in talks with advertisers to generate income from this service.
              Drivers who tried out Oneshift’s gantry guide felt it was useful but
              needed tweaking to make it more intuitive and user—friendly.</p>
              <p>“In
              its current state, I think it’ll attract a limited audience. It’s
              useful, but might not be useful enough to get people back because of
              the little interface foibles,” said civil servant Soon Ying Jie, 27,
              who has dabbled in Web design.</p>
              <p>“When I plot a route which uses
              the Central Expressway, it appears like I have to go through four
              gantries, when not all of them are for south—bound travel,” said Mr
              Soon.</p>
              <p>If the function tabulating total ERP charges and the option
              for self—plotted routes were added, he said he would “definitely use
              it”.</p>
              <p>Magazine editor Gayle Quah said she would use the guide
              before heading out of the house. “I’ve entered ERP zones and exited
              unknowingly, only to pay another two bucks to get in,” said the
              31—year—old, who drives to town twice a week. — TODAY/sh</p>

              <p><strong>First Day Implementation of New ERP Gantries and<br>Criteria in the City Centre</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1. With the implementation of the new ERP criteria in the city 
              centre and the addition of 5 new gantries along the Singapore River Line, data 
              collected on the first day showed an improvement in travel speeds and traffic 
              conditions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2. Along the Singapore River, the 5 new gantries have been 
              effective in cutting down through traffic from 6pm to 8pm. Traffic volume 
              dropped by about 30 per cent, and consequently, traffic speeds improved by 9 to 
              35 per cent, from below the threshold speed of 20 kph before implementation of 
              the 5 new ERP gantries, to between 22 kph and 26 kph, which is within the 
              optimum speed range of 20kph to 30kph. For the entire CBD Cordon, speeds between 
              6 pm to 8 pm had also gone up, by 9 to 15 per cent, to between 21 kph and 22 kph.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3. While traffic conditions will take time to settle, it is 
              nevertheless an encouraging sign. LTA will continue to monitor traffic 
              conditions closely.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4. Our experience in the last 10 years shows that ERP has been 
              effective in managing congestion, both on expressways and in the city centre. 
              For example, when a new ERP gantry was implemented on the north-bound CTE in 
              November last year, traffic volume during the most congested time period dropped 
              by about 10% and speeds went up by 50%. Similarly, from the experience with 
              Orchard Road ERP implementation, we found that traffic speeds along the Orchard 
              corridor improved from 15 kph to 25kph and stabilised at 23kph. Through traffic 
              using Orchard Road was reduced from more than 30 per cent to about 20 per cent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5. "Some have questioned if it is timely to raise ERP 
              rates, given the current economic situation. The fact is that congestion, if 
              left unchecked, will have a negative impact on our economy and the quality of 
              our living environment. If we do not manage demand for road use, our roads will 
              eventually become gridlocked and all road users will have no choice but to get 
              stuck in traffic jams. LTA has worked with the transport operators on immediate 
              measures to improve the capacity and speed of the public transport system. The 
              Government has also decided to allow motorists to encash their COE and PARF 
              rebates," said LTA Chief Executive, Mr Yam Ah Mee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Public Transport Improvements</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6. Various measures have been implemented to make public 
              transport a more attractive commuting choice. Mr Yam adds, "Seventy-five 
              premium bus services now supply door-to-door service. The new SBST 128 is plying 
              the southbound section of the North South East West line between Bishan and Ang 
              Mo Kio to address heavy peak hour loading on that line. The recently announced 
              Public Transport Journey Planner, which covers both SMRT and SBST routes and 
              fares on one website, will make planning for trips more convenient. Bus lanes 
              are also added to make bus travel faster and smoother. As of 30 June 2008, peak 
              headways of basic trunk bus services that ply corridors affected by the ERP 
              changes have improved from 15 minutes to 12 minutes on weekdays.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>More Choices: PARF/COE Rebates</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7. From September onwards, registered car owners of un-used 
              and valid PARF/COE rebates can apply to encash their rebates as an additional 
              option. This initiative is intended to provide flexibility to owners, to make it 
              easier for owners giving up their cars to do so.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">8. These initiatives and improvements underline LTA's 
              commitment to provide more choices for commuters, including drivers who decide 
              to switch to public transport.</span></p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LTA to review ERP rates for gantries around Singapore River</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will review the
              rates for the five Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) gantries around the
              Singapore River in October – a month ahead of its usual quarterly
              review.
              <br> <br>The move came in response to recent feedback that businesses in
              nearby Chinatown have seen a slump in sales since the ERP charges were
              introduced in July.
              <br> <br>The LTA met with the Chinatown Business Association on Monday as
              part of its ongoing engagement with stakeholders affected by ERP
              implementation. The authority said it will adjust the ERP rates from
              early October if traffic conditions warrant it.
              <br> <br>Senior Minister of State for Transport, Mrs Lim Hwee Hwa, said that
              the new gantries are meant to ensure that businesses benefit from
              smooth-flowing traffic in the long term.
              <br> <br>She cautioned that reducing ERP charges will not be able to address
              any underlying weaknesses in consumer demand or economic conditions.
              <br> <br>Mrs Lim said: "What we hope to do is to make sure that the ERP
              rates are pegged at the appropriate level that will ensure that patrons
              and users of the area will not be prevented from coming in simply
              because of congestion.
              <br> <br>"There are also some issues with regard to public education. A lot
              of people, including the operators themselves, thought that the ERP
              hours are operational on Saturdays as well, which is not the case. <br> <br> "That is something which LTA can look into to see how it can publicise
              this more widely so as to help the businesses in the area."

              <p><strong>Not all 6 new ERP gantries need to be switched on in November</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Not all of the six new Electronic Road Pricing (ERP)
              gantries need to be switched on in November. Transport Minister Raymond
              Lim offered this little nugget of hope to motorists at a talk to the
              Press Club on Friday.
              <br> <br>ERP was an obvious hot topic at the talk, especially as it comes
              after rates went up at about half of all gantries in the central
              business and shopping areas, while five new gantries along the
              Singapore River were added in July.
              <br> <br> Explaining the rationale, the minister said such road pricing was a measure of last resort.
              <br> <br>He said: "We recognise that such system-wide changes will have a
              significant impact on people's lives. So let's roll it out in phases,
              and as we roll it out in phases, we hope we might end up doing much
              less than we have to."
              <br> <br> He added that since the July changes, speeds have picked up on many of these roads.
              <br> <br>Thus, not all six new gantries that the Land Transport Authority
              had previously announced would be switched on in November, may have to
              become operational.
              <br> <br>These are the ones along Serangoon Road, Commonwealth Avenue, Jalan
              Bukit Merah, Alexandra Road, AYE-westbound near Alexandra Road and
              PIE-westbound near Eunos.
              <br> <br>There was also a nugget of good news for public transport commuters
              - bus passengers may get higher transfer rebates. Details are expected
              to be announced next week.
              <br> <br> This means the majority of bus passengers who make one or more transfers stand to benefit.
              <br> <br> During question time, Mr Lim was asked if fares for children could be waived, in light of Singapore's family-friendly thrust.
              <br> <br>The answer was that it boiled down to a question of government
              intervention and cross-subsidies - a path it is not likely to take. <br> <br> Click </span><a class="path" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/annex/050908_raymondlim.htm">here</a><span> to read the full text of Transport Minister Raymond Lim's speech.
