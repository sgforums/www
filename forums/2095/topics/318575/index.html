              <h1 class="clr">Road above Circle Line construction site caves in</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A section of the road above a Circle Line construction site
              near Holland Road caved in on Saturday morning, creating a massive
              hole. No one was injured.</p>
              <p>The hole, directly in front of two private houses along Cornwall Gardens Road, measured 8 by 7 metres and is 3 metres deep.</p>
              <p>According to the Land Transport Authority, tunnelling work about 25 metres under the road was in progress when it caved in.</p>
              <p>The
              tunnelling work is part of the last few stages of the Circle Line
              construction in the area, between Holland and Farrer Road Station.</p>
              <p>One
              family, whose house is right in front of the cave—in, said they noticed
              a huge crack about 8.30pm Friday before that section of the road
              collapsed at about 5am the next day.</p>
              <p>"This morning (when) I woke
              up....my little brother and I went out to look and there was a huge
              hole in the road about 20 feet long and maybe 10 feet wide and it is
              filled with water," said 14—year—old Eliot Sperling.</p>
              <p>Eliot and his brother Owen said that after the incident, their water supply and Internet connection was cut off.</p>
              <p>Three
              other households in the area also lost their access to cable TV and
              Internet as the cables were severed after the accident.</p>
              <p>938LIVE understands it may take weeks before the cable wires can be restored.</p>
              <p>LTA has offered one of the affected families transport and temporary hotel accommodation to minimise further inconvenience.</p>
              <p>This is not the first time roads have caved in near tunnelling works of the Circle Line.</p>
              <p>Last
              year, the Building and Construction Authority issued a stop—work order
              for the Telok Blangah site after a stretch of the road, about 7 metres
              long, sank 20 centimetres. — 938LIVE.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Restoration work underway at Cornwall Gardens Road</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has said expects one lane of Cornwall Gardens Road to be opened this Friday.</p>
              <p>LTA said its inspection of the area is complete and reassures the public that buildings in the area are safe.</p>
              <p>The
              family that has moved to the hotel since the incident has returned
              home. Telecommunications network to the area is up and running as well.</p>
              <p>Cornwall Gardens Road has been blocked off since part of it caved in due to the MRT Circle Line construction.</p>
              <p>Although tunnelling work in the area has stopped, LTA said the incident will not affect the Circle Line’s construction schedule. — CNA/so</p>

              <p><strong>Works to Restore Cornwall Gardens Road in Good Progress</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1.     The road subsidence which occurred
              at Cornwall Gardens road on Saturday, 24 May, had been back-filled by 5.00pm on
              the same day and works are in progress to restore the area.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2.     LTA engineers and contractors have
              inspected the monitoring instruments installed at the houses and on the ground
              in the vicinity, and are satisfied that the houses and surrounding area are
              safe.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3.     The incident had caused water
              disruption to three houses and telecommunication disruption to one house. The
              LTA had provided potable drinking water to the households during this period.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4.     The water supply was restored on
              Saturday night and the telecommunications network restored on Monday, 26 May.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5.     Although there has been no damage
              to the power cables, SP PowerGrid and PowerGas engineers are continuing to check
              the electrical cables and gas pipes in the vicinity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6.     As a precautionary measure,
              electricity to the cables and gas to the pipes at the site have been turned off.
              However, electricity and piped gas supply to residents in the area have not been
              affected, as electricity and piped gas are being supplied through alternative
              cables and pipes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7.     One lane of the Cornwall Gardens
              road is expected to re-open on Friday, 30 May, depending on weather conditions
              and the progress of the utilities inspection. Meanwhile, members of the public
              are advised to avoid the road.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">8.     The family that was moved to a
              hotel on the day of the incident has since returned to their home. The LTA will
              continue to provide assistance to the residents in the vicinity to minimise any
              inconvenience caused to them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">9.     While the tunnelling work at this
              site has stopped to facilitate inspection and further grouting works, the LTA
              does not expect this incident to affect the overall progress of the Circle Line,
              scheduled for completion from 2009 onwards.</span></p>
