              <h1 class="clr">Crane driver knocks down traffic lights, crashes into MRT tracks</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Barely a week after a lorry driver took a gantry down with
              his crane, another knocked down a set of traffic lights before crashing
              into the MRT tracks along Woodlands Avenue 10 on Monday.</p>
              <p>The lorry driver told traffic policemen at the scene that he had
              forgotten to lower the lorry—mounted crane before driving off. He
              declined to comment when approached by this newspaper.</p>
              <p>No one was
              injured but the accident, besides damaging the traffic lights, also
              left scratches on the MRT tracks. However, there was no disruption to
              train services.</p>
              <p>An SMRT spokesperson said they had checked the
              tracks to ensure that they were safe, adding that such accidents
              involving its tracks were few and far between.</p>
              <p>Last October, the
              Land Transport Authority developed a series of public education
              materials to distribute to lorry crane owners to remind them of the
              importance of keeping to height limits on the roads. The kit held a
              brochure, tips and stickers to drive home the importance of retracting
              cranes.</p>
              <p>Between 2000 and 2006, there were 111 cases of vehicles
              hitting road structures such as pedestrian overhead bridges, gantries
              and walkways. Of these, 68 per cent were caused by drivers who forgot
              to retract their lorry—mounted cranes before moving off.</p>
              <p>Traffic
              police spokesperson Liu Xiangling advised road users, especially heavy
              vehicle drivers, to exercise care on the roads. — TODAY/ar</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: A crane on tow caught fire on Saturday morning at 10.45am as
              it was travelling on the Tanjong Penjuru flyover in Jurong.</p>
              <p>The 100—tonne crane was being towed by a lorry when it caught fire.</p>
              <p>Its engine compartment was damaged in the blaze, which was put out by Civil Defence officers in ten minutes.</p>
              <p>No one was injured, but officials are investigating how the fire started. — CNA/so</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: An accident on Dunearn Road early Sunday morning left three men in a rental car dead and one seriously injured.</p>
              <p>The rental car was going on the extreme left lane of Dunearn Road, heading towards Newton Circus.</p>
              <p>But at around 2.20am, the driver was believed to have lost control of the vehicle after the Dunearn Road/Chancery Lane junction.</p>
              <p>It then hit a kerb and a tree before landing in the bushes nearby.</p>
              <p>Police said all four occupants of the car were flung out of the vehicle.</p>
              <p>Two of them, both aged 23, were pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
              <p>The
              26—year—old driver and another 19—year—old passenger were found
              unconscious and in critical condition. They were taken to Tan Tock Seng

              <h1 class="clr">Driver rams steps outside Raffles Place MRT station</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A driver rammed through several reflective posts and crashed
              into the steps outside Raffles Place MRT station during the evening
              peak hour on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The driver, a man in his 30s, was conveyed to Singapore General
              Hospital after he complained of chest pains. It is believed he was
              driving his grey Hyundai Getz down Robinson Road when he skidded at the
              junction of Cecil Street and Robinson Road and crashed.</p>
              <p>This
              comes more than two years after the Land Transport Authority (LTA) made
              traffic changes to better regulate traffic flow at the busy junction.
              In July 2005, a raised kerb was installed along Cecil Street to create
              an interrupted two—lane slip road. This meant motorists from Robinson
              Road could no longer travel towards D’almeida Street.</p>
              <p>About two
              and a half months later, the kerb was removed to prevent jaywalking,
              and a flat red marker with white stripes took its place. The
              controversial change sparked off a slew of accidents at the junction
              involving motorists who didn’t know about the rule changes.</p>
              <p>Several drivers wrote in to TODAY and complained that the new rules were confusing and the markers not visible enough.</p>
              <p>The LTA then made changes again, with a row of yellow—and—black reflective posts erected on top of the red markers.</p>
              <p>But
              drivers complain the rules at the junction are still too confusing.
              Said Mr Ali Abdul, 62: "New drivers or those unfamiliar with the roads
              here may panic when they realise they can’t turn where they want to."</p>
              <p>One
              cabby sad he has seen some near—misses. Another taxi driver, Mr Ang C
              H, 43, said the reflective posts are not sufficient to warn drivers to
              keep to their lanes. "Imagine if someone was walking on the pavement
              and an accident like today’s happens?" he said. — TODAY/so</p>
