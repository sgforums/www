              <p><strong>LTA Awards First Two Civil Contracts for Singapore’s Tenth Expressway – The Marina Coastal Expressway</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1.     The Land Transport Authority (LTA)
              today awarded the first two of six civil contracts for the construction of the
              Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE), signalling the start of work on Singapore's
              newest expressway.<br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2.     The MCE will be the tenth
              expressway in Singapore, a major part of the strategic island-wide road network
              to support the long-term growth of Singapore. The MCE is expected to be

              District Cooling System Box at Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>ABOUT THE MCE</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">11.     The dual 5-lane, 5km long MCE is a
              key element of the strategic island-wide road network to support the long-term
              growth of Singapore. The underground east-west transport link runs between the
              Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE), the East Coast Parkway (ECP) and the Ayer
              Rajah Expressway (AYE), with direct connections to the Marina South and Straits
              View areas.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">12.     The MCE's total route length
              includes a 3.6km long road tunnel, two ventilation buildings and 13.1 hectares
              of land reclamation. It also includes 3 interchanges with KPE/ECP, Marina
              Boulevard and Central Boulevard, and the AYE.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">13.     With several upcoming developments
              such as the Marina Barrage, the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort, the Sail @
              Marina Bay and the Marina Bay Financial Centre in the vicinity, the MCE will
              cater to the projected increase in traffic volume generated in the Marina Bay
              area and serves as an essential transport link from the Marina Bay area to the
              rest of the island.</span></p>

              <p>The Land Transport Authority, LTA, has awarded two more contracts worth
              more than $1.6 billion for the construction of the Marina Coastal
              Expressway or MCE.</p>
              <p>With the award of the two new contracts, LTA has awarded four out of the six civil contracts to construct the expressway.</p>
              <p>In addition, the LTA has also awarded four contracts for the
              provision of various Electrical &amp; Mechanical and Cladding systems
              required for the road tunnel.</p>
              <p>Works for the MCE are expected to star in the first quarter of next year.</p>
              <p>The MCE includes a 3.6 kilometre long road tunnel that will run
              through segments of reclaimed land as well as a 420 metre section that
              runs below the seabed of Marina Bay.</p>
              <p>The 5 kilometre long MCE is expected to be completed by 2013. --938Live</p>

              <p><strong> New expressway to cost $5b?</strong></p>
              <p>MCE already $600m over budget; poor soil, higher construction costs cited as reasons</p>
              <p>THE new Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE), which will link the new
              downtown to the western and north-eastern suburbs, is busting its
              budget in a big way.</p>
              <p>With four out of six major contracts awarded, expenditure on the
              5km-long underground and undersea road has already hit $3.1 billion -
              $600 million more than its $2.5 billion estimated price tag.</p>
              <p>When the five-lane dual-carriageway expressway opens in 2013, it could
              cost between $4 billion and $5 billion, which will make it the
              costliest road here for years to come.</p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has attributed the cost overrun
              to a general spike in construction cost, and also to poor soil
              conditions that required strong temporary walls to prevent accidents.</p>
              <p>A former LTA executive said: 'The cost is staggering. Compared with it, the KPE is nothing.'</p>
              <p>The 12km-long, largely underground Kallang-Paya Lebar
              Expressway (KPE) cost $142 million per km, nearly four times the $37.5
              million spent on the Central Expressway in 1991.</p>
              <p>Another expensive road to come is the 21km-long, $8 billion
              North-South Expressway to link Thomson to the city. To be completed in
              2020, it is now expected to cost $381 million per km.</p>
              <p>But should the MCE hit $5 billion, it would top them all, costing an unprecedented $1 billion per km.</p>
              <p>The project is so massive that civil works have to be carved up
              into six portions, so that the builders are not overstretched.</p>
              <p>Even so, industry players said each portion would pose a
              cash-flow challenge to builders. The civil contracts have so far been
              secured by Ssangyong Engineering &amp; Construction, Samsung C&amp;T,
              Penta-Ocean Construction and Sato Kogyo-Daelim Industrial - all foreign
              groups.</p>
              <p>Elaborating on the cost spiral, LTA chief executive Yam Ah Mee said construction costs had gone up.</p>
              <p>'Given the poor soil conditions and the reclaimed land at the
              location where the MCE will run and the many engineering challenges, it
              is important that we put in place a more comprehensive and robust
              temporary wall system for the tunnel excavations.'</p>
              <p>Construction industry observers said such beefed-up
              engineering requirements - mandatory since the Nicoll Highway collapse
              in 2004 - contribute to the higher costs.</p>
              <p>The LTA declined to reveal the revised cost of the project,
              saying that doing so could influence bids for the remaining contracts.</p>
              <p>The MCE joins the newly opened KPE to the Ayer Rajah
              Expressway. It links the new Marina South financial centre to the rest
              of Singapore. -- ST</p>
