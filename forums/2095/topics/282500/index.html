It is more satisfying now to see this engineering marvel being completed."<br><br>The first phase, which connects the East Coast Parkway (ECP) to the PanÂ—Island Expressway (PIE), will be opened on October 26.<br><br>With the opening just weeks away, the authorities have been doing some fineÂ—tuning.<br><br>Chuah Han Leong, deputy director of the KPE project, said: "Emergency planning is something we refine as we go along. We have been doing a lot of tests.<br><br>"This is what we call part of the integrated testing and commissioning process. And we have actually developed many scenarios of possible accidents within the tunnel."<br><br>A series of safety events and tests, including a fire scenario, are planned for next Saturday (October 6).

Some of the participants included residents living along the expressway.<br><br>Rows of cars came to a screeching halt in the tunnel, as there was a threeÂ—vehicle Â’collisionÂ’ in front.<br><br>The crash caused a car to overturn, passengers on a bus were Â’injuredÂ’ and another car went up in flames.<br><br>As special pipes sucked out smoke and pumped in fresh air, emergency personnel opened the metal shutters to the adjoining, unaffected tunnel.<br><br>If there is a big accident, some lanes of the unaffected tunnel will be closed to traffic so that emergency vehicles can use it to go through to the accident site.<br><br>Within minutes, firemen swung into action, dousing out flames, rescuing trapped drivers and rushing Â’injuredÂ’ passengers to safety in the adjoining tunnel for emergency treatment.<br><br>The exercise was not just about getting the injured to safety but also getting stranded motorists safely out of the accident tunnel.<br><br>In the event of a major accident which involves closing off the entire tunnel, the motorists who are trapped inside can make a speedy exit through escape staircases located every 500 metres along the KPE tunnel.<br><br>The staircases lead to the roads on the surface.<br><br>Transport Minister Raymond Lim was there to watch the entire exercise.<br><br>He said this was just one of a series of exercises to test various disaster scenarios, and for public education.<br><br>"The key thing is that this is the longest tunnel that we will have in Singapore. In fact, itÂ’s the longest underground tunnel in Southeast Asia. So, because it is the first time Singaporeans will be driving for such long distances underground, we need to really educate them. So we have installed a whole programme to try and get these safety messages across to Singaporeans," Mr Lim said.<br><br>Also present were external consultants who have experience in tunnel safety in Europe.<br><br>Residents who participated in the exercise found it useful but they also had some suggestions.<br><br>One of them, William Seow, suggested that there should be "some simple things to carry the handicapped up from the tunnel".<br><br>Phase one of the KallangÂ—Paya Lebar Expressway opens on 26 October.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Channel NewsAsia - Saturday, November 3</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">About 600 motorists caught speeding every day since new KPE opened</span></strong><br><br>SINGAPORE: About 600 motorists are caught speeding on the newlyÂ—opened KallangÂ—Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) each day.<br><br>Cameras installed in the tunnel have captured 3,378 vehicles travelling above the speed limit of 70 kilometres per hour since it was opened a week ago.<br><br>The traffic police said this is cause for alarm because on average 10,000 speeding summons are issued in a month.<br><br>Many people do not know there are now digital speed cameras operating 24 hours a day in the tunnel. And many motorists are not fully aware that the speed limit in the tunnel is 70 kilometres per hour, not 90 kilometres per hour as in some expressways.<br><br>"In many countries, speeds in tunnels are always lower than (those) in open expressways. And in Mont Blanc where a serious accident happened before, the speed limit is now 50km/h, much lower than the 70km/h that we have in the KPE tunnel," said Land Transport Authority (LTA) Â’s transportation chief engineer Chin Kian Keong.<br><br>To guide motorists, the LTA has put up signages and road markings.<br><br>"The figures are high because motorists are in fact speeding. They are not travelling within the speed limit of 70 kilometres an hour. They may also not be aware that there are cameras operating 24/7 Our aim at the end of the day is to bring the number to zero," said Traffic PoliceÂ’s Deputy Superintendent Alvin Lee Fook Wing.<br><br>Those caught speeding in the KPE in its first week will receive advisory letters or summons over the next few days.<br><br>An average of 21,000 vehicles travelled in the KallangÂ—Paya Lebar Expressway tunnel on weekdays. And on the first weekend since it opened, the number jumped to 25,000.<br><br>The Land Transport Authority said traffic along the threeÂ—kilometre tunnel, which forms part of the 12Â—kilometre expressway, has been smoothÂ—flowing.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Update On First Week Of KPE Phase 1 Operations</strong><br><br>1.     A week after the opening of the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) Phase 1 tunnel, the Land Transport Authority has observed that traffic in the KPE tunnel has been smooth flowing.<br><br>2.     There is an average of 21,000 vehicles per day traveling in the KPE tunnel on weekdays and 25,000 vehicles per day using the tunnel over the last weekend. Traffic continues to be smooth flowing during the morning and evening peak hours. There are no significant changes to traffic volumes on the CTE and the ECP at this point.<br><br>3.     Based on traffic monitoring for the past week through the KPE Operations Control Centre, we have observed that motorists are generally keeping in lane and a majority of motorists have switched on their headlights when traveling in the KPE tunnel.<br><br>4.     This is a clear indication that most motorists are aware of the safe driving habits that we have advocated in our safety education programme.<br><br>5.     We have observed that some motorists are undecided about using the KPE tunnel or their usual route, resulting in last minute lane switches. Before the opening of the KPE the LTA has put up ample signages and road markings to guide motorists. Advanced traffic signs are located at 600 meters and 300 meters ahead of entrance slips, while another is placed just before the slip road. Over and above these, LTA has put up additional temporary signs so that motorists who are unfamiliar with the new road have ample directions. We advise motorists to look out for these signs and plan their route in advance. During peak hours LTA Traffic Marshals are also deployed at entrances to assist motorists.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Speeding in the KPE</span><br><br>6.     Our traffic monitoring shows that there are a number of motorists not keeping to the stated speed limits of 70km/h in the tunnel.<br><br>7.     Speeding is a major cause of serious accidents, and potentially catastrophic if it takes place in a road tunnel.<br><br>8.     The LTA would like to urge all motorists to continue to practice safe driving habits and adhere to the speed limits when driving in the KPE tunnel.</div>
