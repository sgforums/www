              <h1 class="clr">Roads along S’pore F1 circuit to be closed for resurfacing works</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Roads along the Singapore Formula One track will be closed in stages so that resurfacing works can begin.</p>
              <p>So far, the S$23.8 million roadworks, that are already being carried out, are proceeding as planned.</p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority said the circuit will be completed two weeks ahead of schedule.</p>
              <p>To
              prepare for the speed demons at the inaugural F1 race, the road has to
              be resurfaced with a special asphalt, which is darker than what is
              normally used.</p>
              <p>A stretch at Raffles Avenue has already been laid
              with the stronger surface, using what is called the Polymer Modified
              Binder (PMB).</p>
              <p>It is a special mix that will enable the road to withstand greater forces that are necessary for the race cars.</p>
              <p>The
              resurfacing works, which will be done in stages, starts on 4 April at
              Raffles Boulevard. The road closure will be from midnight to 6am the
              next morning.</p>
              <p>On most occasions, works will be carried out from
              Sundays till Thursdays, when traffic is not as heavy as compared to the
              weekend. In some cases, one lane will remain open to traffic.</p>
              <p>Yap
              Boon Leong, Director, Road Construction, Land Transport Authority,
              said: "Whenever we do resurfacing work, there will be alternative
              access to be given to stakeholders, so that their accesses are not
              adversely impacted. We will also put up well ahead directional signs
              and we have engaged auxiliary police and also traffic marshals to guide
              traffic."</p>
              <p>Besides Raffles Boulevard, other roads affected include
              Nicholl Highway, Stamford Road, St Andrew’s Road, Anderson Bridge,
              Esplanade Drive and Raffles Avenue.</p>
              <p>Some of the works will not
              affect motorists. One example is the floating platform. The Promenade
              area at the floating platform will be widened from 10 to 22 metres.</p>
              <p>Other
              changes include removing 89 seats from the structure to make way for a
              run—off area, which is a kind of safety allowance for the cars as they
              turn and connect back into Raffles Avenue.</p>
              <p>New roads will also be constructed next to the Singapore Flyer and the Pit building.</p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority said the biggest challenge is completing the necessary works in the short time available.</p>
              <p>To
              meet strict requirements set by the International Automobile Federation
              (FIA), the entire width of the track has to be laid, at one go, in one
              single operation to prevent what is known as cold’ joints or
              unevenness. This is unlike regular resurfacing works which can be done
              lane by lane.</p>
              <p>Resurfacing is the final phase of the road works. Others include removal of traffic islands.</p>
              <p>Despite
              the tight deadline, work is expected to finish by 7 June and that is
              when the LTA will hand over the project to the F1 organisers. — CNA/vm</p>
