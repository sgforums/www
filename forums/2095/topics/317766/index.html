              <p><strong>LTA Introduces New Initiatives To Enhance Road Safety</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1. Motorists and pedestrians alike will benefit from a series
              of new initiatives to enhance road safety, as outlined in the recently unveiled
              Land Transport Masterplan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2. The four initiatives, namely the 'enhanced pedestrian
              crossing lines', 'pedestrian crossing ahead markings', 'traffic calming
              markings' and 'your speed sign', have been implemented at selected locations to
              test their effectiveness. This is part of LTA's continual efforts to make our
              roads safer for all users. If found to be effective, the pilot initiatives will
              be implemented at more sites. (Please refer to <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/Road_Safety_AnnexA_FINAL.pdf">Annex
              A</a> for details.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enhanced Pedestrian Crossing Lines (EPCL)</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3. Dashed lines, instead of a continuous straight line, have
              been implemented at selected pedestrian crossings, to make the designated
              crossing more obvious. Motorists have been observed to overshoot the continuous
              white stop line and sometimes even encroach into the designated pedestrian
              crossing, thus endangering pedestrians. Currently, about 20% of vehicles have
              been observed to overshoot the stop line.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4. If the pilot is successful, LTA would consider implementing
              the initiative island-wide at all signalised pedestrian crossings. Driver
              behaviour will be surveyed during the pilot to monitor the effectiveness of the
              dashed lines. This initiative has also been implemented in cities such as
              Brisbane, Australia and London, United Kingdom, where it has shown good results.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pedestrian Crossing Ahead Markings (PCAM)</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5. Motorists have been observed not to give way to pedestrians
              at zebra crossings that are located after a bend, despite advance warnings
              provided by existing safety features such as signboards, zig-zag lines and
              flashing beacons with black/yellow poles on site.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6. The proposed Pedestrian Crossing Ahead Markings are one
              form of advanced road markings used to enhance the safety of pedestrians at
              zebra crossings. The markings are similar to 'Give Way' signs as they are
              triangular in shape and are marked in white for heightened visibility. They come
              in pairs, with the second marking serving as a reminder in case motorists miss
              the first PCAM.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7. If the pilot is successful, the markings would be
              implemented at locations where motorists have reduced visibility due to curves
              or bends in the road.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Traffic Calming Markings (TCM)</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">8. 'Traffic calming markings' consist of a series of paired
              white triangles which gives motorists the impression that the road is narrower.
              They serve as traffic calming markings to slow motorists down and complement
              existing traffic calming measures such as slow markings, humps and speed
              regulating strips.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">9. The Cornwall County Council and Scotland in the UK use
              similar markings which are usually applied along rural roads before speed change
              gateways. Research by Transportation Research Laboratory (TRL) has proven that
              such markings are effective in reducing the mean speeds of vehicles by 8 to 11
              kph.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">10. LTA plans to extend the measure to locations where there
              are recurrent speeding problems, if the pilot is successful.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Speed Sign (YSS)</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">11. Your Speed Sign' is a dynamic electronic device that
              displays the real time speeds of vehicles and alerts motorists that they are
              speeding. It serves to encourage motorists to obey the speed limit displayed,
              thereby enhancing safety on the roads.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">12. In the past five years, the UK, USA and Korea have been
              using YSS and many of their before-and-after studies have shown positive results
              that such signs are effective in reducing motorists' speeds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pilot Initiatives</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">13. The LTA will monitor the pilot initiatives for a period of
              six months to evaluate their effectiveness. Before-and-after studies as well as
              perception surveys with motorists and road users will be carried out as part of
              the evaluation process.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">14. Dr Chin Kian Keong, Chief Engineer, Transportation, at
              LTA, said , "We hope that these new initiatives will make our roads even
              safer for users. However, even as we continue to improve the physical
              infrastructure, we want to encourage motorists to practise safe driving
              behaviour on our roads to ensure safety for all road users.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">15. Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police (DAC) Christopher
              Ng, Commander, Traffic Police (TP) said, "TP is pleased with the road
              engineering initiatives introduced and will continue to work together with LTA,
              through education, enforcement and engineering, to enhance the safety of road
              users."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">16. Members of the public may obtain information on all four
              pilot initiatives on the ONE.MOTORING website. Residents who live within 400m of
              the pilot locations will receive leaflets informing them of these initiatives.
              This is to help these residents be familiar with the new road markings and
              signs.</span></p>
