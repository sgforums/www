            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Cyclists in Tampines may soon be able to ride on footpaths legally, depending on the results of a study that will be conducted at the end of this month.<br><br>Other towns may also join in the ride if things go well.<br><br>The Traffic Police said having cyclists on footpaths is one way of lowering the number of road accidents.<br><br>James Ho, who rides his bicycle daily to do grocery shopping and to get to the MRT station, agreed with the insight.<br><br>He said: "On the roads, you'll have to worry about cars."<br><br>Tampines is chosen for the study because many of its residents ride bicycles and use it to get to places like the MRT station.<br><br>During the pilot study, cyclists can use the footpaths but must give way to pedestrians.<br><br>They need to ride on the left side of the footpath and get off when there are too many people using the same space.<br><br>Separately, the GRC wants to link up many parts of the town for cyclists in a five-year plan.<br><br>It formed a committee to look into the matter two years ago.<br><br>And although the pilot programme is for cyclists, pedestrians are not left out.<br><br>Irene Ng, MP of Tampines GRC, said: "It should be safer for pedestrians now. Without this pilot study, we could not have gone out with our cycling wardens and our promotion material to teach cyclists how to cycle."<br><br>The idea was hatched when the issue of riding on footpaths was raised in parliament two years ago.<br><br>The criteria to allow cyclists on footpaths includes the attitudes and behaviour of cyclists and pedestrians, accidents on footpaths and feedback from organisations in the GRC.<br><br>The study ends at the end of May 2008 and findings will be evaluated then.</div>

For example, if they say in certain areas the footpaths are a bit too narrow, then let's see whether we can expand the footpath a little bit."<br><br>Some 80 cycle wardens have been appointed to assist in the study so far. The plan is to have 150 cycle wardens eventually.<br><br>Potential cycle wardens will have to attend a half-day course to learn skills like how to wear a helmet properly and dismount. They will be placed around Tampines hotspots like schools and during peak hours.<br><br>Most residents are receptive to the initiative.<br><br>"It's a matter of public education. It's a social responsibility of everybody living in Tampines. If it is a once-off, it takes a lot more to inculcate this practice into the residents."<br><br>"By sample studies you can see how it works, then you can proceed on it."<br><br>Besides the footways initiative, Tampines residents also celebrated their town day with a host of other activities to bring residents closer as a community.<br><br>They were also given an update on the town's barrier-free access plans. - CNA/de</div>
