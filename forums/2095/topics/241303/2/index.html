              <p>And 29 people were arrested during the six—hour blitz at seven locations.</p>
              <p>There was no way out for drink drivers.</p>
              <p>One by one, the motorists were stopped by officers to check if they were fit to get behind the wheels.</p>
              <p>The
              six—hour operation started at 12.30am, with road blocks along Nicoll
              Highway, Maxwell Road, Keppel Road, Bishan Road and Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim.</p>
              <p>At 3am, more road blocks were set up in the Havelock and Outram area as part of the Traffic Police’s ring—fencing strategy.</p>
              <p>Superintendent
              Lee Chee Chiew, Deputy Commander of Traffic Police, said: "We have our
              road blocks conducted at all exit roads outside the cluster of popular
              drinking outlets ... our officers will check most of the vehicles, if
              not 100 percent of the vehicles, as they come out from these exit
              roads."</p>
              <p>During the operation, breathalyser tests were
              administered to 170 motorists. Twenty—nine of them failed the tests and
              were placed under arrest for drink driving.</p>
              <p>The highest breathalyser result clocked was more than twice the legal limit.</p>
              <p>Police say the suspects were aged between 20 and 45 years old. Three of them were women.</p>
              <p>The
              latest arrests bring the total number of drink drivers caught during
              the Lunar New Year period to 90. Sixty—one of them were nabbed between
              February 6 and 10.</p>
              <p>A motorist who passed the breathalyser test can still be charged for drink driving if he is unable to control his vehicle.</p>
              <p>Those convicted of drink driving will face severe penalties.</p>
              <p>First—time
              offenders can be fined up to $5,000 or jailed up to six months. Repeat
              offenders can be slapped with a mandatory jail term of up to three
              years.</p>
              <p>Drink drivers will also be disqualified from driving for at least 12 months and have their licences revoked.</p>
              <p>Police advise those who drink to take public transport or have a designated driver send them home. — CNA/de</p>

              </span></p><p>The Land Transport Authority will be upgrading the traffic
              signals to include Red-Amber-Green (RAG) traffic lights at the junction of
              Thomson Road / Moulmein Road / Newton Road on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>27 February 2008 from 10.30am</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>The RAG traffic lights will be installed to control right
              turning movement from Newton Road into Thomson Road. A lighted red arrow is a
              stop signal for motorists turning right, while a lighted amber arrow indicates
              that motorists must get ready to stop. A lighted green arrow indicates that
              motorists can proceed to turn right.</p>
              <p>CISCO personnel will be deployed to guide motorists and
              pedestrians during the modification works. Motorists are advised to drive
              carefully and to follow the instructions of the wardens when approaching the
              junction.</p>

              <p><strong>Road Re-Alignment At The Junction Of Raffles<br>Boulevard And Temasek Avenue</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1. A road re-alignment will be carried out at the junction of
              Temasek Avenue and Raffles Boulevard from Monday, 24 March 2008 at 1300 hours by
              LTA's contractor, Shimizu Corporation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2. This re-alignment exercise along Temasek Avenue is to
              facilitate the construction works of Downtown Line Stage 1 (DTL1) and will be
              for the duration of three years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3. With this re-alignment, motorists should travel along
              Temasek Boulevard at the "Fountain of Wealth" roundabout and turn left
              into Raffles Boulevard and Temasek Avenue to access into the entrance for
              Millenia Tower, Centennial Tower and the taxi bay area.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4. Affected motorists will also be able to access the same
              entrance when travelling on the opposite side of Temasek Avenue by taking a left
              turn into Raffles Boulevard, a right turn into Raffles Avenue, another right
              turn into Temasek Avenue and finally making a left turn into the entrance of the
              Millenia Tower.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5. All road users are advised to take caution while travelling
              along the affected stretch of Temasek Avenue Road. Prominent signs will be
              placed along the affected roads to guide motorists accordingly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6. LTA will continue to work closely with Shimizu to minimise
              inconveniences for commuters and road users alike. We seek the understanding and
              patience of all road users during this road diversion exercise.</span></p>
