              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Traffic Police to trial new cameras that detect illegal U-turns, vehicles stopping in yellow box junctions</span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A new traffic camera system capable of detecting multiple traffic offences at junctions will be tried out in June, Traffic Police (TP) said on Thursday (May 10).<br><br>The system uses a 3D laser scanner to track the movements of vehicles and automatically detect three types of offences: Illegal u-turns, vehicles turning in a non-turning lane and vehicles causing obstruction at yellow box junctions, it said.</p>
              <p>It will record the time of the violation, the lane the vehicle was travelling on and its registration plate.<br><br>The system, which can also detect multiple offences committed simultaneously, will be tested for three months at the junction of Thomson Road and Newton Road. The location sees heavy traffic and is prone to such violations, TP said.<br><br>No summons will be issued for offences detected by the system during the trial period.</p>
              <p>“These are violations that potentially can cause accidents, and we have seen such accidents happening at major junctions,” said TP commander Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police (SAC) Sam Tee.<br><br>“That causes concern and TP wants to use technology to remind and deter motorists from committing such violations.”<br><br>The system’s effectiveness in detering such offences will be evaluated after the trial period before deciding on next steps, SAC Tee said.<br><br>When asked if it will deploy the new system at other junctions, TP said it will adopt a risk-based approach, similar to how speed cameras are deployed on roads where speeding-related accidents have occured.<br><br>“We don’t have a specific timeline in mind, but quite certainly we want to deploy such technology,” SAC Tee added.<br><br>For this trial, the system comprises two cameras: One for detection and another for capturing. However, TP said it is still working on the final "form and shape" of the locally-developed system.<br><br>"There will be reminder signs when we deploy the enforcement cameras," TP added.<br><br>The offences of making an illegal U-turn and causing obstruction at a yellow box junction carry composition fines of S$70, while failing to form up correctly when turning left carries a S$130 fine and four demerit points.<br><br>"The new cameras (help) to shape motorists' behaviour so that we prevent accidents from happening," SAC Tee said.<br><br><strong>UPDATE ON AVERAGE SPEED CAMERAS</strong><br><br>TP also revealed that the average speed cameras, located along Tanah Merah Coast Road, will be operationalised in the fourth quarter of this year.<br><br>Twelve sets of cameras have been deployed along 4km of the road, where speeding was often seen, said TP. The road is also frequently used by heavy vehicles and cyclists.<br><br>These cameras use a two-point system to detect and compute the average speed of a vehicle as it enters and exits the enforcement zone. This means that motorists who resume speeding after passing the first camera still risk getting caught.</p>
              <p>TP said it tested the technology last year on Changi Coast Road, adding that it has been "very effective".<br><br>SAC Tee also confirmed that the average speed cameras will be installed at other locations. "TP is looking at it and at a suitable time we will share with the media our subsequent expansion plans," he said.<br><br>The two systems are the latest in TP's enforcement capabilities, which already include mobile speed cameras, fixed speed cameras and red light cameras.<br><br>"Can we have an all-in-one technology that can capture all (offences)? The answer is yes, I think," TP said. "But that is something we are still looking at."</p>
