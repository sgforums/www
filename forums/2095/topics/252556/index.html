            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Opening In May: New Road System In Marina Bay Area</strong><br><br>LTA has constructed a new road system to provide direct access from ECP into and out of the Marina Bay Area. This will facilitate traffic flow for construction activities in the area, such as the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort and the new Marina Bay Financial Centre developments. With this new road system these vehicles will not need to access the Marina Bay Area via the city roads, thus minimising adverse impact on city traffic and keeping city roads free of construction debris.<br><br>The new road system will be opened in 3 phases to enable LTA to construct the new access roads. It will be fully opened by end of May 2007.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">DETAILS OF THE PHASE-OPENING:</span></strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phase 1 A &amp; B</span><br><br>Under phase 1A, the existing exit to Marina South from ECP (AYE bound) has been shifted and opened on 28 April 2007. Phase 1 B, a new exit from Marina South into ECP (AYE bound) will be opened on 5 May 2007.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits:</span><br><br>With this new exit, motorists who want to head west from Marina South can use this direct access to ECP (towards AYE bound) instead of driving to Fort Road to make a "U-turn" to head towards ECP (AYE bound). This will shave off about 6 to 8 minutes of journey time and a reduction of about 8 km of distance travelled for motorists.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phase 2 A &amp; B</span><br><br>Under phase 2 A, Marina Station Road will be re-aligned on 5 May 2007 while the existing Maxwell Road slip road into ECP will be realigned under phase 2 B on 12 May 2007.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phase 3A</span>:<br><br>Under phase 3 A, a new exit No. 17 from ECP (Changi bound) into Marina Station Road will be opened on 19 May 2007. The link road to serve IR will also be opened for use on the same day.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits</span>:<br><br>With this new exit, heavy construction vehicles coming from the west will have direct access into the Marina Bay Area from ECP without the need to enter CBD via Anson Road and Maxwell Road.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phase 3B</span>:<br><br>In phase 3 B, Central and Marina Boulevard will be opened to traffic on 31 May 2007. At the same time, existing Marina Station Road between Marina Street and Central Boulevard will also be converted into 2-way flow.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits</span>:<br><br>The opening of the New Road System will provide direct access for construction vehicles to enter or exit the Marina Bay Area, thus keeping construction traffic away from the CBD area. This will minimize adverse impact on city traffic, especially during peak hours.<br><br>It is projected that more than 21 million tonnes of construction material will be transported as a result of the developments in Marina Bay Area over the next three years. At the height of construction, about 5,000 trips is required daily to transport the material that consists of aggregate, sand and excavated spoils for the construction projects.<br><br>With this new road network, heavy construction vehicles will not need to use city roads and signs will be placed to alert them not to enter the city area.<br><br>By 2012, part of this new road system will be gradually replaced by the permanent road system under the Master Plan 2003.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">ERP GANTRY TO BE SET UP ALONG CENTRAL BOULEVARD TO CLOSE OFF CBD CORDON</span></strong><br><br>To maintain the CBD ERP cordon, the ERP gantry at Central Boulevard near its junction with Raffles Quay, will be operational once the Central Boulevard is opened to traffic on 31 May 2007, as part of the new road system at Marina Bay Area. Motorists using Central Boulevard to enter the CBD via Raffles Quay, will continue to be charged for entering the CBD ERP cordon, as before, and at the same rates.<br></div>
