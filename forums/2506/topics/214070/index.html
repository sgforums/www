            <div class='col-md body'>Taking a screenshot (a.k.a. Screen Capture) is a relatively simple process, and it can be quite helpful to know how to take one. You can take pictures of anything, from completing a tough quest, to leveling one of your skills up and more. Of course, it's different to take a screenshot in each operating system.<br><br>Instructions For...<br><br>Windows<br>Macintosh<br>Quickshot (software)<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Using Windows<br><br>(1) Taking The Screenshot<br><br>Press the Print Scrn key on your keyboard. It can be found above the Insert key and to the right of the F12 key. Anything on the screen is now in the computer's memory, or the 'Clipboard.'<br><br>Hint: A key combination of Alt + Print Scrn will take a screenshot of only the current window, making cropping of your new picture much easier!<br><br>Warning: you CAN'T take another screenshot, or copy anything (using cut and paste) at this point! The screenshot has been saved into your computer's temporary memory, and it will be deleted if you copy anything, take another screenshot or turn your computer off!<br><br>(2) The Picture<br><br>Open up Paint or another graphics program like Photoshop or PaintShop Pro, and paste it by pressing Ctrl+V.<br><br>(3) Cropping<br><br>Cropping is very important! Most of the time, you only want a specific part of the game screen, or maybe even the entire game screen. Crop out anything you don't need, like the side menus (unless you need it). You will need to use the selection tool in Paint to select the part you want, press Ctrl+C to copy it, Ctrl+N to make a new page, and then Ctrl+V to paste it into a new document. Other programs have tools to crop and add effects that you can use.<br><br>In paint, you want to select the marquee tool, in the top left hand corner of the toolbax (in red):<br><br>Then just select whatever part of your picture you want, press Ctrl + C to copy it, press Ctrl + N to clear the excess part of the picture, and then paste what you copied with Ctrl + V.<br><br>(4) Saving Your New Screenshot<br><br>You can't forget this part! you need to save your new, editted screenshot<br><br>Since .bmp (a.k.a. bitmap) images are big and 'unfriendly' to the web, you should save it as a .gif or .png to make it smaller. In Paint, select the format you want to save in from the 'type' menu, and then type in a name with the same extension (.gif or .png).<br><br>Why not save it as a .jpg? - Well, .jpg's are actually meant for photos, like the ones you take with a camera. They aren't meant for computer generated art due to the wide range of colors (and most computer art is pixelized). Of course, you can still save screenshots as a .jpg, but there is generally more distortion and a larger file size.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Using Macintosh<br><br>Press the key combination of Shift+Command (apple)+3. The apple key can be found betweent the Alt key and the Spacebar key.<br>Depending on your system, it may be saved as a different file type:<br>In Mac OS 10.x, a PDF file with your picture in it will be saved to the desktop. You need to open it, choose Export from the File menu, then choose a new format to save it as. then click Save.<br>In Mac OS 9.x and below, it should just be an image file saved on your desktop.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Imageshack Quickshot<br><br>ImageShack Quickshot is a small program that allows you to easily take screenshots without having to go through each of the above steps (paste, crop, and save) before being able to take another one. It's a very useful tool, especially if you find youself annoyed with having to individually save each and every one of your screenshots, one at a time.<br><br>Some of the benefits of this program are:<br><br>You can set your own hotkeys to save and upload your screenshots automatically.<br>Saves each screenshot in a format defined by you (png or jpg) - no need to stop your game and save them anymore!<br>You can take a fullscreen picture, or just a screenshot of your currently open window.<br>You can get Quickshot from the ImageShack website<br></div>
