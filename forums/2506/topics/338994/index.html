              <p>Movario licked his dry, cracked lips, not taking his eyes off the
              ancient book in front of him. His hand, acting almost like a separate
              entity, scratched spidery notes onto parchment. He knew who V was, but
              the references to the stone intrigued him. Fragmentary thoughts were
              gathering, forming up together into something important – but something
              was missing, some key detail. With trembling fingers he turned the
              yellowed page.</p>
              <p>“The stone was clearly not of this world...”</p>
              <p>A triumphant scratch of Movario's quill tore through the parchment.
              That was it! After all this time his research was finally bearing
              fruit!</p>
              <p>The antiquated surroundings of the temple afforded little warmth,
              and the only luxury was the lone, guttering candle by which he read.
              The chill still reached inside, but it did not register for Movario as
              his unyielding research ground on through the days.</p>

              <p>The Quick Chat menu wasn’t showing some of the minigames available
              to play when trying to organise a group. This issue has been resolved.</p>
              <p>You will now find that entering the chaos portal in the Dagon'Hai
              caves works with an omni-talisman. The omni-staff and -tiara were fine,
              but this one was missed and has now been added accordingly.</p>
              <p>The abyssal parasite familiar will now prevent your Prayer from
              being drained when teleporting into the abyss, exactly as it's supposed
              to.</p>
              <p>Free players who had started the recent Hallowe’en quest, <em>Swept Away</em>,
              but managed to misplace their broom couldn’t chat to Maggie to get
              another. Rest assured, Wendy is now ready to send you to Maggie who
              will replace your broom should you lose it again.</p>
