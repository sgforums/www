              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Living Room</span></strong></p>
              <p>Care for your sofa by getting fixed cover fabric sets professionally cleaned at least once a year. To prevent colour variation in removable covers, be sure to clean them all at the same time. When vacuuming, ensure upholstery or drape attachments are used so as to reduce abrasive effects. Remember to blot up spills immediately but avoid using detergents!</p>
              <p>Aside from regular vacuuming, flip your rug &amp; pat it down before vacuuming its back to dislodge stubborn particles. Avoid shaking it as it can damage your rug. To prevent wearing the rug pile unevenly, remember to rotate it once in a while.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bedroom</span></strong></p>
              <p>Flip &amp; rotate your mattress once a month, and always have a protective cover over it. For parents with young kids, opt for a vinylcover to protect your mattress from all kinds of spillage.</p>
              <p>Pillow &amp; mattress protectors extend the life of your pillows &amp; mattresses. Plus, clean protectors keep allergens at bay, so ensure they are washed frequently! The right fit &amp; size of protectors can lengthen the lifespan as well.</p>
              <p>Fluff your comforter frequently to keep its shape. Ensure that your comforter is thoroughly dry after a wash by keeping it out in the sun for a day at least.</p>
              <p>Thread count is one measure of fabric quality. Standard cotton thread count is around 150 per square inch, while good quality sheet start at 180. We often see the word "percale" when buying bedding products. The term simply means that the cotton is combed throughly to remove knots, resulting in linen that is softer to the touch.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kitchen</span></strong></p>
              <p>Using Teflon cookware is as easy as its maintenance. "Condition" your pan with a thin coat of cooking oil before 1st use. Always use heat resistance plastic or wooden spatula. Cook at medium to low cooking temperatures because Teflon coated cookware heats evenly. Do not wash Teflon cookware while it is still hot, wait till it has cooled. Wash with soapy water &amp; soft sponge after each use.</p>
              <p>Shiny pans reflect the heat &amp; are your best choice for cake baking. They slow the browning process, making it ideal for soft-crust breads. Bakeware with a dull-finish &amp; glass baking dishes absorb more heat &amp; brown crusts more quickly, making them good for cookies, cakes &amp; crusty breads.</p>
              <p>Prevent drinkware breakage by not stacking your glasses nor putting drinkware in the mircowave. Take good care of your water pitchers by using them for cold beverages only. Avoid sudden temperature changes. Don't pour boiling liquid into water pitchers nor rinse them with hot water immediately after they have been used for cold beverages.</p>
              <p>When storing leftovers, shielding them from air is essential. Instead of covering a bowl with foil or cling-wrap, transfer your leftovers into an airtight food storage container to keep them fresh for as long as possible.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bathroom</span></strong></p>
              <p>Over time, calcium deposits cab form on shower heads. Place a bag of heated vinegar around the showerhead &amp; watch the calcium dissolve.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Laundry Room</span></strong></p>
              <p>Keep a selection of hangers in different sizes. They will be useful for clothes with neck holes of varying sizes. You can create more storage space with organisers such as closet pockets. Make use of the space behind doors by storing small items such as socks &amp; accessories in closet pockets.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Store Room</span></strong></p>
              <p>With smaller homes today, space is a big issue for many. Get hold of storage boxes to keep your home tidy &amp; organised. Opt for clear or translucent ones so that it is easy to see the contents within each.</p>
              <p>A silicon gun is a handy tool in the house. Use it to seal the gaps around tubs &amp; sinks, as well as crevices in doors or walls before painting them to obtain a smooth finish.</p>
