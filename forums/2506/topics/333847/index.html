              <p><strong>15 October 2008 - Improvements to the game log-in process</strong></p>
              <p>Today we’ve streamlined the way you get into the game. The aim is to
              help you get playing more quickly with fewer pages to go through every
              time. To start the game, simply click one of the two new buttons on the
              front page (depending on whether you’re a free player or a member). You
              will then be taken straight into the game. Once the game has loaded,
              you will be able to (optionally) choose both your world and detail
              level directly from the title screen.</p>
              <p>More details on the changes made:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>World selection has now been moved entirely in game</strong>, so there is one less page to go through to start the game and you can get playing faster.
              <br><br> </li>
              <li>We’ve had a world switcher in-game for a while, but since it
              is now the main way of choosing your world, it was time for an upgrade.
              The in-game world switcher now shows lots of extra information,
              including suggested activities for various worlds. </li>
              <li><strong>Automatic world selection.</strong> Just press 'Log in' on the
              title screen, and the game will automatically choose a suitable world
              for you. If you want to play on a specific world, just choose it from
              the world switcher first, and then press 'Log in'.
              <br><br> </li>
              <li><strong>Favourite worlds.</strong> The in-game world switcher now lets
              you select up to 2 worlds as your favourites. For example, you could
              set one favourite as your non-PvP homeworld and one as your PvP battle
              world. Once you have set up your favourite worlds from the world
              switcher, you will see extra buttons for them directly on the title
              screen, you can then click on those buttons to go straight to your
              favourite world.
              <br><br> </li>
              <li><strong>Members see less adverts.</strong> Because of the above changes,
              we’ve been able to remove adverts for members playing on free worlds –
              we hope you enjoy the change!
              <br><br> </li>
              <li><strong>The detail selection option has also been moved into the game.</strong> Again, this means there is one less page to go through to start the
              game, and gets you playing faster. This also means that you can now
              switch modes more easily without having to reload the game. The game
              will remember your last selection, so you no longer have to keep making
              the same choice over and over again.
              <br><br> </li>
              <li><strong>The 'safe mode' feature is now automatic.</strong> If your game
              fails to load for any reason, it will detect the failure the next time
              you load it, and automatically activate safe mode. If you want to force
              safe mode, then you can still do so by pressing the 's' key on your
              keyboard while the game is loading. Safe mode has also now been
              adjusted to only make the minimum changes needed to get the title
              screen to load: if you want to change any other options you should do
              so yourself from the 'Graphics Options' menu on the title screen before
              logging in. Your choices will then be remembered for next time.
              <br><br> </li>
              <li><strong>Unsigned mode is automatic.</strong> We’ve removed the
              ‘unsigned’ option from the Java options menu. Don’t worry, you can
              still access the unsigned applet if you need to. We’ve made the
              selection process for it automatic. If the game cannot load in signed
              mode (either because you didn’t grant it permission, or your security
              settings do not allow you to grant it permission) it will fall back to
              the unsigned version, you don’t need to do anything for this to happen. </li>
