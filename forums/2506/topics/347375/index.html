              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
              <p>I'd like to introduce myself to you all. My name is Mark Gerhard and
              I am the new CEO of Jagex, the makers of RuneScape. I have been
              fortunate enough to have worked at Jagex for some time now and consider
              us to be first and foremost a games developer. We’re driven by teams
              that not only care passionately about games but also actively enjoy
              playing the games we create. We are going to be making a number of
              improvements to the game, I'm also keen to clear up a few
              misconceptions about RuneScape at the same time and I also believe
              there are a few things we have done wrong in the past that I want to
              apologise for.</p>
              <p>To start off with, we want to be more open and listen to our
              players. Some of you may consider Jagex a secretive and closed-off
              company which isn't how we want to be perceived moving forward. Unlike
              most other companies, it just isn't our style to spend our time self
              marketing or shouting about how great we are, we prefer to just get on
              with it and make cool games, but that doesn't mean we don't listen to
              what you have to say.</p>
              <p>A good example of this is that a lot of free players told us they
              found our video adverts before the game annoying to the point it was
              putting them off playing, so we've scrapped them with immediate effect.
              We now appreciate that it can be frustrating having to sit through a
              video advert when you just want to play RuneScape, so we have to put
              our hands up to admit we made a mistake and say that we're sorry. To be
              completely candid with you, video adverts generate significantly more
              revenue than other adverts, but as one of our fundamental philosophies
              is that having fun is more important to us than making as much money as
              possible, we have removed video adverts from the game.</p>
              <p>We are also planning to change the way we communicate with you. We
              are going to be bringing back Development Diaries but making them more
              regular and focused on some of the different projects we're currently
              working on for you. These will replace Behind the Scenes, which we have
              found a creative constraint on our developers as the promised content
              has to come out as communicated in order to avoid disappointment and
              prevented us from surprising you with better or different content. It
              has also led to compromises in quality that we've not been happy with
              and, most importantly, pieces of content being released which you, our
              players, have not enjoyed as much as you should. A side benefit of this
              is that we'll be releasing more content which will be a complete
              surprise to you, so keep your eyes peeled for updates!</p>
              <p>We'd also like to clear up a few issues surrounding the free game.
              RuneScape is different from all other MMOs in that the free game has an
              epic amount of content (we'd estimate over 2,000 hours worth to get all
              your skills up to 99 and complete all the quests) and isn't merely a
              demo for the members’ version. If anything, we see the members’ version
              as an expansion pack for those that really love the game and we feel
              both games are substantive in their own right. I want to apologise for
              habitually over-promoting the benefits of membership to our free
              players. I strongly believe if you love the free game you will equally
              love the members’ content and that is sufficient promotion to me. If
              you can't enjoy the free game in its own right then we're not doing our
              jobs properly. We will continue to improve the free game and,
              crucially, make it as fun as possible because we know that this is the
              way that everyone first discovers RuneScape.</p>
              <p>We also have a long-term commitment to improving all the aspects of
              the game – from overall graphical enhancements through to new gameplay
              mechanics.</p>
              <p>Another thing that has cropped up in recent times, which we'd like
              to clear up once and for all, is the common belief that RuneScape is a
              game aimed at kids. This is absolutely not the case. We can see how
              this view has fostered, however, thanks to our over-zealous chat
              filter, Quick Chat worlds, “dumbing down” of certain bits of humour and
              storylines, as well as certain areas of the game like the Stronghold of
              Security, which do provide solid security advice but perhaps come
              across as a little condescending to the vast majority of our older
              players. I unreservedly apologise for this and to rectify this we have
              already removed a number of words from the chat filter and are
              currently working on reviewing and amending any content we feel is too
              kid-focused.</p>
              <p>RuneScape benefits from one of the most diverse player demographics
              in the industry and is truly reflective of the worldwide population. As
              a responsible company we have had to comply with certain regulatory
              obligations to ensure online safety for any younger players and as a
              result we introduced Quick Chat for players under a certain age, but
              this was to meet our legal responsibilities rather than who the game is
              designed for, it’s probably also worth noting that we have a total of 4
              Quick Chat worlds in a total of 165 RuneScape worlds. As I said
              earlier, we are gamers at heart and we try to design games and content
              which we ourselves would enjoy playing. I’m an active RuneScape player
              and I’m ever so slightly over 21 :)</p>
              <p>We are also committed to working with our fans in the RuneScape
              community to make the game a more enjoyable place to be. We will be
              running community events, tournaments and JMod participation in-game to
              provide more support to you and make RuneScape an even better place to
              be.</p>
              <p>To kick things off in this new era of openness I'm going to be
              answering your questions. For the next week we will open a thread in
              the News and Announcements forum for questions, and in a week’s time I
              will post answers to a selection of your questions. So please feel free
              to drop-in and ask a question or tell me what you think of the game.</p>
              <p>Have fun!</p>
