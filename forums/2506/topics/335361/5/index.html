              <p><br>Yah.....remember I was going out to play with the USN ships....?</p>
              <p>Well on our first try in the morning, we managed to go as far as 100m from the wharf when something unimagineable and catastrophic happened and we made an emergency return to the wharf and docked again.</p>
              <p>We could not resolve that problem and on our 2nd attempt in the afternoon, we got as far as 5 miles out of base when something else went wrong and we plonked our anchor just off Changi as a result and stayed there till midnight before returning to base.</p>

              <p>For myself I was in the steering gear compartment monitoring the system for anomalies....</p>
              <p>When I saw the warning on the screen: Bow thruster hydraulic pressure very low. I made a brief mention to the IC but both of us thought it was ok....after all we're talking about a troublesome ship. And control had left the bridge suddenly minutes before causing quite a hooha so we thought nothing of it.</p>
              <p>Then as I checked the heading and bow thruster and steering gear status and our speed, I got quite a shock.</p>
              <p>We were moving at 1 knot, the rudders were at 30 deg starboard. Obviously at that speed the rudders won't work. But the headings were increasing rapidly to starboard indicating we're turning by other means. So I checked the bow thruster status and I was surprised....it was off!</p>
              <p>It was easy to tell already by then, I rushed to the next room and informed the IC something was wrong with the bow thruster. And sure enough, the hooha came in 2 min and we went back to the wharf.</p>
              <p>Heng that day I was pulled out of the berthing party at the forward part of the ship.....it was there that the trouble was. Back at harbour I couldn't believe my eyes...it was a freakin 10" rope stuck fast between the bollard and the bow thruster. Kicking it proved beyond doubt it was extremely taut.</p>
              <p>The officers who didn't know it was a monster rope we're talking about were initially optimistic there were no damages. But obvious that rope was no ordinary rope....it managed to actually warp the proppeler!</p>
