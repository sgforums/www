              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>[Runescape &gt; PayByCash &gt; MOLPoints] - Why this payment 
                  method?</strong></span><br><br>- PayBySMS is very expensive. ($18.00 / 
                  month). At the same time, PayBySMS does not work on prepaid SIM, thus 
                  not many youngsters can pay through this method.<br><br>- By using 
                  MOLPoints method, it saves about $5.00 to $6.00 a month as compared to 
                  PayBySMS.<br><br>- So far, this is the only "Prepaid Card" method to pay
                   for Runescape membership. Thus, almost everyone, including youngsters 
                  can subscribe for Runescape members easily.<br><br>- Most youngsters do 
                  not have an ATM card. They only have cash (probably using their pocket 
                  money). Thus, players who only uses cash can use this payment method to 
                  purchase for Runescape membership easily.<br><br>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How
                   to pay for Runescape membership (1 Month):</strong></span><br><br>Note: 
                  This payment method is only for Singapore players ONLY. It is 
                  recommended to turn off Pop-up blocker when using this method.<br><br>This
                   subscription method is a "One-Off" payment method. Thus, there is no 
                  need to cancel your membership if all your membership credit is used up.
                   This means, your account will automatically become free-to-play status 
                  if your membership credit becomes zero. To re-subscribe simply do the 
                  following steps below to renew your membership.<br><br>Before we get 
                  this started, you must have a MOL account. If you do not have one, you 
                  can create one for free at <a id="link_9" rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.mol.com/">http://sg.mol.com/</a>. <br>You will need
                   this account to top up money (via Prepaid Card) and also to make 
                  payment for Runescape membership.<br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First Step (MOL -
                   Money Online):</strong></span><br><br>1 - Create MOL account at <a id="link_10" rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.mol.com/">http://sg.mol.com/</a>.
                   IMPORTANT! Make sure you are in "MOL Singapore" Portal!<br>(Skip this 
                  step if you already have MOL account.)<br><br><br>2 - Purchase MOLPoints
                   prepaid card from the retail stores and top up money into your MOL 
                  account. (You can use AXS Stations to top up if you have an ATM card)<br><br>List
                   of available prepaid cards:<br><br>Prepaid Cards ---------- Price (With
                   GST Included)<br>$10 Prepaid Card ------ $10.70<br>$20 Prepaid Card 
                  ------ $21.40<br>$50 Prepaid Card ------ $53.50<br>$100 Prepaid Card 
                  ---- $107.00 <br><br>Refer to this link for the list of retailers 
                  selling this prepaid card.<br><a id="link_11" rel="nofollow" href="http://global.mol.com/sg/portal/en/wtg_MOLepoints_retailers.aspx">http://global.mol.com/sg/portal/en/wtg_MOLepoints_retailers.aspx</a><br><br><br>3
                   - If this is your first time paying for Runescape membership (1 month) 
                  using this method, It is recommended to buy and top up $20.00 to your 
                  account. <br><br>The 1 month membership costs you about $11.00 to $13.00
                   depending on the currency rates. This is why you need to top up $20.00 
                  to your account in order to cover the cost of the 1 month membership.<br><br>(After
                   you paid for your 1 month membership, you will have about $7.00 ++ 
                  remaining in your account. The next time you need to re-subscribe again 
                  for 1 month, you just need to buy $10.00 card as the previous balance of
                   $7.00 ++ in your account will cover the cost for your next 
                  subscription.)<br><br><br>4 - After topping up the required amount into 
                  your MOL account (Using MOL Prepaid cards or AXS Stations), you are done
                   for the first step.<br><br><br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

                  method. However, please wait for about 3 days before contacting them if 
                  your Runescape account has not been activated after you made your 
                  payment to PayByCash.<br><br>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Summary:
                   How this payment system works</strong></span><br><br>Many players asked 
                  why Runescape is not listed inside MOL games list. This is because, 
                  MOLPoints payment method is <strong>NOT</strong> a direct payment to 
                  Runescape. The MOLPoints payment has to go through PayByCash for 
                  processing. Once PayByCash receives the payment, PayByCash will process 
                  and communicate the payment to Jagex (Runescape) for membership 
                  activation.<br><br>Basically after all the above explanation, you do not
                   see "Runescape" inside MOL games list. However, you will see 
                  "PayByCash" inside MOL games list instead.<br><br>Here is the summary of
                   how the payment method works:<br><br>- You make your MOLPoints payment 
                  to PayByCash<br>- PayByCash receives the payment from MOLPoints and 
                  thus, communicated the payment to Jagex (Runescape)<br>- Jagex 
                  (Runescape) acknowledges it and activate your subscription.<br><br>In 
                  Summary, this method is an indirect way of paying for Runescape 
                  membership.<br><br>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
