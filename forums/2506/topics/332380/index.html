              <p>October is traditionally a month of scary surprises and toothache.
              This month will be no different when it comes to our Hallowe’en
              content, with a quest AND holiday event both to be available on the
              free servers. For scary surprises: how about entire worlds where you
              can PK and hunt other players to your heart’s content? That’s right,
              PvP worlds are coming! But first, a few words about how we’re going to
              update RuneScape in the future.</p>
              <p>During the last six months we’ve been reading through the forums,
              talking to you in-game and running polls on the sorts of updates you
              really want. It doesn’t take a genius to realise that it’s the bigger,
              chunkier updates that really get you excited, those like the God Wars
              Dungeon or a new skill. These are the sorts of updates we found that
              you wanted to play. Updates that you want to go back to time and time
              again.</p>
              <p>So, starting from this month, we’re changing the way we release
              content. From now on you’ll see one massive “headline update” (such as
              a Recipe for Disaster or a Castle Wars) every month. On top of that,
              there will still be a secondary release, much more like the size of
              update you’re used to right now. We’re also still committed to making
              sure that no two weeks pass without something new.</p>
              <p>Basically, from now on our releases will be like this:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Four week months will have two updates: one big headline release and a secondary one.</li>
              <li>Five week months will have three updates: one big headline release and two secondary ones.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>So, on to this month’s updates...</p>
              <p><strong>PvP Worlds</strong></p>
              <p>Ever found yourself wanting to say, “Look, it’s my tree. If you
              don’t stop chopping it...I’ll chop you!” Sounds cool, right? Yeah, but
              where could you do it? And when? The answers are PvP worlds and October!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From log-in, those that are interested in PvP content will be
              able to join in on special PvP worlds. The danger on these worlds will
              be very clear from the first messages you see, ensuring that players
              never log onto these worlds by mistake. After all, we don’t want
              players accidentally getting involved with PKing (player killing) if
              they don’t want to. Normal, non-PvP worlds will still act just as they
              do now, so don’t worry if bashing others isn’t really your thing.</p>
              <p>Those that want to get involved will find a number of differences to
              the usual set-up on PvP worlds. Firstly, you’ll be able to fight people
              pretty much anywhere, so long as their Combat level is similar to yours
              (within a certain range of levels). This means that almost everywhere
              is dangerous. Some places, like banks and respawn points, will be
              deemed “safe” and no combat will be able to occur there, and some of
              the minigames will be disabled (you won’t be able to PK team mates
              while playing Castle Wars, for example) but many will still be active.
              Other places, like Falador, Varrock and the entirety of the Wilderness,
              will be considered “hot spots” where the danger will be even greater
              and a higher concentration of opponents.</p>
              <p>Now, onto the money side of things. Many of you will be aware of the
              RWT (real-world trading of RuneScape gold for money) reasons we changed
              the old Wilderness. We certainly can’t just bring that threat back to
              RuneScape, so we have devised a system that rewards players based on a
              variety of factors. This means that things such as risk, level of foe
              and location will help to calculate rewards. Drops will be determined
              by a combination of drop tables and some of the gear that your opponent
              drops. We will go into more depth about this on the day of release.</p>
              <p><strong>Hallowe'en</strong></p>
              <p>As well as changing things around with the headline updates, we also
              decided to change the way we do things with our holiday events. We
              wanted to make the most of the little bits of fun we have every year,
              and give the free-to-play game a taste of the content we release in the
              members’ world. This year, we will be releasing a Hallowe’en-themed
              quest as well as the traditional holiday event. This quest will be
              available to our free players for the two weeks around Hallowe’en,
              along with the holiday event itself, and members will be able to play
              the quest at any time (the normal holiday event will disappear after
              two weeks as usual). What’s it about? Well, you’ll have to wait and
              see, but expect some funky decorations to start appearing.</p>
              <p>Spooky player letters and artwork will also await those strong of stomach...so be prepared.</p>

              <p><strong>
              </strong></p><h3><strong>Updates being released after October</strong></h3><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p>In case that little lot isn’t enough for you, let’s take a few
              moments to talk about the headline content we’re releasing in the
              months after October:</p>
              <p><strong>Stealing Creation</strong></p>
              <p>Not long to wait now for this crazy combination for skillers and
              PKers. Can you and your team work together capturing resources and
              equipping your warriors? Will you avoid the multitude of threats
              bearing down on your safe haven? Will you try to make your own way to
              the higher level gear, or will you just PK and destroy your opponents’
              hard work? Will you be able to keep the enemy at bay while stealing
              creation?</p>
              <p><strong>Mobilising Armies</strong></p>
              <p>Ever fancied assaulting a castle with your very own army? You will
              be able to hire a mercenary force to battle against three other
              players, complete set objectives and earn rewards. Mobilising Armies
              will be a fast paced tactical minigame allowing you to control your
              very own RuneScape army with troops made up of humans and other races.
              There will also be some special effects including dive bombing gnomes
              and giant catapults. Will you be up to the challenge?</p>
              <p>Have fun!</p>

              <p><strong>3 November 2008 - Behind the Scenes - November</strong></p>
              <p>We've written a lot about combat-orientated multiplayer content in
              RuneScape recently. This mostly focused on the way that it had been
              relegated to the sidelines, until the introduction of PvP worlds
              invited it back into the heart of the game. There's one aspect,
              however, that we haven't mentioned: its relationship with
              skill-orientated multiplayer content.</p>
              <p>We felt that producing a piece of content, which would appeal both
              to those players who prefer combat and those who prefer non-combat
              skills, was a major challenge for us. So, we put our thinking caps on
              and the result is this month’s headline update: 'Stealing Creation'.
              Stealing Creation will be a new 'safe' minigame, where teams of players
              work together to control resources across the game area. This area will
              change each time the game is played, so you will need to keep your
              tactics varied.</p>
              <p>The game will focus on collecting 'sacred clay', thought to be the
              building blocks used by gods to create worlds. You'll enter the
              minigame with nothing, which means you'll need to use your skills to
              gather resources and make the equipment you need to dominate the game.
              For those of you who are just as happy making swords as you are using
              them, it will offer lots of choice as to the kind of experience you
              want to have playing the game. But what of the pure skillers? Can you
              create equipment for your battling buddies while they defend your back?
              Can those doing the fighting rely on someone else to make them
              powerful? With the added ability to fight as a clan, battles can be
              organised for very specific groups of players. So, if you want to
              gather with your clan buddies to take on your enemies, you will be able
              to.</p>
              <p>Speaking of enemies, Zamorak was once mortal like the rest of us,
              but through clever manipulation and some devious planning he became
              revered as a god in Gielinor. The god wars that followed brought about
              great destruction and change – it would be impossible to do that now,
              wouldn’t it? What does it take for something like that to happen?
              Gathering some of the most important artefacts and keenest minds to
              research them would be a good start...but that is bound to attract
              attention, isn’t it?</p>
              <p>That’s where our November quest will join things. Specialists and
              concerned dignitaries will be gathered to discuss the whereabouts of
              the Staff of Armadyl, an ancient and powerful artefact from RuneScape’s
              distant past. All they will need is a willing adventurer to conduct the
              more interesting parts of the...investigation. Will this link to the
              mysterious dragonkin symbols found recently, or the rumours of the
              dragon forge? While Guthix sleeps through the centuries, treachery is
              afoot, and terrible dangers appear on the horizon. In our first
              Grandmaster quest ever, with the longest, deepest storyline we have
              ever attempted, it will take an expert adventurer to find out.</p>
              <p>Finally, after that huge update will come something much, much
              smaller! For a few days over the last weekend of November, you’ll
              notice Thanksgiving turkeys wandering around the map, gobbling and
              generally minding their own business. Hunt them down for some tasty
              drumsticks or find the turkeys in disguise for a special reward. Look
              out for more short celebration updates like this in the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">
              <h3>Updates after November</h3>
              <p><strong>The Phoenix</strong></p>
              <p>Some months ago, we asked you to vote on the next Summoning familiar,
              and you chose the phoenix. There were some great discussions on the
              forums taking the idea far beyond what we had originally imagined, so
              we decided to expand the idea out to another 'Distraction and
              Diversion' similar to the Shooting Star update or Bork from the Chaos
              Tunnels. You’ll find this update (planned for early next year) features
              not only a new Summoning creature and a repeatable activity, but also a
              quest!</p>
              <p><strong>Mobilising Armies</strong></p>
              <p>With any tactical game you need to spend a long time fine-tuning its
              different aspects to try to make it as fair, balanced and fun as
              possible. Mobilising Armies, our headline update for December, is no
              different and we have been working hard to tweak the key scenarios for
              this: Conflict, Siege, Hoard and Rescue. We'll have more on this update
              in next month's Behind the Scenes but in the meantime we have another
              screenshot for you.</p>
