              <p><strong>Combat Change:</strong></p>
              <p>First on our critical ticklist was the multiway aspect of Bounty Hunter. Occasionally, solo players would walk into Bounty Hunter and be ambushed by huge clans who they didn't stand a chance against.</p>
              <p>This was not what we intended to happen, therefore, we have tweaked the rules so multiway combat can only be used in certain circumstances. The aim is that going in with some friends or a clan does, of course, still give an advantage, but not to such a ridiculous extent. As such, a skilled solo player has a fighting chance as well.</p>
              <p>So, this week, <span style="color: #ff9900;">we have made Bounty Hunter single-way combat, meaning that only one player may attack another player at any time. There are two exceptions to this rule:</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>You are able to attack someone who is in combat if they are your Bounty Hunter target </li>
              <li>You can be attacked when in combat if you are the Bounty Hunter target of your opponent </li>
              </ul>
              <p>We would like to remind you that Bounty Hunter is a dangerous minigame, and you risk losing your items when entering the caverns.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Cash Rewards:</strong></p>
              <p>We have introduced another reason for being a bounty hunter: cash rewards for defeating your bounties.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mandrith loves to reward bravery, so players who kill 10 or more bounty targets will earn cash rewards based on the market value of their combat items. This cash amount is worked out by taking only the second, third, fourth and fifth most expensive combat items you are carrying and giving you access to an amount of coins based on their value. You will have to defeat at least 10 bounty targets to receive your reward, which you can do by speaking to Mandrith.</span></p>
              <p>There is a limit to the amount you can receive per 10 kills, according to the crater you entered:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #ff9900;">Low-level crater - You may receive a reward up to a limit of 40,000gp for 10 kills </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff9900;">Medium-level crater - You may receive a reward up to a limit of 80,000gp for 10 kills </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff9900;">High-level crater - You may receive a reward up to a limit of 120,000gp for 10 kills</span> </li>
              </ul>
              <p>A summary of your kills will be given when you exit each crater. You do not have to kill all 10 players in one go - Mandrith will remember how many more kills you need for your next visit</p>

              <p><strong>Bounty Locate Change and Rune Rewards:</strong></p>
              <p>Some of you felt that the <a href="http://www.runescape.com/kbase/viewarticle.ws?guid=magic_teleportation_spells"><strong><span style="color: #7b4f17;">Bounty Locate</span></strong></a> spell was only available to members and was slightly too high-level, giving the advantage to more experienced players.</p>
              <p>Well, we have made tweaks that should make the Bounty Locate spell more accessible and affordable! Firstly, we have reduced the Magic level required to cast Bounty Locate to 32, and reduced its cost to 1 law rune, 1 air rune and 1 fire rune.</p>
              <p>We have made the spell available to F2P, and once you have made 10 Bounty Hunter target kills, you will receive a prize of 15 law runes, 15 air runes and 15 fire runes - the number of runes required to cast 15 Bounty Locate spells!</p>
              <p>To get a running total of how many targets you need to kill, or to receive your rune rewards, visit Mandrith outside of the Bounty Hunter volcano. You do not have to kill all 10 players in one go - Mandrith will remember how many more kills you need for your next visit.</p>

              <p><strong>New PvP Minigame:</strong></p>
              <p>Clan Wars and Bounty Hunter did a fair job of offering new PvP gaming choices, but they weren't without their problems; in particular, Bounty Hunter was dominated by large clans, which just wasn't how we intended Bounty Hunter to be used. We are aware that this week's Bounty Hunter changes leaves only Clan Wars for multi-way fighters, which does not offer the level of danger and reward that Bounty Hunter did. We can reveal that changes to the Clan Wars arena are at a proposal stage and future multi-way minigames are planned, all of which should alleviate these concerns.</p>
              <p>It must also be said that Clan Wars and Bounty Hunter were never alone intended as a replacement for the Wilderness. We saw them as the first in a series of PvP minigames, with other games being briefed that would attempt to cater for all types of PKer. Well, the next PvP minigame is now finishing development and entering the first round of quality assurance. We're certainly very excited about this single-way, one-versus-one safe minigame.</p>

              <p>Currently at a briefing stage is the item-lending feature. It has been incredibly difficult to find that balance between versatility and stopping cheaters from abusing it. We believe we've found a solution that achieves this, and we will give you more news in future articles</p>

              <p><strong>Grand Exchange Improvements:</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.runescape.com/img/news/progress1.gif" alt=""></p>
              <p>Some changes to the Grand Exchange interfaces are entering the final stages of testing. We've listened to your feedback and we are finishing off interface changes to really speed up your selling and purchasing.</p>
              <p>We also promised 'a new web page...which will allow you to track item prices over a long period of time'. This is very close to completion and is currently with our Quality Assurance team. This will be a comprehensive and very visual means for you to find out item values and compare them with others, or see how they fluctuate over time. As you can imagine, we believe that this will be really useful to any merchants out there.</p>
              <p>Finally, the Grand Exchange pricing errors are being fixed in what will be an ongoing process. We have staff members dedicated to collating information from the Forums and in-game sources, so you'll see amendments occurring as the weeks go on. Here are a few examples of pricing issues that we have remedied:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>We've allowed Summoning items to be traded on the Exchange for a wider range of prices over a prolonged period, and allowed their prices to adjust with their large number of sales. </li>
              <li>We have made the price of items such as jewellery, poisoned dagger and clockwork toys behave more consistently, so that you are always getting a fair deal. </li>
              <li>We've allowed a more generous range of prices on the Exchange for those items that are sold in shops. </li>
              <li>We've also fixed a number of bugs that have been highlighted in the Forums, such as how potions behave. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>We'd also like to remind you that the 'Grand Exchange Price Feedback' thread in our Suggestions Forum is the place for any constructive feedback you have on our market prices.</p>
