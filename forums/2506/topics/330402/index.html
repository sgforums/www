              <p><strong>12 September 2008 - FunOrb News</strong></p>
              <div class="newsJustify">
              <p>It's not often that we bring you news about FunOrb, but we think a
              number of games really warrant your attention. Each of these are free
              to play and only a few clicks away.</p>
              <p>The first game we'd like to tell you about was only released a few days ago: <a href="http://www.funorb.com/info.ws?game=pool">Pool</a>.
              Like many of the recent FunOrb releases, Pool's focus is on the
              multiplayer and, even though it's only three days old, it's already
              attracted a large community of pool players. A number of game types are
              available, including nine-ball and eight-ball variants, all played out
              on a wide selection of outlandish pool tables. There's also a
              single-player Time Attack mode for those that want to practise their
              skills.</p>
              <p>Our second game is proving to be the most popular FunOrb title since
              Arcanists, so we reckon fantasy-loving RuneScapers will really enjoy
              it. <a href="http://www.funorb.com/info.ws?game=dungeonassault">Dungeon Assault</a> casts you in the role of a dragon with two simple aims: to protect your
              hoard by constructing an elaborate dungeon, and to send raiders out to
              steal from other dragons. You can fill your dungeon with legions of
              beasts, hidden traps and guardians, making it incredibly difficult for
              your opponents to get to your gold. Once your stash is safe, recruit
              some raiders and take on players' dungeons to steal their gold.</p>
              <p>Fans of tower defence-style games may also be impressed by <a href="http://www.funorb.com/info.ws?game=orbdefence">Orb Defence</a>.
              This takes the basics of the genre and turns the dial up to 11,
              bringing wave after wave of relentless enemies, a kaleidoscopic neon
              look, and hours of addictive gameplay.</p>
              <p>Similarly pretty is <a href="http://www.funorb.com/info.ws?game=pixelate">Pixelate</a>.
              It has a brand of gameplay that we have never encountered before, so we
              can only encourage you to get to grips with its reaction-testing
              puzzles and psychedelic style.</p>
              <p>We couldn't part without mentioning the addition of global
              highscores to FunOrb, so your gaming feats can be recognised by the
              entire community. If you can get to the top on any FunOrb game, then
              you're a better gamer than any of us!</p>
              <p>We plan to update you about FunOrb games in the future, but only if
              we think you'll really appreciate them. Indeed, a FunOrb game is
              planned that is based on the RuneScape universe, which might be right
              up your alley. Keep your eyes and ears peeled...</p>

              <p><strong>19th November 2008 - FunOrb - Zombie Dawn Multiplayer</strong></p>
              <p>Halloween may well have been and gone, but our sister site, <a href="http://www.funorb.com/">FunOrb</a>, is keeping the horror theme alive with our latest release, <a href="http://www.funorb.com/">Zombie Dawn Multiplayer: Fight of the Living Dead</a>.
              Building on the popular single-player version, Zombie Dawn Multiplayer
              brings you 2- to 4-player shuffling action, as you try to capture
              and/or zombify more humans than your opponents and get them back to
              your research lab before the time runs out.</p>
              <p>The more zombies you're able to get into your portal, the more
              Research Points you earn. These points are allocated to the power-ups
              and zombie traits that you can use on your zombies (of which there are
              LOTS to discover) allowing you to mould your zombie horde to your own
              style of play. You'll also find that if you're able to herd a few live
              humans into the portal, too, you'll get a lot more points.</p>
              <p>The gameplay of the single-player version was always something we
              wanted to build on. With the multiplayer version, we've aimed to retain
              key elements of the original while building an evolutionary path that
              opens up more strategies the further you get into it. So, for example,
              dropping a hammer on an opponent's zombie can thwart their carefully
              laid plans. We hope you enjoy the many ways that this game allows you
              to cause mayhem! This brings FunOrb to a total of 33 games, 10 of which
              are multiplayer.</p>
