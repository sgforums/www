You can create yourself a new account by clicking here and clicking the "Create a Free Account" button. Once you've done that, you can come back here to continue the guide<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: Create Only @ www.Runescape.com</span><br><br><strong>Playing for the first time</strong><br><br>You play the game by clicking the "Play RuneScape" link from the RuneScape main page. This will take you to a screen which gives you the option to play in high or low detail.<br><br>We recommend you try the high detail mode first. If you have problems with the high detail mode, try the low detail version by going back to the front page and selecting "Play RuneScape" again.<br><br><img src="http://www.runescape.com/img/kbase/getting_started/choosebutton_free.gif"><br><br>This will take you to the world select screen. All of the game worlds are identical, but you will meet different players on each one. The easiest option is to choose the large button that says "Choose best free world for me". This will try to choose the least busy world near you.<br><br>The button on the right selects the best members-only world for you. There are far more features of the game available on the members' worlds; if you find you're enjoying RuneScape and you'd like to take the game experience further, you can subscribe and start playing on those worlds.<br><br><img src="http://www.runescape.com/img/kbase/getting_started/first_steps_3.jpg"><br><br>The initial download process will then start. During the download a grey security box will pop up.<br><br>You will be asked 'Do you want to install and run RuneScape?'<br><br>You should check the box that appears next to 'Always trust content from Jagex Ltd' and then click 'Yes'.<br><br>When the game has loaded you will be presented with the title screen. Enter the username and password you chose when you created your account and click 'Login'.<br><br>You will then be presented with a character design page, as shown below:<br><br><img src="http://www.runescape.com/img/kbase/getting_started/first_steps_4.jpg"><br><br>You should use the arrows on the screen to change each option until you are happy with your character's appearance. There are features in the game that will allow you to re-design your character, although you may have to pay some RuneScape currency to make any changes!<br><br>Once you have finished you should click the 'Accept' button which will launch your character into our Tutorial Island, where the friendly citizens of RuneScape are looking forward to greeting you.<br><br><strong>Tutorial Island</strong><br><br>Tutorial Island is the place in RuneScape where your character will begin their life. Here you will be introduced to the basics of playing RuneScape. You will be taken through a variety of skills by the instructors, including casting spells, Fishing, Mining, combat and much more.<br><br>This should only take about 20 minutes to complete. When you've finished, your character will be transported to the rustic town of Lumbridge where your RuneScape adventures will truly begin!<br><br><img src="http://www.runescape.com/img/kbase/getting_started/first_steps_5.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you're new to RuneScape, you'll probably want to know what to start off with, such as which skills to train or which quests you should work on first. This guide will explain a bit about each skill and explain which quests you should do first<br><br><img src="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/images/dharokaxe.gif"><br><strong>Melee Combat</strong>: Now you would probably want to start off with a weapon that can kill anything in one shot. That's not going to happen, but the next best thing is a Scimitar or Battle Axe. Each time you are able to wield a new metal type of weapon, go for the next type of Battle Axe or Scimitar.<br><br>If you are willing to take a risk and sacrifice some defense to cause some major hurt, Try a 2-Handed Sword. They are slow and you won't be able to use shields. Also, try to level up Smithing, as you might be a good enough smithy to make your own weapons and armour. Try shops such as the axe shop in Port Sarim, or the sword shop in Varrock.<br><br><img src="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/images/magicshortbow.gif"><br><strong>Ranged</strong>: Start by getting around 100-200gp. Then go to the Ranging shop in Varrock and buy a normal Shortbow. Spend the rest on Bronze Arrows. Make your way south of Varrock to the small farm with a shed and plenty of chickens and continuously pummel the chickens with arrows. Be sure to pick up any that fall on the ground after impact. It is optional to buy some leather armour to start off with, but it's not the greatest idea when sniping chickens.<br><br><img src="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/images/holysymbol.gif"><br><strong>Prayer</strong>: Put everything in the bank and switch to a world (server) that has a small amount of people and head to Varrock. Using your map, head into the Wilderness and head to the chaos temple surrounded by lava. When I went, there was no one around. There are around 20-30 continuous bone spawns, which will provide a fair amount of Prayer experience when buried. If you think you're ready, move on north to the bone yard. there are Skeletons, but try your best to avoid them<br><br><img src="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/guilds/images/mystichat.gif"><br><strong>Magic</strong>: Magic can be expensive to start with, but when combined with Runecrafting (see below), it should be ok. Head to the Wizard's Tower south of Draynor Village. If there are some wizard's robes that are already on the floor, grab them. If not, leave, or kill one (don't wear metal-related armor!) and grab some blue robes.<br><br>If you have completed the Rune Mysteries Quest, grab a pickaxe, go mine some Rune Essence, and obtain mind and air talismans. Then craft some mind and air runes. If not, buy them from the Varrock magic store. Cast wind strike as much as preferred on rats in varrock sewers.<br><br><img src="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/images/cosmicrune.gif"><br><strong>Runecrafting</strong>: You must have completed the Rune Mysteries Quest before starting this skill. Go to Varrock with a pickaxe, head to the magic store and ask to be teleported by the shop owner to be teleported to the Rune Essence. Mine 28, head out, bank it, then repeat until you have around 200-300. Head to Falador bank and buy a mind talisman and an air talisman off another player for a reasonable price.<br><br>Halve your rune essence that you mined and write that down. Keep taking 28 essence at a time to the air temple south of falador and craft air runes. Then repeat this with the other half of essence except this time do it at the mind temple, north of goblin village. Recommended to use these for magic.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The way of fishing and cooking..</span></strong><br><br>Seriously...<br>Fishing is one of the most important skill in this game...<br>Together with cooking, you will have unlimited amount of food...<br>Yup. Fishing and cooking are my favorite skills ^^<br><br>First of all, grab a net.<br>Can be found at the fishing village with the name called Port Sarim.<br><br>Place to train for low level...<br>Well i feel that the best place is dranor manor...<br>As there is a bank nearby with loads of woodcutter and therefor fire isn't a problem here...<br>Just net the shrimp and cook it again and again...<br>Store you shrimp in bank as they will come in useful when training for combat...<br>After that, with a little cash, buy a fishing rod and some baits...<br>Continue the same thing... Just that you are using different item to fish different fish now...<br>After you have enough level to fish anchovies, then put down your baits and time for you go with your nets again...<br>Fish those anchovies...<br>Type of fish level:<br>Shrimp: 1<br>Sardine: 5<br>Herring : 10<br>Anchovies: 15<br><br>After you can start with trouts, fly fishing, time to go for it...<br>Level needed: 20<br>Items needed:<br>Fly fishing rod<br>Feather<br><br>Feather can be obtain from killing chicken... Well... 5 feather per chicken killed...<br>get around 500 feather or even more and start your fly fishing...<br><br>Well fly fishing is odd... using feather to fish instead of baits...<br>Best place is, barberian village...<br>With the bank above you can store you fish easily... (well the distance is consider close already...)<br>and trees nearby, fire isn't a big problem.<br><br>happy fly fishing til you can fish salmon...<br>well... isnt much different so happy fly fishing salmon too...<br><br>(you can choose to fly fish until lvl 50 too... It's better this way i think)<br><br>At level 40, finally...<br>Lobby!!!<br>ok lobby or lobbie means lobster... that how we call it. lobby ^^<br><br>best place, alright no need to explain much why, karamja...<br>the reason why don't need to explain is, that is the only place to fish lobby -.-"<br><br>buy a cage at the fishing shop, go to karumja paying 30gp to the sailor or whatever is he called...<br>bring an axe along... as that place is bad to find fire...<br><br>happy fishing<br><br>Your fishing and cooking level should be close enough for you to cook the lastest fish you have... ^^<br><br>Well... Loads of fish, loads of food... Train your combat too ^^</div>
