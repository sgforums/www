              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Somewhere
                  in a field, a young man could be seen sleeping on the comfortable
                  haystack. As the sun rises and shone onto his face, he gradually opened
                  his eyes to the beautiful view of greenery. His name was Cloud, an
                  unofficial member of the Vizard. He had spiked blonde hair with sparkly
                  radiance blue eyes that shines with hope. Dressing in a full black
                  costume that brings fear to people, he took a yawn. “ So this is where
                  you have been all along. The Captain is looking for you.” Said a voice
                  from somewhere on the top of the trees behind the young man. Looking
                  back, he just mumbled, “ Whatever, I’m going now. See you later.” Cloud
                  just took his katana and walked away without looking at the person who
                  talked to him.<br><br> Arriving at the front of a warehouse, he walked
                  into it half-awaked. There, in the middle of the warehouse, a large
                  crate was seen. On it, a man could be seen doing the traditional formal
                  way of sitting in Japan while drinking herbal Japanese tea. Cloud paid
                  his respect to the man and places his katana behind him as he said, “
                  What can I do for you, Captain?” The man just took his mask off and a
                  sip of his cup, “ Congratulation Young tiger, you have been accepted to
                  officially join us in ranking of the gang. You shall receive your mask
                  that we personal-made to suit your character and hold the honour of our
                  gang.” A lady from a dark corner of the warehouse appeared with a mask
                  on her right hand. It resembled a skull of a tiger and had that feeling
                  of fear to whoever sees it. Taking out her blade, she did the process
                  of being knighted and gave Cloud the mask. With Honour, he wore it and
                  pledges himself to be part of one of the notorious yakuzas of Japan. <br><br> Upon receiving the mask, he was given his first assignment. Another man
                  came crashing down from the rooftop by a rope, passing him a thin
                  folder that contains all the info that was needed for his assignment.
                  Cloud browses through it and was ready for it. He went out to his
                  destination, his battleground. His first assignment was a one-on-one
                  combat with their longest and stronger opposing rival, the Arrancars,
                  over a territory. Whoever member wins, the territory would belong to
                  the gang. Cloud could not possibly fail this easy task for his and his
                  gang honour. <br><br> As the sky turned red and the sun sets, giving
                  way for the full moon to rise. Cloud descends the step to an abandoned
                  underground train station. His eyes scanned the dark surrounding of the
                  station. He could see nothing. Grasping on his katana and removing it
                  from the scabbard, Cloud was shaking with excitement. He could not wait
                  to present to the captain with the body of his opponent. Sudden burst
                  of light appeared as the station came alive, a man who seemed similar
                  to Cloud was standing at the opposite end with his hand on the circuit
                  beaker. <br><br> “ You’re my opponent? Boy… the Vizards sure have
                  brought their standard down.” Said the young man as he played with his
                  large blade that is as long as an average human. He was dressed with
                  only Skinny jeans. His long blonde hair matches with his ice-cold blue
                  eyes. A large plain dark dot could be seen tattooed on his chest as it
                  represents being the member of the Arrancar. <br><br> “ Better take
                  those words back. For I am Cloud Ace Chara, young tiger of the
                  Vizards!” exclaimed Cloud as he launched himself and strike a blow onto
                  his opponent. Beautifully deflecting it with his large blade, the
                  opponent’s facial expression changed from a smirk to something
                  flabbergasted. He asked, “ Are you really Cloud Ace Chara? Do you know
                  who am I? I’m your long lost twin brother.” This broke the tension
                  between them and both began to cool down especially cloud. His brother
                  introduced himself to be Sephiroth Jack Chara. Their parents were
                  divorced and they were separated from each other since young. Their
                  mother who took Sephiroth told him about having a twin brother. On the
                  other hand, Cloud’s father kept the existence of having a twin brother
                  quiet from Cloud. They did not think that they would meet each other
                  this way. <br><br> Cloud was in a dilemma now. He has no idea what to
                  do, keep his honour of his gang or his siblinghood. It was a tough
                  decision. He can’t just simply killed his brother that he just met but
                  he can’t also go back to the warehouse with his head low, bringing the
                  reputation and the honour of the gang down. Grapping onto his katana,
                  he looked at his brother and asked to continue the match. Getting into
                  positions, they exchanged blow continuously, deflecting one another
                  attacks and tries to plunge their blades into each other. <br><br> Sephiroth delighted to see his brother for once since young, decided to
                  let Cloud win seeing his face with the passion of a bright future. He
                  purposely gave himself an opening and did not evade. Cloud’s katana
                  plunges directly in stomach and drawing out of it, staining the blade
                  with blood. Sephiroth drops on his knee, smiling towards Cloud and ask
                  him to finish him off. “ No, I can’t. I know that you did that on
                  purpose, letting me win. I can’t let you have that. That’s not pure
                  honour. I’m sorry, Brother.” Said Cloud in a weary voice. Holding the
                  blade, he stabbed himself through the heart. “ I can’t bring myself to
                  disgracing both my gang honour and our siblinghood honour. Sorry
                  Brother and goodbye.” Cloud muttered his last words as he falls into
                  the arm of his brother.<br><br> Sephiroth hold his brother in his arms
                  with tears swelling up in his eyes. He did not anticipate this. He
                  screamed out towards the empty station and began to felt remorseful.
                  His reason of joining the Arrancar was actually to find his brother as
                  they promised him in return for his power. All is now down the drain
                  with his brother dead. He had no more purpose to be in the Yakuza
                  anymore.<br><br> The full moon shone upon the dark park as a dark
                  character could be seen walking down the path. It was Sephiroth, he had
                  recovered from his injury and could be seen with his brother mask on
                  and katana as memento. He set off, breaking free from his gang for
                  their siblinghood honour and search for a new purpose to life.</span></strong></p>
