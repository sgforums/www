              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>
              </p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Dear Good Samaritan</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I ma a newcomer to SGforum!! Have read through all the comments posted with regards to CVC. Just to share, I got a call from a company claiming to be from CVC directly themselves. Surprisingly, the call started with a statement that I have not been using the facilties of CVC since 2005. And they said that if I wish to continue or to sell off my so-called CVC membership, they will do this for me.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Very specifically, I asked them, <strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do I have to pay any money at all.?</span></strong> The answer was an emphatic <strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Same</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When I asked, how much is the value of the membership that they will pay, I was told I can only be told this when I come down to their office. She claimed the value has gone up. When I mention that my situation was a <strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CASH-BACK</span></strong>, with LMG and Concept Programme in UK, she said she knows about this. When I mentioned that I never got the amount promised - S$28K ( approximately ), she said they will buy back the CVC, at the value I paid for. ( This would have been maybe about $30K, if my memory serves me! ). It has been more than 7 years since this cash back took place.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I note you have a similar cash-back like ours. Not sure what you got back - but we got back about S$1500.00 ( not the S$28K as promised.)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Yes, I was misled by LGM to take out a 5-year CVC membership with Cash Reward Scheme in mid-2005. However when I discovered the transaction was a scam just 1 month later (the salesperson who had attended to me told me so; he had left LGM to join another timeshare company and wanted to assist me to recover my monies), I reported the matter to both CASE and CAD. As I did not get any service &amp; assistance from LGM (likewise, LGM did not repond to CASE at all) and I also did not hear from CVC, I treated the whole transaction as not genuine and did not even bother to make a claim on the Cash Reward Scheme that was due in late 2010.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Initailly, when I got the call yesterday, I thought it was a genuine call from CVC. But having read through all these correspondences from the various members, I have decided that I will not attend the meeting set-up for today. And I have been getting calls again this morning ( I guess to remind me to attend ). The address is Orchard Towers, #04-24.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The office @ Orchard Towers #04-24 belongs to Connection Tours &amp; Travel. This company is merely a tour agency and some of their staff represent Dynamikz Netwerkz in the timeshare business. I also understand that Concepts Club Services is now operating there too.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">As some have commented, we should just write this off as a bad experience. ( we did have 2 clubs membership ), which we had to sell to LMG, to participate in this<strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cashback</span></strong>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I had to terminate my MTC membership myself direct with the resort developer as LGM did not do it.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">And that point in time, we emphasied that we were not interested in joing any other clubs <strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">nor wanting to pay anymore annual fees</span></strong>. this was the very reason, we agreed to the cashback scheme. And ours was a 5-year wait ( which was over about 2 years back ). This was made known to LMG at the very start.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Thought I want to share our experience in case there are others like me who may be "sucked in" again needlessly. Thanks to this forum, I have gathered more information to convince me, that this can be an endless "game". We have decided to just ignore it all. ( Incidentally, we had a slightly approach from Beaufort Park, which initally also said they would want to buy out membership ). And I wasted a lot of my time meeting them- to finally find out I had to pay more money, to be able to "sell off" my CVC.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Despite them all telling you that we do not pay out any money, the bottom-line ends up with us HAVING TO FORK OUT MONEY. Completely untruthfull.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Incidentally, had also received calls from AFTAG! When I questioned the caller over some issues, he just hung up on me!! Shows how genuine this company is!!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Yours sincerely</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">NEWCOMER</p>

              <p>Bobby Wiranto is the Member Service Manager of CCS. He is in his mid-40's (I was told by the rep who had attended to me) and is bald &amp; big(boss|balls). His reading skills is not very good (jerky when he read the contract to me).</p>

              <p>Sorry I wanted some news on Dynamikz Travelz.</p>
              <p>I know the below companies are all connected, and I'm affected by their recent scam. Anyone with news about these scammers  please let me know. Thanks</p>
              <p>(quoting)</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Oops, I didn't see this post until now.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Yes, it is stated in CVC's website that Connection Tours &amp;
                                      Travel is CVC's corporate office in Singapore. I had gone to their
                                      office to find out whether Concepts Club Services is really CVC's
                                      authorised service centre. They confirmed of the relationship.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Connection Tours &amp; Travel also represents Dynamikz Netwerkz for
                                      timeshare matters. By the way, the cheque that I had received for
                                      cancellation of a Service Agreement with Dynamikz Netwerkz
                                      (represented by Connection Tours &amp; Travel) was issued by
                                      Concepts Club Services.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Separately, I had also written to CVC for confirmation. CVC claimed
                                      that they are not related to and do not have any business dealings
                                      with Concepts Club Services. This contradicted what Connection
                                      Tours &amp; Travel had told me. As such, I wrote again to tell CVC
                                      about it and had requested CVC to remove Connection Tours &amp;
                                      Travel's contact details as this company is unethical &amp;
                                      dishonest in providing information which as a result may mislead
                                      CVC members to make wrong decisions. CVC did not respond to my
                                      email at all. However, CVC has recently put up a notice to advise
                                      members not to deal with Concepts Club Services.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span>1) When they said it that my annual dues are not current does that mean that I still have to pay them subcriptions fees as from April 2012 till April 2013? <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Please refer to your contract pertaining to "Subscription Fees". However, I understand from one CVC member that he did not pay the annual subscription fees and was informed by CVC that he will not enjoy the benefits. Hence, it's not compulsory to pay.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span>2) And if I want to terminate my membership with them,is it deem that I have to pay whatever if due from me to them as from April 2012 till April 2016,whatever is expected to be paid by me..???<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <strong>If I were you, I'll just wait out till April 2016 and then write to CVC Membership Services for an e-mail status confirmation. </strong></span></span></p>

              <p>I cancelled the Service Agreement with CCS as I was informed by CVC that my membership had expired and CCS has no business relationship with CVC. I had to wait for 45 work days before CCS release the cheque to me.</p>

              <p>Hi All, </p>
              <p>why not all of us fight this together. its not just one , but many people's hard-earned money is being stolen like this. All that they scare us is that it is going to cost too much to hire a lawyer. It is because we don't know who the other members are . if we all join and do it together, it may be much lesser and i think all of us be benefited. please think about this. May be we can do it even without hiring a lawyer, by alerting the media, police and the government to take some action againts the scams. </p>

              <p>Hi A Good Samaritan,</p>
              <p>Appreciate your advises to forum users.</p>
              <p>I was also scammed by Garraway in 2009. I signed up for 20 years membership fee waiver given by Garraway. I've received so many calls about selling my membership and getting back money and went to couple of those callers and sensed it to be fraudulant as they always keep saying special offer and do not apply once I walk out of the door.</p>
              <p>Since Oct 2011, I have recieved emails with pdf attachments that I-Generic B &amp; M Pte Ltd is now serving CVC members that were previously under Garraway. So, I decided to meet them once and find what are the options I have.</p>
              <p>The guy said as Garraway is closed, I have to pay the membership fees and CVC will come after me after 5 years. If I choose to terminate, I need to pay him around 4K and offer valid only on that day and I can get refund of upto 8K (after 3 years) and I need to sign up for MTF (Money Tree Fund www.moneytreefund.com). I escaped from there somehow.</p>
              <p>What are the options I have? Will CVC come after us for membership fee? As I see so many people around, can we get together for any action against these perpetrators so that these dubious companies can't taunt us again and again for one mistake we have done.</p>

              <p>Hello Good Samaritans, </p>
              <p>"You're mentioning that you manage to terminate your MTC direct with the Resort Developer."</p>
              <p>Can help to elaborate what benefits/difference does it make by doing this ?</p>
              <p>Since looks like there's no obligation for us to pay for the annual fee, I don't see the point terminating.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, I got the same story as the rest of you all, went to the Orchard Tower office and listened to what they have to say about terminating the account and getting back ~23k for a fee. Hearing a 'too good to be true' story and the fact that I have to fork out money to make it happen made me decide to tell them that I will take it back and think about it. Thankfully my 'research' led me to all these discussions. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, I've paid 3 years membership fee to reactivate my membership again (plus whatever previous years due) since I genuinely have plan to take my family for a trip to some resort somewhere, hoping that I got a good rate from them (somehow vaguely I recall CVC used to send a monthly rates for resorst around the world and the price looks cheap to me). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now that I read this forum, I hope my membership really reactivated back. If not, I will ask for a refund from them. Of course will check on my membership status reactivation direct to CVC too. </p>
