              <p>Hello, Good Samaritan.</p>
              <p>I am a CVC member too.  Now that LGM has closed down, who should have the legal right to all the membership contracts documents?  Shouldn't the court ordered these documents be returned to CVC HQ itself?</p>
              <p>I was contacted by this Concepts Club Services Pte Ltd (CCS) this past few days and have visited their office at Orchard Towers too.  I saw they have the CVC contract documents (those belonging previously belonging to LGM) of the CVC members.  Have confirmed with CVC independently that they have NO business relationship with CCS. </p>
              <p>Is this suffice to conclude that what CCS is doing is ILLEGAL ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also, is it LEGAL for CCS to possess those CVC membership documents, given that they have NO relationship with CVC, and are NOT the appointed service agent in Singapore for CVC members here ? </p>
              <p>If so, can we report Police /CAD or CASE on their ILLEGAL activities? </p>
              <p>Those people working in CCS are all Malays (no offensive /racist incinuation) and one of their so-called manager is a guy with Indoneisan name. I don't think he is a Singaporean.  I am very highly suspicious of their activities.</p>

              <p>Hi Good Samaritan</p>
              <p>I too bought the CVC membership from LGM years ago. Last week was contact by phone and asked to collect some cheque.</p>
              <p>When reach Then asked to pay membership fee. The amount is not small as they ask me to back pay them.</p>
              <p>The issue is nothing heard from them before that. but suddenly ask  to pay. which I think this is not right. but please advise.</p>
              <p>Yes the person contact was from Concepts Club Services Pte Ltd at POMO.</p>
              <p>Like Kkoh7172, was wondering  if they are geninue CVC. Even that payment mode is not negotiable only cash and nets. </p>
              <p>This is something cannot be accepted.</p>
              <p>Anyone can give some advise,?</p>

              <p>Hi Kkoh7172 &amp; PhotoSnapper,</p>
              <p><strong>PLEASE DO NOT PAY</strong> any maintenance fee as requested by all the companies that I had mentioned above (including other companies too).</p>
              <p>Suggest that you find out the status of your CVC membership by writing directly to this email address: membershipservices@conceptsvacationclub.com</p>
              <p>It would have probably expired like mine, and that was how I discovered that the companies were not genuinely helping me to terminate the membership. I am lucky to get back my full deposit after waiting out for more than 2 months (not easy at all).</p>
              <p>Should you have any other queries, please feel free to write to me.</p>
              <p>Wishing you Merry Christmas &amp; a Happy New Year!</p>

              <p>Sorry for my late reply.</p>
              <p>Btw, I realised that CVC has recently updated their website to advise the following:</p>
              <p>1. Do not deal with Concepts Club Services Pte Ltd;</p>
              <p>2. Singapore CVC Member Enquiries: i-Generic B&amp;M</p>

              <p>This is getting very strange as I had earlier written to CVC directly on separate occasions to verify the following:</p>
              <p>1. Is Concepts Club Services Pte Ltd related to CVC and able to assist me to terminate my CVC membership? <span style="color: #0000ff;">Their reply was my CVC membership had already expired last year and CVC has no relationship or business dealings with Concepts Club Services Pte Ltd.</span></p>
              <p>2. Is Connection Tours &amp; Travel Pte Ltd their corporate office in Singapore (as the representative from this company told me that Concepts Club Services Pte Ltd is related to CVC)? <span style="color: #0000ff;">There is no reply from CVC.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Sam another post by SCBSS12 and replied in that post as follows:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">Looks like you have been scammed the way I have. I also received a call from Concepts Club Services at POMO, their offer to get me back my $ paid to LGM simply sounded too good to be true. I searched on them and found this site that gave good information and thanks also to Good Samaritan for his good information. From your experience, now I understand their scheme. It is no different from all others. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">There are so many of such scams around, actually run by similar persons, changing companies and names but I recognise them at different scam companies. They all want us to put in more $ after bad. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">Once I called Commercial Affairs Department and informed them. They say they know and watching.

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">No, please!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">BTW, I believe you are referring to Connection Tours &amp; Travel instead of Concept Tours &amp; Travels. This company is just a travel agency but represents Dynamikz Netwerkz that is in the timeshare business. I had a bad experience for cancelling a transaction relating to my CVC's Cash Reward Scheme and I was lucky to get back a full refund about 3 months later (but it was not easy).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I had initially accepted Connection Tours &amp; Travel's offer to assist me in recovering monies from CVC for the Cash Reward Scheme by "re-registering". However, I cancelled the offer (actually a Purchase Agreement for Club Dynamikz) as I discovered several discrepancies later. In addition, I also received a confirmation from CVC upon my enquiry that I cannot make a claim as the Cash Reward Scheme had already lapsed.</p>

              <p>Glad to know that you did not engage the services of CCS. Please also note that I have reasons to believe that Concepts Vacation Club may not be a respectable company too. Hence, apart from finding out the status of your CVC membership (no choice), do exercise caution if they were to advise you anything.</p>
              <p>BTW</p>
              <p>If you were led into buying your CVC membership from the defunct LGM, I think your plan should be quite similar to mine (ie 5-year with Cash Reward). You would then have a copy of letter from LGM regarding membership validity &amp; full waiver of subscription fees.</p>

              <p>Also receive call saying they represent some legal company which is having an on going Class Action and will sue LGM / CVC. Pay nothing to join, once they win the court case, they take 25% and 75% will be share among those who join. Any advise?</p>

              <p>Hi A Good Samaritan</p>
              <p>I think my plan is quite similar to yours.  Mine is a 7-yr Cash Reward with waiver of yearly membership and the cash reward is going to due in Sep 2012.</p>
              <p>But I don't quite understand when you say that you have cancelled it and get a full refund back?  Then on the other hand, you said that the Cash Reward Sceheme (CRS) has lapsed.  Did you miss the redemption date?  I thought CRS is handled by another company called Concepts Programmes Limited in UK?</p>

              <p>Hi A Good Samaritan</p>
              <p>The CVC membership card staed member since Jan 06 and valid thru Jan 11.  I supposed it has expired last year though mine should start in Aug 05 and last through 15 years.  Think LGM only pay 5 years of membership instead of 15.</p>
              <p>Have written to the 2 emails already on thursday night but they yet to reply.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Does anyone been to this company located at 400 orchard road orchard towers #04-23. Their company name is concepts service claimed that they are directly from Concept vacation club. They mentioned that they are able to terminate our membership after we pay any outstanding liabilities based on our record from the Spain side but if we choose to continue the membership, we have to pay the maintenance fee to them. They also mentioned that the current membership we are holding has a cash value so once terminated, they will inform us of the current market value and pay us back the monies.</p>
              <p>Wondering has anyone been to the company and what do they tell u?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thks,</p>
              <p>Naz</p>
