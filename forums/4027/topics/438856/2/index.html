              <p>By the way, Concepts Club Services is at 1 Selegie Road #02-14 POMO Singapore 188306. I last visited them in Nov 2011. Have they shifted to Orchard Towers?</p>
              <p>The bald guy is Bobby Wiranto. I am not sure if he is an Indonesian but he is the Manager, Members Service of Concepts Clubs Services.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Yes, it is stated in CVC's website that Connection Tours &amp; Travel is CVC's corporate office in Singapore. I had gone to their office to find out whether Concepts Club Services is really CVC's authorised service centre. They confirmed of the relationship.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Connection Tours &amp; Travel also represents Dynamikz Netwerkz for timeshare matters. By the way, the cheque that I had received for cancellation of a Service Agreement with Dynamikz Netwerkz (represented by Connection Tours &amp; Travel) was issued by Concepts Club Services.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Separately, I had also written to CVC for confirmation. CVC claimed that they are not related to and do not have any business dealings with Concepts Club Services. This contradicted what Connection Tours &amp; Travel had told me. As such, I wrote again to tell CVC about it and had requested CVC to remove Connection Tours &amp; Travel's contact details as this company is unethical &amp; dishonest in providing information which as a result may mislead CVC members to make wrong decisions. CVC did not respond to my email at all. However, CVC has recently put up a notice to advise members not to deal with Concepts Club Services.</p>

              <p>Hi Good Samaritan,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thks so much for your prompt reply. Yup me and my husband when down to Concept Club Services at Orchard tower last few days. So they told us about the same thing that is whether we choose to terminate or carry on with the membership. So we told them that we wanted to terminate and they told us that if we choose to terminate, we will have to pay the outstanding liabilities which amounted to $8k+ after the calculation. Then they told us that we have to pay a deposit of 2k first so that they can proceed with the solicitor after that we have to pay the balance. The whole process will take about 4-12months before we could recover our monies then after which we have to pay 5% commission to your side. What this the same scenario for your case? The thing that puzzles us was that they were able to show our record from the spain side stating our maintenance fees, open market value, type of membership purchase etc etc, wonder how they got those info from??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ive actually paid $1k only as i told them $2k is too much and they are fine with it. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After reading all this, how do i get out of this situation as most probably they might be calling me to fix an appointment with solicitor? How do i check with cvc directly with regards to my membership?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Yup the guy name who claimed to be the manager was Bobby Wiranto, he gave his name card to us and the company name is Concept Club Services so i guess they have shifted to Orchard Tower now! He sounded so convincing as he kept putting down the other companies who had conned us before saying how could they do this to people like us so on and so on. He also told us that some members had already managed to get bavk their monies.</p>
              <p>So can I make a police report juz like what you did? Or what should i do?</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Thks so much for your prompt reply. Yup me and my husband when down to Concept Club Services at Orchard tower last few days.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I thought Concepts Club Services operates in POMO Building and Connection Tours &amp; Travel is in Orchard Towers.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So they told us about the same thing that is whether we choose to terminate or carry on with the membership. So we told them that we wanted to terminate and they told us that if we choose to terminate, we will have to pay the outstanding liabilities which amounted to $8k+ after the calculation. Then they told us that we have to pay a deposit of 2k first so that they can proceed with the solicitor after that we have to pay the balance. The whole process will take about 4-12months before we could recover our monies then after which we have to pay 5% commission to your side. What this the same scenario for your case?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Same</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The thing that puzzles us was that they were able to show our record from the spain side stating our maintenance fees, open market value, type of membership purchase etc etc, wonder how they got those info from??</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did Concepts Club Services get our documents? Probably ex-LGM's employees may have sold the documents to them or may be working for them now.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The computation can easily be prepared and printed out like an email from CVC to Concepts Club Services. I believe you may have waited for an hour or so and all this was done in the backroom.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Ive actually paid $1k only as i told them $2k is too much and they are fine with it<span style="color: #0000ff;">. </span>After reading all this, how do i get out of this situation as most probably they might be calling me to fix an appointment with solicitor?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>

              <p>Yup the guy name who claimed to be the manager was Bobby
                  Wiranto, he gave his name card to us and the company name is
                  Concept Club Services so i guess they have shifted to Orchard Tower
                  now! He sounded so convincing as he kept putting down the other
                  companies who had conned us before saying how could they do this to
                  people like us so on and so on. He also told us that some members
                  had already managed to get bavk their monies.</p>
              <p>So can I make a police report juz like what you did? Or what
                  should i do?</p>

              <p>According to the terms &amp; conditions, you are able to cancel the Service Agreement provided notice is given within 3 days from date of the contract. Concepts Club Services will also ask you to surrender all original documents, ie Service Agreement &amp; Receipts. Please make copies of these documents for your file and request from Concepts Club Services to give you a confirmation letter for the cancellation (and as a precaution, please also tell Bobby to include in the letter that Concepts Club Services has collected your original Service Agreement &amp; Receipts).</p>
              <p>Your letter is basically to request for cancellation of Service Agreement with Concepts Club Services Pte Ltd with immediate effect and reimbursement of $1,000/-. It is up to you to include the reason for your cancellation, ie CVC members are advised not to deal with Concepts Club Services (a notice found in CVC's website).</p>
              <p>Don't bother about the maintenance fees as Concepts Club Services has no relationship with CVC. Btw, are you entitled to maintenance fees waiver? If yes, you may have a copy of the letter from the defunct LGM.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">1. The money you paid is to LGM Pte Ltd.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">2. LGM is only a marketing company and once the Private
              Limited Company closes down, it is almost impossible to get back your money
              from the local Singaporean Director as he/she is protected by limited
              liabilities which are the nature of Pte Ltd.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">3. LGM sells services from CVC, not on CVC's behalf.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">4. Thus, CVC is not responsible for your contract which is
              with LGM.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">5. For Cash Back, CVC in Spain may not pay you back the
              amount or is pro-rated to a few hundred dollars as they claimed that LGM did
              not pay them the money they collected from you.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">6. For records, the cash rewards forms indicated that CVC do
              not have to answer to your queries regarding the cash rewards.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">7. Many others marketing companies also sell services from
              CVC and have closed down.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">8. Many others new marketing companies have also took over
              the records from these companies and have also made claims such as termination
              with refund or switching over with additional amount etc.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">9. According to SG authorities, these marketing companies
              did not break the law and not many actions could be taken against them.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Companies are setup by people who want to earn money in the
              same concept to an employee looking for a job.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If you believe that there is a possibility of an employee
              who seek a job in a company, work for the company, does not take ANY pay and
              yet pays the company a sum of money, then the same concept of a company which
              claims that they can do things for you free is possible.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If they request that you pay them first, then they fit into
              the company that is looking for a profit, here you would want to be careful on
              the legal representation that they claim they can do.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You might want to check with the authorities before making
              payment.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Also, there is a consumer protection system in place for you
              to recover your money (read the fine prints in your contracts, or at times, not
              even there, so ask what the time frame you are allowed to terminate is)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">For termination, time and actions are crucial; any amount of
              delay is proportional to the reduction in probability of you getting your money
              back.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Pro-active is the work here. Use the laws to protect
              yourself.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">A point to note, scammers are highly intelligent personnel, probably
              with a higher than average IQ, and knows the social, legal system well enough
              to manipulate it in such a way to avoid any legal implications.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The only two ways to play their game is 1. Do not get
              involve in the first place. Frankly, only your own desires, which are
              constantly exploited by them, will be the cause of your wrong decision. 2. Play
              their game with a better understanding of the laws then them and outwit them at
              every junction and tactics they throw at you.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">These people are not actors, they are just employee of the
              company who told them what to do, so usually they are very real in their
              emotions, thus allowing you to believe in them, remember, they get paid when
              they make money (work) for the company.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Good Luck.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Do u know if they are open on Sat? Ive tried calling them but no
                  one ans? What if within the 5 days cancellation period, i cant meet
                  up with this Bobby? Ya who knows he might try to avoid knowing that
                  we already know about their scam after i drop him an email or
                  message about our intentions? Any suggestion?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thks in advance</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">You are unlikely to reach them in the morning as most of them start work in the afternoon. They work on Saturdays but I am not sure about tomorrow because of the coming Chinese New Year. The purpose for sending an email is merely to inform him. By doing so, you can then date your letter as per the date of your email.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When submitting your cancellation request, it will be best if Bobby Wiranto is around so that you can also get the confirmation letter as he needs to sign before releasing it to you.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">IMPORTANT:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">We can now only suspect that Concepts Club Services Pte Ltd may be involved in fraudulent business activities as there is no evidence. So, please be discreet when dealing with this company for your cancellation.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I believe you'll get back your refund as the sum is small. In the event if they refuse to reimburse you, you can still seek help from the Small Claims Tribunal. As such, please make sure you have copies of your Service Agreement, receipts , your cancellation letter (including your email to inform Bobby of the cancellation) and their confirmation letter of your cancellation request.</p>

              <p>Why are you afraid of the maintenance fee liability? Concepts Club Services cannot act on behalf of CVC to collect maintenance fee from you. By the way, you have not even ascertain the status of your membership with CVC (maybe it has already expired like mine). You have to accept the fact that whatever sum of money paid towards this membership via the defunct LGM is unlikely to be recovered. Everyone makes mistakes... but it is more important that we learn &amp; do not repeat them again.</p>

              <p>Dear Good Samaritan</p>
              <p>I ma a newcomer to SGforum!! Have read through all the comments posted with regards to CVC. Just to share, I got a call from a company claiming to be from CVC directly themselves. Surprisingly, the call started with a statement that I have not been using the facilties of CVC since 2005. And they said that if I wish to continue or to sell off my so-called CVC membership, they will do this for me.</p>
              <p>Very specifically, I asked them, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do I have to pay any money at all.?</span></strong> The answer was an emphatic <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO.</span></strong> When I asked, how much is the value of the membership that they will pay, I was told I can only be told this when I come down to their office. She claimed the value has gone up. When I mention that my situation was a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CASH-BACK</span></strong>, with LMG and Concept Programme in UK, she said she knows about this. When I mentioned that I never got the amount promised - S$28K ( approximately ), she said they will buy back the CVC, at the value I paid for. ( This would have been maybe about $30K, if my memory serves me! ). It has been more than 7 years since this cash back took place.</p>
              <p>I note you have a similar cash-back like ours. Not sure what you got back - but we got back about S$1500.00 ( not the S$28K as promised.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Initailly, when I got the call yesterday, I thought it was a genuine call from CVC. But having read through all these correspondences from the various members, I have decided that I will not attend the meeting set-up for today. And I have been getting calls again this morning ( I guess to remind me to attend ). The address is Orchard Towers, #04-24.</p>
              <p>As some have commented, we should just write this off as a bad experience. ( we did have 2 clubs membership ), which we had to sell to LMG, to participate in this <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cashback</span></strong>. And that point in time, we emphasied that we were not interested in joing any other clubs <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">nor wanting to pay anymore annual fees</span></strong>. this was the very reason, we agreed to the cashback scheme. And ours was a 5-year wait ( which was over about 2 years back ). This was made known to LMG at the very start.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thought I want to share our experience in case there are others like me who may be "sucked in" again needlessly. Thanks to this forum, I have gathered more information to convince me, that this can be an endless "game". We have decided to just ignore it all. ( Incidentally, we had a slightly approach from Beaufort Park, which initally also said they would want to buy out membership ). And I wasted a lot of my time meeting them- to finally find out I had to pay more money, to be able to "sell off" my CVC.</p>
              <p>Despite them all telling you that we do not pay out any money, the bottom-line ends up with us HAVING TO FORK OUT MONEY. Completely untruthfull.</p>
              <p>Incidentally, had also received calls from AFTAG! When I questioned the caller over some issues, he just hung up on me!! Shows how genuine this company is!!</p>
              <p>Yours sincerely</p>
