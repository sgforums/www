              <p>You may file a police report online @ http://www.spf.gov.sg/epc/ePCLinks.html</p>
              <p>I have done so 6 months ago and the matter was referred to CAD. However, I doubt CAD has initiated an investigation on Concept Club Services, Connection Tours &amp; Travel and Dynamikz Netwerkz for fradulent business activities.</p>
