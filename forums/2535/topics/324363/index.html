              <div>A <strong>STOMPer </strong>says he was shocked when his niece was charged $2,600 for a PSP set, with the bulk of the price charged for a modification of the console his niece was not aware of.<br><br>Said the STOMPer:<br><br>"On July 12, my niece and her mother were walking around the electronics store in Lucky Plaza to look for electronic gaming console.<br><br>"They chose a decent looking shop, well furnished and displays of game consoles and games were neatly placed."<br><br>The STOMPer said his niece and her mother agreed to pay about $300 for the console, including accessories.<br><br>He said the sales assistant later took the unopened PSP box away and when he came back with the 'modified' PSP and added miscellaneous charges.<br><br>The STOMPer said his niece was not informed that any modification was to be done and that the shop did not get her consent to do so.<br><br>He said:<br><br>"The sales assistant had taken the PSP away from the shop to a 'technician' he claimed had downloaded software known to be able to download games and a PSP version changer.<br><br>"He claimed that it is compulsory to install this license from SONY and a software to play downloaded games.<br><br>"He did the software update without my niece’s consent."<br><br>The STOMPer said the costs were as follows:<br><br><strong>PSP Set $290<br><br>MMC 8GB $98<br><br>Screen Protector $29<br><br>PSP 6 in 1 kit $69<br><br>Total: $486<br><br>Cost of modification: $2114<br></strong><br>The STOMPer added:<br><br>"Initially the total price was $3400 and they made a mistake writing $3550 on the GST 7% column which goes to show a very obvious mathematical error.<br><br>"After some negotiation the sales assistant gave a discount to $2600.<br><br>"My niece was very shocked at the price because she bought her Playstation 3 at some $700, playstation 3 is a bigger console for use with the television.<br><br>"She wanted to cancel the order as she did not expect the price to be exorbitant but the sales assistant mentioned that once the software has been installed, workman cost and product cost has been incurred and they will have to pay $2000+ even if they do not want the console.<br><br>"Given no choice, she signed the credit card and paid $2600 in total."<br><br>STOMP is contacting the shop for comment.</div>

              <p>it's not the first time ma.. that time I was scouting around for Nintendo DSlite also like that.  Lucky Plaza selling 190 when elsewhere 240..</p>
              <p>I thought got so good so I went down see see, after a few ask arounds, can tell they are all linked with each other.. then I settle down at a shop, yea he's ah beng, and asked for a black colour set.</p>
              <p>He went out and brought the DISPLAY set filled with scratches and finger prints, and tried to "tell" me it's brand new. LOL, then I politely refused and ask him for the white colour one. This White one is really new one, BUT he refused to let me test it, or examine its exterior, and cannot go further than the first white loading disclaimer screen, which means I can't check for dead pixels.</p>
              <p>"sorry hor, once you touch it considered second hand. so cannot touch."</p>
              <p>then I was actually okay with it, however before he actually showed the set to me, he went to the back of the shop and hide behind a partition and apparently very suspicious.</p>
              <p>After his demo, he tell me, "sorry, 190 is without batteries. I put batt for you liao, it's 68 dollars." I was like, wth. But i was firm. I know he would not be pleased if I reject after all the demonstrations. I came up with an excuse, "Well, it looks great but I actually more interested in the Black one which you don't have a newer one."</p>
              <p>He was glaring at me lo.. but I just say "thanks for the demo, sorry about it" and walk out. I ended up buying at a decent comic shop for $239 plus warranty and it is free to try and test for dead pixel.</p>

              <p>Wow 2.1K for modification? Haha with the 2.1K can buy an ECU upgrade to chip any VAG cars to up their bhp. Now thats real modification.</p>
              <p>Sigh this is daylight robbery and if indeed the shop is run by so called "ah bengs" then i guess its a sad country we live in. Fear the strong, prey on the weak.</p>
