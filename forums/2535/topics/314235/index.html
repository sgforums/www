              <p>Hi all!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just came back from game shop to repair my PSP screen. The owner asked me whether i upgraded my PSP using Pandora's Battery?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Now, what is Pandora's battery?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, i asked for the price for a brand new Slim and found out that additional charges is req for upgrading to CFW. When i enquired about how much i can save if i upgrade to CFW by myself, the owner said that for Slim series, the CFW upgrading is not as simple as Fat, so..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Is this true that Slim is more problematic when it comes to CFW upgrading?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I upgraded my PSPs to CFW by myself, and so far no problems occured for me, maybe i'm lucky. But the way the owner said sounds like he wanna make money by bluffing customers to upgrade through him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope you guys can clear my doubts, thanks in advance!!!</p>

              <p>he is trying to make money......</p>
              <p>its blashphemy to charge people for something thats free....ofcourse the battery and memory stick is not free but the software bloody hell is and their authors have been dead angry about this situation</p>
              <p>there is nothing problematic about upgrading cfw on slims.....</p>
              <p>A pandora battery is a normal psp battery(not slim battery) thats been modded by using free software from dark-alex and team m33.....</p>
              <p>so, the shop owner avoided saying the price first and started giving excuses....all is bullshit......</p>
              <p>do not hear the shop owner......even when i follow my fren go buy his psp i tell him dun need to be scared of upgrading himself coz i have been doing it like many times already......</p>

              <p>Ya, while the firmwares are free, i think ppl still go to shops as 'insurance'.</p>
              <p>I upgrade by placing the firmware installer into the 'Game' folder and install through the XMB. That means i'm not using Pandora's Battery method right? The site where i got my PSP fixes recently downed, but i managed to find out some info about Pandora batt, i think they are more beneficial in unbricking PSPs, cos the source didnt mention how to upgrade through it.</p>

              <p>yes you do not use pandora battery for upgrading firmwares but to unbrick or downgrade your psp......</p>
              <p>to me i think that people who 'still' go to shops are those who dunno anything and kena con or they juz want to burn money......</p>
              <p>my colleague go and downgrade and upgrade one time......the shop charged him 20 bucks for a downgrade and an upgrade of firmware......with 40 bucks you can like go watch movie and have dinner sia......</p>
              <p>at least if they do downgrading service using pandora battery it would be ok to charge abit......</p>
              <p>but just to bloody upgrade i think a 12 year old boy also can do if being directed properly sia......wtf sia....i hate bloody conmen......if wan charge can but if they start to give irrelevant and false excuses, that would be conning already sia.....wan charge just be straight foward with it lar....</p>

              <p>Another qn regarding 8GB memory card. Are there any problems/issues you fellow gamers have heard of regarding 8GB mem stick pro duo on PSP?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I read in another forum regarding the FAT16 and FAT32 embedding systems used by mem sticks. One of the posts talks about lag, but i cant remember if its lag on PC or PSP. Apparently, the bottom line is if your OS (PC or PSP) doesnt support the FAT system of the mem stick, the mem stick will lag instead. This include transfering of information and loading.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if any gamers have problems using 8GB Pro Duo, i hope can shed some light, thinking of buying it...</p>
