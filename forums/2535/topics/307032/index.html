                  middle, with the backstory filled in as it the plot developed. But even
                  if you haven't played the classic game or seen <span style="font-style: italic;">Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children, </span><a id="tag" title="Game developer, Father of Final Fantasy series" href="http://pspupdates.qj.net/tags/square-enix/281">Square Enix</a> is giving fans the story behind the story in <a title="Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7, by Square Enix for the Sony PSP" href="http://pspupdates.qj.net/category/Crisis-Core-Final-Fantasy-VII/cid/1720"><span style="font-style: italic;" title="Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7, by Square Enix for the Sony PSP">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7</span></a> - and has two videos to prove it.<br><br>The
                  first video explains the reason why Zack Fair was sent to Wutai in the
                  first place: Soldier First Class Genesis has gone rogue and Zack and
                  co. have been asked to bring him in. Add Zack's hyperenthusiastic glomp
                  to that and you've got the beginning of a story on your hands.<br><br>Square Enix's second video features <a title="Aeris Gainsborough and co. show up in Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 " href="http://pspupdates.qj.net/Crisis-Core-FF-VII-European-Spring-release-confirmed-new-screenshots/pg/49/aid/111738">another familiar face</a>,
                  but without the menace that's so often associated with him - yet.
                  Sephiroth takes the time to talk to Zack about his parents, then
                  suddenly catches himself and brings his team's focus back to the
                  mission.</span></span></span></span></p>

              eh i dun really fancy the new fighting systems.
              i really like the turn based, time bar system.
              
              anyway, the game started to get too linear at final fantasy XII.
              so i stopped playing.
              i guess the best story to me is FFVII
              but i have a friend who loves FFIV
