              <p>Which makes people wonder, cause it'll be a sellout. But for some reason they don't want to. Why? My guess is that they've decided to move on although their best stories were 7,8 and 10 imo.</p>

              <p>i suspect that there will be another FF7 game involving genesis....</p>
              <p>at the end of the credits of Dirge of Ceberus, He was seen carrying the white coloured hair guy and saying something like we still got work to do or something.....</p>
              <p>in the crisis core game got many genesis clones also, genesis's good guy gone bad i think is somewhat like sephiroth also it involves around professor hollander</p>
              <p>as for angeal he still good guy right till the end.....on one mission you will go to some village and find angeal's mother and stuff</p>

              <p>hojo treats all life as "specimens", so to make the project a success, they need to inject into a human that hasn't grown yet, that's why they go inject lucrescia to test on sephiroth</p>
