My friend was thinking about purchasing a second PSP and went down to our local EB Games to check out if they were downgradable. He knows the manager there and asked him if they could be downgraded. He said all can be for now but future PSP's will not be, this is what he told him (as he has states on other sites),<br><br>"Sony was sending out Emails to its Commercial Retailers that all new PSPs to be sent out will have 'Downgradable Prevention' built right into them. All new PSP's to be shipped out as of next week Friday, May 18th, will be a higher firmware, 4.xx (specifics were not released), but they were promised to include new security features to prevent hacks and downgrades. Apparently this is one of their first steps to start focusing on the PSP again, instead of diverting all attention to the PS3."<br><br>Now all above was stated in my hometown (well technically it would be a city lol) of Calgary, AB, Canada. No physical evidence of the above stated is true but we're taking a managers word for it. So for all you out there who are thinking about purchasing a new PSP think quick before the new non-downgradable PSP firmwares will become available.</div></blockquote><a href="http://www.acidmods.com/news/Acidnews.php?" rel="nofollow">http://www.acidmods.com/news/Acidnews.php?</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No worries. Man also said that the earth's natural resources will be used up in then next few hundred year. But who knows? Scientists will come up with new ways to replace the natural resources. It only said that it can't be downgraded now. Never say it can't be downgraded in the future. Firmwares that can't be downgraded now might be able to be downgraded a few years later? who knows? There are a lot of developers around us. Think about it again, who did downgrades for other versions other than 1.5 in the first place? Think of your version of your PSP[e.g. 3.03]. So I believe technology will improve and we have to improve with the technology too.</div>
