Care is taken to make sure information here is correct, however no 100% responsibility for that will be taken. Follow the steps at your own risk.<br><br><strong>Notes:</strong> your new mod here, let me contribute something that people have trouble with =] and save some of your money rather than paying others to unbrick for you. Guide will be improved over time with new releases if any, as well as my own corrections. i will improve this guide as and when i have the time, as of now, i will refer to the readmes provided. do tell me of mistakes<br><br><strong>Overview:</strong><br>PSPs brick usually due to corruptions to firmware (flash0) files. This can happen during flashing of firmwares (more likely), or flashing of themes (if you are stupid enough...). These bricks can be solved by the Pandora method, thanks to the promethus team. The Pandora battery will put the PSP into a "service mode", and together with the correct memory stick, a new firmware can be written to flash0, reviving your PSP.<br><br>There is another type of brick relating to a corrupted Idstorage. Idstorage is a set of keys relating to the basic running of the PSP, eg running of wifi or UMD. Thus if you screwed your IDstorage, you might find these functions not working. An IDstorage brick is unrecoverable as of 16/12, unless you have a NAND-dump, but unbricking is not 100%. Most people should not be screwing up their IDstorage, so no worries<br><br><strong>Items needed:</strong><br>1) Your bricked PSP<br>2) A working, CFW enabled PSP, preferably 3.xx<br>3) Your battery, which will be converted to a pandora/jigkick battery (either permanently or temporarily)<br>4) A Memory Stick <strong>PRO</strong> Duo. IT MUST BE A PRO! MSD WILL NOT WORK. Size at least 128mb<br>5) Your PSP charger for converting your Pandora battery back to a normal one<br><br><strong>Files needed:</strong> (thanks to qj.net and dark alex for their websites, and of course the creators of the various homebrew)<br>1) <a href="http://dl.qj.net/General-Apps/pg/12/fid/15512/catid/151" rel="nofollow">Hellcat's Pandora installer for 3.xx kernel rev 3</a> rev 3! steps remain the same, might work on upcoming 3.80<br>This is for converting your battery into a Pandora one and back, as well as formatting your MSPD into a "magic" one for unbricking.<br>2) <a href="http://dl.qj.net/Despertar-del-Cementerio-v3-PSP-Homebrew-Applications/pg/12/fid/14770/catid/151" rel="nofollow">Despertar del Cementerio v3</a><br>Think of this as an upgrade to the original "magic" MSPD.

In this case, wait for a while, and follow the button presses on top depending on your choices. Wait until the Wifi and MSPD LEDs stop flashing after a minute or so. When you are positive they have stopped flashing, press X. This might be due to an error not sending an image to the LCD screen.<br><br>If you have followed these steps correctly, GOOD LUCK!

              <p> There's a new all in one installer to do all the mentioned things easily.</p>
              <p>Think i'll ask a expert who use to be around this forum to explain since he's the one to provide me that.</p>
              <p>Basically somethang like d/l it, unzip &amp; use it!  Just like THAT! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>that might be true for the old installer, which i doubt uses the cementerio method which is the newest method. the old installer you are talking about should be about making the magic stick from the computer itself. unless you want to go through the long winded way from 1.50 &gt; 3.52m33 &gt; 3.90m33. the pandora battery still needs a working psp to make though, you can't "unzip" a pandora batt</p>
              <p><br>if you are talking about disinter 3.80, it only unzips the above listed applications to your psp. it does cut out some steps, but not "Just like THAT!". there's no such method currently as far as i know</p>

              <p><span style="color: #00ccff;">Yes, i hv to admit that it's not "like that" to do e pandora batt. </span></p>
              <p>But it sure helps to make things a lot easier for those who can't understand the different stuffs merging to make the batt.</p>
              <p>That why tis 'all in one' installer should help most PSP noobs to do e padora batt &amp; magic stick easily!</p>
              <p>All they hv to do is follow 3 sets simple instructions &amp; also use a Fat PSP battery NOT E SLIM ONE!! (look below)</p>
