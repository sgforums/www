There was a large lorry carrying tree logs was at the extreme left, the kips was in the middle and the Malaysian bike at the right with me looking at the whole show at a slow pace behindÂ…. ThenÂ….the Malaysian bike seems very pissed offÂ…. He gave a sharp sudden turn towards the kips and forced it to move towards the large lorryÂ…. The kips had no choice and braked immediatelyÂ… I managed to by pass and speed off to woodlands, not wanting to know the results of their fight.<br>Taught me somethingÂ….
