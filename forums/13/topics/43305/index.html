            <div class='col-md body'>Disc Pad Installation and Break-In<br><br>Here's a quick plug for proper maintenance of your brake system. Bleed you brakes as frequently as you can (at least once per year.) Thoroughly clean the brake caliper, dust seals, guide pins, etc with a can of automotive brake clean solution after removing your old pads. On higher mileage bikes, remember to use a micrometer to measure the thickness of your rotors. You may think a set of new pads are all you need, but your rotors might just be one ride away from the junk bin.<br><br>Once you've decided on an appropriate disc brake pad for your riding style and have them installed on your bike, you'll want to bed the pads in by making a series of gentle, controlled stops from a speed of 40-50mph. Find a nice open stretch of road. The first few stops may seem a little scary as you squeeze the brakes and get poor stopping results. Don't be alarmed. This is merely the result of the last amounts of residual moisture and adhesives working their way out of the pad and into the atmosphere. After a few more controlled stops, you should feel a dramatic increase in braking effectiveness.<br><br>Resist the urge to immediately go out and hammer on the brakes with high speed, tire smoking stops. This will likely lead to pad glazing, a condition where the resins in the pad crystalize on the friction surface, resulting in poor stopping performance and excessive noise. If this occurs, the pads are useless. Throw them away, buy another set and start the whole process over again.<br></div>
