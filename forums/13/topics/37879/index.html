Hahahaa</div></blockquote>actually banning it on pavement makes the pavement much safer for pedestrains. If such scooter can go up to more than 25km/h, what you think will cause when they bang into people? It was on the newspaper saying that a bicycle has caused a woman's hand to dislocate as the bicycle crash into her hand. Imagine a bicycle can caused this. I think bicycle should not be riden on the pavements. Neither should they be on the road, sometimes these bicycles actually caused a nuisance to motorbikes. I have personal experience. Coz I am working in industrial park, all this bicycles going around made me siamming them all the time.<br><br>and sometimes seeing those mothers riding with one kid in front and one kid behind makes me really wonder, how can the mother make sure that no accident will happen which will endanger her childen. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Bicycles and motorized scooters should be riden in the park for leisure and should not be use as substitution for public transport. If the public transport is cheaper, people would not mind paying it to travel a short distance. But now even those feeder bus cost 70 cents. Little wonder people wuold prefer endangering their lives than pay this amount to travel a short distance.<br><br>All this actually round down to expensive public transport. Agree???</div>

Neither should they be on the road, sometimes these bicycles actually caused a nuisance to motorbikes. I have personal experience. Coz I am working in industrial park, all this bicycles going around made me siamming them all the time. </blockquote><strong>Sorry, but can't agree with you there. Bicycles are a legitimate form of transport. Cycling is healthy, free, emits ZERO pollution... I cycle from Tampines to Bukit Timah everyday. I obey all the rules and use hand signals to indicate my intentions at least 10 metres before I carry them out. I also wear a helmet and gloves on every ride.<br><br>I have seen many drivers and riders who are downright dangerous on the road. Does that mean that all drivers and riders should be banned and everyone should just take MRT and buses? Even then, how about the bus drivers who purposely run the ah pek motorcyclist near to the kerb just to get past them? How about banning the MRT becos cars can get onto the tracks and the SMRT says that they can't do anything to improve the situation?</strong><br><br><blockquote>Bicycles and motorized scooters should be riden in the park for leisure and should not be use as substitution for public transport. If the public transport is cheaper, people would not mind paying it to travel a short distance. But now even those feeder bus cost 70 cents. Little wonder people wuold prefer endangering their lives than pay this amount to travel a short distance. </blockquote><strong>It's not about the money. I have 2 cars and a motorbike. But I would choose to ride one of my bicycles anytime if possible.<br><br>The problem is lack of education. If your case is just ban them cos they're dangerous, then MOTORBIKES should be FIRST on the list!</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the problem with cyclists (electric or motor or watever sai) is that many of them think they don't have to follow traffic rules because they still considered themselves as pedestrians.<br><br>it is very common to find them riding AGAINST heavy traffic, and expecting cars and bikes etc to give way to them. it is also common to find many of them out late at nite, cycling along extremely dark areas with no lights at all, and yet if you bang into them, it's your fault.<br><br>cyclists should be kept off the roads and restricted to pavements only.</div>
