I also wear a helmet and gloves on every ride.<br><br>I have seen many drivers and riders who are downright dangerous on the road. Does that mean that all drivers and riders should be banned and everyone should just take MRT and buses? Even then, how about the bus drivers who purposely run the ah pek motorcyclist near to the kerb just to get past them? How about banning the MRT becos cars can get onto the tracks and the SMRT says that they can't do anything to improve the situation? It's not about the money. I have 2 cars and a motorbike. But I would choose to ride one of my bicycles anytime if possible.<br><br>The problem is lack of education.

In fact, I don't think it is "right" for anything, whether living or mechanical, to hold up traffic.<br><br>But, people don't think less of bicycles and other slow moving vehicles and drive them off the road.<br><br>But my point is: the motorists over there have respect for ALL road users, whether their vehicles are engine powered or human powered.<br><br>I asked my friend why nobody tried to overtake me although it was quite easy to do so, and he told me that the motorists knew that cyclists had to maintain an optimum cadence to climb up a mountain, hence motorists tend to show patience so as not to disrupt the cyclists' concentration. Well, France is afterall a nation that loves cycling.<br><br>There are overtaking lanes every few KMs, so that traffic wouldn't be stuck for too long.<br><br>The same goes for trucks carrying heavy loads. The cars will just travel slowly behind them until the overtaking lane comes up. Although it is possible to sqeeze through, rarely anyone does, becos they know the dangers of doing so.<br><br>If you feel that it's "wrong" for a slow moving vehicle to hold up traffic for a few KMs due to uncontrollable circumstances, then wouldn't it make sense that you also agree that vehicles like 3-tonners, coaches...etc should be banned from going up a mountain on a single carriageway?<br><br>All I'm saying is that there shouldn't be "classes" on the road. All road users deserve the same respect, and anyone allowed onto the road should know how to earn it.</strong></div>
