            <div class='col-md body'>im sending the organisers this...<br>somehow i cant get it posted in singaporebike forum...<br><br>Original welcome address taken from http://www.bigbikefest.com.sg/main.html. my replies in italics.<br><br>WELCOME ADDRESS<br>Welcome to the Official Singapore Big Bike Fest website<br>The SBBF 2006 is the 1st motorbike festival of its kind in Singapore, created by bikers for bikers!<br><br><span style="color: red;">(This is NOT the 1st motorbike festival of its kind in Singapore unless your talking bout how bad it was. Sorry no bragging rights for you. Created by bikers for bikers? I think you sorely got confused with cycling and motorcycling. Ps. Lance Armstrong is a not a biker...)</span><br><br>This festival will showcase a range of stock and custom motorcycles from around the region and provide a platform for bike enthusiasts and bike novice alike to enjoy Biker-related activities, entertainment and food and beverage.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>(Oh I did remember seeing some bikes from our neighbor up north. Then again I think they belonged to the staff of the eateries nearby.<br>Slide the JD bottle n win a free bottle of JD Coke and the swing the hammer to make the bung hit the bell game are NOT a biker related activities.<br><br>Best bike competition, this is what I posted on another forum. Â“word of advice for all you guys who ever thought of winning one. no matter how much $ you pour into your bike and how great it looks. Make sure your bike is the same brand as the main sponsor or else donÂ’t waste your time...Â” and no I did not enter and im not a sore loser.<br><br>Biker babe contest? HAHA! the gals who joined the biker babe contest were so dolled up that they all looked liked clones. cant really tell them apart. organizers. This is not miss universe. one of the things biking symbolizes is freedom. let the gals wear what they want &amp; doll themselves up, instead u made them look like a bunch of bananas. canÂ’t tell one from the other. then again. they seem like most of them come from the same agent...<br><br>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE? I think the existing eateries in Clarke quay will be pleasantly surprised that they have Â‘participatedÂ’ in providing food for your event. Drinks?. Hey I donÂ’t mind JD and Beer but $6 a pop and served in a plastic cup... Thank god Hooters was open. And Lucky thing for the parents that there was a small convenience stall nearby to get soft drinks for their kids.)</span><br><br>Fans of Harley Davidson, Ducati, MV Agusta, Triumph will be treated to the latest that these brands and many more have to offer, and It also offers our regional bikers, mainly from Malaysia and Thailand, another reason to visit our sunny Singapore. SBBF strives to become the iconic festival that local as well as international bikers can look forward to for years to come.<br><span style="color: red;"><br>(Really bad first impression youÂ’re making to our overseas guests when you invite them over during the IMF season where hotels cost 2 to 3 times their original cost and you cancel out the scheduled bike convoy. Yes there were a few new models but nothing special that they canÂ’t see online or at their local dealer. Only showcasing a few odd vendors who had little or no good deals and promotions is really disappointing. Good thing I did not invite my friends from up north, if they did show up, the only term I can think of is in hokkien Â“sibeh pai seh, lau kwee korÂ”. Only thing I was impressed with is Kudos to the road marshals! They were well organized and really polite)</span><br><br>The inaugural event to be held at Clarke Quay Singapore on 16 &amp; 17 of September 2006 is also open to a natural traffic of 300,000 families, and tourists who frequent Clarke Quay on weekends.<br><span style="color: red;"><br>(300,000? Does the person who quoted this figure have double or triple vision? Or was he/she counting the number of cars that drive by the area. PS. Kids that frequent MOS should not be included as your event was a day event.)</span><br><br>With extensive marketing initiatives on radio, (Power 98, Dongli 88.3), magazines, (Maxim ,Motor Culture, Eyesight, I-S), online portals, (www.singaporeharley.com, www.ebay.com.sg, www.nightlife.sg), direct mailers and posters in more than 300 bike and nightlife outlets and tertiary schools, the SBBF targets over half a million youths, aged between 18 Â– 35, with a natural spillover to the Â“young at heartÂ” riders of Â“big bikesÂ” who are between 35 Â– 55 (secondary target).<br><span style="color: red;"><br>(Yeah I saw the ads in some mags and I got the spam. Design wise it was impressive, sounded good too. Too bad the event itself was otherwise.)</span><br><br>Special Thanks to our main sponsor Harley Davidson of Singapore for making this happen, and our partners, Jack Daniels, Ebay, Power98 , MAXIM, Motor Culture Asia, Eyesight, Gotham Penthouse and Clarke Quay, as well as Traffic Police for their support, contributions and advise.<br>The SBBF 2006 is a fun event not to be missed. See you at Clarke Quay, where bikers have more fun!<br><br><span style="color: red;">(I will make it a point to miss SBBF 2007 and I had fun only at Hooters.)</span><br><br>Warmest Regards,<br><br>Jeremy Glenn<br>Managing Director<br>Threesixty Communications Pte Ltd<br><br>Irene Ang<br>CEO<br>Fly Entertainment Pte Ltd<br><br>(Which of you is the biker that organized this?)<br></div>
