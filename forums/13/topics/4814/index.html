            <div class='col-md body'>My best wishes to your friend. Hope he recovers soon!<br><br>I encountered an incident today at Clementi. Was making a right turn at a cross junction to the next street with one of those mini lorry at the right lane beside me. Bloody driver just turned into my lane while we moved across the junction. Good thing I was aware that something like that could happen which is why I was around 3/4 of the lorry length behind. Gave him a long blast of my horn and stuck my middle finger at him before accelerating away from this idiot.<br><br>I guess the point here is that we have to always be on the alert whilst riding. Never assume you have the right of way and be ready to react to any situation. Quite stressful sia...<br></div>
