            <div class='col-md body'>I met with accident on 23 May, which was thursday night. I was travelling along Ang Mio Kio Ave 8, then when reaching the junction of Ang Mio Kio Ave 8 and Ang Mio Kio Street 41, a stupid car swerved into my lane suddenly. I was travelling on the center, 2nd lane. The stupid female driver was on the 3rd lane, right lane. The 1st lane was the bus lane. She claimed that the car in front of her stopped suddenly and she had to swerve out. But that lane she was travelling on allowed cars to go forward or turn into Ang Mio Kio Street 41, so cars turning naturally had to stop. The left side of the car brushed against the right side of my bike. I tried to aviod the collision by turning to my left, but i was already travelling at her blind spot when she swerved towards me suddenly, so there's a limit to my reaction time.<br><br>My gf and I suffered multiple abrasions on our limps and body, while my bike's fork, gear, fairing and such were all damaged...<br>Wat's Infuriating was that after that, the stupid driver's husband said bikes always have a tendacy to be unbalanced and I fell off the bike myself and his wife did not knock into me!! wat the hell is this.<br><br>My gf is now hopitalising and I have difficulity moving around and using my right hand. I can't believe there are such irresponsible ppl.<br><br>Life is fragile...especially on a bike, such things could happen when I was juz travelling slowly at a speed of 40m/h ++. All it takes is an idiot driver to end ur life. Imagine if I was travelling at a higher speed, I would not have been alive to tell this story...<br><br>Now I duno how to face my gf's family...everything is such a mess right now....<br><br>[This message has been edited by N|rVaNa07 (edited 25 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually wat i wanted to say is. if you are injured during the accident, call the police and make the report immediately. dun take down the particulars yourself and then wait till sometime later then report. cos you might forget something or even add on more things, this will either give chance for those reckless ppl to say something. or even get away with it. once you are injured, call 999 immediately. let the police handle. they won't be able to get away one.</div>
