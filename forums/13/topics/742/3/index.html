            <div class='col-md body'>I guess there's some miscommunications on everybody's part. (I hope I haven't) I think the hot blooded CBR rider thought the SP was trying to challenge him after the former playfully disturbed the SP w/o considering the consequences. Then the SP thought the CBR was trying to makan him. In the process, both of them nearly caused an accident with the yellow top taxi. With these, the SP rider decided to pour out his grievance on the forum. But the taxi passenger thought the SP rider was trying to distort the story as her encounter was different. While he just post what he was thinking all the while instead of distorting what he knew.<br><br>Well... All arguments can come to rest. I also meet pple who cannot wait to cut me on the road. But what can we do? Since they wanna show their powers, let them be. But we should do our part of not getting involved in these 'road fights'. It's quite senseless also. Our licence don't come easy. Especially bike licence if you intend to upgrade.<br><br>Ride safely, ride smartly.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with MS...<br>i juz think IT is not appropriate to juz put ppl's number plate on the internet.<br>I think both is at fault loh, juz as MS say, the SP nearli met with an accident due to this kind of road racing, n he push all the blame to the CBR. ASK urself, if u lan lan slowli ride for a distance, i dun think the CBR is so bo liao, cause he may think u dun wish to continue the hell racing.<br>But if u wnt to continue the hell race, u got to bear with all the consequence. N not shift blame to others.<br>Go to the track n u knoe wat i mean, play there mean got to bear with the consequence.<br>Unless u got a sponsor.</div>
