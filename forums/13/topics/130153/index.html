            <div class='col-md body'>I recently needed to go to Cantonment Police station to make a report. I wanted to take MRT but my dad wanted to send me. He dropped me off in front of the station and went off. He got a traffic fine of $120 and 3 pts for stopping those few seconds. Now he's yelling at me over it saying "i kaypo for police and he got fined".<br><br>To be honest I agree with him. I mean its the principle of it. I was helping the police in their investigations and they can't bend the rules slightly? Whats the point in helping them then?<br><br>He already has 12 pts to his name and I just got my license so its under probhation. I would honestly take the pts if I had the normal 23 pts but I only got 12 pts maximum. I know I am selfish but I don't want to take it in case I hit a camera. Do you think there;s anything that can be done to waive these 3 pts? Please help me.</div>

He just dropped me off then the fine came "stopping in a no stopping zone".
