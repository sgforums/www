            <div class='col-md body'>What a wonderful saturday? Had a dental appt. at alexandra today.<br>First i was greeted by a parking summon ~~$8~~, the time given was 3.25am. Then i proceed to carry on my journey. 2nd thing at bukit merah, i was going on the leftmost lane when this guy suddenly jump out of the pavement straight at me but he bail out at the last moment. When i turn around, i saw him smiling chin to chin. I though i lost my way and went somewhere near woodbridge. 3rd thing, i was waiting for the road to clear at the alexandra hospital's exit/entrance 'cause i'm making a right turn at the next immediate junction, i have to cut three lanes mah.... A cab behind me try his horn on me 'cause he wanted to turn and keep left only (the first lane is clear at that time). So i raise my hand (signalling wtf), he gave me a thumbs up <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> . Fourth thing, this i can understand 'cause certainly is my wrong. The cars were travelling rather slow on the furthest right lane.... i cut infront of one car, overtook the car infront and was on my way home...(my wrong to cut into his lane). Think he gave chase, came behind me, kept really close no. plate 4035 can see it clearly in my mirrors. He HIGH BEAMED me for dont' know for what F**K, its a freaking bright sunny day. So i slowed down, adjust my slippers. He exits. Fifth thing, i'm reaching home. I was at the right turn, it was time to turn when this 2a sportsbike with a darkblue paintwork something 475 took off really fast..... nothing wrong. But he turn back look look, after he kup another corner, he turn back look look again, slowing down seemingly waiting for me. i turned to another carpark instead of mine. When i came out, he was there on the  main rd but far enough so i turn left out to the main rd first. There he was in my rear mirrors, saw him coming on my left in between me and the pavement. How can i race with him when i'm riding TA200? i shifted to the right, giving him more space and he sped past. Hmm, the day is still young eh?</div>
