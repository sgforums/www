First make sure you are 100% innocent. None of that traveling on small roads at 70kmph, showing middle finger, kicking cars...... How you can get to visit the courts is how im gona tell you to put the other fella there instead.<br><br>If you have time to spend and wana c these F**KERS burn  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> Just go to any police station and tell then you wana do a civil summons. You will be given forms to fill &amp; have your statement taken down (make sure you get the story straight and dont get yourself summoned in the process). The TP will be forwarded this report and pending their eveluation of the report, a summons will be filed against the driver. Be prepared to be called by the TP investigator to call you up for an appointment before he/she issues the summons k. She will advise you on the legalities of the matter and if you wish to pursue the matter you might have to attend court if the defendant does not simply pay the fine and wants to fight it out.<br><br>I did this once to a tailgater, whom asked me for a fight when we stopped at a traffic light. It was a hassle to get the summons done plus the interview  at TP cause it was all during office hours but well worth it!!! The D**K probably doesnt even know what hit him and just paid the summons quietly thinking I was LKY's grandson!!!

He thought he was good by trying that stunt. But of course, you must be able to afford the responsibilities. Watch out for those fearsome white rabbits on the roads. On SG roads, 90+ on the extreme right lane is just rite when the left hand traffic is going only at 70-80+ with that density of traffic. He was definately nuts to wanna travel anything faster than that all the way. He does not have the rite to show high beam all the way. It'll endager the motorist in front whose vision can be badly affected.<br><br>If Henry thinks that I'm too slow on the rite hand lane at 90+ during that time, then think again. My speed was just rite in that kinda traffic condition. Any faster would've invited TP's attention. If anyone were to be in that situation first hand, i guess most would've done the same.</div>
