So, I want to ask you few question before I decide whether I will go for it or not.<br><br>1. How much money normally one spend to pass 2A? I am not a racing type person, so I do not posses excelent skill riding bike.. I am just a soso rider.. I can ride, and seldom fall..<br>2. How long does it take for the 2A?<br>3. How much is the insurance for 3'rd party 400cc fairing bike (400cc)?<br>4. How much is the road tax for 400cc bike?<br><br>Let's say, I am at Bishan, my workplace at Tanjong Pagar, and I only ride the bike to go to work.

I am just a soso rider.. I can ride, and seldom fall.. </strong></blockquote>You can take a look at the fee structure here:<br>http://www.bbdc.com.sg/courses/cl2afee_new.html<br>Fee structure in other driving centers shouldn't be much different.<br>You need to pass 3 practical stages and attend 1 theory class before you can take TP test. So you can calculate the minimum amount of money need to be spent. I read somewhere that in average ppl take 5 practical lessons to pass 2A test, but I don't remember the link. About TP test, sometimes it depends on your luck and the mood of the testers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> . Everytime you fail TP test, you need to book 2 revision classes. I spent about S$200 when taking my 2A.<br><br><blockquote><strong>2. How long does it take for the 2A?</strong></blockquote>The answer to this question is closely related to the answer of previous question. It took my about 2 months to get my 2A, because of work commitment. I could only take evening classes, and they're often fully booked. I failed the TP test once, so must wait for about 1 month for the next test. The auction you mentioned closes on May 24. If you're only eyeing that bike, definitely you won't make it. You can buy the bike now, and leave it in the parking lot until you get your 2A  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><strong>3. How much is the insurance for 3'rd party 400cc fairing bike (400cc)?</strong></blockquote>Guess that depends on your age and type / brand of bike. It's better to contact the insurance company for exact quotation.<br><br><blockquote><strong>4. How much is the road tax for 400cc bike?</strong></blockquote>Here's the tax structure for motorcycles:<br>http://www.lta.gov.sg/motoring_matters/motoring_vo_tax_motor.htm<br>In the example it's mentioned that your road tax will be S$140 annually.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Let's say, I am at Bishan, my workplace at Tanjong Pagar, and I only ride the bike to go to work. How much money I need to spend weekly for petrol?</strong></blockquote>The distance between Bishan and T.Pagar is about 10+ km, and you need to find out the fuel consumption of SV400. Here's what I got on the Net: http://www1.suzuki.co.jp/motor/kankyo/road/sv400k4.html<br>I can't read Japanese, but by guessing the content of the page it seems the consumption is 37km/l, when ridden at 30km/h. Nobody it his right mind would ride at 30km/h. So it's better to search for the actual consumption on the Net or by asking someone who has owned SV400 before. I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out to be more economical than a 150cc 2-stroker like SP or KRR.<br><br><blockquote><strong>What is your opinion? Is it worth to buy?</strong></blockquote>The answer to this question is highly relative. Just calculate your budget carefully, and if money matter has been settled, follow your heart and get your bike!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The lessons of 2A/2 are much more compact and in terms of course length is shorter than 2B (not lesson hour, lesson hour same as 2B).<br><br>Getting your Class 2A/2 will be quicker than your 2B that is for sure, unless you don't take lesson regularly.<br><br>Also Class 2A/2, (what I heard, dunno true or not)TP will look at your riding attitude, traffic rules and how you conduct yourself on the road, lesser on your skills on how to do pylon, ebrake, etc, as this skills you should know already.<br><br>For bike cost, insurance, $$$ related issues, I have to agree wif SnailRider, depends on your bike you are planning to get, as you know some insurance company has already black-listed some bikes on the market (due to their high buang rate :mrgreen<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>Take me for example:<br>I ride Suzuki GSX 400 Impulse. Road tax about 70/half-year, 140/full-year, 3rd party insurance $214 (after no-claim discount 15%)<br>Petrol wise, Total milage for aday is about 50Km (to and fro from work), plus weekend go out, one week around 300Km, pump about 12-14 litres per week. My bike is fully paid already so if you have installment, you have to include that in your budget as well.</div>

They emphasize on safety aspects, rather than obstacle tests. They're more forgiving in obstacle tests for 2A, and even more forgiving for class 2 (unless if you make an IF mistake).<br><br>Probably because they assume you already have experience riding on the streets, where safety is more important. The obstacle courses are just to make sure you're able to handle bigger and heavier bike properly, and most of the time it's not a problem for experienced rider.</div>
