Firstly.. telling them you never go till sooo fast as mentioned by the police.. (which can help you lower your fine if possible) and that you are rushing someone back to camp cause is too late ready.. Something like that.. if really cannot.. than LL lor. </div></blockquote>i saw the radar device myself... and the speed was recorded on it..116km/h<br><br>done my research... 47km/h is within the 40-50km/h overshoot limit..<br>which is -12 demerit points... and a fine of less den 1k for first time offenders..<br><br>most of the past offenders usually get a fine of 600-900 buckz.. depending on the judge's mood..<br><br>well few more days to go b4 i appear in court... wish me luck..</div>
