Things like dropping 3 feet to a hard surface, chemicals ( body oil, gas fumes, etc.) being hit by debris at highway speeds cut the lifespan dramatically. The expanded poly-styrene material inside the helmet degrades over time and is less able to provide impact protection.  If you or your loved one is using a helmet over 5 years old, please get them into a new one. Convince them to buy a new one or give them one as a present.<br><br>The new flip front style helmet is rapidly becoming a favorite by the EMT's and Medics. They afford  EMTs access to the face without removing the helmet possibly causing more injury to the neck and head areas to administer oxygen and/or medication to the injured. Normally they would have to cut off a helmet with a cut saw or use the "jaws of life" to cut the chin guard off of a full face helmet. Now, they simply raise the face shield.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choosing a Motorcycle Helmet </span><br><br>The most important piece of motorcycle safety equipment that you can buy is a helmet. Every rider benefits from wearing a helmet, no matter how great or how little their level of experience. In order to choose a helmet that offers the most protection without sacrificing comfort or style, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offers some guidelines.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be sure your helmet meets the DOT standard.</span><br><br>Make sure that your helmet meets the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 218. First, look for the DOT symbol on the outside back of the helmet. Then, look for a label inside the helmet stating the manufacturer's name, month and year of manufacture, construction materials, helmet model and size, and owner information. A complying helmet must have both labels.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Make sure your helmet is well made.</span><br><br>Helmets that comply with the federal safety standard will have a firm polystyrene (Styrofoam) inner liner of about one-inch and weigh about three pounds. They will also have sturdy chinstraps with solid rivets. Safe helmets will never feature spikes or other protruding decorations.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Think about style.</span><br><br>Full-face helmets offer the most protection in a collision. Plastic face shields protect you from wind, dust, rain, insects, and road debris thrown up from cars.   If you buy a helmet without a face shield, be sure to wear goggles to protect your eyes. Remember, a windshield is not an adequate substitute for a face shield or goggles. And neither are eyeglasses as they cannot keep your eyes from watering and are easily dislodged.<br><br>A design such as the German Army style or skull cap style may be a clue to an unsafe helmet. Generally, unsafe helmets are noticeably smaller in diameter and thinner than ones meeting the DOT standard.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Make sure your helmet can be seen.</span><br><br>Brightly colored helmets increase your visibility to other vehicles. Add reflective tape on the back and sides of the helmet for even greater visibility.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Make sure your helmet fits properly.</span><br><br>Always try on a helmet before you buy it. Your helmet should feel snug and it should not turn freely around your head. It should not be able to move back and forth on your head. A helmet should not in any way prevent you from turning your head to observe traffic. All helmets are required to provide the wearer with a 210รยบ field of vision.<br><br>When you wear a properly fitted helmet, wind noise is actually reduced. Although a helmet does reduce the intensity of sounds, it reduces the intensity of all sounds equally. Loud external sounds such as car horns and sirens are still very audible above all other street noises.<br><br>Each brand of helmet fits differently. So, try on a variety of brands to find the one that fits you best. The dealership staff will assist you with the proper fit.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Always fasten and tighten the chinstrap.</span><br><br>An unfastened helmet will fly off in a crash. Whenever you have the opportunity, check the chinstrap to make sure it is still secure.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid wearing a damaged helmet.</span><br><br>A used helmet may have been involved in a crash and damaged in ways that are not obvious. Even falls from places like the motorcycle's seat or the end of a handlebar shorten the life span of a helmet. Be sure to replace your helmet if it has been in a crash. Any damage to a helmet reduces its effectiveness, so replace your helmet if it has been damaged. If you are not sure that your helmet needs to be replaced, arrange to return it to the manufacturer for inspection.  Care for your helmet as indicated in your owner's manual.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess racing helmets and bike helmets are very similiar bah. I just want to ask, while those flip-up fronts allow EMTs good access to the face, in the case of an accident, isin't it much weaker in the fronta area compared to a proper fixed full face helmet? My 1st helmet was one with a frontal flip up. but I had to get a proper full face one because the flip ups are not considered strong enough to withstand a serious impact, n were thus banned for use in racing. I understand that for motorbiking, the speeds are less extreme, but then those helmets DO have a fundamental weakness right?<br><br>Also, I noticed that singapore doesn't seem to use the SNELL standard much where helmets are concerned. I wonder how many motorcyclists actually know about the importance of a SNELL certification for a helmet?</div>

The PSB board having this advert, where this son bought a helmet without a sticker and his parents told him he shouldn't but helmets which haven't been tested by PSB and dun have their sticker. The helmet he was holding was a Arai GP5 which costs over $1000, possibly as much as $1500. Snell S2000 standard, with Nomex lining and fit for even Formula1 racing.
