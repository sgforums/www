U can't see things clearly among you and your wife actually.<br><br>Anyway, from my point of view, have you considered, she is your wife, u can discuss it with her, thats what husband and wife got to communicate. Let her understand what u r thinking, let it be financial constraint or individual needs. Compromise something between yourselves.<br><br>To be frank, ask yourself some key questions:<br><br>1.) Do you really need the bike more? Or your wife needs the car more?<br>2.) Can your financial status allow you to proceed what you're doing?<br>3.) Does your wife understand what you're facing?<br>4.) So what if you got the bike, but end up husband and wife relationship become like shit?<br>5.) Or ask yourself, issit your wife that is the problem? Coz as u said she don't pay a single cent, does that mean she don't care about the financial status of the family?<br>6.) Last, if u really wan a bike, have you thought of getting a 2nd hand? Which is cheaper and can satisfy your bike need?<br><br>Hope these helps...</div>
