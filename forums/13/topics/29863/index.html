            <div class='col-md body'>Geeze..seems like they never improved their services at all........<br><br>I brought  my first bike(TZR 125) from them in 1995 and hell lots of problems with the bike.. Firstly i was told to come and get the bike on our agreed time and date. When i went on that day, the Sales Person told me it was not ready yet...asked me come 2 days later...Well, i was just a newbie at that time..so no choice had to listen. 2 days later, went to get the bike, made 2 wait 3 hrs later before i got the bike..then nvm...so i happily rode my bike out...less than 500 away...my bike broke down.....and had to walk back to complain....and.......(story too long already..but i guess u get the idea and my experience with Mah Motor)...i might be suay lah too..but since then never ever go back to them to buy bikes liao.<br><br>Btw I'm a newbie here in Sg forums......Hi everyone.....</div>

See the mechanic's service manual from the manufacturer and ask around. Then learn more and DIY more. It's good for ourselves especially during long distance ride or track.</div>

They like to chop newbies. Give extra service which never existed and charge heavily on them. KNN, I was badly chopped during my 2B days. Recently when I went with a friend to look at their new R1, they quoted 22k. I believe many hidden charges inside and I told my friend to leave the place.</div>
