            <div class='col-md body'>The collision is truely a tragedy but  some good can happen from it. Most mistakes led to improvement. Lets not find out whos at fault but lets improve the situation. I never said the the Gov is the best but its better then most. Imagine living in some of our poorer neighbours, can u still get online to this forum or even ride yr darling bike ard. Most likely is that u are thinking if you will have food to eat or a roof over yr head. Lets say u are the better off ones, are u able to walk ard safely carrying yr new HP or fearing ppl will chop off yr hand just to steal the gold wedding ring thats stuck to yr finger. We may enjoy more freedom and cheaper road use with some other form of Gov but do u prefer to risk some internal conflict for that kinda of improvement. We are a small country and i dare say we are the best in terms of our size. Say if the Gov decides to tell everyone wats the 'true' situation are and the next thing u know is that some other country will use our weakness to wage a war or something. Its sad to say this but knowing the true really hurts sometime. I dun say that i am supper happy with our country but i am not complaining so much because i know our country might be much much worse. All the above are my personal believe and i have no intention to flame and our post. Ride well ppl.</div>
