            <div class='col-md body'>Hello. I have this problem, dunno if anyone can help.<br>I just bought a 2nd hand SP last week. These few days, I have a LOT of difficulty starting the bike in the mornings. I take 10-15mins just to kickstart it! I dunno what happened. Also, these few times, I noticed that there is coolant dripping out of the tube below when I kickstart. I dont think its gotta do with my fuel and battery, they seem ok. Can anyone give any advice?<br>Another thing....Can anyone gimmme suggestions to what paintwork is nice on the SP?<br>Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding starting the bike, have you tried opening the choke then try starting the bike? If this doesn't work, then it could be that the spark plug needs to be replaced.<br><br>Are you sure your bike is dripping coolant? If so, then better get the tube replaced!<br><br>No idea about paint work. I thought the original design is pretty good? Don't see the point in doing painting as the cost is rather high.</div>

Hopefully the problem can be solved.<br><br>Anyway, the bike shop offered a repaint coz the bike's fairing scratched and some other parts too.

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah i have the same problem as u. anyway the trick is to pull up the choke and keep on kickstarting for 2-3 times. however when u do this crazykicking, u have to turn ur key to the off position (not ON or LOCK).<br><br>After the 3rd kick or so, i usually have no problem to start the bike....of coz, u have to turn the key back to the ON position lah<br><br>try it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Some people will tell you there is a difference, however slight. But I think using the plug as recommended in the bike manual is good enough. For our type of bike, don't think there is much discernable difference.<br><br>2) Engine oil brand is also another subjective topic. Different people got different recommendations. I think the more important thing is to do your oil change at the required interval.<br><br>3) The Arai rainsuit available from Chiap Lee is really good stuff. However, rather pricey compared to the Pro-Grip one available at LAB. I have the Arai one and it is holding up pretty well in our monsoon seasons  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
