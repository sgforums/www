NO SUCH THING AS 3 MONTHS' instalments upfront!!<br><br>5. if the motordiam has the right to repossess your bike and want to do so, they must inform you in writing 14 days in advance! if not, they must prove that you're someone who will conceal or hide the bike.<br><br>6. after they have taken your bike, they must deliver in person within 14 days a receipt that they have taken your bike, if not, they will cease to have rights under the agreement, meaning they have no power to make you pay anything. however, if you decide to take back your bike, the agreement will become effective again.<br><br>wah lanz.. really got a lot of things.. i can't finish reading yet..<br><br>please, to all, please take a look at the hire purchase act. this is a law that governs all hire purchase agreements. if motorshops are clearly in violation of this act, action can be taken. i will find out more on this topic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> nbz... all unfair practices by the motordiams..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>------------------<br>Ain't I the fastest rider on the planet?!?! =P</div>
