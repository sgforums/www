            <div class='col-md body'>maybe u have a point, but what's wrong with getting bikes such as r1 pgm4 and so on? im not an expert when it comes to bikes but somehow i believe these riders shouldn't be stereotyped as poseurs or wannabes. true some of them love to "whack" their bike and blow their exhausts like crazy but so what? just let them be, just be safe on the road and enjoy riding, we are all motorists and we shouldn't be against one another.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

LIM CHU KANG runway is certainly a good place... dont go there wif a lot of bikes... and dont go there and run straight away... i normally recce wif a few friends up and down the stretch till sungei gedong camp... then go into the small road leading to the air base... and up the cemetry to see if there are any diversions there <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> (to mr TP, i dont test top speed if i think it will endanger other members of the public.. and if i see that u guys are anywhere in the vicinity u can be sure i wont test at all... and actually i am testing a rs50cc aprilia my friend brought back from uk <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> honest!)<br>this is the best place i have tried in my life... and so far some of the speeds i have got there is really cool for my own standards.. i am not saying what speeds... but my bike at 6th gear 12300rpm...<br><br>2. Aye from tuas checkpoint towards jurong.. sunday morning 7am tried once there... but manage to see 6th gear 12000rpm give and take 100rpm... never try there again coz found better place to test..<br><br>3. TPE... but very bumpy... so unless ur suspension is tuned to hardest settings u gonna get really shaken... and make sure ur damper is there... tpe from east towards north is good... the stretch b4 jln kayu should be perfect... saw 270+ there.. but never tried again after finding better places to test...<br><br>4. so far fastest i ever see on CTE was 255kmh... but i was getting thrown all over my bike coz of all the uphill and down hills and the bumps! that was thrilling.. but i wont do it again... heheheheh (to any tp reading this... i had a bad stomach ache and had to go shit really soon otherwise i would never go above 90kmh on the expressways...)<br><br>5. ECP towards AYE the straight road above the old train station at tanjong pagar there... i dont think u can test top speed here... but if there is a blue flashing light hot on ur tail all the way from east coast.. this is the place u can lose him! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> 270+ was wat i saw on my meter... and chances of having volvos parked at the side waiting to catch u? nahhh not a chance! too narrow!<br><br>lastly... i am bullshitting all the figures... as what others like to do... so mr TP.. if u are reading... its actually all just bull... so please dont believe what u read... i am just joking <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
