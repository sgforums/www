            <div class='col-md body'>Was on my way to pick up something from my friend this morning,suddenly,a cat dashed across my path so i jammed the brakes immediately,unfortunately,this had not prevented me from running over the cat. What it did caused however is a collusion from a Super4 behind.I got down the car to check on the rider. Luckily the rider was not seriously hurt,only some scratches on his forearm. But the cat is dead. What a gruesome death!<br>The Super4 rider insisted tt it was my fault n demanded compensation from me($500)for repairs on his bike n medical bills but i refused saying tt i had no choice as a cat had came into my path. Further more, he was not folllowing a safety distance.Seeing no further conclusion from this argument, we exchanged personal particulars/licence plates n left.B4 he left,He said tt he's going to sue my pants off for this but i had not heard from him till now.<br><br>What should i do? Should i make a police report or just report to my insurance coy? Asked a few friends n they said its his fault as he had not followed the safety distance rule,n i could claim the damages on my car from him. Need views from u guys. Thanx!<br><br>P.S izzit against the law to run over a cat n leaving the scene wifout reporting?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wat I heard is that when you that your car practical, the instructor should have told you that if you can avoid the cat without causing any accident you may do so if not then you will be the one at fault. They will rather have you killing the cat rather then causing any accident. That's what I heard when I'm taking my car practical.</div>

After asking my friends, i den realise tat in an accident, if u happen to bang ppl from the rear, u are at fault. stupid right... no choice.. i think the S4 behind u should not follow so close. if he is keeping a distance, he might not be able to stop but maybe can avoid banging into u ....<br>juz my opinion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the S4 is trying to escape responsibility. i disagree with Henry, RAIDER u are in no wrong.<br><br>if i were u, i would have jammed brake too bcos i look forward more than i look in the mirror.<br><br>whether it is a cat or not isn the point. if a piano was to drop from the sky suddenly and land in front of ur car, naturally u would jam brake right? if during that split second while u are braking u look in the mirror and see de S4, would u let go your brake and crash into the piano? allowing him to avoid an accident while urself bear the costs for something u could have avoided if u braked. de S4 was following too close. no doubt abt that.<br><br>The exact same thing happened to me last nite at Changi V, when i was turning into ChangiV from loyang avenue by filtering left, i checked for traffic and when i turned bac the car in front brake from 40km/h to 0km/h just in time to avoid hitting a cat. thankfully i did manage to stop in time bcos i wasn going too fast and i wasn tailgating...<br><br>but i had quite a feel of my pillion when i e-braked... but thats out of point... kekeke</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx for ur comments everybody, i've just called up my insurance coy but nobody picked up the phone(Oh ya! i forgot today vesek day!) Went to make a police report from advice from a friend(just in case the S4 tua me n reported the case claiming tt i ran away after the accident). Btw i was travelling at abt 60km/h on n so i think the 4 brakes vs 2 brakes would not b an issue here. My bumper had a crack about 8cm long so i think the bike was was going above 60km/h too. Anyway the rider called up, still demanding for the 500bucks for his injuries n damages. He even threatened to sue me for that but i had asked him to go ahead as had received an assurance from my friend's dad who is working in the tp investigation department that wif the nature of accident, i would have a more favourable ground.<br></div>

I think its more than enugh distance for a S4 to brake from 60 to 0 in 6 carlength(abt 15m??? Unless he is going well above that...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno about this, but I kept thinking about this statement .... Cars 4 brakes, higher braking power, bikes 2 brakes, smaller power ....<br><br>I think think think ... car has 4 brakes, true, but they also have higher inertia due to their larger mass. Bikes have only 2 brakes, but in comparison, bikes have lower inertia. So the statement that a car can stop in a shorter distance than a bike can doesn't seem to make sense to me. It seems to me that both vehicles would roughly have more or less the same stopping distance, if not, the bike should be able to stop faster.<br><br>I think the problem with motorist on our Singapore road is that we follow too close behind. Every so often, on the expressway, on the right most lane,I can on several occasions, see a car coming behind another car, so close. What's that suppose to mean ? "Hey, I am faster, you better give way, and to show that, I'm coming right up behind you" That's very bad.<br><br>No, I dun think you are in the wrong. Super 4 was too close perhaps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sori 2 hear tis... in my own opinion, u r not in the wrong. the following distance is too close oreadi. the one who hit the rear of another is always in the wrong in the eyes of the law. if u go to tp on tis, worse case end up both party deduct 6 points for reckless drivin... the one who hit the rear is always in the wrong because he is supposed to follow a safety distance. even anythin, if he had followed tis safety distance, he will hav time 2 react.... juz my opinion coz i been in accident b4 when drivin 2...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear raider,<br>forget bout the safety dist, rd cond , the dead cat and how many brake calipers.....haha<br><br>In the eyes of the law, the bike is at fault no matter how far the safety dist and speed he was goin!<br><br>If he calls u again, ask him to contact and make claim against your ins...which is a joke and waste of time. But make sure u report the incident accordingly to your ins company.<br><br>If u want to u can claim against the bike for the damaged to your bumper...but if u pity him thn forget it cos he will suffer a greater loss on his repair of his bike thn your small scratch on your bumper......<br><br>Ride safe.....</div>
