            <div class='col-md body'>well here my 2 cent worth of advice...<br>for raider u r not in the wrong so don't worry, but do have some thought for the S4 rider, c'mon we all r rider here who can tell me that they REALLY follow the bk on following distance. Shit happen so just face it, in this case both of u all can just blame it on luck.. and repair ur own damage. Don't find trouble wif he S4, cos he can't see a thing wif u infront, unless he want to, then this would be a lesson for him.<br><br>For zhenzhen_11:<br>For ur case i think appealing telling them that the car was tailgateing at high speed and keep high beaming u, and the high beam blinded ur visiual and u 'tap' the brake.<br>this should be enough to overrule the summon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Given 2 choices by the agent, either respray the rear bumper+alinement+labour charge=$520 or change the whole bumber+workmanship+$1150.Dunno what to choose? If do the first, i think i'll share the cost between me n tt S4 rider,but if i choose the 2nd option, i think must claim liao.</div>
