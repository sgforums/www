Vijayan<br><br>MOTOR insurance companies have pushed up premiums for motorcycles, especially those driven by youngsters under 21 years old.<br><br>And traders believe premiums may increase beyond the about 25 per cent hike now - or almost double in the case of riders under 21 years old - before levelling off unless new players enter the market. Already, one company has pulled out of the motorcycle insurance market.<br><br>Another factor pushing premiums up - motorcyclists are the most vulnerable group of road users, with an average of one fatality every four days.<br><br>Last year, the number of motorcyclists and pillion riders who died on the road increased to 101 from 88 in 2001. About 60 per cent of those who died were below 30 years old and at least three motorcycle accidents a month involved death or serious injury to riders aged 21 years or younger.<br><br>Industry players say they have had to up premiums because of the high risk involved.<br><br>NTUC Income, which commands at least 51 per cent of the insurance market for motorcycles, now charges an average premium of $850 for a new 175 cc motorcycle, up from $688 last year.<br><br>But for riders younger than 21 years, the premium may be double compared to riders above 30, said NTUC Income's general insurance manager Adeline Ang.<br><br>'Based on our claims experience, motorcyclists below 21 are poor risks compared to those 30 years and above.'<br><br>Mitsui-Sumitomo, another big player in the market, now charges a premium of $1,425 for a rider below 21 on a new 200 cc motorcycle, up from $950 last September.<br><br>And the company does not accept scramblers or off-road models, sports bikes and ones with fairings - motorcycles primed with a fibreglass cover in front to improve their aerodynamics.<br><br>NTUC Income also stopped insuring some speedy models like the Yamaha RXZ, Honda CB400, Honda RVF400 and Honda NV400 in February because 'the claim experience for these models has been bad', said Ms Ang.<br><br>A major player withdrew from the motorcycle insurance market last November.<br><br>'Claims have outstripped premiums and the market has become unprofitable for us,' said a company spokesman, who requested that the firm not to be named.<br><br>Mr Jonathan Phoon, who runs a leading motorcycle trading firm, A S Phoon Pte Ltd, said: 'Higher premiums have affected the sales of the bigger bikes.<br><br>'Bikers are unlikely to be able to afford the higher premiums of between $2,000 and $3,000 a year.'<br><br>But he said sales of smaller motorcycles were not hit as much by premium rates as by the economic downturn.<br><br>The figures bear this out.<br><br>Although motorcycle insurance premiums, especially for younger riders, have skyrocketed in recent years, overall sales have risen - from fewer than 10,000 in 1998 to 17,092 motorcycles and scooters last year.<br><br>Said Mr Phoon: 'A 200 cc bike costs about $5,000, but a rider aged below 21 would cut premium costs by opting for third-party insurance cover, which only adds up to $300, instead of comprehensive insurance cover, which would amount to more than $1,000.'<br><br>Bearing the brunt of the rise in premiums are courier and delivery companies that maintain fleets of motorcycles. It is also bad news for motorcyclists who have a good riding record.<br><br>Said operation manager Joseph Goh, 43, who rides a Phantom 200 to work: 'The insurers should differentiate between those who ride many hours as part of their work and the joyrider. Those who ride less should be charged even more.<br><br>'I've had no problems in my 25 years of riding because I always keep left and give way to bigger vehicles, unlike those who take the middle lane.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>HIGH-RISK: Prone to accidents<br><br>Number of motorcyclists and pillion riders who died on the road last year: 101 (up from 88 in 2001)<br><br>At least three motorcycle accidents a month involved death or serious injury to riders aged 21 years or younger. 'Claims have outstripped premiums and the market has become unprofitable for us.' - A spokesman for a company that withdrew from the motorcycle insurance market last November ...<br><br>Damm unfair to us..<br>What cheap means of tpt, now have to pay high insurance premiums...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually it is the bad claim practices that has partly led to the hikes in insurance premiums. Look at the way they are claiming last time through all the loopholes ... and because of those loopholes now we have to bear the increased risks costs ....<br><br>Increasing the costs is not a feasible solution in my view ... they should really do something about their system of claiming before they start to hike prices ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Insurance&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe there is a website from NTUC income for you to do your own insurance quotations, site name I do not know.<br><br>There is also another way, by going to the company eg: NTUC INCOME branches to enquire abt your insurance price, they would ask you for the log card, but never bring wont hurts. They want it cos they want to know the exact cc of the M/cycle.<br><br>I am currently 22+ with more than 3 years riding/ driving experience, and my quotation for a YZF- R1 about a year old, is S$3200/- for a comprehensive plan, TPFT would cost me S$1200/-(est).<br><br>KTM 400: TPFT- S$500/-, with 10% NCD, Comprehensive about S$800/-<br><br>BMW GS1100/1150: Comprehensive about S$1200/-.<br><br>Insurance differs for every bike and rider, it works in a point system, every question they ask would actually have a point system, so the more points you incur, the more ex the plan, even the bike's brand plays a part. For eg the BMW GS1100/1150 seems cheaper than an R1  but it is because it is another company, a company which only insures, Ducati, Harleys and Bimmers, Liberty Citistate Ins Com. But the base money you have to pay for each insurance cliam is considerably higher than other ins company...<br><br>Well this is just my 2 cents worth.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
