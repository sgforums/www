No offence but we do know some really does not have some or none of the qualities to be a leader. But still somehow they made it through OCS and gets commissioned. I as a rifleman work at the lowest level. I've been through some shit and still is going through. My friend is the pc runner and he has to dig the pc shellscrape while the pc sit there and watch, what can we say? suck thumb...... Of course its not just these shit, i am not an officer but i believe they have a lot more benefits and blah blah...<br><br>Haiz..... maybe i should have said "gd luck to your ns life" but that was my advice.
