            <div class='col-md body'>If you have both hands holding on to the handlebars.  You should try to move your body nearer to the motorcycle.  It makes for easier manuvering the bike when its closer to your body.<br><br>Thats why, its easier to move the bike when you are actually straddled on the bike then pushing it around.<br><br>Dont worry about main stand thing, you will eventually get used to managing the bike when you graduated to bigger bike, then you find the bike you were riding at the centre really small and easy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yah, i aso fell while negotiating a corner, lost balance and almost fell when stopping and even fell when i dismounted from the bike.  All this in my first lesson in front of many ppl waiting to go for their prac7.  I wuz aso the last person to finally get the clutch-freeplay right, but that aso kept stalling the whole time.  In my opinion, prac1 was the hardest for mi yet the most memorable.<br><br>Moral of story: alot and alot of ppl did bad for prac1.  So no need to feel upset.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Definitely there are differences between bicycles and motorcycles. Moving backwards and setting on the main stand, I had difficulty too and often lost balance, this is because of the weight of the motorbike as you're not used to it, unlike a bicycle.<br><br>There are also more control such as the gear, clutch and brakes in a motorbike which is not found on a bicycle. What I'm trying to say is that it just takes more practices and soon you'll become a pro!<br><br>Don't feel disheartened on your first practical. I'm sure there are people worst than you yet they've overcame it.<br><br>Good luck for your future practicals and don't give up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To TS,<br><br>Dont lost heart.<br><br>I still often have trouble setting a bigger bike on mainstand.<br><br>Which is why you might want to consider using a better pair of leather riding glove then the standard white gardener gloves you use at the driving centre.<br><br>A pair of soft leather golf gloves will also do the trick.  Try it.  They are about $10 a piece and you can try to locate a pair.<br><br>The gloves provide some cushioning and additional grip to help you hold and rock your bike onto the mainstand.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are so used to the light weight of the bicycle, that you forgot that the motorcycle is heavier. When the bike leans over slightly to the right of 90 degrees, it will pull you over.<br>For the time being always remember to lean your bike slightly to the left, to where you are standing. Do this even when you are pushing the bike. Later you would be able to hold it upright 90 degrees naturaly. But still, lean slightly left is the best. Don't be shy of leaning the bike against your body.<br><br>Later when you decide to take up Class 2A or Class 2, you will again face the same weight problem. Its just a matter of getting accustom to the weight.<br></div>
