I recently enrolled for the class 2B course and today happens to be my 1st practical lesson. I was looking forward to this lesson and was feeling scared and excited at the same time.<br><br>But I fell down alot during my 1st pract. The bike fell when i was setting it on the main stand, fell when i was pushing it backwards and i fell down when i stopped the bike after it moved forward. I dunno whats wrong.. I can ride a bicycle but when it comes to riding the motorcycle, i feel intimidated and always feel like falling down.<br><br>Sigh... Now very disheartened. dunno wanna continue not...<br><br></div></blockquote>dude! relax. i'm also having my class 2B lesson at SSDC. Don't be disheartened. I tell ya, i fell down more than my ten fingers can count and i'm only at lesson 5. The no. of times i fell down in circuit is incredible. It will make you improve alot. No one will laugh at you for falling down, because they don't have the time to. They need to concentrate on the road itself.<br>Let me relate you a few of my "jia-lat" experience...<br><br>Lesson 1 part 2 - I got up my bike from the left hand side, and immediately dropped of the right hand side. HAHA! *I believe you can imagine that yourself*<br><br>Lesson 2 - Figure of 8 and Crank Course. This is pratically the hardest for me. In just 1 lesson, I fell like 8 times O.o ? HAHAHA. I cut diagonally through the 8 and rode to the main rode! And that's super dangerous! *Imagine that and you'll laugh* Oh! And don't be dishearten when you go for the slope, because it's ok to be stuck there and stall there many times. You'll get a hang of it. I promise.<br><br>I got many more to write but i'm lazy though. Trust me! Continue learning, it's gonna be damn fun. If you have advance very far already, think back on those lessons that taught you different things. You'll laugh when people tell you tey never experienced before. Simple because It's ONE HELL OF AN EXPERIENCE!</div>
