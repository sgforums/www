U can always have a bike for ur personal pleasure while a car for family. If u can afford a car, sure u can easily afford to have another bike. Its true that as people see more things, grow mature, they will ride more carefully or even give up riding when they have no more interest liao.<br>But there r also uncles 50+ liao ride a class 2 chopper. Married guys who r 30+ and still goes to track leh.<br>All this come down to interest/passion. Ask urself why u ride a bike instead, the answer comes from u.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi abterror...<br>I had the same suituation as u b4. I got my 2B when I'm 18. I tell myself that 2B is enough cos as long as there is a bike 2 ride will be good liao...Then I got my 3 when I'm 20. At that time, I got a family car 2 drive so I nv think of getting my own car. After riding my 2B bike 4 so long, I oso sian cos no power. Then i mod it but ganna caught by TP. Then I tell myself, since no power, y not upgrade. This is when I went 4 my 2A, 2yrs after I got 2B. Then I bought a 2nd hand steed. Really shiok man, power so much different. But if u wanna more power then have 2 get a sport bike. Ride that bike 4 not a yr, I pyscho my dad 2 buy a car 4 me cos family car sold liao. But he dun have $$$ so carry on with my bike loh. 4yrs after my 2A, I took my 2 cos 2A power sian liao. I intend 2 get a big bike but instalment, maintenence, petrol, insurance, rd tax cost ard $700+ - per mth. So i didnt get it. As 4 car, u wont be able 2 get it with this amt unless it's a lousy car.<br><br>As 4 now, my dad intended 2 share a new car with me. I juz need 2 pay part of the instalment which is $500 per mth and everything extra will be paid by him. In this case, it's cheaper than getting a class 2 bike. So y not... But i will still keep my bike cos it give me different kind of sensation. It's totally different from driving. As bike actually helps me 2 cut down cost on petrol, parking and avoid traffic jams. So i will ride 2 work and drive on wk ends.<br><br>As 4 ur case, i advice u 2 get ur 2A and 2 even if u wont change bigger bikes. In sgp, guys r better 2 have as much licence as possible. If u getting a car, find some1 in ur family 2 share with u who wont be fighting with u 2 use it. Then u may carry on keeping ur bike.<br><br>It's juz a piece of advice...</div>
