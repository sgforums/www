Both were in stock condition. My RXZ averaged 28km/l. My SP averaged 21km/l. Some people will claim higher consumption, some people will claim lower consumption. It all depends on their bikes conditions and their riding style.<br><br>So from consumption alone, keeping an SP is more expensive. Whether you will feel the pinch or not, it's relative to your spending power. If you're still a student, difference of 20 bucks per month might be significant. If you're already working and earning a comfortable salary, difference of 50 bucks per month might not matter. I personally find maintenance and spare parts costs don't differ that greatly between those two, and both are reliable bikes.<br><br>Performance wise, of course SP kicks RXZ's ass. And don't listen to people who say Mr ABC's RXZ can smoke SP after changing this and that. We're talking about RXZ and SP in general, don't use a single bike as benchmark. There's no replacement for displacement.<br><br>Appearance wise, this is subjective. But in my eyes SP wins hands down.<br><br>Comfort wise, RXZ provides better riding posture for commuting, and it's more pillion-friendly. Riding SP at slow speed is a pain in the neck (and shoulders), literally.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by R3SsH|n:</div><div class="quote_body">sp consumption quite high.<br>35km~40km i heard.<br>40km&lt; and u can tao jio loh...</div></blockquote></div>
