You will need to have at least 50% of the sum of the total fine for the judge to find you convincing. and even then if he declines your request, you wil be thrown in jail immediatly. thie is even if you have the entire amount for the fine in you back pocket . so dont fool around.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a blatant case of giving change of address as an excuse.  Sorry to say this.  But you know, riding or driving a vehicle without roadtax and valid insurance is a offence which carries a jail term.  How can one forget to pay?  For me, even when I did not receive any reminders, I make an effort to go down to Sin Ming and get one printed out.<br><br>All I can say is plead guilty.  Don't mitigate too much.  Just say you are a poor worker, you know you are wrong etc etc.  You will get away with a much smaller fine.  Don't even bother to appeal.  The judge will be lenient and MAY let you off with a concessionary fine.</div>
