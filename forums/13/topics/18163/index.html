            <div class='col-md body'>Just came back from bike lesson ..... These are the few 'I think is interesting' things I heard in the lesson ....<br><br>1. While on an expressway, the instructor saw a rider who was riding and messaging SMS on his handphone.<br><br>2. A passenger was waiting for a taxi outside the school (T-junction) when a taxi on the 2nd lane, is heading in his direction. However, on the opposite direction, another taxi caught sight of the waiting passenger and the oncoming taxi. Both taxi drivers wanted to get the passenger; so the taxi on the opposite side of the road did a U-turn, while the oncoming taxi increased speed. Both collided. A 3rd taxi came by and picked up the passenger.<br><br>3. The instructor showed us some videotapes on defensive riding. In one of the scene, a motorcyclist was travelling without his head light .... a TP came along and stopped him. The TP was smiling and signed to the rider to switch on his headlight. Then he smiled again and moved off. Everyone began to laff ... "Real or not ? So friendly ah ?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dread passing the traffic lights in my nieghbouhood ..... In the morning ... woring hour, a lot of people at the traffic light waiting to cross the road.<br><br>The red man is on ... and some just dash across .... and some see your vehicle coming but dun want to wait until you pass totally ... so as you near them, they step down and start walking ... It looks like they are trying to walk into your path and let you bang into them.<br><br>Then people come down from bus and start dashing across the road ..... Haiz ... so scary .... even if I travel at low speed ... if one dash out sure injure them one ... Think the traffic police should do more to educate them .... Haiz ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>last time during my class 2B days , my riding instructor told us that if ur signal light is dead , u should use hand signal to indicate direction of turn , then this bugger got a bike which had faulty signal lights straighten both his hands when he was going straight in a cross junction ; he is thinking go left means stretch out left hand and right turn means strectch right hand , then going straight means usind both hands , so both his hands are use for signalling .</div>
