As such, ur braking distance will be shorter. (Tat day my fren tried ard 50++km/h on a s4 at ssdc and still managed to stop b/f the 13m mark.</div>

Here is tips from  a  person who heng heng passed.I took very few lessons and din't go for a single revision except one while waiting for the test.<br><br>1.) Arrg ga liao with the instructors there. If they arrange to give you an instructor bike, there is a huge difference, my practice bike all problematic, but i got a instructor bike for my test. It purred.</strong><br><br>==&gt; Come on lar...when I was in 2B..I always blamed the bike here spoil lar...there spoil lar....things like that...the sad truth is....we ourself lousy...no offence..i been true that stage as well.<br><br><strong>2.) Try to be the last few 75-80 onwards. Higher chance of passing. Apparently for the 80th candidate , TP already start to pack up oreadi. So I was the 80th candidate!<br>Everyone there told me , i close one eye oso can pass wan.</strong><br><br>==&gt; When you come to be the later ones...the L plate cars will be more and if you bad luck...ppl having car lesson all finish..then they park car liao anyhow cross the road...you "wan wan liao..." So get the earlier numbers...then better.<br><br><strong>3.) Be relaxed, try very hard to psycho yourself to fail/fail oso nv mind. Usually you pass instead.</strong><br><br>==&gt; This is true. But this only works on certain ppl. For me...i created a die die situation that i must past....Most important..be confident.<br><br><strong>4.) Plank , grab tight , look far ahead and never look down.</strong><br><br>==&gt; No comments....This is true as well..<br><br><strong>5.) Figure 8 , swing with the bike ,it tilt you tilt. And cheat abit by starting across the line , start off fast and kick up to second gear very fast, fast release , then speed up whenever possible, but slow just before coming out.</strong><br><br>==&gt; Cheating is actually further away from the line. Juz in case you hit into neutral gear...so you will have time to react b4 going into the course. When your bike touches the exit line....clutch in and slow down a little. Let your bike roll slowly so that you will not move out of the course too fast then in return you get a wide turn. Same thing applies for the crank course. The criteria is in the clutching in.<br><br><strong>6.) E-brake, keep practicing the motions. straigten arms, release throttle earlier , look far, pull in front brake hard, rear brake abit, then 5 seconds later, you clutch in.</strong><br><br>==&gt; True<br><br><strong>7.) Exaggerate your motion abit, check back , check blindspot .</strong><br><br>==&gt; Do your motions smoothly. Not too slow coz there will be things like delay in moving off when you check too long. Look afar.<br><br><strong>8.) on road, look far ahead and plan your positioning. Go slow near hazards or near too many cars.( trust me TP look alot into this) KEEP SAFE FOLLOWING DISTANCE. Go slower better than faster. I calculated that you lose less points going slow then not having enuf following distance and safety.</strong><br><br>==&gt; Going slow is 2pts. But this applies to one instructor. So....one instructor 2pts....on road got five....then you get 10pts...Hurray...you still got 8pts left. Go watever speed the road allows but minus 5-10.<br><br><strong>9.) Start off fast , but check blindspot slowly and exaggeratedly. Change down to lower gears far ahead  before you reach the junction for the right turn,</strong><br><br>==&gt; I repeat again....not too exaggerately...will delay in moving off..when you too concentrated on checking blindspot exaggerately while moving..you will not notice wat is in front of you. Then you can wobble your way true liao..<br><br><strong>10.) U-turn , don't use rear brake. look far and aim where you go , maintain throttle AT A CONSTANT VELOCITY. START  OFF doing the U-turn further away from the kerb. about 1.5 m-2m. Most likely you are always too near.</strong><br><br>==&gt; True<br></blockquote>No offence okay joel? Lawlipop..do your things smoothly. Dun rush through the test..you paid for it right? Enjoy the moments of ppl(TP instructors) looking at your beautiful and smooth movements. Be it on road or on circuit...look far ahead.<br><br>By the way...I juz passed my 2A today. Thats why i am still fresh about the tp test.<br><br>------------------<br>I am TA150. But now changed nick liao... Cheers...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ah^Huat (edited 22 January 2002).]</div>
