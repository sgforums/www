            <div class='col-md body'>Hi!<br>I just check and update the price for the insurance at NTUC.<br>Refer to my previous mail.<br><br>Lee's Motor only do sell.<br>Mah's mechanics are OK. can chat and ask questions but depend on how long is the Q but the price for the service are higher due to their reputation. BTW, 1st 3 services are free excluding the price of the engine oil.<br><br>Warranty was 3rd Party w fire and theft(Actually this is the so-called 2nd party). Actual 3rd party is without Fire and Theft.<br>Very difficult to explain but U can ask the seller for more detail.<br>Make sure U understand the term and know what U want.</div>
