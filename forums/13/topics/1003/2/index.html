            <div class='col-md body'>hi atti...me not 2nd second hand dealer..my first car was a 2nd hand one and i learn alot from the car so i knoe the pro and con.  hmm...my bro in law is a car dealer at LAND ROVER. He knoes alot abt car thingy not me. But if i knoe anything, l will share iwth all of u...<br><br>WEll, someone mentioned abt wht 100km/h will shake or something like tht... For your info, car tht didn't RAM b4 will have this problem. ONly car that has been rammed will be quite stable when gonig over 100km.h else u will find the car trembling even at 90km/h.. Normally new car small car got this problem.<br><br>Hmm...actually 1litre and 1.6 litres do have alot of differents...unless your car is a modified one . FRom wht i have seen all these year, i think why a taxi is slower than a 1 litres car when pickup is becoz.( i myself try it many times) taxi uses diesal while private car use petrol. THere is a great different if u experience it b4.  I think tht should be the main reason for it.<br><br>FYI, Starlet is normally modified to 1.6litres and a starlet is worht quite alot even the CEO ended .  U still can fetch a goodprice after tht. REasoning being hte part is quite easy to get and quite cheap also . But the car itself is not cheap.<br><br>Just some of my views on car.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi GoonDu ....... well u r really lucky to have gone overseas.......so which country was that? Anyway i fully agree with u that the lexus IS200 is unattractive ..... dun think i will opt for it too, if my dad has asked me. Wow yr dad really has a good buy for that volvo s80. Think in current market, S80 2l will cost abt $165 w/o COE. Think yr father is veri lucky. Anyway, is the car plate no. start with SCW? think at 1 stage SCW car r considerbly cheaper than other car i believe.And yes, its a nice car ..... both attractive and solid.<br><br>Hello Ah blur.....frankly speaking i dunnoe if a car dealer need a license but i suppose so lor, just like property agent i think <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> (sorry if i am wrong). Well 60-70 for a japanese car to cup a corner is rather dangerous leh, i think. And not all cars will 'fly' at 100km or more. I tried cars like BMW (3 series only) and Merz......u can travel at 120 km and feel like 80kn/h....no joke, esp Merz cos its heavier. Or maybe as a general conclusion, intercontiental cars r heavier, thus more stable lor. I remember driving the accord once, hit 100 felt quite light liao .......imagine somemore its a 2l car.<br><br>Patie: Hi, errmmm so 1 qns, does a car dealer need a license? do u happen to know? and since starlet got quite a good valur according to u, how come they stop production? Is there some fault in them ? i believe the sales of this starlet is actually quite good........ just wondering how come they change.....and the 1l ECHO now seems a bit expensive, for its catagory that is ..........<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi!<br><br>Atti: the reason why production of starlet was discontinued is because the car couldnt meet increasing emission standards.<br><br>About whether a car will be unstable at 100km.....I think it is more than just the type of car.  Any (most) cars can reach 100, its one of the benchmark sprint time that the industry uses to rate the acceleration of cars (another being 0-160kmh)<br>Anyway as long as the road is straight and bumpless and windless, stability isnt much of an issue. But because there are no such roads in Singapore, varying degrees of the above affect varying types of cars with varying types of running condition.<br><br>Has anyone ever followed a car and see it bounce and bounce after hitting a bump? Dont condem the brand! Its probably a worn out damper thats the culprit.<br><br>As for continental cars being heavier and more stable, it is true that continental cars are heavier than their asian counterparts (much like the continentals and their asian counterparts  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> oops). Therefore the cars would be more stable - in a straight line.<br>But heavier cars have more momentum so its gonna be more difficult to change the direction of a continental car in an emergency.  Of course modern driving aids help.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth....cheers!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pardons...<br><br>Just out of curiousity, I'm just wondering how prevalent is car ownership here? It seems that a high portion of the forumites in this thread are priviledged to have driven a wide variety of cars and possibly owned a few before.  :p<br><br>When I first considered buying my first car, I was wondering how I could possibly afford it. A Mitsubishi Colt with 5 yrs left on the COE then was a cool $45K. To pay for the intial payment of $20K, and then take a loan for the rest of the amount meant that the car financing company will suck up $1.4K per month for me, and that's excluding the petrol costs. All in all, that means that I need to have double that amount for my income, to be able to afford to drive in Singapore, pay my utilities, give my sister allowance, and entertainment. I need to earn $2.8K a month!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> The majority of graduates and poly dips earn around a mean $1.6K a month...<br><br>Am I in the minority in this? I don't ever dare to dream of Skylines and RX7s, much less supercars like the Jaq F-type. To do that, I need to earn mebbe $8k??<br><br>Sure, I have a friend who reviews cars for a magazine and I've tagged along one or two times, BUT, the gap between reality and aspiration is too wide.<br><br>So to patie etc, who knows the car market well, is there some sort of arcane formula that you know that allows for such diverse exprimentation in dabbling with cars?<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>It doesn't mean that love always has to obey Mariah Carey ...

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi pple,<br><br>io:i presume the bigger the tyre meant the size of thr rim is it? I ever heard that the larger the rim (17" compare to 15"), the 17" will have more stabilities. However, these 17" normally come with wider surface (width), thus guess its link somehow.<br><br>Barclays: well frankly speaking its hard for pple earning 1.6k a mnth to own a car, but did happen to see some manage to get 1 somehow, never ask them how they did it, but normally their car are left with 1-2 yrs to go. Lets say a Daihatsu 1.3l with 1 yr plus, will cost abt 16k-17k (This price was quote officially by a 2nd hand car dealer). U give downpayment of 10k. and for the next 1 yr, u need ony pay abt abt 600 bucks a mnth. And heard the OMV of the car is abt 10k too. So eventually after scraping the car, only lost abt 6-7k. Think worth it, somehow.<br><br>Cantofire: Does the dodge avenger and the dodge viper comes from the same family? Well its true that i never heard of it b4. Well as for the BMW, the older 1 is more sporty while the new 1 more elegant, to me at least.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Dakar: Well taking abt vans, pick-ups and lorries, i manage to drive some b4 ..... well haven't tried the 2800-3000cc 1 but even the Toyota Liteace (think 2000cc) is beri strong and powerful. Thus, not surprise that if its empty, the pick up and win some of the cars ard.<br><br>Anyway, in the past, only those with registered company can buy a van/pick-ups. This rule have change liao meh?

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah blur, the chasis of the Honda SiR don't really consider low lor, unless you really go and lower the suspension. Frankly speaking, haven't try the SiR at 140, think 100 odd i start to decelerate already. As for the ramming of engine, i just know that for brand new car just out of the oven  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> , u cannot ram the engine lor cos its not 'warm up' yet, must reach certain figure (1st 1000km) i think then must start ramming a little, so that the engine can get use to 'stress'. Errmmm any1 noe if i am rite or wrong? pls enlighten as well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Goondu, hey like i say again, yr dad is really lucky lor. SCY plate is somewhere last July/August i think. Think at that time car had hit quite a high price. So care to tell me more abt that car?<br><br>Regards</div>

So care to tell me more abt that car?<br><br>Regards</div></blockquote>The car was registered in August...yupz...but we booked the car in April/May period wile under promo.  The car...hmmm...handles quite well, siao-lang accelleration and torque steer can can almost break your wrist...make u-turn the most fun period coz you can really light up the front tyres.  Ride comfort ok lar...coz the car set up with 17" rims and lower profile than the 16" rims that come with the 2.0T. Cruise control quite fun when driving up to Penang but useless in Singapore...<br><br>Interior wise, quite spacious with huge trunk at the back.  Comes standard with strut brace which was quite a surprise.  Washing the car not-so fun coz it's huge <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Also, the plastic bits (read boot lid area, bumpers and roof drains) tend to discolor and can only retain original color if you polish it real hard...very jia lat.  It's got a pretty decent sterao system with 7 spakers...and the interior looks like an airplane cockpit at night coz of all the lighted buttons and dials.<br><br>It's got 7 cup holders (1 more than the BMW Z8 in "The World is Not Enough" it's only got six heh heh heh...), a built in GSM car phone with handset for rear passanger to use, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, power seats up front, rake-reach adjustable steerning plus that 18 airbag system they call the "Inflatable Curtain" and another four airbags upfront.<br><br>Brakes could be a little more progressive tho...press a bit oni bite like siao lang...talk about stopping power.  I guess coz most European luxury models have huge discs.  First service due at 15000km which is really wierd...the car doesn't need running in at all which was fun coz from the day we got it, I already drive like siao lang hehehe...</div>
