            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa, Mazda RX7??? If you are thinking about buying in Canada, my advice is... don't want la. Cause their engine different from normal cars one. So expensive to repair. The car is also out of production since 1993?? I believe?? So it makes the car old liao. But if you don't mind, well, go ahead  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> its a real cool car.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I personally want the BMW M3.. hehe... that is until if Mitsubitshi Lancer Evolution or Nissan Skyline ever comes to Canada, *Wish Wish*.. I like my car with tons of gagets. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> For an exmple, computers that tells you how many KM u can still travel, or in dash Map screen.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Dakar : Well guess its a fact that nowsaday female divers are driving better and faster cars than many guys ard. i personally saw a woman in her 30s driving a WRX!!! However, u should really see her driving skill (sorry dun mean to criticise female driver), think her speed is less than 80km/h on the expressway, and worst still, her lane chaging skill is the worst of all, many cars have to jam brake just to let her come in, think she's queen of the road liao lar. Errrm....yah think there's a 2 kids behind the back sit.....pity those children.<br><br>Rinoa : Hi errmmm....so u currently in Canada is it? So where u got yr license? Been driving in Canada? Got a friend just returned from Winnepeg i think, he say that its much easlier to drive there than in S'pore. And the car there got very hugh engine capacity. Anyway, agree that a cool car is important, heh ........<br><br>Cantofire: Hi too, well think u watch a little too much James Bond lar....heh.... errm....anyway heard that the sanggyong chairman is really sophisticated ...... got touch screen monitor and so on ........heard radio also touch screen 1.......<br><br>By the way, what do u pple think of the 2 BMWs 3 series .....the previous model more Chio or the latest? Just curious .........~<br><br>Regards<br><br></div>

And that 1.6 liter taxi is a heavy car....so need more horsepower lah... besides more liters does not mean more power. For an example Honda Prelude, 2.2 liter has 200 horsepower, but the 2.0 S2000 has 240 hp... i think it depends on how the manufactuer makes the engine. F1 cars are something like 2. something liters, but can produce 500+ hp.. wah.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

My friend's dad just sold 1 DEC 96 sir for abt 80k last Dec (so 3 yrs old exactly). Me drive that SiR b4, well auto too, think the power is good enuff ......to me personally, the disadvatages is that the car is too light for such great power.....maybe me not use to driving the car, but once hit over 100 like gonna fly like that, heh ..... but still, it's one of the more reliable cars ard, never heard of much complaint against it.<br><br>Goondu: Hello.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  wow how old r u? heh....me rather curious, look like u have drive many cars b4, including some top class 1 like Acura NSX...... quite envy..... so how does it feels? great i suppose..........me not as lucky, though did manage to drive some diff types b4 ..........<br><br>So Cantofire, care to tell what car u driving now?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Atti,<br><br>I just turned 29...working now.  I've been quite lucky lor...parents sent me overseas when I was 15+ and have lived there for quite some time. The NSX I test drove is quite powerful although I didn't get to open the throttle fully (the salesman was next to me) otherwise I sure try out full throttle all the way one...hehehee<br><br>Somehow I find that in Singapore, Mercs are a little too common...when my dad asked me what car to buy for himself, at first I suggested the Lexus IS200 since he liked Lexus...but after looking at the car (didn't even test drive) we felt that it lacked lots of features that were available in my 9-5...so we left...I then suggested to go to SM Motors since it was nearby to look at the S-40 or S-70.  Just so happen that at that time, the S-80 was going under promotion and he saw the car and liked it....I expected the price to be above 200K but when I was told it was only 168 incl COE, I jump at the chance and told him to get it...so until now, he still loves that car and hasn't regretted for one minute buying it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
