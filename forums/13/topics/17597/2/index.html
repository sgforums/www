            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys. since you're all talking about licences, i'd thought i'd relate my experience. i just passed recently at BBDC and although people say it's easier to pass, i don't really think so. i took my tp 3 times before i passed. when i passed, only 12 or so out of 70+ people passed but the previous time it was around 20+ people passed. so i think maybe it's getting harder.<br><br>some more. what i heard form the instructor is that in jan or feb 2002 they're gonna implement an extra "highway lesson" AFTER you've passed yer TP. only after that can you take your licence. maybe he's bluffing, but i've heard the same thing from other people.<br><br>i don't mean to demoralize you guys, but i thought it'd be important for you to know.<br>good luck!</div>
