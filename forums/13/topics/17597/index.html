KTM not realli recommended. KTM125 is even more problematic than 200. You can take a look at the topic on dirt rider and see our reply there abt scram.<br><br>Aniway...SSDC quite difficult to get practical sessions to fall within the next day. Normally, when u book a lesson, u will have to wait 2-3 days one. I'm not sure about BBDC though.</div>
