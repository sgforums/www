All riders out there, pls ride carefully n safely k...</strong></span><br><br>Friday December 26, 6:11 PM<br><br>Motorcyclist killed in SLE accident on X'mas Day<br><br>SINGAPORE : A freak accident along the Seletar Expressway on Christmas Day led to the death of a motorcyclist.<br>The accident involving two taxis happened at 5.50am, just before the exit to Yishun.<br><br>Police said the motorcyclist had skidded and was trying to put his bike upright, when he was hit by a taxi.<br><br>Nashily Pozi, 23, and his pillon rider were travelling along the Seletar Expressway towards the city, when he lost control of the motorcycle just before the Lentor flyover.<br><br>The bike grazed some bushes along the centre divider and both men were flung onto the road.<br><br>Nashily and his friend then got up to pick up the bike, which was on the extreme right lane.<br><br>And that's when a TIBS taxi crashed into them.<br><br>Then along came a Comfort taxi which crashed into the bike, which was still on the extreme right lane.<br><br>Nashily was killed instantly, but miraculously, the 22-year-old pillon rider escaped with only abrasions on his hand.<br><br>Mohamed Sani, pillion rider, said: "From behind, the taxi was speeding. Then it hit the bike and hit him. I run to him and say Nashily, wake up. I feel his pulse, no more already. I run to the taxi driver and ask him to call the Police."<br><br>According to Nashily's elder brother, Nashily only got his motorcycle licence just about a year ago, and was making a living as a despatch rider.<br><br>Fadzli Pozi, victim's brother, said: "All I need right now is for any witness to the accident to come forward and call up the Traffic Police."<br><br>Both taxi drivers are helping police with the investigations and eye-witnesses can call 1800-5471818. - CNA<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree. Both sides must be careful at all times.. motorcyclists and car drivers.<br><br>If the rider didn't lose control of his bike, he wouldn't have died. If the taxi wasn't speeding, the rider wouldn't have died either.. so, ya.. life is precious.. don't lose it or cause someone to lose it just becoz of a moment's folly.</div>
