            <div class='col-md body'>hi...newbie here...as can c from my no. of posts...juz wanto say somethings TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE<br><br>v-power burns very fast...hence the power...but at the same time it oso burns at a higher temp than other petrol...so if ur bike's optimum temp is not high...then its not good for ur engine in the long run<br>kick starting....if ur carb is empty (close the petrol tap) then it whd be very ez to start but the engine dies off cos there no petrol to burn wat....but if ur carb is full of petrol...it whd be very diff to start....so its normal for engine to die off in the mornings...juz open a LITTLE BIT of throttle for ard 30 sec to send ur petrol into ur carb...if after tat u release then engine die again...2 tings...1) ur choke is on... 2) ur idling is too low<br><br>juz my 2 cents worth</div>
