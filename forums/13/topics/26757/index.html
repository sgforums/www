Practical lessons are grouped into 33 subjects. Due to the high cost of each session ($50-$60), driving centres tend to be more lenient, allowing most students to pass each subject on his or her 1st attempt. Such a candidate would probably take about 18 lessons, and usually between 4 to 5 months to complete the syllabus.<br><br>Class 2B syllabus has only 8 stages, however it is very common for students to take up to 4 lessons to clear each stage. Hence more than often it would take about the same number of lessons and time as Class 3.<br><br>Driving centres are also required to let students sit for an evaluation test before the actual TP test, with both classes allowing a maximum of 18 points before failure. Class 3 students however are allowed more slack, and minor mistakes that when accumulated would cause the student to fail are overlooked. This is not the case in Class 2B where every small mistake would be taken into consideration.<br><br>Over the years, Class 2B requirements have also become tougher. The minimum age has since been raised from 16 to 18. Apparently there are plans to bring it up to 21. Emergency brake is no longer tested on dry roads. The road is purposely sprayed with water to increase the difficulty.<br><br>I really have to agree with and praise the changes. We choose to ride bikes not because it is safe, but rather it is a cheap and fast way to get us to our destination. Studies have shown that in Singapore, the group of riders who get involved in accidents most often are young people (below 25) and riding 2B bikes. Raising the standards of 2B license in the long run would only benefit us riders.<br><br>Even safe-riding and safety-conscious riders like us are not spared from danger. Drivers have for long, lamented about the number of reckless riders. I would just like to say that there is probably more reckless riders out there. Motorcyclists generally belong to the lower income group, and cannot afford to buy cars. This is however groundless to cause drivers to look down on riders. It is also evident that other than taxi drivers, the drivers who give the least respect to riders would be those driving large cars (above 2000cc). There is also an increase in the modification of Japanese saloon cars for roadracing. Such drivers more than often have ill disregard for traffic rules, driving at average speeds of more than 100km/h, and changing lanes recklessly. We have seen goods vehicles, lorries or even prime movers speeding.<br><br>Drivers often do not take into consideration motorcycles around them, changing lanes, braking and overtaking without giving due warning, causing riders to E-brake, change lanes dangerously to avoid an accident and being squeezed out of their lanes. I have seen drivers at a crossroad junction overtake dangerously from the right side, cutting in to the left to make a left turn and missing the motorcycle by a few centimeters.<br><br>Drivers may say that costs of buying and maintaining a motorcycle is very much cheaper compared to a car, but this does not mean that our lives are of less value. The lower costs come at a price of the higher risks to our lives. We are not asking drivers to be responsible for the safety of riders, but just to be aware of us and do not view us as insignificant road users. The TP can help to educate drivers on this, and also to punish severely offenders.<br><br>I realized that new shopping malls in the new towns, for example, Rivervale Mall, Rivervale Plaza and Compass Point do not allow motorcycles to use their car parks, forcing riders to park on pavements and causing inconvenience to pedestrians. TP has not done much to help on this, instead choosing to issue traffic summons. This is not a long-term solution for this problem. Just give us an area to park. Most riders would be happy and definitely not that stingy to complain about a minimal parking fee.<br><br>The dangers and marginalization of motorcycles on the roads have been a problem that most riders were not willing or able to raise. However these days, a new breed of riders are emerging, one that are more highly educated, and economically better, and more willing to speak out in order to increase their road safety.<br>_________________<br></div>
