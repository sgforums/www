            <div class='col-md body'>i know there are some feelings of dislikes between car drivers n bike riders ah, but to be honest both groups also got bastards. anyway check with AE86tofu for more car owner stories... he got lots to tell from the time he worked in shell as pump attendent. haha<br><br>i help him tell one farnie one 1st.<br><br>There was this guy who drove in one fine day in a Merc C Class. This guy was a damn cheapo... why? there are 3 things he did which proves he is.<br><br>He asked to pump the cheapest fuel (92)<br>He told tofu to inflate the tyre to a certain Psi which is over inflating the tyre. When tofu pointed that out to him, he ask tofu to shut up n say that tofu dunno anything, that overinflating the tyre will help to reduce tyre wear n fuel consumption since less friction as less of the tyre is in contact with the ground. so tofu lan lan pump to the Psi he want loh. HE just walk in to pay for e petrol only when.....<br>BOOM! one of the front tyres blew. wahahahahahaha!!!! serve the idiot right.<br>Then when he change the tyre, he only change the one that blew. Normally ppl change tyre change whole set, becos having diff grip levels on each tyre can make driving dangerous... but the stupid tightwad values his $ over his bloody life....</div>

This guy was a damn cheapo... why? there are 3 things he did which proves he is.<br><br>He asked to pump the cheapest fuel (92)<br>He told tofu to inflate the tyre to a certain Psi which is over inflating the tyre. When tofu pointed that out to him, he ask tofu to shut up n say that tofu dunno anything, that overinflating the tyre will help to reduce tyre wear n fuel consumption since less friction as less of the tyre is in contact with the ground. so tofu lan lan pump to the Psi he want loh. HE just walk in to pay for e petrol only when.....<br>BOOM! one of the front tyres blew. wahahahahahaha!!!! serve the idiot right.<br>Then when he change the tyre, he only change the one that blew. Normally ppl change tyre change whole set, becos having diff grip levels on each tyre can make driving dangerous... but the stupid tightwad values his $ over his bloody life....</div></blockquote>chaffuer-act-owner?</div>
