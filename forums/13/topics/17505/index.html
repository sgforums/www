            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys, just saw something on the Aprilia forum. Something about insurence. Take a look.<br><br>.............................................<br>On 13 October 2001, all insurance companies have revised their insurance premiums for all bikes and the greatest hike comes in one brand name which is Aprilia, our beloved bike.<br><br>I just renewed my insurance a few days ago expecting the usual $500++ to pay. However I was saddened to find out that this no longer is so.<br><br>According to my bike shop and based on documents which I saw first hand, insurance premiums have risen to a point beyond belief. This time round I had to pay $755 which is $200 more. The best thing was, this was only after deducting discounts such as NCB and another discount thingy. Imagine if I had no discounts, I would have to pay around $850-900.<br><br>Is this justifiable? Insurance companies state their reason for the price hike is due to the vunerability of aprilia to accidents and the spare parts are expensive. Give it a thought and you may longer see new aprilia's emerging from yr 2001 onwards anymore. Why?<br><br>Imagine you are 18 yrs old and just passed your license, Do you know that you would have to fork out $1800, ( YES! ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SINGAPORE DOLLARS ) each year for insurance ? This refers to first party insurance. (And u cant put a new bike on 3rd party insurance ) Dont you think it is very rediculous! Where will this put the brand name Aprilia? No where among the top brands for sure.<br><br>To top it off, only NTUC will offer 1st and 3rd party insurance coverage. Other than that, all other insurance companies will only be offering 3rd part insurance. All first party renewals will be pushed over to NTUC.<br><br>I truly do not have anything much else to say. Saddened by this, I do not want to see a prestigious brand name die because of insurance companies. Their claims may be legitimate, but the end-consequences are devastating.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> What else can we do? Not much I supposed.<br><br>Comments pls<br>.............................................</div>

U've got a point there but there's still something that u've miss out... "CLAIMS" Those things that's cheap don't need to claim lah... Some "bo liao" ppl cheap claim, expensive also claim... Of coz the insurence company cannot tahan lah... Their company is not 'John Hancock' or any other big companys... Somemore times are real bad... I agree that they're a little too much but there's really little that we can do...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">Haiz! TING TIAN YOU MIN BAH!<br><br></div>
