Did the engine knock when you tried to release the clutch? Perhaps you can pull and release your clutch(quick actions) abt 5-10 times b4 engaging 1st gear.<br><br>If it is wat I tink it is... it's just ur gear system, not yet lubricated unlike ur engine(coz engine warm up liaoz...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wenever i start mine in the morn, i switch on choke, start then leave the choke on (let the engine run a little faster), after bout 15~20 seconds the engine will lower a little, then i switch off the choke to let engine run at usual.<br>next i will just play with the throttle. how i tell is (when still neutral of coz) i open throttle slightly and i see how it sounds. i always experience either one of two distinctively different sounds: one is the weak rev which i believe wat you are describing. if like dat i keep blowing throttle. after a while when i test again by opening the throttle slightly again, i should experience the second sound, which is stronger or like normal when the engine no longer cold. this has been my morning ritual ever since dat time just come out of my carpark at the junction, light turn green, i open throttle skali weak weak like you describe and it almost stalled. i quickly clutch in, blow harder and released clutch. of coz then the bike shot out like a rocket.<br>by the way i using v-power. i donno if 2T oso affect this problem. before, i used combination of Esso98 and Esso 2T Perfumed and this problem quite bad. now i use v-power and Esso 2T Pace not as bad. gonna change to Shell 2T vsx, donno will how.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

This could be that your valve are clogged up. You should go clear your valves. This applies if you mileage is around 50000. If you were using lower grade 2T the valve will clog faster. Dun ever let Ah Bee (HOCK KIM LEONG) to touch your bike though they are cheap. Good things dun come cheap. Last time I let them do it, nabei...itchy hand go and change the timing of the valve. Then the whole bike become too responsive! Dun let them touch your bike!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>I am TA150. But now changed nick liao... Cheers...</div>

Cause, 2T will go into the piston chamber when you start the bike running. So there is something for them to rub. But for 4strokers, gotta wait for the 4T to go into the piston chamber.
