            <div class='col-md body'>Keratinize,<br><br>Well yr situation normally wun get kantong but yr case is that u r p-plate, thats why i am not sure. By rite p-plate is not allow to make big mistake, wonder if yrs is considered but it involves court, so think consider rather big offence.<br><br>But let me tell you one sad fact abt getting license kantong in S'pore, that is chances are that u will never get back yr license again, no matter how good you are. They let you take yr test but will never pass u. Seen a few such cases already. E.g one of my dad's friend got 20 yrs of driving experience, caught drink driving. Now the revoke period is over, he tried to get back his license for a few yrs but still haven't passed! Not becos hes lousy, its becos he's being marked.<br><br>Inconsiderate driving is as bad as reckless or dangerous driving. 9 points, fine plus suspension. If suspend for 1 yr or more, it automatically mean revoke!<br><br>Nevertheless, wish u all the best too.<br><br>Regards<br><br>P/S: P-plate wun get suspension, only u r allow to ride or straight away revoked.<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"<br><br>[This message has been edited by Atti (edited 10 March 2001).]</div>

But, speeding is definitely not a stupid mistakes. I mean, lets admit it, most drivers and riders need to have the need for speed. We know it when we speed, but we still do it. Yah, i do agree, speeding at most suspension enuff, unless really go overboard by a lot. Kantong is far to serious, consider the amount of time and money spend in getting the license.<br><br>As for yr friend, wonder if he's p-plate but it doesn't matter. 150km/h is sure kantong case, no need fight. Even if hes on expressway, 90km/h, 150kn/h would mean 60km/h over the limit. Straight revoke. Think he will really feel like shit now. You and i can understand that.<br><br>Frankly speaking i am not getting on fine lor......... 2 weeks liao and still feeling very lost.

No matter if its 3 mnths, 6 mnths or 12 mnths, he will used the word disqualified. But 3 &amp; 6 = suspend, 12 = revoke.<br><br>Is yr license still at risk? hmmm...... not for the court side but still, its still a risk for you to ride on the road now cos u got ZERO points. any small mistakes caught red handed now by any TP would still meant a striaght revoke cos u r still P plate after all. My advise to you, be extra careful in riding now or dun ride for these few mnths till u get back yr point or p plate is over.<br><br>i dunnoe abt TP suspend pple, cos normally al the proceeding have to go through court 1st, be it drink driving or speeding....... so i think the judge that day on her hearing is another nerd!!! dunnoe much abt traffic also.......sigh~really wonder how he become a judge, esp traffic side.<br><br>I also know how it feels when u r in joy, u would really want to celebrate with the one u really love. I was surprised that misunderstood and u haven't get any better. Well then allow me to put it this way lar, maybe u really hurt her too badly the other time. If she doesn't want to see u, then u go and see her then! Action speaks louder than word. I am sure she will 'forgive' you soon.......... as for smoking, hmmmm.... for sake, maybe u can try cutting down, dun need to quit totally yet lor, show her u r willing to change. Or, at least when u r with her, dun smoke lor.........<br><br>Nevertheless, take care and all the best in riding and misunderstood........ well, be thankful of what u have, u r much much much luckier than me, in all the above mentioned!<br><br>Regards<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>
