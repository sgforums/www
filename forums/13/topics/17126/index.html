            <div class='col-md body'>TP is the most common on the road,of coz they take care of all the big n small things, but i heard ROv mostly focus their attention on "tai lorry", also got one more type, the type who dress like the tp n ride bikes like the tp but their plate also F plate one,those r from cisco but they like to pose alot,also becareful of highway patrol now,their BMW now got no stickers sia except for the door,if the car is following u, it will look like a normal family BMW,almost kanna that day. just becareful of white BMW parking at the side of the expressway.in the mean time i would suggest you call tp n ask about your case, coz the cop could make a mistake.</div>
