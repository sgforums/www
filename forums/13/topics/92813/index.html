Is this true?<br><br>its not the newest now. it was before. tink the latest now is wave-r. its not better than any other wave series. tested before. it suk. coz fuel injection is to control the amount of fuel going in. so petrol is safe. other than tat it wont make the bike any faster. btw honda dealer did not bring in wave-i as ther r some problem on tat bike. those selling in singapore r export in by motor shop on their own. problem as in cdi spoil, during speed ard 90km, u open throttle 1 shot engine die off or it wont increase speed. need to slowly open in order to go faster.<br><br>2 ) How much is your maintaince on the bike every month ? How much you spend for your petrol?<br>wave-s petrol ard $4.50 shell95 for full tank cover ard 150km.<br>maintaince ard $8 for engine oil. change ard every 3000km. spark plug ard $4 change ard 10000km once. bah bah bah... brake pad ard $20, tire ard $60.. bah bah bah...<br><br>3 ) Is there any problem you encountered with Honda wave bike ? i mean new bike not 2nd hand bike<br>so far no problem on wave-s. wave-i as i said, a few of my frd got it. all say suk n sell in 4month times. personally try my wave-s wif wave-i a few time. nvr outrun me before. not even on pickup.<br><br>4 ) HOw much did you pay for your bike ?
