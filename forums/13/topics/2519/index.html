Its very normal for the engine to rev alot just by increasing the throttle abit, and the engine break is a real killer.<br><br>U just drag ur gear at 1st and 2nd gear and never close throttle fully....sure wobble one. Just close a bit will do. Its also easier to do the bumpy course standing up rather than sitting down...believe me....<br><br>Gd luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dont worry i also have this problem before.You know why? Not due to the bike is too powerful is that we used to it aready cos 2B bike no power so we have to trottle a lot to get it moving. When i was learning also like that after lesson you will find that you trottle a bit on 2B bike it will die on you so dont you worry sure pass but must have patient ok good luck!</div>

Also, what your instructor meant was that if your front wheel gets locked, you're definitely gonna skid and fall.  In contrast, if the rear wheel is locked, your bike will fishtail but it can still be pulled back.<br><br>I would advise you to apply more of the front brakes(don't pull the lever all the way in though) and only a little of the rear brakes.<br><br>Don't worry, the S4 front double disc brakes are very effective so squeeze that lever harder.  With the correct technique, you'll find the e-brake a breeze soon enough.</div>

It's going to be really long ...</div></blockquote>Hey, don't be disheartened pal.  Almost everyone encounters this problem while upgrading to 2A.<br><br>I faced this problem too initially so let me share with you how I overcame it.  Whenever I'm on the bike, say waiting for the lights to turn green or waiting for my turn to do the courses, I would play with the throttle.  Get used to the responsiveness of the throttle.  Try to make the rpm rise as slowly as possible. Once you get the hang of it, the various courses will become child's play  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.  One more thing, when you close throttle, close it slowly as well just like how you open throttle.  By doing this, the engine brake won't give you that much of a headache.<br><br>Good luck.</div>
