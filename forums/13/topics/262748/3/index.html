The helmet is a Nolan flip-open helmet. Normally, one expects a helmet to protect your head in a crash; in this case it seems my friend's head protected the helmet.<br><br>I believe the hinge mechanism hit his temple, causing the eye socket damage and severe concussion. For this reason, I believe flip-open helmets are dangerous and should be avoided.</div>

Actually, to be precise in my use of words and views, i have done a cross module study (fass module) on the trends of the motorcyclist. Figures from LTA (2007) released from the official figures show that in fact 70% of the fatalities are from motorbikes. This clearly do not corespond to the percentage of motobikes in the island. Thus i believe that the views held by threadstarter is valid and cannot be contested.<br><br>I can also see the trends of reverse discrimination occurring in this thread. Since you have emphasis on me being an law student at nus, I have seen stereotying occurring at your part nevertheless. So what faculty are you in at NUS personally? Medicine?</div>
