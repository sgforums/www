            <div class='col-md body'>taxi drivers think they are the king of the road... all road users know they possess this nonsensical theory: the road belongs to them.. whoever tried hailing a taxi mostly will see the taxi driver cut into the very last lane when they see business coming... even when stopping to alight passengers, they just suddenly stop and put on hazard lights... ( and as if last minute switching hazard lights is of any use when a vehicle, especially motorbike can stop in time if at high speed..) i still remember once when i was driving late at night... there was a taxi far in front of me... but i realised he was decelerating and for no reason came to a stop.. (the whole road was almost deserted w/o cars!) i horned at him but he bo chap.. some kind of taxi driver.. (i suspected that he was too tired and wanted to stop fer a rest.. but the frustrating thing was that he didn't even bother to stop near the kerb and just on the very lane itself!!) So always be careful on the road... you never know what taxi drivers will do the veri next moment!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Show me what is love... &gt;&gt;&gt; motorbike. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Someitmes is not that they are reckless, it's sometimes, esp at nite, they are tired, so less alert. so of them hold full time jobs, but cannot meet end's meet, so do p/t taxi driver at night. Imagine, work ady time, then at nite work again, sleep 4-5 hours, then wake up and work again.<br><br>I try to drive non-stop in army 9 hour straight, damn shag sia. so cannot blame all taxi drivers.

            <div class='col-md body'>Juz a few words to "INCONSIDERATE, RECKLESS, F**K_UP THINKING etc." taxi drivers... Go &amp; screw yr mum's "pi kang"...<br><br>I sold my beloved NSR-SP b'coz of a taxi... I was in a small road where i met a taxi going at a very slow speed(almost coming to a stop like alighting a customer by the side of the road) so i signal right &amp; carry on but to what i least expect, the taxi turn right &amp; hit right onto my baby's ass &amp; i lost control of my bike due to the impact &amp; buang... I stand up &amp; look at that asshole number plate &amp; his signal light(to ensure that he never signal b4 turning)... I had hurt my back &amp; can't withstand the pain so i stood down agian but when i stand up the 2nd time, the signal light is on already... After i stand up the 2nd time, the taxi driver walk up to me smile at me &amp; say "okie or not"... I'm so furstrated that he can still smile when it's his f**king fault... I stright away f**k him &amp; ask him to try it lor... My paintwork, racing footpegs(both side break coz he hit me on my left &amp; i land on my right, pipe, alinement, fork, faring crack, brake &amp; clutch lever spoilt all b'coz of him... Guess how much he want to pay me? S$100 only ah... Not even enough to pay for my racing footpeg ah...<br><br>*Advice to all: Never go near taxi... I should say that NOT all taxi drivers are that f**k-up...<br><br>------------------<br>Competition only starts with the same bike with different riders having different minds but aiming for the same thing.....</div>

Taxi drivers lead a hard life actually and sometimes they drive a little recklessly because they are tired.  Have you ever tried driving/riding when you are tired? You'll find that you'll become a little irrational at times......<br><br>The important thing is to stay alert on the road. Try to learn from the mistakes of others; you won't have enough chances to make all the mistakes yourself.<br><br>If you fail to stay alert on the road, the next time it might not even need a taxi; just a piece of wood on the road will send you flying.</div>

Cars only pose one of them; the more common causes of bike accidents are:<br>1. Objects on the road e.g. planks<br>2. Complacent and reckless rider<br>3. Speeding<br>4. Unskilled rider i.e. dunno how to brake on wet surface. Consequently, the bike skids.<br>5. Jaywalkers<br>And btw, nope, I've not seen a bike knock into another before but I've seen a bike knock into a car with the rider flying in the air.  I've also seen a couple of bikes skid in the middle of the road before.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">5. working on the road (eg, cabs, delivery<br>workers) for long hours is not an excuse<br>lor. now u may say ... dun blame them lah<br>they making a living too.<br><br>when u kena accident bcoz of<br>irresponsible cab drivers. ill see wad<br>u say.<br><br></div></blockquote>It's not an excuse but rather, it's just a reason why some taxi drivers are reckless. And we all know that. But can you change anything by saying so much?<br>No. The next time you get on the road, those reckless taxi drivers are still gonna be there.<br>That's why I emphasised that we should always stay alert on the road because there are so many different possibilties of an accident happening. It's not just limited to irresponsible taxi drivers; there are those reckless bikers, impatient drivers and those recalcitrant jaywalkers.<br>On the road, your safety is your own responsibility.<br><br></div>
