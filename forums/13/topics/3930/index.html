            <div class='col-md body'>All you need to do is to look up the yellow pages for the numbers of whichever branch that is closest to you, then call them and ask if there are any vacancies.<br>That's what i did. I just started oso.<br><br>It's true that there are alot of Malays. But most of them are actually quite friendly. Once you get to know them, it'll be alright.<br><br>One thing you gotta know is that...besides sending orders, you oso need to do anything under the sun. More like "Bangala". Also, the bikes suck big time...need to get used to and control.<br><br>The pay is like this: $4.20/hr. $0.60 per order during wkdays, $1 during wkends. Not alot, for me noe choice, since can't find other jobs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>No NSF allowed if I'm not wrong. They do not accept your smart card.<br><br>In conclusion, yellow pages is your answer.<br><br>[This message has been edited by jungleboy111 (edited 13 May 2002).]</div>
