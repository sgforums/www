Needed the extra boost when in TPE to overtake gravel laden lorries speeding over 100km/h.  Fortunately I was single then (5 years ago) and was almost 20kg lighter.  The little bike was just able to speedup before the lorry overtook me.  I was running at almost 90km/h on the left most land then!<br><br>[This message has been edited by seeprompt (edited 30 April 2002).]</div>
