            <div class='col-md body'>dun worry! its like that. probably ur mechanic tune the 2T intake slightly higher as ur new piston will need more lube! n its better for bigger intake. more 2T will not harm but too little 2T will cause jams!<br><br>same when difficult to start! all bikes r like that!<br><br>a new bike will not give u any major problem...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no lar smoke or no smoke for 2 stroke bikes has got nothing to do with the gear box. your friend's "or you" means the 4T or gear oil in the gearbox. "or you" also refers to the 4T in the crankcase for 4 strokers. if there's black smoke for a 4 stroke bike, probably means the piston rings are loose.<br><br>for your bike, probably the 2T intake is a little high, no harm as the rest said. but coupled with a rich mixture, maybe you'll have to change spark plugs more often. make sure you carry a spare plug around in your bike.<br><br>eh but with that said, your friend is not wrong to tell you to change 4T.. during run-in it should be done regularly.. but your smoke problem is not caused by 4T lar...<br><br>------------------<br>rock hard... ride free...<br><br>[This message has been edited by l3stat (edited 03 June 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>I'm riding KIPs too. Mine FT plate and almost 1 year old liao.<br><br>2B bikes need a kind of special oil called 2T to lubricate the piston. For 4 stroke bike, this oil is not needed. Excess 2T oil is the source of the white smoke you are observing.<br><br>The white smoke is ok initially. It means your engine is receiving the oil. But a lot of white smoke not only not good to the environment, TP also might catch. Initially, when I had my bike new, there was a lot of white smoke. But as I wear-in my bike the amount of smoke became lesser until can see just a bit oonly. This I cannot explain.<br><br>In your case, I think the 2T is a bit too much. You might want to get a mechnic to adjust for you. Some info for your reference. In the morning, when you start the bike for the first time of the day, some times a lot of smoke one. But after a few minutes, I dun see any more smoke. I always let my engine warm up for a minute or 2 before moving off, else the bike really won't move one. And while stationary, you open throttle to give the engine a sudden acceleration, you should see smoke. Otherwise monitor your 2T consumption. I had one case where I did not have to top up the 2T for quite some time. Then it occured to me how come so long liao the 2T like never used up like dat ... maybe the 2T tube cot .... You get the idea ? Which brings to my attention to record every 2T change. If the interval gts unusually long, then you might want to check your 2T line.<br><br>By the way, dun pour 2T into your fuel tank hor. KIPS uses 2T metering pump. I dunno what will happen if you start to pour into your fuel tank. And, another thing, look carefully where you pour leh ... I dunno, but I have heard of my friend puring 2T into the coolant bottle and the coolant pur into 2T bottle.<br><br>I'm using Castrol TTS. Good luck !</div>
