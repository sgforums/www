But can say is a good start for u bikers. But den, some points to consider:<br><br>1) A 1 time collection of $$ will <strong>scare away ppl</strong>, which the 1st step of setting up a club doesn't want. Dun worry that ppl come &amp; go as they like, once u established is established.<br><br>2) Simple things to start up like wat snowy &amp; max_alpha has said &amp; done. <strong>Create an awareness 1st</strong>. Nothing to show, just say "I m from sgforums' racetrack" anyone who listen liao will also forgot. No shortcut to success one lah<br><br>3) A group of "fixed" ppl must always be ard to keep the setting up of club going on.<br><br>So far can only say of this, anymore...well u ppl put in the steps..<br><br>Cheers... ~ (",)</div>
