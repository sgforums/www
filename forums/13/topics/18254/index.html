            <div class='col-md body'>Henry, just my 2 cents worth of suggestion.<br>----------------------------------------<br><br>If we register it as a club or something, we must sell something.  Either we are damn good in racing, or we help them do advertising or something, they will ask you, "so what do I get in return?"  Let says we ask them for a $1 discount on something, they need to earn their $1 back, by telling them we advertise for you by putting your sticker on our bike won't help, moreover, I don't know how many people will actually wanna put arcade as sticker on the bike. As for me, I won't!!<br><br>This is roughly what I meant, if we really wanna register it to go out or something, then its quite logical.. but to get discounts, a bit cannot be done... unless u got ppl inside, then they too rich, then maybe still can work out.<br><br>Maybe you ask those in the advertising industry one, they might be able to advice further.<br><br>------------------<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Think of others on the road.

Here's a suggestion tho... think about working with charity organisations. We have to set regular events to promote various causes example Kidney foundation or SPCA or something. This is like the vintage car club. but instead we do group bike runs and family outings to promote various public messages etc. By hooking up with charity organiosations then i think it will be easier to get sponsors... this way they are more willing to come in... looks good on them. Anyway... my 2 cents worth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Transcendence<br>Rule #1 - Minimal Risk</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've thought about the question of what the companies will earn by sponsoring us. basically the answer is, more business from us.<br><br>ok lah shell 5% abit exagerating, to be honest i dun even think it is possible loh. but still must try mah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> even 1% oso very good ah.<br><br>as for the committee, this is something that will need extra discussion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>ok lah ok lah i dun have a head for business, me not JC/U student, nvr study economics b4, only a simple ah beng racer.<br>that's why i open this thread for discussion mah, ask u guys give suggestions and ideas. so at the end of the day when we've sorted out all the details etc, then we shall go ahead with the registration.<br><br>the benefits of having a club really is about discounts. if we could guarantee that we all shall use only shell petroleum, or ngk plugs, then it means we are giving them a steady supply of income, it should be from this point that we bargain for benefits. even if they aren't willing to give us discounts for petrol, we could argue for discounts for other stuff, like 2t/4t (tho i dun think any of us use shell oils  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">) or lower prices for items in the store, etc.<br><br>organising events for charity/community developement is also not a bad idea, other than that, we could aid the government in its attempt to better road safety and abide by traffic rules (us? safety? law? HAHAHA).<br><br>basically, BETTER THAN NOTHING RIGHT?<br>if we can get discount from MS arcade/buffet i feel oredi very good liao. since we frequent that place that much.<br><br>------------------<br>Target -&gt; Jha Over Rev Carbon Pipes -&gt; 100000 Yen -&gt; $1400</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also think that is a good idea. But i also agree the fact that, if we want to get benefits from others, they also need to gain some advantage from us leh. By just giving us discount to attract the support of us getting their product is not good enough.<br><br>1) The total strength there is quite little. Think about it, will they take this trouble just to earn just a little more $$ from us? Dont think so right. Some more they will also think that bikers dont pump much petrol, $10++ nia unlike Merc, BMW or many other big cars. One full tank can cost easily more that $60++ liao.<br><br>2)Do u think our advertisement is that attractive to them. They will also think that we r not like taxis, travel so much. So more, what are we in Singapore? We are not pro racer. Not that many ppl will really respect us.<br><br>3) Big companys are not so easy to get through without ahving certain standart. They have their reputation also. And they will be scare that we might spoil their reputation.<br><br>4) We dont really have much things that can attract them. They might as well save the trouble and use other form of advertisement that can attract more public.<br><br>[This message has been edited by No_regret (edited 06 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i can see a lot of us like the idea of having this as a club, but membership must be taken into serious consideration... imagine we recruit someone we thot is good, and end up got big problem, what will happen to all of us...<br><br>let's do this... those who want the club leave their names behind, those who dun want, also include in a seperate list, then we know we din miss them out... then from the list, we select a committee to look into it, how abt that??

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, they simply wont sponser us.<br>Reasons being, alot of them has been raised.<br>But the main reason would be, What GOOD WILL IT DO FOR THEM? and also Will the club spoil our company image.<br>Based on the size of racetrack and the reputation of overall Singapore motorbikers, if i'm the person in charge, i really can't think of any reasons or profits that i could have of supporting Singapore motor bikers.<br><br>If really given a choice, i will choose cars instead of bikes..because alot of people pay more attention to cars rather than bikes, so u get what i mean?<br><br>All the above are from my opinion and from the perspective of a person in charge of a company for marketing.</div>

So if you want to create a club, do organise road-trip, charity show, visits...<br><br>Make a name for ourselves and then sponsor will pour in..<br><br>Agreee???<br></div>
