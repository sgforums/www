            <div class='col-md body'>he said he want to catch the culprit.. so i say ok lor if u wan catch the culprit urself then u better have evidence lor like having a video recorder n record everything.. so he has prove.. realli very sick of those ppl.. if i can speak to the president i would want to tell him to improve security in those multi storey carparks.. eg. installing security cameras.. i did post a topic a bt this suggestion some one replied "Added security measures will be borne by the public in terms of less rebates and increased taxation"  "Ask your bf if he's willing to pay more for season parking"  if i were to be one of the drivers using the carpark i dun mind paying extra $$ on security.. better then not having one then parts get stolen n u have to pay more in the end to get the parts or ur vehicle repaired</div>
