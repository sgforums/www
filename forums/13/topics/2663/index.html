            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings racetrack friends,<br>I am a current member of this forum, and have been here for quite a long time, long enough to see some of the things that make me, quite upset about. Maybe some of you may notice that this is my first mail, why is that so? Because, if i post this thread out using my real nick, we may create some bad blood, so I will just post out my views, and note, ITS ENTIRELY MY VIEWS. No flame to any particular person.<br><br>First, The pledge.<br>Personally, I think its stupid.<br>"I, xxx, nick xxx, solemnly and sincerely pledge that, i will not start or join in any chat activities, that humanly creates flames, chaos, and un-integrity, in this SG forums. If i have in any circumstances, done the above act, i am willing to be treated un-excusable by others, and be ignored."<br><br>I believe that you all are mature adults and do know that this is a virtual forum where people come and go to chat and post topics. To have a pledge that one would not flame each other is quite childish in my views. Its like you're pledging to a contract,a secret society or something like that. And I do not mean that you all are gangsters when i said secret society, but just that, you all get so serious about this virtual forum that you even set a pledge for it. Its definitly very childish.<br><br>Second, Registering of an official club for this forum.<br>Basically, this forum consists of many special individuals. The need to set up an offcial club is really not there. Why set up a club? My guess is, to ask for discounts from companies, to let people know that you're in some kind of club where people ride instead of walk. And from what I have observed for a long time, there's only less than 5 person really committed for this kind of big thing. Its an official club registered with the Gov. The club will need lots of attention. Like legal services, financial services, real mature adult thinking. And in my opinion, I don't really know anyone in this forum that has reach that kind of mentality and committment. Another is that this forum doesn't have alot of committed people who wants to be in the club. Its definitly perfect if its just a group of riders who wants to have outings every now and then, but to register an official club when there's only ard 10-20 people who just wants to have some fun, I can't really see a reason behind it. Besides, are you guys really united?<br><br>Third, SP<br>Everytime some thing happens, 3 out of 5 2b bikes belong to SP. Why is it so? In my opinion, its because some of the riders riding SP are gangsters, they tend to upset almost every riders that they don't like. So, some of the other riders or maybe even normal people, they see a SP on the road or just parking in a car parks, things happen. So that's why.<br><br>Bascially that's all that I can think right now. So do take a min or two to read through and ponder about it. Thank you.<br><br>Watcher<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By setting up the club is by getting people togather for outings without getting arrested.Does it really bother you with what we are doing?? If it does, you are welcome to leave this place, we won't be bothered.<br>Secondly, you think SP riders are bad? Who the hell are you to say that?! So what if all things that happened involved with SP, are you riding one? If not don't bother abt it coz it's non of your business.<br>Lastly, about the pledge. It's for us to decide whether we wanna do it or not. And it's not being childish or wat. We are just keeping harmony in here just like friends telling each other about not fighting or quarrelling. Will you not bother if your friends fight againist each other?<br>Finally, if you bother about what we do you can don't come in here. You are the one that should be mature enough to mind your own business and don't pop your nose into other peoples'.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rep150 (edited 10 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway im tinking abt this when im bathing.. the pledge is just some form of agreement between us not to do tings like flaming.. and if some1 happen to break the agreement, the rest of the pple got the rite to ignore that person etc.<br><br>every tings need a agreement. mirc have its own rules.. forum have its own pledge. its not really a childish act. its true that most of us are aredi adult, we shld know how to tink.. but if u realise, there wil always be some black sheep ard... so.... a plegde aka agreement is very impt.. i hope u understand...<br><br>anyway.. since u find all this childish.. u can just simply dun join. that is always the best way out.<br><br>no offend... my 2 cents worth</div>

Just that I feel all of you not ready to handle such a big thing, and the keyword is FEEL not other extreme words. Yes, you will be able to get lower rates for hotel rooms and such because that is you're forming a big group of people. It has nothing to do with the official club, unless you have contract terms with the company.

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe SP got a bad name on the road or elsewhere bcos many ppl ride that bike and the tendency of catching some bad SP ride is higher. You should always believe that its not the bike that makes those idiotic moves..Its the rider.<br><br>No matter what bike you ride, if you are a lousy and good for nothing rider, you will make a bad impression on other riders.<br><br>As for the pledge, at first i find it funny but come to think of it, it's actually feasible and correct for the pledge to be created. If you think a pledge is childish, then what do you say to an agreement between companies pledging to share profits and work related stuffs. Do you think if they dont take the pledge of agreement to abide to the rules,the other company would want to do business with them??<br><br>So you see, pledging is not done only for "children"..it is practise anywhere and everywhere whether you like it or not. It just a protocol for members to abide to and to respect. If you dont have any respect to the pledge, then sad to say you dont have any respect to members here... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Abt the SP issue, i think u should go for the rider &amp; not the bike... There's a saying "dun chop down all the trees in the forest juz b'coz u want one of it to have amper sunlight"... U get what i mean? Be fair to other considerate SP rider... At times u'll also ride recklessly too &amp; that includes everyone... Does that mean that we're to be in the blacklist as well? I belive every living creature have ups &amp; downs so why make life diffecult for everyone? U share yr points of view &amp; i share mine...

This is a forum; everyone has a right to "speak". So far, I see the comments on watcher, it gives me the feeling that a lot of us has harsh replies simply because we dun like wat he has said, instead of thinking about what he was talking about.<br><br>Not all people think a like. Please try to bear with each other's differences. You dun go out and start chopping people you buay song with, with a parang. So there ... What you dun like, you can simply ignore. Often, there are some truths in facts that you can't accept.<br><br>Ok. Personally, I do think the pledge sounds kind of childish (I said personally liao hor) and sort of useless.<br><br>So far I have no problems with SP riders. It's cars that I have problems with. And probably the Malaysian scooters. Like to shoot out from nowhere, and come so close. ( dunno why they like to come co close, the roads big enuff wat)<br><br>So, that's all ... probably I'll kena flame also ? hah hh a ...

But, somethings I realised here..... theres alot of SP riders in this forum. When you say about SP, in general, you meant the rider and the bike. I think you should have rephrase your words. So I think you have stepped into their defense zone.<br><br>Actually, its the rider that makes the bike bad. SP is really a wonderful but. Though I do find the weight a drawback, the power is still there. Power is something lacking in 2B bikes. Thats why getting a SP is a good alternative. Other than that, the price, parts and road tax is dirt cheap when compared to bigger bikes.<br><br>I don't recognise myself as a good rider. I will lap ppl if they offend me. This is me. But HEY! I don't ride a SP..... do you get the point? Its all in the riders not the bike.<br><br>Registering the club is some sort of dream, though it's really not gonna be accomplished within soon. But well, this is also some sort of dreams that keep the people here going and most importantly, keep the people here united. Don't you agree?<br><br>I understand the fact why you didn't use your real nick. Cause I have seen people that used that own nicks and post something that cause a flame war, and they have been cursed and swear. This is something which I had seen time and again. I respect your decision. From the way I look at it, its the best to keep your real nick to yourself.<br><br>A bike is something not alive, how the bike behaves and responds is up to the rider himself. In the future, try to say your words tackfully.<br><br>To ALL:<br><br>This gonna hurt guys... those that has taken the pledge, do you guys notice something? You have not abidded the pledge by flaming him. Kindly rephrase the way you use your language against him. Lets try to rephrase it in a softer tone. Please read up the pledge again and you can get what I meant.<br><br>Wahaha...think this is the longest post Ah Huat has posted. Damn lor sor sia!!<br><br>To REP150:<br><br>Tat day you said you gonna give me your icq?? Kuku head man you....reach home forget everything liao.
