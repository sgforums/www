I can juz say that "watcher" is one of the flamers "toa payoh" or "honda"... How is "watcher" going to cover himself/herself when someone assume that he's one of the flamers... U get what i mean? That's y i say it's better to post wif the nick u always use to post &amp; not to create a new nick juz to prevent all this... When i dun like someone, i tell him face to face &amp; not creep here &amp; there... At least i'm not a fucker when talks behind ppl back... Juz 4get everything lah... Why continue?
