            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>1) How do i actually start going in getting a bike?</blockquote>There are two options to get your biking world started. Option 1 from motortiam and second, private.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Motortiam</strong></span><br>Motortiam has various of bikes either second hand motorcycles or first hand motorcycles. Such motorcycles have a form of name calls OMV or themselves evaluation and determine the value accordingly. But not overly as we do have black shops out there.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Do remember to ask for friends that are capable to know simple checkings on bike before purchasing it.</span><br><br>Motortiams have such practise in charges which as: Administration (processing fee), roadtax (OTR for second and new bikes), insurance (OTR for second and new bikes), transfer fee (OTR for second and new bikes), agreement fee (installment applies and check amount), GST and interests (for new 3~4% and used bikes i saw was 5~6%). OTR (on the road) means that above said should be included utimately to bring the bike to be legally ridden on Singapore road. Always ask for a black &amp; white (documents) to indicate charges before signature is to be dropped on the documents.<br><br>Generally, the transfer will take about 2~3 days depends on their do-able. Do bear in mind that second hand bikes do not come with GST. GST is meant for 1st hand bike which has not been ridden before. Most probbaly, you will see the log card has 1 ownership if it has been registered before (motortiam 1st ownership subsequent will be transfered).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Private</strong></span><br>This normally lies on you and the seller to come to an agreement of the price deters the sale's. Should you are interested in that bike. You can either put deposit to secure the bike or directly go down to sim ming (LTA) to transfer the ownership. Insurance must be bought before doing the transfer. You can either choose the famous NTUC or Mitsui.<br><br>Before paying any deposit. Remember to include document to certify the transaction to safe-guard you and the seller (must be fair incase either party deny).<br><br>Similarly, you can assign some old timers to check on the bike. Identify the problems. If such being found... And cost impact not apparent. Negotiate on the final.<br><br><blockquote>2) Wat are the basic procedures in getting a bike?</blockquote>Find a suitable candinate to check on the bike. In general like: Suspension (push down and see the rebound), chain &amp; spockets (chain should not be rusted or lagged more than half of the finger and spockets must not be sharpen), tyres (must have threadings), forks (no leaks on the surface and good absorb when force is applied), exterior (should be easy to judge), silencer (for 2 strokes bikes the silencer should not have oil leaks), ride the bike (free hand when at 50~60km/h, if shaky steering cones are out), open valve (if 2 strokes bikes try exceed the rmp 7~8 see whether the powervalve opens. Different bikes vary at different rpm), check the engine has leaks or not (gaskets) and others like milleage etc.<br><br><blockquote>3) Wat are some basic info that i should know? eg..insurance, sub-rider, coe.</blockquote>Insurance has three types you need to know.<br><br>1) Comprehensive (which covers everytime. In simple: Fire &amp; theft, motorist knock you or you knock them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> are covered)<br>2) Third party with fire and theft (Motorists knock you only and with fire &amp; theft)<br>3) Third party (Motorists knock you only)<br><br>NTUC has stopped allowing eldest rider to be the chargable premium as on 1st august 2005. Hence, youngest riders will be taken according to the premium. Options said are NTUC or Mitsui.<br><br>COE. Every motorcycles COE has a cycle of 10 years. Determine from the plate number as 2001 equals FT etc. COE is renewable or extendable for either 5 years (no more renew for the next oncoming. Must scrap) or 10 years (extendable for the next renewal).<br><br>Sub-rider wise. Can be done when doing renewal or getting new insurance. When your policy is with effect... You can add a sub rider too but the charge is higher than renewal amount. No mistakes that the sub rider is covered with your selected insurance premium too.<br><br></div>
