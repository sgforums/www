I believe all of you heard of stories where girlfriends so called "run away" with other guys while they are performing their national service.<br><br>cases like these do happen but is not so frequent. If you happen to be one of the few unlucky guys....<br><br>cheer up. think in this way: you should be happy for yourself, at least now you know that the girl is not so called "totally faithfully" to you, easily influenced by external factors and run away while you are not with her.<br><br>of course, saying is easier than doing.<br>you do get hurted in the beginning, thinking why she walked away from you when you needed her most at the moment.<br><br>don't worry, at least now, you have a new bunch of friends in your living bunk.
