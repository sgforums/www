A place for them to toke, know each other and exchange contact no. then unite as 1 if possbile.<br><br>i oso noticed tat old bird are all quite bz now. thus no tuiz organise by them. maybe the old bird wants to find some time.. if possible?<br><br>i ask ard and happened to find out y the old bird dint join the new bird outings.. its because of some1. i tink tat is the biggest obstruction between the new and the old. if we really wan the new and old to unite, its either leave that person out, or the old accept him as who he is. if not.. then like wat 1 of the old bird say.. "let it be the way it is now".<br><br>another ting is.. a lot of us are quite broke. thus if possible. organise outing tat is cheap.<br><br>And hope pple are less fussy abt tings... especial where to go and wat to eat.<br>last time when i 1st join outing.. pple say go where.. i just follow. i dun complain. my dear and i live in the west... u all go east we oso follow.. now pple onli wan tuiz near their hse.. which i tink is another big prob.<br><br>erm.. tat all i can tink of now.. hope i make myself clear of wat i mean. sori im not gd at expressing myself..<br><br>hope the racetrack can be united as 1 again!<br><br>gd luck every1.. ride safely always.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Closing the channel is only a way to escape from troubles. IRC can be a very spontaneous way of interacting one another. Same thing might happen if put this situation in the forum. Not that i am protecting my own channel. To me...its juz a way to escape from reality.<br><br>Come on guys, lets try not to put ourselves as lao jiao or xin jiao.........we are juz bikers that wana have fun. Don't we? Go outing, must be spontaneous. Go out in outing does not mean a chance to wack your bike and show off to others. If you have this mentality, you are one big sucker.<br><br>No matter how you mod your bike or watsoever, the capability is in the bike. So wat if your bike can hit 300km/h. That is on the bike, not you. It all depends on the rider, the rider good, wat ever bike oso good. Its all in the skill.<br><br>In singapore, you want to speed. By all means, go. Hit your top speed without hesitation. But think about the other road users, dun create such a bad image for bikers. Bike is a hobby and transport to me. This should only be the bottom line for everyone.<br><br>When ppl got outing, ppl move together... They dun race with one another on the road, they move in staggered formation or something like that. Along the way, can joke and laugh wat. No point racing like some crazy bastards and ram into old ladies or children????<br><br>Guess some of you need to revaluate the meaning of group riding.<br><br>__________________________________________<br>Now economy bad lar, wanna go out, try to think of somewhere tat is cheap lor. And pls, make sure the whole thing is planned properly. Not something like, "Go where go where?" Organisers are supposed to plan ahead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No No guys, Closing off is definitely NOT gonna solve the problem!<br><br>I apologise for MIA so long, its just TOO BUSY for me liao... imagine i now Sat/Sun still in my stupid camp's guardhouse to use their stupid com... haiz... this is the only time i have to check up forums....<br><br>1st my gf Monster had already pointed out some of the problem. *Thanx dear for the points*<br><br>Now we have to find solutions for these problems am i right?<br><br>These problem occur mainly i think its becoz, nowadays riders are just to self centred thinking. We all need to do our little small part to make everything nice for us.<br><br>Example? If we plan to go somewhere, do your little part like says "ok, lets go", "onz"<br><br>Instead of, "ehhh don wan leh... so far..." "mai lah... bo liao" or what "mother cook soup, must go home drink, paiseh" these kinda shits.<br><br>2ndly, our group MAINLY lacks of a leader, or what u wanna call, a moderator. Someone who organizes, plans, and runs the show most of the time. We have this problem is coz most of use are too busy to take up such a position. People will thinks its a burden/load to carry. Our organiser used to be NIck34, but too bad he now no bike licence liao, only drive car, thats why its kinda hard for him too.<br><br>Solution for this, i have thought of one. We have to SYSTEMATIC. No system, there will alot of so called "Indian Chiefs" around. Like, we plan some outing, and we must SPECIFY the IC for that event. He will be the one responsible for the contacts and events. This IC will be randomly choosen, as to be fair for other riders around. Each rider will have the chance to lead once. Fair? Don be too worry, IC is just a name, when come out, all of us will be helping u out. Ur main is just to be there, when everyone lost or what, they will just shout for u, and u will plan the next step. Know what i mean? (The IC we choose for each outing will be someone we think he can do it one, don worry okie?)<br><br>And lastly, for problems like, internal affiars or "political" problems. We will solve them when we have teh tarik sessions. Now we tok in net, no point. Chat face to face better, am i right? I might also have some internal problems related around, but i know its MIGHT be just some misunderstandings. But so? The main problem now is NOT my or YOUR internal affair, is this FORUM's affiars. Know what i meant?<br><br>So, we just have to call for a BIG EVENT night. For all riders to come together, not specifying Old/New birds, just purely riders, to come out for a re-fresh gathering.<br><br>This gathering, Tok no use, i will be the first to volunteer to be the IC for this event. Steady? But it will somewhere after 15th June, becoz i'm now on course, very very busy. I'll keep u all updated ok guys? =).<br><br>3 Cheers!<br>Hip Hip! Horray!<br>Hip Hip! Horray!<br>Hip Hip! Horray!</div>

U noe last time is like 1 person noe.. dat person will let other ppl noe of the outing? Dat was hw united we were.But nw some jus keep the outings 2 themselves.<br><br>movie tiu,pa pool at selegie,chomp chomp dinner,fishermen v,pebble bay.......the same familiar places we always hang out &amp; had so much fun. Now even got same tiu organised aso the feeling is diff liao.<br><br>the thing abt some ppl stated got bf,gf no time is I tink not realli relevant in our context. cos most of ur partners I beleive is known via irc.. since we all noe each other, y cannot come out 2gether? of cos we understand those moments when u wanna tian mi mi go ahead la.. we wun force u come outin one ma. The issue abt having a bf or gf no time come outings is jus overruled... cos u guys r stil coming out... except wif other ppl ma.<br><br></div>
