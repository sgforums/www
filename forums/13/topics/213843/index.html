            <div class='col-md body'>This morning while riding with my wife as pillion along the left lane of Upper  Changi Road North opposite the Salvation Army, I wanted to change lane to the right to turn into Changi North St 1. The traffic was heavy, I checked the right mirror and saw a taxi some distance  behind me, infront was a lorry. With my eyes on the back of the lorry and the taxi some distance back, I change lane. Argh!  To my horror there was a full sized car on my right, in the blind spot. I saw its front left head-light just in time, I tried to apply the front brake but trottle more instead, and I quickly pull in the clutch. I free wheeled and slide along the left of the car. The car braked  and I wobbled ahead stepping down my gears.<br>I slowed down to allow the driver to come along side, He was askance, I <span style="font-style: italic;">tah peh</span> the driver profusely. Sorry, sorry. He was an army officer, he shake his head. I apologized, he continued his way, and I mine.<br>I wonder if his car suffered some scratches.<br>My wife scolded me continuously all the way.<br><br>Thankfully it did not turn out bad. But I feel very bad about it.<br>IT WAS ENTIRELY MY FAULT.<br><br>I failed to check blind spot.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, you are not the only one who does check blind spot. Most Singapore Drivers doesn't check at all. Especially those driving bigger cars or so call branded cars. They also think that others should let them just because they drive a bigger, more expenisve cars. So what!! Some even never bother to signal when they are making a turn. These are the people who create ACCIDDENTS. F**K U.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its not that I do not have a habit of checking blind spot, I always check. Even when I am sure there are no vehicles alongside me.<br>Call it Murphy's or Hobson's Law, the one time when I did not check nearly ended in disaster.<br>Phew! The full length of a sedan car totally invisible in the blind spot!<br>I'll never forget that.<br><br>Taught me a lesson not to trust my mirror 100%.<br><br>By the way in that incident, I did signal, but it was for the taxi that I saw in the mirror. I guess the army officer thought I would change lane behind him, therefore he did not horn at all.<br><br></div>

We had Bah Chor Mee at 85 and while exiting the CP i waqs behind my tow truck friend. He turn left and i turn right and i just followed without checking at all. When i was about to go into the next lane, i rise my right hand and wave BB to my friend. That instance when my hand came up , a taxi hit me. All my frens was shocked. My fren called the tow truck back and up my bike went up.<br><br>End of the story is. This accident which could have be provided has set me back a lot. I could not move for days , till now i have yet to regain my full movability.</div>
