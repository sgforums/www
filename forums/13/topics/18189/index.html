SSDC is located at yio chu kang, near the MRT station, just behind the civil defence camp. CDC is located at ubi. don't have the numbers, try their websites.<br><a href="http://www.ssdcl.com.sg" rel="nofollow">www.ssdcl.com.sg</a>  <a href="http://www.bbdc.com.sg" rel="nofollow">www.bbdc.com.sg</a>  <a href="http://www.cdc.com.sg" rel="nofollow">www.cdc.com.sg</a><br><br>as for the theory lessons, it's not that bad, but i cannot remember the exact required standard. i think if you get 5 or less answers wrong, out of 50 or 60, you pass the test. for riding, only a single test, the riding theory test, is required, unlike driving.<br><br>if you wish to practise without a license, the driving centres offer this service, with the condition that you'd have attained at least a certain standard in their syllabus. this varies for driving centre to centre, so i'm not that sure.<br><br>just enrol and start the lessons, practising without a license is not advisable for public roads, as it is illegal. and you cannot rent a bike without a valid license and one year's experience in riding for that license class. practice sessions (called "self-practice" in SSDC) don't cost more than $11 or $12 per session (100 minutes). it's not worth the risk, as the penalty for riding/driving without a license is a fine and a 2 year ban from learning/driving for all vehicle classes. will be worse if you hit someone...<br><br>hope this helps.<br><br>------------------<br>rock hard... ride free...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks alot l3stat and Gums!!!<br><br>I'll check their websites for the numbers. however, I really wish to take the exams without having to enrol in classes or courses as they are quite expensive. I'm still a student and working to support myself as well. So paying for classes is not one of my options. I'm very confident in my riding experience (not theory) as where I came from the traffic is a nightmare compared to Singapore. So if anyone can lend me his theory book, I'll be very grateful.<br></div>

I dunno how difficult it is to get a license in Vietnam, but I assume it'll cost you less than it'll cost you in Spore.<br><br>If getting a license there is not too much a hassle, it's better to get a license there (you do go back to Vietnam for holiday once in a while, don't you? ). Then when you get back to Spore, you can just convert your license, as l3stat has mentioned before. The effort is minimal compared to having to go thru the entire normal process. And it'll cost you less than 50 bucks, if I remember correctly. You just need to pass the theory test, which is not very tough (based on my experience). Almost all questions can be answered using common sense, except the ones that involve signs or street markings. The theory book can be bought when you enroll for the theory test.<br><br>Once you pass the theory test, bring the notification letter to Traffic Police HQ at Paya Lebar, and they'll convert your license for you. It's not a probation license, so you don't have to put on P-plate on your bike / car. Good luck!</div>

Unfortunately, it's the rule in Spore, and bitching about having to ride a smaller cc bike won't make the government bend the rule just for you, will it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Unless if you're really serious about it, maybe you can start a campaign or petition directed to Traffic Police to change the rule.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

But the person doesn't have to stay outside Spore for 6 months. So he can get the license from his own country, then enter Spore and stay happily here for 6 months until it's valid for him to convert.<br><br>I'm not saying your information is wrong, but maybe the regulation has changed over the time.

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe regulations change over time, tts y i stated clearly it was yr 2000 tt i converted my lic and those were wat i encountered in yr 2000. the foreign lic conversion form tt i filled in stated at least consecutive 6 mths stayin in the country wher the lic was issued. hwever, ther will always be exceptional cases for lic conversion. the best is to go down personally n check it out. i hav friends successfully converted their 3mth old lics bt oni after hrs of interview wif the officers. warlock, u can try at ur own risk. else, it might b better to get ur lic in spore...u need mayb 2-3 mths...<br></div>
