It can unless you hold on to brakes and rev a little, but this will wear out the clutch.

Also, which shop can i change back to the original exhaust, and how much will it cost?<br>And if i dont change... and if TP see, what will happen(fine how mcuh?).

I alerady got it leh. actually, its for transport, yes. also the price is also a concern. But then again, many would say i'll prob. spend much on repairs. sigh... dunno wat to do lah. But, anyway, life is a gamble right? I will definatly like a WR, but in a few months time, i will be getting a @a bike, so selling the WR after 3 months would make me lose quite a bit too. But wats done is done, i just need to pray for the best now.<br><br>A question... how much 2T to put ah? I know this question is damm dumb, but understand that this is the first time i am touching a bike, and i only started learning less than a week ago. heehe. More 2T, wat will happen? Less 2T, wat will happen? Will any 2T from shell be ok? Which 2T is recommend from shell? I only wanna use shell.<br><br>thanks.</div>
