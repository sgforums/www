"ASPHOON" at Bt Merah/Serangoon/Changi. But most people go to Serangoon one, its directly opposite GHC.<br><br>Their bikes have no GST and no other hidden charges, Just the bike and the interest. Thats all. Look for Jonnathan at Serangoon.<br><br>I asked for a 2nd hand TZM previously, FN plate $4500 only. And 7% interest. Thats ALL. U all go visit its website at <a href="http://www.asphoon.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.asphoon.com</a>  Lots to view.</div></blockquote>asphoon... heard a lot of compliments from other people... the mechanic there one called "ah xiang" heard he is good skilled...<br><br>another motorshop called Go Pa (wu bai) at amk ave 5 AutoPoint. The service is good... my friend went to change spark plug and engine then they will auto help you check here and there... very responsible. But they very slow heehee...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
