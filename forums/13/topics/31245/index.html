            <div class='col-md body'>Please share yours, this serves as a warning to those young and newbie riders to take care of themselves on the road.<br>My latest buang, is last week or is it the previous week....nevermind...here goes....<br><br>I was traveling along AYE in the morning, heading towards the city, I was riding on the first lane, overtaking, I wasn't paying attention, then a vehicle infront of me brake. Shit, I e-brake, but siao liao, cannot e-brake in time, so to make the best outcome in a bad situation, I tried to siam to the left. Too late, Bang! I crash into the vehicle. scratch the car's left side bumper and crash left side lights(brake,reverse,etc lights) and I fell onto the 2nd lane.<br><br>I was lucky that day, the car on the 2nd lane stop just in time, so I wasn't run over. I just got bruise and scratches on my right leg. And the shocking thing is my bike no problem!!!! That fella's car got smash and my bike no problem.<br><br>But I thank the heaven that I'm in one piece, just think, if the 2nd lane car didn't stop, I wouldn't be here writing this. It was my fault anyway, I wasn't paying attention on the road, just have to live with my mistake and pay the damages.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>My advice to newbies : Pay attention on the road. Accidents happen in a split second!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
