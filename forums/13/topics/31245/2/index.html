            <div class='col-md body'>actually phantom cannot be considered safe bike. it's as fast as the SP but has shit for brakes. the turning angle is too wide, sometimes while turning kena forced by other vehicles (cars/bikes watever) to take a lower lean angle. the lean angle of this bike is also too low, such that if you enter a corner at too high a speed , good bye.<br><br>wanna do stunt or not is up to u one. last time my ta150, wheelie, burn out all do before. oso like to jam rear brake and let it skid to a stop sideways. i've managed an 80Â° wheelie before (or pop if you're anal about specific terms).  it doesn't matter what bike you're on, if there's a will, there's a way. cutting through traffic, it's not as hard as you imagine it to be.<br><br>and now that i think back about it, i severely regret getting the phantom. i'd rather have an SP or a mito or a hornet oh heck even a skipper, at least those are fun to play with.<br><br>the only bikes worth riding are sportbikes.</div>
