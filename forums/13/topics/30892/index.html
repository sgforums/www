            <div class='col-md body'>I'm riding a Virago 125. Recently there is some problem with the electric start up.<br><br>It started with last week, when I finish riding home at night, with no problem at all. The next day, when trying to start up, it can't. The sound from the ignitor sound like as if the battery is flat, which I dun understand why all of a sudden the battery can just died ( the front light, neutral light and signals are still ok though)<br><br>I sent it to the mechanic, and he charged the battery to full.<br><br>It seems fine for a moment. Today I ride again, but from the sound of starting up it seems that the battery is weakening. The weird part is in the evening, when I try starting up again, the "battery flat sound" returns (other lights still ok).<br><br>However, when I reverse the bike out of the parking lot a few steps, and in stationary, I tried again. This time, the bike suddenly came back to life again (the electrical start up seems to have no problem at all!) The flat battery sound had just disappear when I start up. Just now I tried again, and it's working fine.<br><br>The thing I would like to know is - is it possible that the movement of the wheels could affect the start up process? I'm not talking about run start. Thanks.</div>
