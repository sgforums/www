            <div class='col-md body'>This is wat i know of:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KTM</span><br>High maintenace as this is a performance bike that gives a realtime performance. Very powerful bike because this bike is a race-ready bike. Price is high but worth getting it. Provided you know a good mech about KTM. Not all mech noe about this bike well.

All these bikes are 4 strokers except CRM250. XR200 is said to be the upset production. But to me, I find that it has good a good pick up. Low topend is a definate thing. XLR200 is an old bike but then again, its a super duper low maintenace bike. XR400 is what I consider as lowest maintenace 400cc bike available in Singapore. (Lets not tok about 400cc scooters). But biggest drawback is that this bike is too heavy to play around with. CRM250 is not as common in singapore as stop production already. My neighbour has one.<br><br><blockquote>Suzuki</blockquote>Not really familiar with Suzook family.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kawasaki</span><br>KDX125 and KDX200.<br>Don't get this bike........ I heard Xiao Hei used this bike to flew over the river or something like that lar.... That bike belongs to some singaporean. Cause he tried to sell me that bike. Don't get this bike cause old already, dun get yourself headaches for getting the parts. KDX200 actual engine displacement is 216cc. Only availabe 8 units in Singapore. My friend used to own one. Another do not get bike.</div>
