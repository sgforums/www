Just that i hate drivers who think that they pay more roadtax and keep driving on the right lane when they are going so slow. I think all drivers have the concept that all bikes are slow. And only cars tailgate them and high bleam them, then they give way. We bikes do the same thing, those drivers die die wouldn't give way. And one more thing, please drivers, when you want to change lane, PLEASE signal! We don't have X-rays eyes that can see through your car.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... i do not think a car driver's reflexes r as fast as a biker's... most of the time, i move off first. so far, i can beat most cars in terms of acceleration on my first 3 gears. after dat i lose out (i'm on a 2b bike) esp 2 larger cars like beemers, so generally i'll zoom in front n lane change 2 the left.<br><br>i agree that bikers have a better - in fact, much better - awareness of the rd. i say this as a driver n as a biker. i think there is no way a driver in a car can beat a biker in reflexes.<br>oh ya, squeezing in front makes me feel gd... the joker who shot past me den kena stuck by traffic... i just squeeze thru, so shiok the feeling.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>as 4 high beaming, i admit guilt. sometimes i lose control of my temper, i go behind the vehicle dat offended me, n high beam n stay rite behind...</div>
