            <div class='col-md body'>Hey can anyone tell me how to put the bike on main stand? I'm taking Class 2B lessons now and I really hate my lessons because of this. The instructors dont let me put the bike on side stand but only use their mouth to tell me  how to do it.<br><br>They ask me to put left hand on the handle bar, right hand on crash bar and pull it up. I really use all my strength to pull until want to die but the bike still cannot go on main stand. Can someone help me by giving me another technique <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  Thanks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly I hope you don't make sweeping statements like the instructors...<br>If you can't mount the bike on the main stand, you can't pass the TP test.<br><br>One thing I'd add to the technique described by the others:<br><br>When you kick down the main stand with your foot, you will reach a point when the two parts of the main stand will touch the ground. Once this happens, the bike should be stable.<br><br>This should be the point your resting point before you look half-right and swing it in one smooth motion. It is not a function of strength, it's the momentum.<br><br>One other tip is to take a deep breath and exhale when starting to pull it from this position.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Contrarian... seriously I am not making a sweeping statement. You might have been pretty good or maybe faster at learning that's why you probably didn't get yelled at so much.<br><br>There are 2 in particular who yell so much but won't help at all. I do admit that there is one who is very helpful but there are 2 whom I got for a couple of lessons who were really horrible to all the students. In particular my 2nd lesson instructor, there was another guy who was also struggling to mount the bike and he yelled at us like as if we were expected to know evrything on the 2nd lesson.<br><br>And thank u very much for the tip. I'll take note of it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

You might have been pretty good or maybe faster at learning that's why you probably didn't get yelled at so much.<br></div></blockquote>actually i'm bad student who took 33 lessons at SSDC before i finished - took lesson 1 six times, lesson 3 five times and lesson 6 six times. you wouldn't believe how bad i was at controlling the bike at slow speeds, and i had my fair share of yelling.<br><br>i've had at least sixteen of the instructors taking me before. what i'm saying is that i wouldn't make a statement that the instructors at SSDC are "..." even today, because it is not becoming to make generalisations to a whole class of people because of a few.<br><br>i don't like being stereotyped and i don't think you would either. imagine if someone called you a lousy lady biker who can't even set the bike on the stand and that lady bikers are like that.<br><br>as you say, some instructors perhaps aren't as friendly as you like, but relax. you just started your lessons. wait till you finish the course and look back.<br><br>back to your question: it's not a matter of strength. Note: pull not with your arm strength, but with your shift of your body weight.<br>use the momentum of the swinging motion once you have both sides of the main stand on the ground. look right, step down, shifting your body weight by pulling right with one smooth motion. if you miss, keep the bike with the two sides of the main stand on the ground, breathe in, try again after composing yourself.</div>
