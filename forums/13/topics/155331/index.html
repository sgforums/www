            <div class='col-md body'>It good to have the habit of staying back in the bike shop while servicing your bike especially for new riders, in that way, you will able able to learn more about the trouble shoot on bike, also make it a habit to let the bike shop know that if they want to change any parts, you will have to be inform first and the PRICE as well. I do have experience of the bike shop change parts without my knowledge beforehand, I told them I will not pay and change back the part for me.</div>
