After receieving the license I went to check some bike shops at Serangon Rd with great enthusiasm but it was really a pain to see very few options for the bikes under 200cc. I saw Varadero XL125 at one shop and the guy there was quoting S$9800 for it with everything included. On another shop(which had no varadero in stock) was quoting S$7000 with everything included and promising 2 week delivery on order...i double checked - everyting included and of course first hand. What really baffled me further was that the guy on the second shop(cheaper price one) was really discouraging me from purchasing the bike. He was saying that this bike has some overheating problem and spare parts are very expensive. And that the resale value is very bad. I really loved the bike but these strange things are confusing me.

"nothing fantastic, don't expect too much..."<br><br>er.. actually, this bike banks in on the typical new biker's desire to ride a shiny large bike as soon as possible... but the added weight of the frame with the small engine means it's not going anywhere in a hurry. it's also designed for the UK "learner legal" market, where the max power is 15bhp.<br><br>regarding parts, i won't worry so much if i were you, but cosmetics wise, i would. it's unlikely that it would require any major parts change in the first 2 years, being a new bike, if you maintain the bike regularly. probably after then, when the market for it picks up, you're going to see more parts for it. but do think about cosmetic things like fairings. er.. not cursing you, but it's easy to get damaged fairings... accidents and stuff. not easy to find... oh yes, accessories are expensive. go to the UK honda website, they have a list of accessories there. a PLASTIC exhaust undercowling costs $260.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>as for whether you should buy a new bike as your first bike etc, i won't touch on that. just think what you want out of your bike. cheap, economical transport? then it's the bike for you. a full tank is 17litres, and can go up to i quote "450+km" but if you're looking for something fun and fast to ride when you need the pickup, it's probably a bad choice. just drop me a line if you wanna know more about it. btw, $7k sounds quite impossible, especially OTR, everywhere i've gone to quotes $9.5k OTR, at least. kuang tai lee at ubi even quoted me $10.4k!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>so which shop quoted you $7k? care to share? don't worry, don't think lines of people are forming to "snatch" the bike from you...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>rock hard... ride free...<br><br>[This message has been edited by l3stat (edited 24 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks a lot guys for your quick and insightful info. I fully understand your point that this  bike rides on your desire to ride a fleshy bike asap. Though I've not made my mind yet about what I'm going to purchase. I want to purchase a bike which I would ride for around 1-2 years atmost, mostly in Spore and don't want more than 3K depreciation in first year. What would you recommend..Varadero, Aprillia, NSR ????&lt;br&gt;<br>About the shop which quoted me S$7K - I donn know whether the guy was conning me or what. The addrs of the shop is Bike Production Pvt Ltd. 610 Serangoon Rd &lt;br&gt;<br>Thanks again for your responses</div>
