I fully understand your point that this  bike rides on your desire to ride a fleshy bike asap. Though I've not made my mind yet about what I'm going to purchase. I want to purchase a bike which I would ride for around 1-2 years atmost, mostly in Spore and don't want more than 3K depreciation in first year. What would you recommend..Varadero, Aprillia, NSR ????&lt;br&gt;<br>About the shop which quoted me S$7K - I donn know whether the guy was conning me or what. The addrs of the shop is Bike Production Pvt Ltd. 610 Serangoon Rd &lt;br&gt;<br>Thanks again for your responses</div></blockquote>Oh... i hear bike production is a black shop.. very black.. as is mah motors opposite the fire station. black in what sense i'm not sure, but i haven't heard anything good about them.<br><br>eh $7k really, might be possible, but definitely not OTR. i dunno man.. i suppose if the guy sticks to his word, and you really want the bike, go ahead, just don't go back to those shops to service...<br><br>regarding your bike choice, best way to avoid depreciation, is to get a used bike. when you get a new bike, even when you sell like in 1 or 2 months, it knocks off at least $500 off the value. reasoning behind this is that you gotta entice the buyer to buy your bike, over paying the small difference and getting a new one. certain bikes depreciate faster, like continental bikes. so, get a used one, and one with good resale, like erm.. honda or yamaha bikes. i was told this lar.. a new cagiva planet costs about $11k, 2 years later, it sells for about $6k at the dealer.. so deduct the markup that the dealer gives on this bike, you can figure out how much the owner loses...<br><br>if you want a decent, practical ride, and you're not looking for speed or fun, get the varadero, but as nismo said, there're a lot of other good alternatives to that bike... $7k OTR is still okay, but definitely not $9k+! among the bikes you listed, i would go for SP.<br><br>------------------<br>rock hard... ride free...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks guys !! You've been really helpful. I've got some idea now about for which bike to go. I'll try if I could close the deal for Varadero for 7k without any pitfalls - 10k for not so reliable bike is definitely expensive. If couldn't then I'll go for NSR SP.</div>

SIGH~ sian... oh btw, the brake fluid inlet on the right handle-bar? hits the windscreen when you make a full left-turn. nothing much lar, just didn't expect a $9000 bike to have this kind of flaw.<br><br>------------------<br>rock hard... ride free...</div>
