            <div class='col-md body'>ok guys i know some of us tot that our 3rd party insurance is useless. even if we die on the road, the coverage is only $5k. anyway i may help you trying to claim from the other party IF they are in the wrong.<br><br>yeah right, police wont handle minor traffic accident. i will teach u another trick like how to get the $$$ just like the volvo case metion in another post.<br><br>1st when involve in a minor accident if the other party is at fault and he admit it, this is what you should do.<br><br>not only you get his particulars also get his INSURANCE particulars. you may never know, just in case if his insurance expire, call the police on the SPOT. if his insurance is valid then proceed to next.<br><br>after getting his particulars and insurance detail(let say the insurance is X insurance) go to idac workshop to have it access(maybe need to leave the vehicle there).<br>next go to YOUR insurance company and make a report. after reporting it, your insurance company will keep a copy, you will get 2 copies. keep one for yourself and sent the other one to the X insurance company. ask the X insurance company when they can get a surveyor to check on your vehicle. if they like to delay or give some excuse, do what i did....call them particular everyday(morning, lunch and evening) till they piss off.<br>once vehicle is check by X insurance surveyor, the surveyor will actually try to strike a deal with you. of course you need to pay first for your repair and submit the receipt to X insurance company.<br>again do the same thing to get the payment. call them morning, lunch and evening.<br><br>by doing the procedure above i got to claim $1300 from the insurance company when that asshole doesn't want to pay $300 after my vehicle was access. and yes i got the refund back within 3 WEEKS on above procedure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok next is trying to get the other party to admit his fault like the volvo case.<br><br>if the other party doesn't want to admit his fault after a minor accident. call an ambulance informing them there is a casualty(in this case it is u) at the same time u get a feeling of a dizzy spell or numbness on your body(which ever part of your body you like)<br><br>once an ambulance come, you tell them your 'injuries'.<br><br>note, if a traffic police on duty in the area where u had an accident is free, they will comedown. in order for the traffic police to take control of the case you got to go to hospital by the ambulance u call for your injuries......usually this will make the othe party pay up on seeing a trafic police<br><br>LOL</div>
