            <div class='col-md body'>There's something wrong with my NSR150. I suspected is my carburetor that caused the problem. Whenever my rpm is before 4500 and after 5000, the bike goes smoothly. What happens between rpm 4500 and 5000 is that my bike will start to shake as if not enough fuel or too much fuel rushing in. So I guess between rpm 4500 and 5000, it's when my valve opens, causing this problem.<br>I hope you people understand what i meant. I was wondering if any NSR riders faces the same problem.

Of course, carburetor was washed at the same time. But still have the same problem, so the same mechanic said my clutch plate wear off liao. Then change clutch plate. He even asked me to run in the clutch plate for a week.<br>One week later, guess what? Still the same problem. I damn tulan liao. Went to another motor shop, he said shouldn't have changed the fuel controller inside the carburetor and changed it back to the original one which I paid another time to change it back to original part. Waste my $$$. Anyway, until now still have the same problem</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Lastly, i went down to First Motor and asked the mechanic. He said shouldn't have this problem, asked me to leave down my motorbike and he will inspected my bike bit by bit. That includes inspecting the engine, carburetor, valve, etc, until he finds the root of the problem.<br>I dun know how much it will cost, neither does he. But my guess is, it's not going to be cheap.<br>Finally, i gave up the idea and I ended having an accident because of this. The reason when the rpm shoots above 5000, the motor will sudden gain power (because the valve open)and there goes my bike. So that day, the same thing happened and a car suddenly turned in my lane and boom....</div>
