            <div class='col-md body'>if anyone's interested, SBR membership is only $50.<br>it usually takes SMSA 2 weeks to approve your 'racing license', but for this race, got special case.<br><br><blockquote>Hi Everyone.<br><br>Long story short here ...<br><br>Sepang have finally managed to negotiate with the SMSA to add an SBR only race into their Malaysian Super Sport Series commencing next weekend 27-28 July 2002. Rmind you  that the culmination of this mini championship may be a support race to the Moto GP in October !<br><br>I know this is short notice but we as SBR need to field a grid of at least 10 (the more the merrier) for next weekend.  This is important because Sepang have opened up an SBR slot for practice, qualifying and our own race ..... in the event that we walk away from this then we are unlikely to be in a position to be looking for favours in the future viz a viz track time. With Shah Alam closing shortly, and the current general non availability of Pasir Gudang, Sepang is more and more looking like our "home circuit" of the future.<br><br>Almost everyone in the SBR Club is eligible ... all you need is a bike (600 cc and above) and a Novice License issued from the Singapore Motorsport Association. I am holding all of the necessary forms with me to apply for membership to the SMSA and for the Novice License and can get these approved virtually on the spot as Sepang have put considerable pressure on the SMSA. The most complicated part of this is getting a Medical Card signed by yr Doc to say that you are of sound mind and judgement !<br><br>As for Bikes, because this is an SBR only event we can be guided by the general rules of the MSSS, but choose to enforce them, ignore them or interpret them to fit our own circumstances ..... For next weekend I have already cleared with the clerk of the course that we can clear scrutineering  with minimal "race rules" .... we will not have to lock wire sumps for example, or remove headlamps etc. (Although Headlamps will be required to be taped).<br><br>The weekend's programme basically for us looks as follows:<br><br>Sat 27th<br><br>09:00 - 10:30 hrs All Bikers Registration<br>10:30 - 11:00 hrs Riders Briefing<br>12:40 - 13:10 hrs Superbike Free practice<br>14:00 - 14:30 hrs Superbike Qualifying<br><br>Sun 28th Jly<br><br>10:30 - 11:00 hrs Superbikes Heat I (15 Laps of the half circuit)<br>11:50 - 12:20 hrs Superbikes Heat II( '' '' '' '' )<br><br>(I'm not sure which is the SBR heat)<br><br>Because they are running prodn motorcycles (125/150/250), Classic &amp; Super Cars, together with the Proton Series the track timings are all very tight and we are unlikely to get any further time. Sepang have however said that they will open up on Friday if there is sufficient interest to let us have further practice &amp; familiarisation laps as this is all run on the Sth Side Half Circuit.<br><br>So far so good ..... what is the cost I hear you say. Well it ain't cheap first time out because the licensing part amounts to S$100-00 (valid for 6 months) and then there is the entrance fee to stump on top of that. I need clarification on exactly what that is as there seems to be some confusion on whether that is 300 Ringgit or 150 Ringgit.<br><br>I need to emphasise that it is important that field a grid for this and that we work towards securing a future for SBR and bikes with Sepang. Otherwise we will find ourselves marginalised behind the BMW, Ferrari and Porsche club as is currently the case at Pasir Gudang. If we get this right, we will be included in all the remaining round of the MSS series with our own SBR race. If we do not then after all the hassle that Sepang have gone to with the Malaysian Motorsport Association and the SMSA, I cannot see us being included again.<br><br>The crux of the matter is that unless we have at least 10 then we're not eligible to form a grid and this is all in vain. So who's out there ..... We have about 6 firm "yes" so far and believe me will have a very diverse standard to fit everyone's level of skill.<br><br>Please come forward and support the club in this, I need to get back to Sepang with our uptake by Monday/Tuesday to get the licensing stuff in place.<br><br>I'm on my handphone 9786 1498 to answer any queries..... This should be great fun and we will be able to build on this for the future if we can kick it off properly.<br><br>Gareth Williams<br><br>PS.<br><br>We could do the race and still ride at Shah Alam on Saturday afternoon. Going on the piss and racing on Sunday may be another story but Im game if you are.<br><br>Graeme<br></blockquote></div>
