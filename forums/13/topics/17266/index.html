So what if malaysian riders? Yes they sia lan, but also human beings right? Its just that they are not much educated people, thus their attitude towards road is also not good. Eh they take licence not like SSDC leh, they just pay a fucking kopi $$ and they got their licence leh, what u expect?<br><br>Sometimes they speed all these is not becoz they wanna show off. I've realised that they are all rushing for the custom to go home early to have dinner with their family. U 6pm to custom see their fucking rd jam lor.. then u will know their "TONG KU"....<br><br>Ivan, sometimes hor, u must put urself in their shoes....<br></div>
