            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha.....NSR150SP seems common nowadays but doesn't seems weak. I had been riding NSR150sp for 2 years and of course it is not a fast bike compare to "big" bikes. However, if comparing it with hornet seems like a joke to me. And by saying hornet is better then repsol is more funny. Since you know repsol is an enhanced version of hornet, come to think of it, is there any company manufacturing bikes will like to manufacture something that is weaker then what is now in the market? And maybe you say hornet is better in sense of outlook of the bike then repsol, that depends on different people opinon. From what i know, hornet is nothing but an empty shell.

            <div class='col-md body'>To verify what Nonsense said is true, i had indeed tried a 200km/h with NSR150sp before. And if Hornet can reach 200km/h, or maybe even 170km/h...then i think you lost damn alot of money by selling your "special" bike for 2.6k!<br><br>------------------<br>Â®To The Maximum Limit Of My LifeÂ®</div>

I think their error is about more than 10%.<br><br>I have a friend who rides the NSR250 PGM4. Now that bike has a digital speedometer. He ran with an NSR150SP who showed 150kph. The true speed was only 120kph.<br><br>I'd give the 150SP a top of 170kph true speed. It's a light bike... too light... too shaky at high speeds and unstable in corners.<br><br>Stable 2B bike?? Get Mito or Aprilia, they're 2A sized.. plus, their speedos are more accurate (Tested with PGM4!) also, Corner Queens... Fit in an Arrow pipe and you will also get 170kph top speed. Downside is expensive maintenance.<br><br>I'll put up my modded RS125 for sale in about 4 months time... anyone interested then?? heh heh...<br><br>.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Hornet definitly loses out to SP alot.... Most hornet can only hit 130+ km/h. When i first got my licence, actually was planning to buy hornet but luckily came across PGM3 (kickstart hornet) and was advised by experienced friends to buy it. The speed is still reasonable, 160+km/h. But SP is still the best 2b honda bike, in terms of performance and realibilty( excluding the inaccurate speedometer). I wonder if the guy who said that his hornet is more suporier in performance than SP has anything to declare of his bike. perhaps he change the whole engine also hehe... to hit 200km/h?</div>
