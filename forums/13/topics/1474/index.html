A first hand bike will cost alot and have poor resale value. so if u r on a tighter budget i would recommed that u consider other bikes.<br><br></div>

Track sessions with the bike was exhilarating.<br>Maintenance wise, monthly trips to the workshop to get your gearoil changed, valve cleaned, carbs cleaned and properly tuned, will ensure that your bike doesn't break down.<br>As for the wear and tear of parts in the bike, I personally had numerous clutch plate replacements as I loved the acceleration of the half-clutch technic... which was abusive and torturing to the bike. A chain/sprocket change a year...<br><br>Though it was painful getting stopped repeatedly for fitting-on an RSpipe, and getting a hefty fine in the end which ultimately made me give the bike up, The bike I must say... is a SENSE OF WONDER<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://web.singnet.com.sg/~tniki" rel="nofollow">tniki.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, if i get a 2nd hand bike, I'll first check:<br><br>1) Front/Rear Brake Discs(rotorS) - whether warped<br>2) Front/Rear Brakes/calipers - working or not<br>3) Front/Rear shocks/suspension<br>4) Front/Rear Tyres - How much life left<br>5) Chain/sprocket - How much life left<br>6) Alignment of handlebar with front wheel<br>7) Steering cone - too stiff?<br><br>Trust me, you won't want to change the front brakedisc as they costs about $600++ for one piece. Then go ahead with the engine and bike run test:<br><br>1) Check if difference in bike idling sound when clutch in - determines if housing is loose and needs gasket/housing replacement<br><br>2) Rev to the Max gradually, to determine max rpm - this will tell if exhaust system is clogged with carbon residue, also checks if valves are working (will most probably be maxed at 10,000rpm on a stock milo pipe *yucks* and 12k-13k rpm if fitted with an arrow/rs/chamber pipe system)<br><br>3) Lastly, whether I'm comfortable with the bike itself. Take it for a spin maybe?<br><br>All of the above, of course, is subjected to whether or not permission is granted.<br>You can get your hands on parts easily from Ideal motors (aprilia agent) or from most motorshops around UBI. *not sure why people always like to spread the legend bout `parts hard to get', that's when the bike was firstly introduced to SG*<br>And pricing of the bike parts are somewhat similar to cagiva's. The bike won't blow a hole in your pants if you keep your ass on your seat and not BUANG. And if you're not so UNLUCKY as to pick one in a FUGGed up condition.<br><br>Hope the above helps<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://web.singnet.com.sg/~tniki" rel="nofollow">tniki.com</a></div>
