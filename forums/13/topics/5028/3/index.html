I didn't know your leg was aching also... so good timing.... and you have to overtake me and stretch it in front of me???<br><br>As I said, I didn't think that you are the CBR rider that vspec posted... cos I nber remember the number plate... So it wasn't a revenge... I you did pass me slowly... I nber say you zoom pass me... But I didn't do anything wrong... You came tailgating me after that you come by my side... dunno whether that is diao or see my face... then you overtook me... stretch your leg out... Thatz when I was angered... who likes that action of yours too? You like meh?</div></blockquote>but u havent ans my question<br>which leg of urs was aching?<br></div>
