But where to buy parts ? Buy at LAB first then bring there to do??? Very Marfan...They have parts which they borrow from RXZ,TZM and some original TZR parts.<br><br>So my strategy was to let them qoute first , then chop of the price until ard the prices offered by other motortiams.<br>I chopped off about Rm100.<br><br>The last i saw they oso service Aprilla , big Super 4s , Phantoms , Harleys etc.<br><br>But ,workmanship is very good. They have about 7-8 mechanics and they reserve the senior ones for Spore bikes. Boss was a former racer and brought me on a pillion ride on my own bike for 3 rounds.<br><br>He diagnosed the problems , came back and opened up three times, cleaned up my petrol tank , cleaned carburettor twice , then set the carb setting according to my use.<br><br>Very strict with his mechanics too. When the bike not properly fixed , he comes back from the short trial run sceaming at the mechanic and get them to fix again. So quite good quality control.<br><br></div>

A-6 Jalan Harimau Tarum , Century Garden , 80250 Johor Bahru, Johor Darul Takzim<br>Tel : 07-332 3993 fax:07-3326162<br>Opening hrs: M-S 9am-8.30pm<br>Sun 12.00pm-6pm<br><br>Agree with you totally. But where to buy parts ? Buy at LAB first then bring there to do??? Very Marfan...They have parts which they borrow from RXZ,TZM and some original TZR parts.<br><br>So my strategy was to let them qoute first , then chop of the price until ard the prices offered by other motortiams.<br>I chopped off about Rm100.<br><br>The last i saw they oso service Aprilla , big Super 4s , Phantoms , Harleys etc.<br><br>But ,workmanship is very good. They have about 7-8 mechanics and they reserve the senior ones for Spore bikes. Boss was a former racer and brought me on a pillion ride on my own bike for 3 rounds.<br><br>He diagnosed the problems , came back and opened up three times, cleaned up my petrol tank , cleaned carburettor twice , then set the carb setting according to my use.<br><br>Very strict with his mechanics too. When the bike not properly fixed , he comes back from the short trial run sceaming at the mechanic and get them to fix again. So quite good quality control.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
