            <div class='col-md body'>Hi thinking of buying a full-faced HJC helmet for sometime, and someone wants to buy for my bday.<br><br>So is the AC-10 available in the "sunburst" colour pattern like Index and Arai helmets at LAB? I don't want plain silver or black color...<br><br>Any advice on whether features like COOLMAX lining and cheekpads, flow thru ventilation, ears are impt? Or should i buy OGK or AGV ?<br><br>There is an ARAI shop near LAB too , think that place is worthwhile.</div>
