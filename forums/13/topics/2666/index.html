            <div class='col-md body'>If there are 2 or more people attending to the victim, I would not stop. If only one or less is attending to him, I will stop and render help. Personally, I think too many people around won't get things done any faster, and would probably cause a jam.<br><br>But in this case, the accident occured on the right lane. I really dunno how to get there. Slowing and trying to stop on the right most lane is really dangerous. Should I stop on the shoulder and try and get across the expressway ?

In fact who's gonna save me if she attempts to murder me for "lying"! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>By the way the chick in the movie Spider-Man also acted in the movie An Interview With A Vampire.

You never know... This person might need more help other than the 2 guys who stopped by. Maybe can call ambulance for them, apply first aid, prevent the casualty from going hysterica from his blood... many things.<br><br>A good samaritan will accompany the victim to the hospital, then pay for his bills and help him contact his family and tend to all the immediate needs (at least) before leaving. Then go back and settle your work. I'm sure God will help your boss or friends to understand. Put yourself in the casualty's shoes. if you were to end up like that, and someone do all these for you, will you feel touched?<br></div>
