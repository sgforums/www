Afterwards tighten everything back. All this while the bike should be upright, not slanted. That means you need 2 person or a centre stand.<br><br>My advice is, dun do it yourself, go bike shop do it. very cheap-$1, some even free.<br><br>Anyway, today went another bike shop and tell them the problem. They told me the chain had been too tight (the previous shop did not do a good job), and they loosen it. Now better, lower noise, but still got noise. Maybe next servicing will change the chain.<br><br></div>
