            <div class='col-md body'>My friend Jonathan the young boss from AS Phoon's Serangoon Branch few days ago expressed his grateful thanks for all pple who has been supporting his business throughout the years especially hearing some good remarks abt his organisation in SGforums. He said that he was 'surprised' to see that pple actually praised his organisation and encouraged pple to go there. He has been making great attempts to make AS Phoon an even better place. As his personal friend, I realised that he has great leadership qualities and an iron yet benevolent hand in controlling the business. Filled with integrity and honesty I would say in carrying out his daily duties as the head of AS Phoon in Serangoon Branch. Sometimes I feel that he has over done his responsibilites. Thus making me all the more impressed by such a person handling the business. Compared to LEE MOTOR, he is very  very much better.<br><br>Please continue to support AS Phoon Serangoon Tel: 2966203 If you want someone to make that every cent you spent is worth it.</div>
