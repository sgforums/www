            <div class='col-md body'>The whole trip is abt 1500km. Because abt 700km from Singapore to Penang and 700km back. Plus an extra 100km to ride around Penang.<br><br>Riding sports bike in Malaysia is a very great leisure. Espcially when you see many sports bike together. Because sports bike in Malaysia are very rare. Anything 250cc and abouve can command a lot of attention. When I brought my 400cc up to Penang, I was given VIP treatment along the journey. Ppple flocked by to ask me what bike am I riding. (They dunno whats CBR cos M'sia dunhav). And many pple will start whistling at you non stop especially malays. Likewise, the more pple go the better.

You cannot slack on the 2T quality you're using. And please use an Arrow pipe with proper carburettor settings. You can approach First Motor Ideal MOtor and Excel Cycles for help. If you're going to excel cycles, look for dua boon (Big Boon). He's one of those most feared opponent &amp; old time racer at PG 250cc challenge. (with lots of medals) and expert in bike modification, repair and maintenance.NSR150SP and similar bikes will definately make it. Provided you bring along enough 2T.

And when you're using pre mix, please mix it at the correct ratio. If you need help can contact me. Mixing 1 - 2 teaspoon or bottle caps won't help. Must follow a mix ratio and apply a formulae. Under mixing can cause piston seizure very easily. Over mixing can cause the cylinder walls to have too many 'varnish' which will in turn cause piston seizure as well.<br></div>

We can go as fast as 150kph. But dun force yourself. Becos everybody must wait for each other. if you think your pipe is good enuf to maintain 110kph - 150kph all the way and doesnt hinder your cornering then its ok. most impt is your safety.<br></div>

And when you're using pre mix, please mix it at the correct ratio. If you need help can contact me. Mixing 1 - 2 teaspoon or bottle caps won't help. Must follow a mix ratio and apply a formulae. Under mixing can cause piston seizure very easily. Over mixing can cause the cylinder walls to have too many 'varnish' which will in turn cause piston seizure as well.</div></blockquote>i very interested to go leh! but dun know my pgm came stand it anot....scare it over heat.<br><br></div>
