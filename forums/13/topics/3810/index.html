            <div class='col-md body'>On the last day before Christmas, I hurried to go to the supermarket to buy the remaining of the gift I didnÂ’t manage to buy earlier.<br>When I saw all the people there, I started to complain to myself:<br>It is going to take forever here and i still have so many other place to go...''Christmas really is getting more and more annoying every year. How i wish i could just lie down, go to sleep and only wake up after it ...<br>Nonetheless, i made my way to the toy section, and there i started to curse the prices, wondering if afterall kids really play with such expensive toys. While looking in the toy section, I noticed a small boy of<br>about 5years old, pressing a doll against his chest. He kept on touching the hair of the doll and looked so sad. I wondered who was<br>this doll for.<br>Then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him: 'Granny, are you sure i donÂ’t have enough money?<br>The old lady replied: 'You know it that you<br>donÂ’t have enough money to buy this doll, my dear.' Then she asked him to stay here for 5 minutes while she went to look around. She<br>left quickly. The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand. Finally, i<br>started to walk toward him and i asked him who did he want to give this doll to.<br>It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this Christmas. She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her. I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will<br>bring it to her, afterall, and not to worry. But he replied to me sadly.<br>No, Santa Claus cannot bring it to her where she is now. I have to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when she goes there. His eyes were so sad while saying this. 'My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy say that Mummy will also go to see God very soon, so i thought that she could bring the doll with her to give it to my<br>sister<br>My heart nearly stopped. The little boy looked up at me and said:<br>I told daddy to tell mummy not to go yet. I asked him to wait until I come back<br>from the supermarket. Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then told me:<br>'I also want mummy to take this<br>photo with her so that she will not forget me.'<br>'I love my mummy and i wish she doesnÂ’t have to leave me but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister' Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very<br>quietly. I quickly reached for my wallet and took a few notes and said to the boy.<br>'What if we checked again, just in case if u have enough money?'<br>'Ok' he said.<br>'I hope that i have enough.<br>'I added some of my money to his without him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll, and even some spare money.<br>The little boy said:<br>'Thank you God for giving me enough money'<br>Then he looked at me and added:<br>'I asked yesterday before i slept for God to make sure I have enough money to buy this doll so that mummy can give it to my sister. He heard me'<br>'I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mummy, but i didnÂ’t dare to ask God too much. But He gave me enough to<br>buy the doll and the white rose.'<br>'You know, my mummy loves white rose' A few minutes later, the old lady came again and I left with my trolley. I finished my<br>shopping in a totally different state. From when I started. I couldnÂ’t get the little boy out of my mind.<br>Then i remembered a local newspaper article 2 days ago, which Mentioned of a drunk man in a truck who hit a car where there was one young lady and a little girl.<br>The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a Critical state. The family had to decide whether to pull<br>the Plug on the life-assisting machine, because the young lady would not be able to get out of the coma.<br>Was this the family of the little boy?<br>Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read In the newspaper that the young lady had passed away.<br>I couldnÂ’t stop myself and went to buy a bunch of white Roses and I went to the mortuary where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to see and make<br>last wish before burial.<br>She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful White rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest. I left the place crying,<br>feeling that my life had been changed forever.

            <div class='col-md body'>From the very Begining, Gal's family objected<br>strongly on her dating this guy. saying that it has got to do with family background, &amp; that the gal will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him.<br>Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrel<br>very often. Tho the gal love the guy deeply, but she always ask him: "How deep is your love for me?"<br>As the guy is not good with his words, this often cause the gal to be very upset. With that &amp; the family's pressure, the gal often vent her anger on him. As for him,.. he only endure it in silence.<br>After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated &amp; decided to further his studies in overseas.<br>Before leaving, he proposed to the gal: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you.If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk<br>them round. Will you marry me?"<br>The gal agreed, &amp; with the guy's determination, the family finally gave in &amp; agreed to let them get married. So before he leave, they got angaged.<br>The gal went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love thru emails &amp; phone calls. tho it's hard, but both never thot of giving up.<br>One day, while the gal was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. when she woke up, she saw her parents beside her bed. She realised that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized<br>that all that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. she' has lost her voice....<br>The doctors says that the impact on her brain has caused her to loss her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down.<br>During the stay in hospital, besides silence cry,.. it's still just silence cry that accompanied her.<br>Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for the ringing tone of the phone. Which pierced into her heart everytime it rang.<br>She does not wish to let the guy know. &amp; not<br>wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer.<br>With that, she sent the ring back to him. In<br>return, the guy sent millions &amp; millions of reply, countless of phonecalls,.. all the gal could do, besides crying, is still crying....<br>The parents decided to<br>move away, hoping that she could eventually<br>forget everything &amp; be happy.<br>With a new environment, the gal learn sign<br>language &amp; started a new life. Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her fren came &amp; told her that he's back. She asked her fren not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there<br>wasn't anymore news of him.<br>A year has passed &amp; her fren came with an<br>envelope, containing a invitation card for the guy's wedding. The gal was shattered. When she open the letter, she saw her name in it instead. When she was about to ask her fren wat's going on, she saw the guy standing in front of her.<br>He used sign language telling her "I've spent a year's time to learn sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that, he slipped the ring back into her finger.<br>The gal finally smiled.<br><br>*Treat every relationship as if it's the last one, then you'll know how to Give**Treat every moment as is it's the last day, then you'll know how to treasure*</div>
