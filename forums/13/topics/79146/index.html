            <div class='col-md body'>me also riding RS 125 for a year plus... when i took over also got problem... but i went and fix it myself...<br>try tell him that when u sold him it's in good condition.<br>no such thing as buy liao not happy ask for refund, i understand that the bike did have some problem, go to a bike shop to have it checked and should be a small problem cos all along u have taken good care of it... so after the repair, should be able to ride smoothly again, also find out why so fast broke down, maybe his poor handling, explain to him nicely that...<br>anyway u r not asking very much from him for a bike... 1.5K is really low to have ur own transport plus aprilia is such a cool bike to own~!<br>till today i still riding it thou i am in NS...<br>hope u and him have clear whatever misunderstanings....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br></div>
