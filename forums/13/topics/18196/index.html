It's almost the same for most class 2b bikes, esp older bikes.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ppl,<br><br>There's a very good reason why the rear brake on bikes are always provide less braking power then front brakes(ie. smaller brake disc, less no. of calipers or smaller drum size).<br><br>Scientifically, bikes use their rear wheel to produce the majority of the gyroscopic force that keeps ur bike upright, balanced. Lock the rear &amp; a slide WILL occur, causing a loss of control, momentary or otherwise. Lose the rearend at high speeds while in a corner will definitely cause a low-silde. Braking &amp; then release will likely cause a highside.<br><br>Bike designers don't intend that u use the rear brake much, except perhaps to tighten ur line while in a corner. Even then. a little tap or the rear brake is all that's needed. If u gauge in advance, most of the time, the rear brake isn't needed at all.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>------------------<br>Just me, Magiskter.<br><br>"Whether your capacity matters is subjective.
