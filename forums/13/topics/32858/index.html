            <div class='col-md body'>AS usual, all lots full, i parked at a corner, near to the slope where we came down from level 1. No obstruction was caused to other vehicle at all, and pk behind my bike was another scooter, after i paid,  they just just walked off and keet the wheel clamp, still dare to reply me that they have alot of wheel clamp in store. no action was on the scooter pk behind me.......... my feeling, blood boiling liao, shoot all the way up to my head.<br>So to the rest of rider, be careful and be alert.</div>

The reason i get so angry is that there really were other bike that pk illegally, not that i want to drag other bike into it, but it was so unfair. i can guarantee they clamp the bike as and when they like, and they pick bike to clamp, cause behind me was a scooter, no action taken, when the security came down , i told them how abt this scooter, they say they will petrol the place and enforce it. 30min later, the security came back to unlock the clamp, no action was taken on the same scooter. I mean,........... its very unfair, if they set a rule,  enforce it, dun pick on bike and work according to their mood. And of course i dun rule out i did pk out of the lot,. All i wan is a explaination from the security that why am i the oni bike that kana wheel clamp, and they did not give me a answer. And natural reaction is, of course angry lor....$50 for that.</div>

The reason i get so angry is that there really were other bike that pk illegally, not that i want to drag other bike into it, but it was so unfair. i can guarantee they clamp the bike as and when they like, and they pick bike to clamp, cause behind me was a scooter, no action taken, when the security came down , i told them how abt this scooter, they say they will petrol the place and enforce it. 30min later, the security came back to unlock the clamp, no action was taken on the same scooter. I mean,........... its very unfair, if they set a rule,  enforce it, dun pick on bike and work according to their mood. And of course i dun rule out i did pk out of the lot,. All i wan is a explaination from the security that why am i the oni bike that kana wheel clamp, and they did not give me a answer. And natural reaction is, of course angry lor....$50 for that.</div></blockquote>What i meant was...... for example, you parked your bike there at 12pm. Then there are bikes parked there too. Then the guards came around petrolling at 1.45pm. Other bikes have left liao... Then they clamp yours only lor.... You get what i mean? Its just a maybe. Thats why i asked you if the bike you saw was parked there before you came. As for what i know, they usually not so free...... keep petrolling the car park one lor.... so unfortunate that you bumped into their petrol time. Then the scooter was parked there after yours is clamp? You know what i mean? So cannot say that they never do their job. Just that, the clamping time haven't reach lor....<br><br>By the way, I'm not a security guard.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Just my $0.00 worth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
