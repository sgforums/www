"sorry i got onli one clamp"? "sorry i anyhow choose"? both these the truth but u get this answer will u say "oh like that than its ok lor"?<br><br>u ask why then they never clamp another bike? by then they so sian kena kao pei until like that, they wanna clamp another bike oso no mood already. they clamp another bike maybe second owner will kao pei, they keep u kao pei, wat izzit they can do right?<br><br>and finally, by then the guard will also already explain to the supervisor plus their own complains bout ur reaction, even the supervisor not happy to entertain u.<br><br>understand this: YES i agree not fair. if i kena like dat oso i not happy, suay suay i onli bike kena. i will definitely kao pei to all my frens, but i will not kao pei to the management or the guards. why? coz realli i illegal park, what can i say? they just doing their job, they got family to feed, and there is no clear evidence that show they deliberately take advantage of me for their own gains. i onli trying to say, spare a thought for them.</div>
