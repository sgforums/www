P plate don't really matters alot. As i myself is a driver, actually it depends on the drivers/rider attitude. There are times when i'm driving, and its my right of way, dont no why but i think the rider lazy to put his leg down onto the ground and just dash out from the slip rd. Boy! it scared the hell out of me, luckly i'm able to stop in time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had two experience, once with a bus and the other, with a long long type lorry.<br>Was travelling straight when these two vehicles came out of the slip road. If car or bike, or they come out take the right most lane, still can siam from them. But they come out...just dash to the left most lane making me nowhere to siam (4 lane road, cannot find one lane unoccupied cos of the length of the vehicle). I was so bloody shocked sial...had to do ebrake...and den change lane when there's a chance to avoid hitting those BLOODY ARSES!</div>
