            <div class='col-md body'>Nope!<br>Most instructors are dedicated in promoting safe riding. Some - just do their job.<br>But all of them do not like to see your name mentioned in the newspapers as a motorcyclist killed on the road.<br><br>By the time you reach the final lesson - The Assessment, it only mean you can ride a motorcycle. Not ready to take the TP test. You will be wasting your time and money if your school let you take the TP test when you are not ready.<br><br>I will not give you tips on how to get through the Assessment, and the TP test, because you must learn by yourself. For your own safety.<br><br></div>

So i guess, it fall on the rider skills. If i'm a instructors, i would make sure my learner know all the basic first, i dun want them to go out on the road, endanger people life or endanger their...<br><br>Go do some reflect on your own dudex.. dun blame other thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Relax ah brother.. SSDC instructor wants you to pass lah.. Thats why they make you come back again for lesson 8.. Tell you something. During my time, there's this person who make so much noise when she have to repeat lesson 8.. So the instructor gave in &amp; let her pass.. End up she failed her TP with immediate failure<strong>S</strong>.. No point rushing when you're not ready right???<br>Take your time &amp; practice. You'll pass TP with good results for sure..
