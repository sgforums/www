You just have to refresh everyday, just like him.<br><br>I did it like him and I got a earlier tp slots and earlier pratical lessons.<br><br>Why are you so agitated and angry? Relaxs, and show that you are a matured rider and not someone who once get their bike will speed and corner like nobody's business.<br><br>You are at the losing end if you get agitated so easily be it OTR or in life.<br><br>Good Luck popmynutsy<br>^^ why did you failed the first time.<br><br>BTW, if you are really good. You will be able to clear Lesson 7 in just 1 time. You don't have to repeat your lesson at all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
