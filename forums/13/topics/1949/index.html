            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>Today after 5 days of ownership of a brand new Honda Phantom 200, I met an accident.  Here are the details of the accident.<br><br>I was with my wife travelling towards the AYE on the ECP at the extreme left lane, lane 4, on Wednesday morning the 8th of May 2002.  As I am still running in my bike, 474 km total at the time of the crash, I was travelling at around 70km/h.  As we were approaching the ERP gantry after Tanjong Rhu Flyover I noticed a black Toyota Corolla from lane 2, second right most lane, coming towards lane 3 in a 45 degrees angle.<br><br>The moment I realised that the vehicle is coming towards the lane that I am travelling, lane 4, I began to execute an emergency brake.  We crashed around 5 to 10 meters before the gantry on lane 4 around 0910 hrs.<br><br>The driver claimed that he forgot to insert a cash card and wanted to stop at the shoulder, he also claimed that he was in a hurry to send his father-in-law to the hospital.  I almost lost my cool and was close to using abusive language.<br><br>Both my wife and myself suffered abrasion and bruises.  Total damage to my bike is around S$450/-, I am in the process to claim insurance from him.  But in retrospect I canÂ’t help but assume that I could have avoided the accident.<br><br>Any comments/advise?</div>

If one party is injured, you will need a police report to claim insurance. In any case, just make a police report (no harm done) to protect urself, in case the driver wanna play punk with you.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>sorry to hear abt your accident.<br><br>here are a few points<br><br>1) you DID notice him at lane 2 cutting into lane 3 den subsequently into lane 4 where the 2 of u collided. i assume he was cutting traffic recklessly and at a high speed or else u would have been able to avoid him, which means you DID notice him but could not react in time due to (this is the important bit) the fact that he was <strong>RECKLESS</strong> or <strong>SPEEDING</strong>. DO NOT LET HIM TURN THE TABLES ON U BY SAYING U WERE THE ONE SPEEDING. hit him before he hits u!<br><br>2) he claimed to be cutting into lane 4 or shoulder to insert his cashcard, granted he has difficulty reaching his cashcard or inserting it. this is verbal evidence and witnessed by your wife, that it was his intention to cut to the shoulder before the gantry, recklessly if need be. use this in the report, bcos if he had no need to cut into shuolder, there would have been no accident.<br><br>3) there is a possibility u were in his blindspot, but remember that it is not a crime to be in another vehicles blind spot. yeah try to avoid being there but these things happen everyday. it is his duty to check his blind spot before lane changing... wat more across 2 lanes on the expressway. if he DID check his blindspot, den it is also evident that either he was speeding or you were speeding.<br><br>to recap: he was RECKLESS or SPEEDING, his intentions were to stop by shoulder before gantry (recklessly if necessary), he did not check blind spot and u were 2 lanes away (further evidence he was reckless and speeding).<br><br>remember it is highly possible he could counter attack by saying u were the party that was speeding on lane 4, which u can defend by stating his lane switching from lane 2 to 4 in such short a time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't worry, the bloody driver has no grounds for claiming that u were in his blind spot and that u were speeding<br><br>1) Every road user is expected to check blind spot and mirrors b4 doing anything and to drive carefully to avoid endangering the lives of other road users. Emergency or not that is no excuse for cutting sharply across 3 lanes at high speed. Not to mention that no amount of checking is going to prevent an accident when he trys to pull off such a reckless stunt<br><br>2) That u and your wife suffered only minor scratches despite colliding with another vehicle on an expressway is evidence enough that u were not speeding. You also need much longer braking distance when carrying a pillion. That u were in the left most lane ( the slowest lane ) is another advantage<br><br>If your case like that also cannot claim insurance then the whole system is really fucked up...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Dino78 (edited 09 May 2002).]</div>
