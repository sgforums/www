But i try to ride defensively and only short distances from NUS to hospitals. Keep to left lane , not too tired , not too rainy .<br><br>Personally , i have assisted in taking off pple's legs before. My consultant surgeon learnt that i was riding a bike. He chopped off the bone , then the leg and then stitched up the stump. When he threw the lifeless leg into a bin , he turned ard and look at me: " you still want to ride?"<br><br>Sicko man , after that i was like quite demoralised during my pract.

Like last wk when chris accompanied me for my leg x-ray (suspected bone fracture), he asked me if i still wanna get my license, I told him "After the operation,when my leg is healed, I'll continue" And u know wat? I was onli at subject one then...and I was ready to claim insurance liao. [/B]</blockquote>That's very brave of you...<br>Guess what ? I just told my mum last nite about my bike. She took it in a jovial manner, quite okay lah... My dad overheard in the phone conversation too ( between NUS and home)<br><br>Just told me to be careful and jokingly told me not to park the bike into my house. It will uglify the house!
