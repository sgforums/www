I'm just speaking up from my point of view.<br>Why can't you just face up to your own mistakes? You obviously broke the law.  It's not as if you were maligned.  And you still got the cheek to scold the tp and their mothers.<br>Even if you say that the tp are corrupted, racist, etc, you cannot redeem the fact that you indeed made mistakes.<br>Can you face up to your own mistakes without blaming others?<br>I don't think you can.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Imaginary (edited 13 February 2002).]</div>
