Wah....serious ah....hehe... you living in SG or china?<br><br>Anyway, its not that you are chinese...but its becoz you are carrying SG plate. Malaysian TP always aim singapore plate 1.<br><br>I also got story. Few months ago, went up to Plentong wif some of my malay frenz. 60% of our grp malay, 40% chinese. Went there, got stop by a malaysian tp. All of us kena stop. He said our bike jack up! Its a scrambler!!! shit!!. He wanted to fine 50 bucks each. Manage to haggle to 20 each. Moral of the story... they dun care you malay or not.... SG plate = money for them....and I tot can escape bcoz majority of our grp malay.<br><br>Its a proven fact that malaysian tp aim for sg car/bike. I tink those who frequent malaysia would noe this very well...<br><br>Next time go malaysia....cover ur plate wif malaysian plate ah....sure escape one...</div>

And in the first place, I wouldn't have anything to say about it.<br>But this is not the scenario in this case.
