A racist malay does not give a chinese the right to be racist n so vice versa."AN EYE FOR AN EYE MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD BLIND" Anyway all i m trying to say is RACISM is downright DIRTY.<br></div>

To make Earth a place to leave in, first we must start with the most fundamental. If we cannot even keep this forum in peace, how can we even expect peace and harmony on Earth???<br><br></div>
