            <div class='col-md body'>Just last week, there was an article on the newspaper that says Taxi drivers are involved in the bulk of the accident on Singapore road (despite only making up 4% of the vehicle on the road?).<br><br>Last night at around 10pm, driving to Woodlands on BKE.<br><br>Typical night after a long day at work... the information board above reading "ACCIDENT ON LANE 3". I told myself, "just another accident". Saw the police car and lights, drove pass... and...<br><br>a motorbike down on the road... 10 metres in front was a taxi... just in front of a taxi was a dead body. Two policemen were holding up a white plastic sheet, trying to shield the sight from the public eyes.<br><br>I ride too, so it's very disturbing... This man/woman was probably riding home after a long day's work but he/she is now dead.<br><br>Sorry for behaving this way, it has been a while since I last saw a dead motorbike rider out in the open. For all I know, he could be a friend of ours.<br><br>I am not judging the taxi driver, he probably didn't see it coming. I myself drive tired at times and I came close to touching bikers too. We must remember, one touch on them, their skin will be on the road; how serious, depends...<br><br>I urge all readers to give bikers some respect, if not take into the consideration that, if given a choice, they want to drive too (like myself).<br><br>Disturbed<br>Vincent<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had lost a close friend to a taxi who ran over his head in 1995 along PIE Toa Payoh. Then, lost a close relative to an accident in Malaysia. My close pals who are still alive have got themselves involved in numerous accidents of various styles.<br><br>I'm driving too, but I'm grateful to be alive when I didn't get a fellow two-wheeler involved in an accident. Now I ride at odd times. Drivers tend to forget to check their blindspots especially from the left which may result to us being in the danger of being knocked down without the drivers realising it.<br><br>My advice to all,<br>1. Please refrain from overtaking from the left.<br><br>2. Squeeze in between vehicles with care, or else don't squeeze at all...<br><br>3. Get yourself a decent loud horn and install a relay. Nowadays the cars are equipped with loud sound systems, they couldn't notice your presence.<br><br>4. Try to stay away from the rain, as far as possible. Rain defers our vision, and we might not be visible to them.<br><br>5. Check your headlights and tail-lights frequently. I frequently see bikes without either tail-lights on, and switch them on all day.<br><br>6. Service your bike frequently to prevent mechanical fault, and get yourself decent tyres. These tyres are the only items which keep us on the road.<br><br>7. Practise safe riding and switch on your signals upon switching of lanes.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Azlan</div>
