            <div class='col-md body'>Just incase your wondering about this Bike,<br>It looks like this<br><img src="http://home.t-online.de/home/obermeier1-muenchen/img6.jpg"><br><br>There is a SIte:-<br><br><a href="http://home.t-online.de/home/obermeier1-muenchen/" rel="nofollow">http://home.t-online.de/home/obermeier1-muenchen/</a><br><br>its in german so u need to use astavista to translate german to english<br>anyway this guy was reviewing the bike...<br>and this is what he wrote:<br>(the english is abit broken bec its a direct german to english) so endure hor..<br><br><blockquote><br>Into the Varadero 125 the same V2 engine comes as in the 125 Shadow  with an easily changed tuning to the employment, the liquid-cooled engine by modern technology is steered. The two independent, digital cycles of the CDI ignition supply each of the two cylinders individually with a tension-strong and precise zuendfunken for cultivated achievement development and at the same time for a reliable electronic overturning protection starting from 12000 routes.<br>The maximum torque of 10,7 Nm is only reached when 9500 revolutions and the leistungsspitze by 15 PS/11kW with 11,000 routes, but even in the lower speed range the Varadero can be moved without jerking.   The torque curve shows that between 7000 and 12000 U/min a torque of over 8,5 Nm at the crankshaft lines up. That is compared with other 12Ã«rn a very tidy value. Design conditionally by the 90Â°-Winkel of the two-cylinder practically no vibrations are noticeable. Quiet humming of the handles is a good indication that the noiseless engine runs; these vibrations are not annoying. The necessary high numbers of revolutions do not decrease thus by any means the comfort of the driver. The sound of the Varadero engine is pleasant: For the driver pleasing quietly and nevertheless surprisingly fully and almost sonor.<br>The afterburning system provides for low pollutant emissions   the small air Injector units sits directly in the cylinder heads and leads fresh air into the discharge opening channels behind the exhaust valves. The afterburning resulting from it guarantees the problem-free fulfilment of the EURO-1-Abgasgrenzwerte.<br>The exhaust manifolds however are guessed/advised with their flat black lacquer finish and the small diameter somewhat mickrig, them cry directly after exchange by the accessory trade. Unfortunately I there still nothing found.<br>The cooling fins are pure mockup and increase optically the engine on at least 500 ccm.<br>Oil level check takes place comfortably at the engine by sediment bowl </blockquote>This is the engine...<br><img src="http://home.t-online.de/home/obermeier1-muenchen/img18.gif"><br><img src="http://home.t-online.de/home/obermeier1-muenchen/img20.gif"><br><br>More info about varadero<br><br><blockquote><br>The chassis corresponds to the standard which high of Honda one also of the Shadow is used.<br>To the high emphasis one gets accustomed fast.   By the large seat one finds a pleasant seating position rapid, in which the legs   are only easily bended. The half shell lining holds a majority of the wind from the driver and ensures together with a better co-ordinated translation for the fact that the machine lies iin the Topspeed few km more highly than the Shadow.<br>The final translation amounts to with the Varadero 14:44 (results in 0.31<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> with the Shadow 14:41 (results in 0.341) thereby lay I with my tip, with which Shadow does not assume at all 14 it pinions against a 1Ã©r to exchange so wrongly 13:41 (results in 0.317) if one Honda uses probably also the same transmission. Thus also the Shadow lies in the terminal velocity a few kilometer more highly. In the level one reaches 11500 U/min thereby as per tachometer<br>The vehicle weight is rather high with 149 kilograms. The 12Ã«r nevertheless is pleasantly easily in the handling and much circle-narrow-hurries. On fast highway curves the XL 125 V is fullly on the road and it gives not even a suggestion of shaking or   oscillating.<br>The brakes fulfill their task only sufficiently, the pressure point are capable of improvement   - the brake works somewhat more spongelike than with the Shadow - with the additional installation of Stahlflexleitungen are eliminated this small weak point.<br>For the small Varadero a new double tube steel framework was developed. The good straight line discharge and the high rigidity are reached by a wheel base by 1450 mm, a 35-mm-Gabel and the sturdy box rocker.<br>The spring travel amounts to in front like in the back in each case 150 mm. Bumps are very well swallowed by the harmoniously co-ordinated absorption.<br>The pre-loading of the centrically installed mono squatting shock strut is sevenfold adjustable. Unfortunately the mechanics lie unprotected in the splash-water range of the rear wheel -- other manufacturers make that better.<br><br>The engine   is the same as in the Shadow   with a slightly changed tuning. He works altogether on quite high number of revolutions level, but for its class he nevertheless offers the maximally permitted 15 PS/11 KW and accelerates also in lower speed ranges without jerking. Consumption is with approx.. 4 litres per 100km<br><br>However:<br><br>The Varadero 125 is not cheap: The basic price amounts to 8770 Marks, in addition still the costs of freight and transfer come.<br><br></blockquote><img src="http://home.t-online.de/home/obermeier1-muenchen/img22.gif"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>did think about this bike before, if not for the prohibitive price tag, i just might have gotten it.. paul chow of trail culture owns one, which is nicely tricked-up with accessories, both original and after-market. can take a look at it at his shop at macpherson. it looks very good with a taller windscreen. 17 litre fuel tank... i think it really depends on your needs, plus the length of time you expect to own the bike... cos at 9k (base price), and 15bhp (SP produces ard 37, TZM ard 39 etc etc), it might be underpowered if you're into some fun. but it should be a great commuter. reviews from local riders say it holds 100km/h with a pillion, vibration free. do think about it if:<br><br>you've some cash to spare, you intend to ride quite a while, you don't really wish to speed or out-accelerate cars, if you're about 1.75m or so. (saddle height is about 800mm or slightly less if i don't remember wrongly).</div>
