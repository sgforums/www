            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmzzz i think there is one more trick in the book...<br><br>if the taxi offends you in anyway along smaller roads.. fall back behind the taxi and follow him for a short distance keeping urself safely behind... and seeing a traffic junction in front coming... for those riding 400cc and above 4strokes... acelerate pass the taxi hard safely and when next to him do a nice BACK FIRE while acting like nothing happened... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> loud enough to startle the taxi driver... its not over yet... when u reach the traffic junction and stop (maybe you will have to do a little coordination to catch the taxi heading towards a red light so he really has to stop...) allow the taxi to stop next to you... right when the opposite traffic is going to turn red and green arrow appears for them... you look down at the taxi's wheels and get the taxi driver attention... and make it seem he has blown his tires... and when he open the door thinking his tires were blown coz of the loud sound previously (made by ur backfire) u just speed off when the light turns green heheheheh<br><br>it actually worked for me... though accidentally... a bmw driver got out of his car and walked around it to check for blown tires... hahahahahahha that was funny... especially the look on his face... hahahahahahhahh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
