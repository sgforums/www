            <div class='col-md body'>If you fell down on your own, usually it is not fatal. You break some bones or your back. At the very least you get some scratches.<br>Most fatalities are because the poor fella is run over by another vehicle, like lorry or bus or even a car.<br><br>Speeding is also another cause. When the rider fly and land on his head or wrap himself around a tree, I don't think the helmet will save him.<br>Usually the newspapers report that the motorcyclist/pillion is killed, and make no mention of the other vehicle involved. So we don't know how the poor chap is killed. Newspapers do not want to mention that the lorry/bus went over the poor fella's head, and the chap died legs kicking.<br><br>Motorcyclists ride carefully, and defensively.<br>Do not let the other vehicle knock you into the path of another vehicle.<br>Follow the vehicle infront and don't squeeze between vehicles.<br>The mistake may not be yours, but the life and limb will be yours.<br><br>There are 200 plus fatalities per year. Less than 2 per day. Highly likely that when an accident happen, you are not around.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting topic........<br><br>Ok people I've search this forum but there is still 1 thing lacking in it......I know you guys out there have a few years experience of riding under your belt, so why not share safety tips.<br><br>For example, never ride your bike less than 50% of the lane....try to ride about 75% of the lane. Reason is that if you are riding at abt 75% of the lane size, drivers have no choice but to change lane in order to overtake you. If you are riding below 50% of the lane size, some idiot dirvers will just overtake you side by side forcing you to the kerb.<br><br>If possible, buy riding helmets that is with d-ring not the clip like our porch. Although it is easier to clip our strap than to put in into the ring type, it is the most dangerous as in the event of an accident, the clip tend to break making your helmet flew off from your head!<br><br>Please on normal beam instead of using pole light. For better visibility.<br><br>Wear full covered gloves. Reason, if we go riding, ccol wid tend to blow making our knuckles slightly numb. In the long run it will affect our hands.<br><br>Try to roll yourself instead of sliding on the road when you collide your skid your bike. This is to minimise your injury.<br><br>Do not use bloody tinted visor. Although it looks cool, but you will have a hard time riding in the night.<br><br>Try to pump your tyre about 10 to 20% more than the recommended. Our body weight plays apart.<br><br>Never use cheap tyres. Try to get as much information on tyres as possible before changing it. Tyres are the thing that divide between the bike and the road surface.<br><br>That's about all for the moment....;p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For motorcyclists, I quite sympathise with them somehow cos they are at the losing end all the time in accidents. As a driver, I can only say, you ride, you know what you are getting into, so its to your advantage that you ride safely. remember defensive riding and driving is to expect the other party to make mistakes.  So the next time you feel a tendency to speed up and zip in and out, remember who got more to lose when there is an accident, you or the 4 wheeler.<br><br>In any case, some practical tips I came across while driving.  At night, Motorcyclists should never go too close to a car (tailgating) because it is dark and if you go too close and the car cant see your headlight from the mirror.<br><br>Also, I find it dangerous for motorcycles to go in between 2 cars at bends, some motorcycles seem to like to do that. I find it dangerous because most cars in bends do swerve a bit left and right in its own lane so the bike may kena if the car swerve a bit more.</div>
