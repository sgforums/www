            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, sorry to be hearing this.<br>Well, most of the responds I saw thinks that the way she is behaving is being "lok".<br>But I think there's more to that. Who likes to have a reputation damaged, not to mention its a girl, which is most important to her. Even for girls who work in postitution centres, I don't think that when they are young, they dreamed of becoming prostitudes. Most of the time its circumtances which forced people to do things which they never intended to. For example, for three meals a day?<br>Well, for your situation, your ex-girlfriend may have suffered blows emotional, which has made her lose her interest in life, not to mention reputation. Family problems may contribute greatly to that, or maybe its because she wants to spite you and make you jealous, cause she can't forget you, and hopes to see you care for her again? It's hard to say what is happening, and its even harder to read a girl's mind. But from my point of view, no girl wants to be "lok" in nature. When someone suffers from heavy emotional blows, and loses his/her interest in life anymore, I don't think she would even be rational about things going on around her, would she even think so much as to what she is doing? her reputation?<br>I think the best way is to talk to her, show her some concern, show her that even though that you may have broken up with her, you still care for her even as a friend. Ask for your current girlfriend for her understanding on this, as you would not want to be caught in between.<br><br>Ps: I'm relativly new here, and do not know much about any of you guys. But this is just my 2 cents worth. Hope I had not offended anyone of you guys here with my comments.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by N|rVaNa07 (edited 09 October 2001).]</div>
