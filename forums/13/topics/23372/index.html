            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by l3stat:</div><div class="quote_body">eh i did discuss this issue with my friend before, but wanna hear you guys' views... cos we have no conclusion still.. hahhaa...<br><br>the fuel tank is connected to the carburettor flat bowl via the fuel inlet tube. the fuel petcock is located on this tube, so you can set on or off. when the fuel in the flat bowl fills to a specific height (preset by your float height), it pushes up on the floats, which activates the float valve to close off the fuel inlet. so no more fuel comes in from the fuel tank, and the level of fuel in the flat bowl is constant.<br><br>when your engine is DEAD/NOT ON/NOT WORKING, there is no pressure difference in the venturi... unless the itchy hand prick playing your bike's throttle go kick in gear and push start i dunno lar.... but the thing is, when your engine is not moving, there is no pressure difference in the carburettor venturi. twisting your throttle has two mechanical functions in the carb: pulling up the jet needle, and throttle slide. even as the main jet is fully open, when there is no pressure difference (cos engine IS NOT RUNNING), how would your cylinders flood? petrol evaporates yes, but to the extent of flooding the cylinders???<br><br>so i got a few questions i discussed with my friend:<br><br>if the engine is not running, i.e. no pressure diff in the venturi, twisting the throttle only opens the main jet and throttle slide, yes the venturi passage is opened, but there is no airflow, how is that petrol will defy gravity and come up through the main jet from the flat bowl(s)? yes evaporation occurs, but i believe not to the extent of flooding your cylinders. at most, the venturi and the cylinder will be saturated with petrol vapour, but that won't cause flooding right?<br><br>secondly, the flat bowl will never overflow, assuming that your floats and float valve are working and properly set...<br><br>eh if there's anything i've missed or got wrong, feel free to tell me ya???! really quite interested to hear views on this... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>erm ok,... i sort of get what ure asking... first i say about closing the fuel tap... its a good practice... closing it after u park ure bike, Y , cos just in case u got a wear out overflow pin. and what effect will this cause&gt;&gt;&gt; fuels over flow from carby. Ok now for the cylinder block flooding thingy... this one will have to depends on individual rider..&gt;&gt;&gt; for eg. some riders may not know how to control  the throttle or amount of fuels going into the engine when startin... they may have open slightly abit more which the heat from the sparks is not sufficient to ignite the fuels and this would starts floodin...&gt;&gt;&gt;eg. 2 some rider likes to go fast and stop... if u all can see from ure carby outlet to ure engine side... there is a lilttle tube which leads to a reservoir which is usually located either on top or at the top side over ure engine... this reservoir is actually to stored ure excess fuels so as to compensate the event where by u can slow down and speed up fast without encountering any hip cups. Those riders who have this habit... often have excess fuels in that reservoir and this may leads to floodin too... eg.3 there are oso some riders who like to off the engine and open the throttle at the same time.... this is a big NO NO. Cos y,... its becos when ure doing this... often u will have a lots of unburn fuels left in ure cylinder block. This will confirm cos floodin especially if the weather is cold. Now pls note that a normal ignition coils only produce about 20k volt to 25k volt to burn fuels and these values will only be reach when the engine is running when ure startin the engine... there wont be 20kv so its best not to open throttle and start  unless ure sure that its wise to do that. If there are any opinion i would like to hear too. Hope what i said can help u guys</div>

(the choke cuts air flow from the venturi so that saturated petrol vapours enters the cylinder) of course, if the cylinder is flooded to start with, the choke is going to make it worse...<br><br>anyway, as for what really causes flooding, be it the degree of saturation (air/fuel ratio) of petrol in the air, or liquid petrol flowing into the cylinder, i dunno, can't comment too much on it...<br><br>heh.. must say we think alike on the faulty components along the fuel tank ---&gt; carb chain... ah.. the rest leh.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
