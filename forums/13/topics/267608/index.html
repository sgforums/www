It sees the investment as money well spent.<br><br>Cynthia Oh, Executive Director of Lam Chee Development, said: "This is the first time that our company is venturing into this (motocross business). One of the main reasons is passion.<br><br>"My father, in the 1970s, he had very fond memories of go-karting and racing... it was very, very fun. And he has been thinking over the years, 'why there isn't a place like this for sport enthusiasts in Singapore?'... So my dad decided to bid for it."<br><br>The site at Tuas West Drive will be the first dedicated venue Singapore has ever had for two-wheeler motocross activities.<br><br>Jackson Han, Singapore Motor Sports Association's Competition Secretary, said: "Once this permanent venue is up in early 2008, we can organise events and Singapore competitions, which we have never done before in Singapore.<br><br>"We are also planning to hold courses for young riders and beginners in order to bring up our new generation of riders."<br><br>And what do motocross enthusiasts in Singapore think?<br><br>"The plot of land is a dream come true for all us riders in Singapore. What it means also is that we riders can take our racing off the roads and onto the track where it's all sanctioned and legal," said motocross enthusiast Kahirul Nizam.<br><br>"There are talented riders around here. It's just that they're not given the opportunity to start with. Well, with this, at least there's a platform for them to start up," said Muhammad Amin, another motocross enthusiast. - CNA/ir<br><br><span class="small">Copyright Â© 2006 MCN International Pte Ltd</span></div>
