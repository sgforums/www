I am a medical student doing training.<br><br>Cos if someone collapses i am duty bound to do alot of things with that two letters in front.<br><br>Well , the handwriting is not on purpose. Cos we are forced to write many things down in a very short time. we probably spend 50% of our time talking to patients, 30% thinking and let's say leave 20% to write. And the writing is mainly to document what we hear or see from the patient and what we tell the patient and how we intend to treat the patient.<br><br>In short, it's like a written record- mostly to protect ourselves  that we have said something and as a written instruction as to what medication to give. So more usu it  is a drudgery and we write it just so that the next dr can read. I had some difficulty reading what  drs write at the start just as others have difficulty reading mine. But now i can read really bad writing.<br><br>We use technical terms to be precise, and very brief so we can save time writing short notes not long essays. It's the same way like the air traffic controller uses codewords that the pilot can understand and is usu short and brief.,<br><br>I am in clinic F but usu run ard everywhere.<br><br>[This message has been edited by hello_fromjoel (edited 25 January 2002).]</div>
