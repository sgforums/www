            <div class='col-md body'>[QUOTE]<br>Hi ah tee,<br>from what you tell me. It sounds like he has a fracture of the metacarpals the part joining the finger bone and the wrist joint.<br><br>Basically , 5th metacarpal ( on the 5th finger) is very commonly associated with punching injury. The surgeon or A&amp;E MO will probably not do any manipulation ( i.e twist the bone) unless the bones are grossly displaced.<br><br>If they are agape, most bones have the intrinsic ability to appose and heal very  well.<br><br>How we treat is to put in a cast (crepe and wool bandage), this ensures the wrist does not move excessively and is done in such a way as to allow the bones to appose( or face each other) so they can heal nicely.<br><br>This early immobilisation usu lasts 10 days , but you should get your friends to move his fingers after the 2-3 day to prevent any stiff hand or carpal syndrome. ( due to the healing process being excessive and the latter being due to built-up pressure from swelling).<br><br>It's an open fracture right, cos i heard something about a wound. Do be careful they are not contaminated bites and check if the fingers are rotated( rotational deformity.)<br><br>If that occurs, surgery may be required. Go back and see the Dr at the appointed time.<br><br>As to whether, this will affect his licence conversion. I think vocational or licence renewal is dependent on vision ,or severe medical conditions that affects the ability of the driver to respond. Like epilepsy or diabetic retinopathy. Wrist injuries normally heal well and should not be an issue.<br><br>But after the injury , there may be some associated weakness with elongation of ligaments or fascia. you can usu correct that with physiotherapy and muscle strengthehing<br><br>What is it you like about gynaecology , i am doing that now. IT IS VERY BUSY.<br><br>Rest well.</div>
