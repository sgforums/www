              <p>
              </p><p>Trainee teacher Hazel Ng, 25, tells her side of the story with regards to the accident in which she was hit by a lorry and says that "I'm sometimes angry, sometimes sad, and sometimes happy that I'm alive."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ms Ng was riding on a scooter when a lorry tailgated and hit her, causing her to be flung onto the road. The incident was captured on video by a motorist, which has now gone viral.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The accident left a 4cm-long, 2.5cm-deep gash on her right elbow. She also fractured her right shoulder and had abrasions on her face and legs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a two-hour operation, doctors had to stitch back a ligament in her right arm that had been severed from the muscles. She has since undergone another operation to fix her shoulder, and is awaiting a skin graft operation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While she is happy to be alive, Ms Ng is angry that the accident is going to cause a mess where her studies are concerned and she will have to make finance arrangements, due to the loss of income from not being able to teach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The avid kayaker is training to be a physical education teacher, but will now have to lay off physical activities until she recovers fully. This means that she will not be able to graduate in May as planned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ms Ng is also looking at a long road to recovery, as she will have to go through three to four months of physiotherapy after her wounds heal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recalling the accident after she felt a violent bump on the right of her scooter, she said at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, "My mind went blank. I just hoped that no other cars would hit me." She did not realise that the lorry driver was tailgating her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ms Ng was conscious throughout her ordeal and while she remembers motorists stopping to help her, she did not see the lorry driver. He had also not contacted her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She does not regret getting her licence two months ago, but will stop riding for now because her family is worried about her safety.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I'm lucky that a witness helped me get the video so at least I know I'm not in the wrong,” said Ms Ng, who has seen the video of the accident at least five times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The police yesterday said that no arrests have been made.</p>

              <p>There were 3 lanes on that expressway, she was in the centre lane throughout, and if she maintained a decent 80km/h, that would be no fault of hers. As for the lorry, it is certain he cannot use the extreme right to overtake. He should be on the extreme left, but requires the centre lane to overtake. So yeah he was kinda stuck.</p>
              <p>But he could drop a gear, take the extreme right and overtake then come back to centre, at the risk of a ticket if he gets caught.</p>
              <p>Normally if I drive one of those 70km/h limited trucks, I'll stay centre, and go full throttle, because at 70, the alarm is beeping, and the engine already protesting at 5th gear, but I won't hesitate to drop gear and go right, till the centre is clear.</p>
