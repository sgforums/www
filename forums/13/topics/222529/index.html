            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, am a newbie in the forum.<br><br>Im gonna go for my Cl 2 soon, but prob is, havent been riding since my 2A. Anyone have any advice on managing the tougher criteria for 2?<br><br>Eg for the damned bumpy course i never got the "one burst of throttle, one obstacle" trick. Lucky lucky got past 2A without any points there; I just didnt clutch in and let the basic engine rpms bring me through.<br><br>And is the power of the Cl 2 learner bikes much stronger than the Super 4s?<br><br>ANY advice is appreciated.<br><br>Thanks!</div>

The fazers at CDC arent really good for such low end riding....  Throttle control isnt as responsive as the 2a bikes.<br><br>You need more practise with the bikes before your test to get a better feel of its power and when it will kick in.</div>

Power dont kick in as and when you throttle, and its sluggish at the start.<br><br>Plank, was a breeze, but shalom was a killer cos the power sort of only push the bike faster at the last 2 pylons.<br><br>E-brake and bumpy was fantastic cos of the weight of the bike and its stability.  Only dropped the bike once at e brake cos my legs was too short and didnt land my left foot properly.<br><br>Was scary at figure 8 cos of the speed!<br><br>And yep, I have same problem with mancha cos of my short short legs. Tip toe (and I mean my boots toe tip was tipping like a ballerina!) at left leg down position.  Always has to wiggle my butt back on the bike seat when moving off.  1st gear was the most wobbly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Class 2A was a learning experience, getting used to the weight and the power, but Class 2 was really enjoyable, as I already know the routine.<br>I enjoy showing off at the fig. 8. Its all in your wrist (trottle control) and eyeline. At the plank, I just lock my sights on the tip of a cone, my hands goes on auto mode. Same for the shalom, my sight locked on the tip of the end cone, and my face always facing that direction, but my body and machine doing the sway round the pylons. For eBrake, I do my 1,2,3 method, 1 squeeze front brake, 2 rear brakes, 3 clutch in.<br>In all the  correct sitting posture and looking ahead is very important.</div>
