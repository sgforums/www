I think that although the aprilla in stock form is now one of the slower 2b racers it is still the best in terms of cornering ability</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>people might say tzm, sp and krr are the best right? But when u look back if u r looking for a most powerful bike on the road plus the horsepower and the design, Aprilia is the best choice. People say those 150 s bike are strong cause maybe they think that the piston is 150 it is better than aprilia. But think again on the Grand prix world racing, do they have such tzm, sp, krr? A grand prix bike is always a grand prix bike. just know how to ride it! The design of those 150 are simply too small to ride fast. and cornering is very difficult! Look at krr, the chassis is a tube chassis. Tell me is a round chassis is strong? Aprilia is design for the maximum. And i think in the market people bring in tzm, sp, krr and say that such bike are good because they want to sell off the bike.c'mmon man this is business. Actually i wanted to buy a krr but was not recommended by the shop owner and same goes to tzm and sp. I ask them for performance bike and they say aprilia was the right choice. I have been ridind long enough my man i know behind all scenes! Good luck y friend! make sure dont' regret for wat bike u choose!</div>

But when u look back if u r looking for a most powerful bike on the road plus the horsepower and the design, Aprilia is the best choice. People say those 150 s bike are strong cause maybe they think that the piston is 150 it is better than aprilia. But think again on the Grand prix world racing, do they have such tzm, sp, krr? A grand prix bike is always a grand prix bike. just know how to ride it! The design of those 150 are simply too small to ride fast. and cornering is very difficult! Look at krr, the chassis is a tube chassis. Tell me is a round chassis is strong? Aprilia is design for the maximum. And i think in the market people bring in tzm, sp, krr and say that such bike are good because they want to sell off the bike.c'mmon man this is business. Actually i wanted to buy a krr but was not recommended by the shop owner and same goes to tzm and sp. I ask them for performance bike and they say aprilia was the right choice. I have been ridind long enough my man i know behind all scenes! Good luck y friend! make sure dont' regret for wat bike u choose!</div></blockquote>hey...LOOK BITCH! don go blabbering abt some FUCK APRILLIA! eh don think yr bike BIG FUCK LAH OK....u say the bike shop say this and that...THN HAO U NOE HE IS NOT CONNING U WHEN U BOUGHT THE BITCHIN BIKE????????
