            <div class='col-md body'>Ok for 1 thing i've already drive a car now, need to ferry family.<br>Therefore my vespa is under layoff for a year<br><br>I've observed that some riders like to hide in the blindspot of other vehicles. New riders that i can understand but those riding superbike?!<br><br>Defensive riding is a must guys and girls (nowaday more gals are riding too so thumbs up)<br><br>Incident 1, I was about to turn to my left, signal light on, check my rear and left mirror, check blind spot..........all clear but i still have this uneasy feeling as i can hear an engine roar by my left side. true enough when i fully turn around my head a motorcyclist is just beside my left tail light! futhermore as i've already signal, he still stick to my butt. you should at least stay away as i might do a sudden braking. nevertheless, i open up the gap between my car and the road kerb to let him thru first.<br><br>Incident 2, please on your headlight all the time and i mean headlight not pole light to make yourself more visible.<br><br>Incident 3, ladies please cover up. i know you got a sexy body that you want to show off by wearing shorts and tube. i've advise to a lady riding a kr150 when we stop at a traffic light junction. i told her to cover up next time when riding. but her respond was "my wishlah" until i show her my scar on my both arm....those scar was minimise as i was wearing a racing suit..........just imagine she skidded.........confirm her body will look like map of asia.<br><br>no matter what, never try to race with a car. i know its hard to contain our anger but what does it got to prove in the end?<br><br>and lastly, please dont zigzag when during heavy traffic as you might not know there are idiot drivers who saw an opening on the next lane and just chiong without looking out for motorbikes. if you must squeeze during heavy traffic (thats what i like about bike) play with your pass light intermittenly to attract drivers you are there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree to this topic.<br><br>haha.<br><br>I am a rider who recently just got a car.<br>I have been riding for 4 yrs before converting.<br><br>After i convert then i realise how drivers feel when motor cycles wiz pass them or stay in their blind spot.<br><br>I used to wiz pass cars and ride on the dotted line on the expressway,<br>But after i started driving, i realised that it is extremely dangerous to ride this way.<br><br>Some of the things that i believe and advice new riders:<br><br>Do not stay behind cars or vehicles bigger than you.<br>when the car do an Ebrake, you would not have to time to react.<br>Stay ahead of them.<br><br>Try not to ride on dotted lines, especially when it's rainning.<br>When the vehicle suddenly do E-brake in front of you, try to brake as much as you can, if it skidds, realease you brake and when it skidds back to normal then you brake again.<br><br>If you think that you are definately going to hit the car in front, slow down as much as possible but do not let your bike skidd until buang.<br><br>I would rather i hit the car in front at a very slow speed than skid until buang.<br>Cos, if you hit the car at slow speed, you would only fall of your bike, the most let them claim insurance.<br>If you try to break all the way and skid until buang, your skin will definately tear.<br><br>Regards</div>
