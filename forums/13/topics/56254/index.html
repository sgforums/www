There are female bikers on the road and you might ask yourself "how come she can ride"... There is no doubt many disapproval of anyone riding bike. Some is for practicality and some is purely out of passion for riding...<br><br>I have same advice as some of them. You have to decide. We can't decide for you. Riding is dangerous. So, is driving, walking down the road and etc. But as a biker, you have to ensure safety to yourself and other motorist. It's true that you are riding safely but other motorist is reckless... Therefore, being acutely aware and alert when riding is crucial thing. There are many safety aspect on the road which can be shared when we meet.... I see many accident victims due to my nature of work in a hospital, but I'm still riding....<br><br>Decide wisely and don't regret on it...<br><br>Ride safe &amp; defensively<br>Shebiker on White STa11ion<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by y2kamoeba:</div><div class="quote_body">I've enrolled for lessons for Class 2B license.
