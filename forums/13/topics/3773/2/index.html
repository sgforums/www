On the road, I always occupy the entire lane and force cars to lane change for overtaking. If it's small bikes which are travelling nearer to one side of the lane, then I'll overtake him by travelling nearer to the other side of the lane (but i usually lane change), if the clearance allows, and it's not dangerous to do so.<br>And, the situation where the 2nd lane is full of cars and you are travelling in the 1st lane with a ot of traffic behind you, will almost not be possible. You think the 2nd lane vehicles will stay in the 2nd lane where the traffic is heavy and leave the empty road ahead of the slow bike, untouched ?  Sorry, but I don't think so. The cars will cut in ahead of the slow bike. By the way, if that really happened, the bike which is travelling at thespeed limit already is not wrong to remain at his current speed and not give way to the traffic behind. 1st lane liao leh, you want him to lane change where ? Road shoulder liao ah ? And you fast doesn't mean people have to give way to you leh. If you are way above the road speed limit, and you try anything funny and gt into accident, you'll be at fault you know ....<br></div>

The driver might be in a real hurry, you never know... maybe he's rushing to the hospital to see his dying mother, etc, and since he's taking the risk to rush there, just let him be.

As a matter of fact, there's no actual "right" way on the road. This is one lesson I've learnt.  Your own safety is the most important.  Nothing else matters as much.<br><br></div>
