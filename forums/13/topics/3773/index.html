            <div class='col-md body'>In view of the recent surge of motorcycle accidents, I thought it might be useful for the more experienced riders here to contribute some safety tips to the newbies.<br><br>As a matter of fact, for me, before I got my license, I did a lot reading up and asking around on the common causes of accidents and how to avoid them.  To date, this knowledge has saved me several times.<br><br>Learn from the mistakes of others, you might not have the chance to make all of them yourself.<br><br>Let me start first.<br><br>1. Try not to rely on the rear brakes too much 'coz your bike will fishtail once the rear wheel locks.  Get used to using more of the front brakes and a little of the rear brakes while braking.<br><br>I sincerely hope this will be beneficial to everyone, especially the newer bikers.<br><br>Bikers, please start contributing; your advice might save someone's life one day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe a good maintenance schedule to keep your machine at prime working condition is important to reduce potential for accidents that might occur due to machine failure like piston seizing, chain snapping etc.<br><br>Also it is important to read up and practise on defensive riding. Some good articles on riding can be found here at: <a href="http://www.msgroup.org/discuss.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.msgroup.org/discuss.asp</a><br><br>One way to reduce one's risk of having accidents is to avoid riding early in the morning between 1 to 6am. I believe one will tend to travel much faster than normal as traffic is light and there are greater hazards posed such as motorists who might be fatigued or drunk during this time. Most of the accidents I have read in the papers usually occur during this period.<br><br>Another thing is to avoid lane-splitting when riding. Moving to the front when the traffic is at a standstill is ok but still exercise caution and care. However, never travel in-between lanes while on the move as you might just be in the blind spot of the driver at your sides. There is nothing wrong with taking up a lane for your own but do not hog the right-most lane.<br><br>Also keep a safe distance between you and vehicles in front of you and always brake earlier but lightly squeezing the front brake lever to signify that you are stopping. This is to give cars behind you ample notice to have sufficient reaction time to stop their vehicles as they will require a greater distance to stop compared to a bike.<br><br>Lastly, I believe one should wear proper attire while riding. Granted it does not look cool but I think it is better than having road rash or skin grafting. I think the basic requirement should be to wear a SNELL or DOT approved helmet, gloves, jeans and shoes. I notice people spend quite a lot on changing the aesthetics of their bikes or attempting to boost performance at the expense of their own safety gear.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>protective wear is certainly 1st most important thing , u spend so much on ur bike might as well spend abit more on ur safety like good helmet , also try to use a jacket those jeans type jacket would do , n maybe go to de extend on wearing gloves , but still most important thing is buy a good helmet even if it cos $500 just buy it , a hole in ur pocket is better den a hole in ur head .<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey how bout we oso include danger areas in s'pore?<br>i travel on kje often to skul. towards tuas left lane almost always occupied by trucks of all sizes all time of day. these trucks travel slow, bout 60 kmh, but BEWARE!!! those clowns like to overtake each other and i dont understand why coz at dat speed their pickup damn slow will alwiz cause a little slowdown in second lane some more once they clear they go back left lane same speed as the trucks they passed donno why they actualli bother overtaking. dangerous: the realli big trucks realli dont see bikers or they just dont care sometimes they swerve out suddenly to second lane with late signal!!! i advise if u on second lane travel a little outside nearer to third lane and be super alert when passing by these trucks.<br>i oso travelled on aye a few times lagi worse, truckers even more gangster and even more crowded. only advise is be damn careful dont try anything funny.<br>oh yah new riders should take the trouble to get veri used to pillion, the feeling veri different. and if ur pillion is not rider him/herself teach him/her correct stuff like sit close and keep still, they shift while u moving your bike will shift oso.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>
