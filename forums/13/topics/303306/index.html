When I'm buying the bike, how do I give a good check on the bike.<br>-Like how to know if its worth buying?<br>-Is the engine running good? Is there anything else i need to know?<br><br>2. After the deal is done, I'm going to transfer the ownership right?<br>-How is it done? and what are the things i need to take note of?<br>-And where is it done?<br>-And what the things i need to take note of?<br><br>3. After the transferring of owner ship, I must get a insurance for a bike right?              -Do i need a person above 21 to sign it for me?<br>-How is the process of getting a insurance?<br>-And where can i get insurance?<br><br>4. Insurance payment is done on the spot right?<br>-After that then i can ride the bike back home already right?<br>-Or is there anything else i need to know?<br><br>5.Finally, is there anything else i need to worry about and know about when getting a used bike from someone i dont know?<br><br>I really appreciate your time and help!

            <div class='col-md body'>1. You wont really know if its worth buying, because you have no experience with bike engines.  And at the bike shop, they have minimum petrol in the bike which you most like going to hear it a while instead of hearing its problem on the longer running.  You can only maybe hope that the following is in good order before you buy.<br><br>a) engine sounds smooth, with no pop sounds or smoke from the exhaust.<br>b) chains looks tight instead of slacking<br>c) tire threads are there or that the shop will change it for you.<br>d) handlebar is straight when you sit on it and stand it upright straight and its looks straight and the wheels are all aligned straight.  get a friend to look at it for you.<br><br>2) deal is not that easily done, you usually have to put in a deposit with the seller or the shop and provide them your nric and licence for them to do the transfer at the LTA.  If its a private seller, you need to double check at the LTA that the bike does not have outstanding installments from any bike shop.  If it does, there is no way you can do a transfer yourself.<br><br>3) And no. You need to get a insurance first before you can do a bike transfer.<br>So if you are not doing it with the shop, you need to get the log card or letter of that bike, bring to a insurance agency and get that insurance yourself.  No. there is no need for anyone above 21 to sign for you. I am not sure on this point because I never went thru the under 21 process.  Being old has its privileges I guess.<br><br>You will need, log card of the bike, your licence, your NRIC &amp; preferably the licence of a sub rider, preferably a family member or a really close friend that can help you out in times of trouble.  ANd of course, your cash.<br><br>4) Yes, insurance can be done on the spot, if you are doing it yourself.  Then you go to LTA and do the transfer of the ownership with the insurance, inspection cert (if any); the log card or letter; the owners NRIC and yours. Then you can ride the bike home after you have paid the seller.<br><br>SOme private sellers might prefer to be on the spot to sign for the transfer instead of trusting you.<br><br>Important note:<br><br>a) the bike is cleared of installments or the bike shop control or LTA will not allow transfer.<br>b) When was the last inspection? Need new inspection?<br>c) Road tax due?<br>d) Insurance ready<br>e) Transfer fees?<br>f) Petrol.  Make sure you top up the petrol once you take over the bike.  Ride a short distance if possible, to the petrol station first.</div>

If it does, I hope you know how to claim insurance.  The driving centre has a basic insurance plan which you did purchased when you enrol at the school.<br><br>2. You might want to check your expiry of your Basic theory &amp; the PDL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>viciouskitty74 has done a great job on this writeup! It'll really help those who are getting their bikes for the first time and I'm sure it's a rather exciting moment for them. There are some points, however, I would like to correct. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[quote]Originally posted by viciouskitty74:<br>[b]<br>a) engine sounds smooth, with no pop sounds or smoke from the exhaust.<br><br><span style="color: red;">smoke from the exhaust is actually common for 2-strokes bike. So, if anyone is getting 2-strokes bike, you don't have to worry about the smoke actually.</span><br><br>3) And no. You need to get a insurance first before you can do a bike transfer.<br>So if you are not doing it with the shop, you need to get the log card or letter of that bike, bring to a insurance agency and get that insurance yourself.  No. there is no need for anyone above 21 to sign for you. I am not sure on this point because I never went thru the under 21 process.

ANd of course, your cash.<br><br><span style="color: red;">There is also no need for the log card at all now. I recently had a transfer of bike and I didn't even see the log card. After doing the transfer for the bike to be under your name, LTA will issue you a letter stating you're now the owner of the bike as well as other information regarding the bike such as the number of transfers.<br><br>For the insurance part, you'll just have to call NTUC and tell them what's the number plate of the bike you're buying the insurance (that is if you're buying the insurance from NTUC)<br><br>After that, just head down to any of their branch to pay the premium and you'll get the policy.</span></div>

Insurance cheaper?  There is no such thing as owner being older and insurance is cheaper anymore. Is there?<br><br>And insurance is calculated for the youngest rider, be it subrider or actual rider/owner.<br><br>Buying a bike on fathers name, with him having no licence, means you need to take on a non riding insurance with you as sub rider.<br><br>It dont make sense that you wont have another sub rider that can help you out when you cannot ride.<br><br>2) Why not buy the bike in your own name, and have your father as a garantor for the bike installments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess everyone is wrong when they say u can buy a bike under your name even if you are under 21. There is no such thing as getting a guarantor when u r under 21 yrs old. The actual truth is like this.. if u r under 21 yrs old u can only buy e bike under someone else name who is 21 n above and he or she must have a guarantor. I went down today with my dad and they clarify everything with us. My dad needs a guarantor even he has stable income and above 21.

              <p>I guess everyone is wrong when they say u can buy a bike under
              your name even if you are under 21. There is no such thing as
              getting a guarantor when u r under 21 yrs old. The actual truth is
              like this.. if u r under 21 yrs old u can only buy e bike under
              someone else name who is 21 n above and he or she must have a
              guarantor. I went down today with my dad and they clarify
              everything with us. My dad needs a guarantor even he has stable
              income and above 21. There is no such thing as buying a bike under
              yr name if u r under 21 but they will still charge accordingly to
              the person under 21 yrs old.</p>
