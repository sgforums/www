            <div class='col-md body'>Guys i think we all must be partial to judgement.. I strongly agree with winston in wat he says coz it is true. maybe he has said it in a way that is not very pleasing to the ears of some of u. Nick I think u should stop flaming coz its onli gonna make our outings next time very awkward. We all know each other and have seen each other b4 so no point making things so difficult for all rite~ i think best thing that all can do is if u do not wish to hear wat he has to say then u can choose to ignore it let others who wanna take his advise to hear it. personally i am going to take it. coz i treasure my lisence. I think this time egos are getting in the way of our friendship and forum comardrie.... so pls all keep our egos in a far dark corner the freezer b4 we log on to post in the forum..<br><br>note. this situation should not happen again<br>if not our nice friendly forum will juz become a place for ppl to practice targeting with their flame thrower.. like delphi</div>

I strongly agree with winston in wat he says coz it is true. maybe he has said it in a way that is not very pleasing to the ears of some of u. Nick I think u should stop flaming coz its onli gonna make our outings next time very awkward. We all know each other and have seen each other b4 so no point making things so difficult for all rite~ i think best thing that all can do is if u do not wish to hear wat he has to say then u can choose to ignore it let others who wanna take his advise to hear it. personally i am going to take it. coz i treasure my lisence. I think this time egos are getting in the way of our friendship and forum comardrie.... so pls all keep our egos in a far dark corner the freezer b4 we log on to post in the forum..<br><br>note. this situation should not happen again<br>if not our nice friendly forum will juz become a place for ppl to practice targeting with their flame thrower.. like delphi</div></blockquote>------------------<br>wish u good luck<br>wish u bad luck<br>wish u born a baby duck</div>
