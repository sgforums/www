            <div class='col-md body'>On Monday late evening when I went to Farrer Road, I was cruising along the road next to the Farrer flyover when a RVF sped past me cutting in my lane with I think 120kph and stopping at the traffic light. I was completely taken aback by his mad man riding. I think he's insisting that I race with him. When I stopped at the traffic light, he looked at me and revved his throttle like want to challenge already. I also looked at him then let him chiong into the yellow box as we headed for a right turn to the road beside Tulip Garden. He really revved very hard that I heard his kui doh pipe roar like tiger!<br>Then I saw him went ahead of me and banked his whole bike down while I followed slowly increasing my acceleration slowly. Then I saw the RVF banked down until very low that sparks flew from his foot pegs.<br>He must be too confident that he lost his awareness of what's going on. The next thing I saw was spinning RVF in the yellow box under the flyover. I rode past him seeing him still demonstrating how tornadoes behave with his RVF. I couldn't stop s it was a yellow box and many cars were behind me. I wonder what happened to that guy. I think he should be all right since he's wearing something like a black leather jacket.<br>Does showing how fierce you are on the road pays? Why not save those eagerness on the track?</div>

I'm not forcing anybody. Of course I do feel disappointed when no one responds. Doesn't mean that I am 'challenging anyone to race'.<br><br>"...wan say track huh winston ... no use here as most of us here dun race ... we juz pit skill on road not racing and pls stop all your fucking race topics now u know y all your topics no ppl reply ... "<br><br>Go ahead and race on the road as much as you like. And you might get revoked one day. Pit skills should not be on the road and on the track. You're being very very irresponsible by pitting skills on the road. What's the difference of pitting skills on the road and racing on the road?<br><br>"i think there a need to let u noe ok ... u think everyone like u so free ah wan go track then go ah no need go school , work and ppl like me in ns .... dont u know it beri troblesome to go malaysia when u in ns ..."<br><br>Like I said Track days I organise on weekends. I'm also doin NS. If I can put out some days for track to make me dun feel like racing on the road. Why not? You haven't get suspended before. You don't know the inconvenience of being unable to ride for months. Plus the gruesome months of waiting for the court session. Then the speeding up of heartbeat while you wait for the judge to pass the sentence -&gt; All becos of the twisting of the throttle slightly for a few hundred meters.<br><br>"...everytime say wan race go track ... fuck man wan race on race u dare ???"<br><br>And I never jio anyone on a race, I always do that as a form of invitation to enjoy a weekend morning on the track with fellow bikers. BTW what you said is very childish &amp; you really make me feel very pissed off with this. Most people know it that I NEVER used my bike to stamp anyone from the class 2B and 2A holders cos I know I must always remember that I also started off with a NSR150SP. Since when did I think I can have the right to stamp anyone from the 2B and 2A category?  Don't make me feel furtherly pissed off. I admit that I don't dare to race on the road becos of TP. You can try and challenge the power of stealth cameras and the traffic police.  I advice you to reserve everything on the track to increase your licence's survivability on the road. Your class 3 will also be liable for a ban if you lose your bike licence.<br><br>Once you go to track, you'll start to enjoy the place very much that you won't want to race on the road anymore. -&gt; And This is the last time I am saying this. Good luck.<br>'hao(3) zi(4) wei(2) zhi(1)'</div>
