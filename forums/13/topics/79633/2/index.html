Not for its speed (I would be crazy to encourage a beginner to speed), but for its stability and ease of use. A sportbike is inherently designed to be stable at high speed. And if it's stable at high speed, it'll also be stable at low speed. It also has high maneuverability. It can easily take bends, corners, u-turns, straights, well... you name it. It doesn't handle bumps and potholes as well as a scram does, but luckily Singapore roads don't have a lot of them.<br><br>Another good point is sportbikes are also inherently designed to be light without compromising their stability. So flicking one from side to side on a twisty road doesn't require much effort. And for 2B bikes, the power delivery is not as intimidating as their bigger counterparts, shouldn't be a problem for beginners.<br><br>But there're downsides to sportbikes. They're not the best bikes for pillions. They tend to consume more petrol because of higher performance. And riding one at not-so-high speed on a long distance could be taxing on your wrists, shoulders, back, and bums. Which brings us to my next recommendation: a sport-tourer.<br><br>A sport-tourer offers the same quality as a sportbike does, without the body ache. The riding posture is more relaxed, so it's suitable for long distance riding. And sport-tourers are friendlier to pillions.<br><br>Another alternative is a cub, which is designed for easy riding. Hence, they're easy to ride <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>The downside is they're not as stable as the previous bikes I mentioned. They can be swayed by a strong gush of wind, and light impact can knock them down. These're not major drawbacks, though, as long as the rider takes good precaution when riding.<br><br>Having said all that... I could have been biased, because I don't have enuff experience with scramblers, cruisers, scooters, and other types of bike to make good comparison. So in the end I guess your GF herself must make the decision, which type of bike she likes the most, and suits her riding style the most. Did you say she was going to get the bike next week? It's been more than a week since your 1st posting, so it might be too late for me to babble in this thread...  oh well... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

My gf also riding a SP for few months already. So maybe i can advice on your questions.<br><br>Actually basically riding a bike, no matter what bike, is already dangerous. So not of a big issue on that, just ask your gf to go for what she like. True, scram and sports bike has many differences. It actually depends of what she herself likes to learn, sports? Or Scram. If she don't mind getting in tough actions and bruises, she can go for scram if she likes. But if she minds, then get a roadbike. But still u must remember, no matter what kind of bikes, once you get into a fatal accident, will also die.<br><br>Regarding about which bikeshop which is resonable, i don't really think there are much reasonable shops in SG. But i can reccommend "Bike Production" at one of the AMK Industrial Park. Altough my bikeshop is not from there, but i heard quite a number of friends bought their machines there at quite good price.<br><br>Hope these helps.</div>
