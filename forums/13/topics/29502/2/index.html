            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THE STREET IS NOT A TRACK - IT'S A PLACE TO PACE</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">TWO WEEKS AGO A rider died when he and his bike<br>tumbled off a cliff paralleling our favourite road. No<br>gravel in the road, no oncoming car pushing him wide,<br>no ice. The guy screwed up. Rider error. Too much<br>enthusiasm with too little skill, and this fatality<br>wasn't the first on this road this year. As with most<br>single-bike accidents, the rider entered the corner at<br>a speed his brain told him was too fast, stood the<br>bike up and nailed the rear brake. Goodbye<br><br>On the racetrack this rider would have tumbled into<br>the hay bales, visited the ambulance for a strip of<br>gauze and headed back to the pits to straighten his<br>handlebars and think about his mistake. But let's get<br>one thing perfectly clear: the street is not the<br>racetrack. Using it as such will shorten your riding<br>career and keep you from discovering the Pace.<br><br>The Pace is far from street racing-and a lot more fun.<br>The Pace places the motorcycle in its proper role as<br>the controlled vehicle, not the controlling vehicle.<br>Too many riders of sport bikes become baggage when the<br>throttle gets twisted-the ensuing speed is so<br>overwhelming they are carried along in the rush.<br><br>The Pace ignores outright speed and can be as much fun<br>on a Ninja 250 as on a ZX-11, emphasizing rider skill<br>over right-wrist bravado. A fool can twist the grip,<br>but a fool has no idea how to stop or turn. Learning<br>to stop will save your life; learning to turn will<br>enrich it. What feels better than banking a motorcycle<br>into a corner?<br><br>The mechanics of turning a motorcycle involve pushing<br>and/or pulling on the handlebars; while this isn't new<br>information for most sport riders, realize that the<br>force at the handlebar affects the motorcycle's rate<br>of turn-in. Shove hard on the bars, and the bike snaps<br>over; gently push the bars, and the bike lazily banks<br>in.<br><br>Different corners require different techniques, but as<br>you begin to think about lines, late entrances and<br>late apexes, turning your bike at the exact moment and<br>reaching the precise lean angle will require firm,<br>forceful inputs at the handlebars.<br><br>If you take less time to turn your motorcycle, you can<br>use that time to brake more effectively or run deeper<br>into the corner, affording yourself more time to judge<br>the corner and a better look at any hidden surprises.<br>It's important to look as far into the corner as<br>possible and remember the adage, "You go where you<br>look."<br><br><strong>DON'T RUSH</strong><br><br>The number one survival skill, after mastering<br>emergency braking, is setting your corner-entrance<br>speed early, or as Kenny Roberts says, "Slow in, fast<br>out." Street riders may get away with rushing into 99<br>out of 100 corners, but that last one will have<br>gravel, mud or a trespassing car. Setting entrance<br>speed early will allow you to adjust your speed and<br>cornering line, giving you every opportunity to handle<br>the surprise.<br><br>Racers talk constantly about late braking, yet that<br>technique is used only to pass for position during a<br>race, not to turn a quicker lap time. Hard braking<br>blurs the ability to judge cornering speed accurately,<br>and most racers who rely too heavily on the brakes<br>find themselves passed at the corner because they<br>scrubbed off too much cornering speed.<br><br>Additionally, braking late often forces you to trail<br>the brakes or turn the motorcycle while still braking.<br>While light trail braking is an excellent and useful<br>technique to master understand that your front tyre<br>has only a certain amount of traction to give.<br><br>If you use a majority of the front tyre's traction for<br>braking and then ask it to provide maximum cornering<br>traction as well, a typical low-side crash will<br>result. -Also consider that your motorcycle won't<br>steer as well with the fork fully compressed under<br>braking. If you're constantly fighting the motorcycle<br>while turning, it may be because you're braking too<br>far into the corner. All these problems can be<br>eliminated by setting your entrance speed early, an<br>important component of running at the Pace.<br><br>We've all rushed into a corner too fast and<br>experienced not just the terror but the lack of<br>control when trying to herd the bike into the bend. If<br>you're fighting the brakes and trying to turn the<br>bike, any surprise will be impossible to deal with.<br>Setting your entrance speed early and looking into the<br>corner allows you to determine what type of corner<br>you're facing. Does the radius decrease? Is the turn<br>off-camber? Is there an embankment that may have<br>contributed some dirt to the corner?<br><br>Since you aren't hammering the brakes at every corner<br>entrance, your enjoyment of pure cornering will<br>increase tremendously. You'll relish the feeling of<br>snapping your bike into a corner and opening the<br>throttle as early as possible. Racers talk about<br>getting the drive started, and that's just as<br>important on the street. Notice how the motorcycle<br>settles down and simply works better when the throttle<br>is open? Use a smooth, light touch on the throttle and<br>try to get the bike driving as soon as possible in the<br>corner, even before the apex, the tightest point of<br>the corner. If you find yourself on the throttle<br>ridiculously early, it's an indication you can<br>increase your entrance speed slightly by releasing the<br>brakes earlier.<br><br><strong>THE PACE PRINCIPLES</strong><br><br>Set cornering speed early. Blow the entrance and<br>you'll never recover.<br>Look down the road. Maintaining a high visual horizon<br>will reduce perceived speed and help you avoid panic<br>situations.<br>Steer the bike quickly. There's a reason John Kocinski<br>works: out-turning a fast-moving motorcycle takes<br>muscle.<br>Use your brakes smoothly but firmly. Get on and then<br>off the brakes; don't drag'em.<br>Get the throttle on early. Starting the drive settles<br>the chassis, especially though a bumpy corner.<br>Never cross the centerline except to pass. Crossing<br>the centerline in a corner is an instant ticket and an<br>admittance that you can't really steer your bike. In<br>racing terms, your lane is the course; staying right<br>of the line adds a significant challenge to most roads<br>and is mandatory for sport riding's future.<br>Don't crowd the centerline. Always expect an oncoming<br>car with two wheels in your lane.<br>Don't hang off in the corners or tuck in on the<br>straights. Sitting sedately on the bike looks safer:<br>and reduces unwanted attention. It also provides a<br>built-in safety margin.<br>When leading, ride for the group. Good verbal<br>communication is augmented with hand signals and turn<br>signals; change direction and speed smoothly.<br>When following, ride with the group. If you can't<br>follow a leader, don't expect anyone to follow you<br>when you're setting the Pace.<br>As you sweep past the apex, you can begin to stand the<br>bike up out of the corner. This is best done by<br>smoothly accelerating, which will help stand the bike<br>up. As the rear tyre comes off full lean it puts more<br>rubber on the road, and the forces previously used for<br>cornering traction can be converted to acceleration<br>traction. The throttle can be rolled open as the bike<br>stands up.<br><br>This magazine won't tell you how fast is safe; we will<br>tell you how to go fast safely. How fast you go is<br>your decision, but it's one that requires reflection<br>and commitment. High speed on an empty four-lane<br>freeway is against the law, but it's fairly safe.<br>Fifty-five miles per hour in a canyon might be legal,<br>but it may also be dangerous. Get together with your<br>friends and talk about speed. Set a reasonable maximum<br>and stick to it. Done right, the Pace is addicting<br>without high straightaway speeds.<br><br>The group I ride with couldn't care less about<br>outright speed between corners; any gamer can twist a<br>throttle. If you routinely go 100 mph, we hope you<br>routinely practice emergency stops from that speed.<br>Keep in mind outright speed will earn a ticket that is<br>tough to fight and painful to pay; cruising the easy<br>straight stuff doesn't attract as much attention from<br>the authorities and sets your speed perfectly for the<br>next sweeper.<br><br><strong>GROUP MENTALITY</strong><br><br>STRAIGHTS ARE THE time to reset the ranks. The leader<br>needs to set a pace that won't bunch up the followers,<br>especially while leaving a stop sign or passing a car<br>on a two-lane road. The leader must use the throttle<br>hard to get around the car and give the rest of the<br>group room to make the pass, yet he or she can't speed<br>blindly along and earn a ticket for the whole group.<br>With sane speeds on the straights, the gaps can be<br>adjusted easily; the bikes should be spaced about two<br>seconds apart for maximum visibility of surface<br>hazards.<br><br>It's the group aspect of the Pace I enjoy most,<br>watching the bikes in front of me click into a corner<br>like a row of dominoes, or looking in my mirror as my<br>friends slip through the same set of corners I just<br>emerged from.<br><br>Because there's a leader and a set of rules to follow,<br>the competitive aspect of sport riding is eliminated<br>and that removes a tremendous amount of pressure from<br>a young rider's ego-or even an old rider's ego. We've<br>all felt the tug of racing while riding with friends<br>or strangers, but the Pace takes that away and saves<br>it for where it belongs: the racetrack. The racetrack<br>is where you prove your speed and take chances to best<br>your friends and rivals. I've spent a considerable<br>amount of time writing about the Pace (see<br>Motorcyclist, Nov. '91) for several reasons, not the<br>least of which being the fun I've had researching it<br>(continuous and ongoing). But I have motivations that<br>aren't so fun. I got scared a few years ago when US<br>Senator Danforth decided to save us from ourselves by<br>trying to ban super bikes, soon followed by insurance<br>companies blacklisting a variety of sports bikes. I've<br>seen Mulholland highway shut down because riders<br>insisted on racing (and crashing) over a short section<br>of it. I've seen heavy police patrols on roads that<br>riders insist on throwing themselves off of. I've<br>heard the term "murder cycles" a dozen times too many.<br>When we consider the abilities of a modern sports<br>bike, it becomes clear that rider techniques is sorely<br>lacking.<br><br>The Pace emphasizes intelligent, rational riding<br>techniques that ignore racetrack heroics without<br>sacrificing fun. The skills needed to excel on the<br>racetrack make up the basic precepts of the Pace,<br>excluding the mind-numbing speeds and leaving the<br>substantially larger margin for error needed to allow<br>for unknowns and immovable objects. Our sport faces<br>unwanted legislation from outsiders, but a bit of<br>throttle management from within will guarantee our<br>future.</span><br></div>
