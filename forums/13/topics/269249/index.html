Too expensive?<br><br>I always see people riding with leathers (upper body) but no armour ... kinda defeats the purpose?

They don't always guarantee the safety of the driver, following an accident; however, it is undisputed that it greatly increases the odds of survival.<br><br>I can understand the argument based on Singapore's weather. However, it is but a small price to pay compared to the medical costs that could ensue (not to mention, in the case of paralysis etc., potential losses arising from lost of jobs).<br><br>With regards to price, SG bike gear is really cheap. Like dirt dirt dirt cheap. Same items here cost a fortune overseas. Considering the average rider will not be involved in accidents on a weekly basis, armor purchased can be considered a lifelong investment, and an investment to prolong life.<br><br>Leathers (without armour) really serve no practical purpose other than to protect against minor abrasions. And I don't think any random pair of jeans will help either. As far as I'm aware, I believe there exists "kevlar jeans" (by a co. called Dragging Jeans or something); very expensive stuff, and that's the only "jeans" that I'm aware of that has any real, substantial benefit to the rider.</div>
