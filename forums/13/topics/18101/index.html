            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br>just like to post some questions in mind on my bike.<br><br>1. I had the opporunity to jack up the rear of my bike during a chain oiling operation. After the job, I switched on my engine to motor the rear wheel. To my surprise, I found that with my clutch disengaged, the rear wheel is turning in 1st gear. The wheel only doesn't turn in Neutral gear. I asked my bike shop, the mechanic told me this is normal. Then, I began to think, if that is the case, then wouldn't my clutch plates be wearing themselves out pretty soon ? Does anyone of you have the same symptom ?<br><br>2. While travelling at 80km/h one day along a straight stretch of road, I suddenly heard one loud bang from the rear. Shocked, and thinking my tyre might have punctured (I'm having a tubed tyre, you see), I tried to slow down quickly. Before I could do that, another loud bang .... But my bike did not fishtail and so I was sure it wasn't my tyre. When I got to a safe place to inspect my bike, there was no sign of any damage. My wheels were solid, so there were no punctures. After much thought, I believed the sound to have come from my exhaust. Any advice on this ? My mechanic did not say anything about this.<br><br>3. I had this problem before, but it went away by itself. Then recently, it came bak again. During acceleration and cruising above 100km/h, there's this faint, but detectable ticking sound. It's only a few click click click sound then you can't hear it anymore. Then some distance later, you can hear it again. My bike mechanic couldn't offer any explanation.<br><br>4. I once saw my mechanic took the fuel tank off from my bike. I was very amused by the operation. He just removed some pipes here and there, and the whole tank came off. There wasn't any fuel leaking from anywhere. Can anyon tell me if there's any tap to shut off so there's no fuel coming out ?<br><br>Thanks for your time.</div>

Is it correct?<br>If that's the case, of course it's normal lah, nothing to worry about  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>When the clutch handle is released, the gears are engaged, and the rear wheel will rotate, becos there's no friction with the ground.<br><br><blockquote><strong>2. While travelling at 80km/h one day along a straight stretch of road, I suddenly heard one loud bang from the rear.

Try to clean your plug, change it if necessary.<br><br><blockquote><strong>4. Can anyon tell me if there's any tap to shut off so there's no fuel coming out ?</strong></blockquote>Usually it's below the tank, not far from the carb. For SP and RXZ, it's on the left hand side.</div>

But he has made a police report. Shortly after the recovery, he sold it back to my bike shop, an then the bike ended up with me. The ex-owner did not terminate the case. So the 2 policemen came and knock my door in the late of the nite and shocked me with the news that my vehicle was a stolen vehicle. They asked to see my documents. After that the matter was cleared. Hai .... Dun quite feel easy about this. Feel like something not rite. Anyway, the case was cleared.<br><br>Got your contact no. Sent a test messge, but no reply. Anyway, tomolo me off, got exam.
