            <div class='col-md body'>er.. there may be a lot of bad comments about ah swee. once i asked about a honda varadero, exactly the same case. but i wasn't very keen on the bike to start with. i believe it's a stunt so that you'll buy his old SPs.<br><br>but with that said, i think he offers a good reloan. 7%, 24 months payback. but it dpds on bike and plate. if you plan to use his services, make sure you be persistent and ask every tiny detail.<br><br>------------------<br>rock hard... ride free...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lemme try on the push-start/battery thing:<br><br>the batt is charged by the alternator ("magneto" + "coil" or whatever they call it), which is connected on the crank. AC current is converted to DC to charge the battery and power the CDI.<br><br>if your bike is the kick-start type, each action you kick is actually charging that battery for that tiny bit and powering the CDI for generating that spark. once your engine kicks into life, it's a self-sustaining process. however, to ensure that your other stuff like lights and indicators can work, a battery is needed to power it. why? because the power generated by the alternator is dependent on the engine rev. the purpose of the batt is to store extra current when the alternator produces more electricity than the bike requires, and this is used when you turn on the lights etc.<br><br>electric start uses a starter motor to start. so if your batt goes completely flat, you're screwed. if you press the starter and nothing happens, could be that either the battery is flat or the starter motor is screwed. test out the battery first. if the battery is fine (lights etc), can still push start and head for your mechanic to service the starter motor (or starter carbon or electricals).<br><br>hope this helps!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>rock hard... ride free...</div>
