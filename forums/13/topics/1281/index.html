            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I find it strange that people would rather pay for a bike with the lowest prices without considering other factors like service/support and warranty issues.<br><br>My TZM was bought directly from Yamaha official agent, Hong Leong. Although the price was higher than other shops around, but the level of service and support from the technicians has been top notch. When my bike was a month old, it could not start and they actually came down, took the bike back to the workshop and remedied the problem within 2 hours. Problem was a fouled plug which was replaced FOC.<br><br>I believe paying more from a reputable shop saves one money and time in the long run from unnecessary hassles and stress. This is something that all potential bike buyers should think about.</div>
