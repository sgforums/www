We should all work harder to educate motorcyclists, which is an uphill task.'<br>He added that the majority of motorcyclists ride dangerously, despite the council's emphasis on safe riding.<br>Motorcyclists are the most vulnerable road users and must practise safe riding to protect themselves.<br>Seventy motorcyclists and pillion riders have died on the road during the first nine months of this year. Last year, this group made up almost half of the 214 people who died in road accidents.<br><br>Always be alert on the road guys.....<br></div>
