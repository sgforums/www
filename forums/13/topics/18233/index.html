            <div class='col-md body'>But since he only planning to ride it for 1yr so y get a 2B sportsbike? Wait until u get 2A than change to a bigger sportsbike lah.No offence to 2B bikers, but do u wan to stick to a 2B sportsbike forever? Whatever u mod on ur bike, still "tio jia" by bigger sportsbike rite? Tts the reason i sell my RS125 to buy the GasGas. For scram, 200cc is good enugh on road or trail. Once the traffic lights goes green, all the SPs,KRR,TZMs,etc.. will smell ur 2t. SG roads, a few lamppost must stop at traffic lights liao so a scram is good enugh.<br><br>1 more thing, u can climb those kerbs,grass slopes small stairs to park ur bike.

            <div class='col-md body'>if i were u....id say id be better if u go for a raod bike. several reasons.<br><br>1) scrams are good if got mud and sand hills...if u dun go tracking nad got no kaki...then for what.<br><br>2) spare parts are expensive...esp if u buy KTM or GasGas...but if ur looking for lower end....WR is the one. but even then....u still have to think agt ur fuel consuption.<br><br>3)Dirt bikes somehow to me are a bit dangerous on road. becoz of their tyres...s'pore roads are smooth and flat...not like JB (heh~). if like that...where the tires going to 'makan'?? got sand and water and oil...lagi worse sia.<br>gud example wud be...u ever seen a scrambler make turning like racer??? no right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>go for a racer....or a roadbike...i dun recommend scrams...faster, road handling better and safer.<br><br>------------------<br>live hard, ride fast...but watch out for rocks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
