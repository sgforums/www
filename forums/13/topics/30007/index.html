            <div class='col-md body'>As I read the topic by joho with regards to getting a 2b license, i might as well post it here, the details and process which I'm still going through. First thing first, I'm 18 and just enrolled in November after my exams at UBI. I took my Riding Theory Test(RTT) on the 22nd Nov. &amp; I'm expecting the result to be out in a few days time. For your info, I always book the 4pm session &amp; i think it's the busiest time coz circult road is always jammed..<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical 1</span><br>1st time = didnt do changing gear 5--&gt;3 &amp; figure 8 (no time)<br>2nd time = balancing &amp; braking at low speed still not stable<br>3rd time = immediate failure.

I'll book 2 sessions in advance)<br>2nd time = coming soon(9/12/02)<br>The above are my experiences, hope that there's no criticism or flaming from anyone,I'm here to share &amp; hope it's useful to anyone getting 2b too.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prac. 5 Revision Circuit ($10)</span><br>1st time -10.20- 12pm<br>Only  3 prac. classes around so the advantage is that u can change &amp; try out other bikes at every round you come in. Some instructors are also free to follow u behind, see &amp; tell u your mistakes. Basically all the stations will be clear, no bikes pile up, no queue, no instructors around. Do anything u want.<br>2nd time - 4.25-6.05pm<br>At least 5 classes going on. No extra bikes will be left, so dont bother to turn in every round to change bike, just keep going. Expect to wait at all junctions &amp; stations. Could only go for a few rounds as most time are spent waiting.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical 5</span><br>1st time(6.50-8.30pm) - Fail - 22 demerit points<br>You line up according to your number tact. In the evening it's dark, so u might not be able to judge the distance at E brake. Also hard to see the S Course( fig 8 ), if u r going too fast u might strike the kerb. Some instructors might give you pressure by making it seems like an exam.<br>2nd time(8.30-10.10am) - Pass - 10 demerit points<br>I thought it was all over when i rolled backwards when moving off on the upward slope. Engine stalled too. I was so weak &amp; tired in the morning that i didnt step hard enough on the rear brake. Having a no care attitude, i went through the whole test route slowing, cruising &amp; almost striking a cone at Slalom when i didnt bother to bank enough. I was surprised when getting my results that the instructor asked for my RTT result slip. I have to apply for PDL using that, together with the Evaluation Checklist. So I passed. Found out later that rolling back 0.5 metre or more on the slope constitute a Immediate Failure. I probably didnt go more than 0.5 metres. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical 6</span><br>Coming soon<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>joo7,<br>Narrow plank what's most important is the speed. Must get it right, too slow sure run off course. Going fast is always better than slow, than step rear brake to play for time b4 coming down. Good luck to you.<br><br>sgboy2004,<br>My whole family are riders, younger brother started 1st ( no license la ), then my sister started learning (but now stopped at prac. 3) &amp; her bf recently just got his 2A license. But I dont want use their bike l2 earn &amp; be dependent on others to get my license. Some people might not like it too.<br><br>milkshake,<br>Thanks for sharing your records.

Pract 5 one and Pract 8 one. Pract 5 test you inside the circuit only, then Pract 8 both circuit and road. After pass Pract 8 then you can book for your TP already.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical 6</span><br>It's night riding so can only book it at night. 1st timers will be briefed on how to conduct pre-riding check. Failing to demostrate after briefing would be immediate failure. So pay attention. Next would be a long briefing by instructor again. He will ask you questions on traffic rules, things like chevron markings, broken white lines etc. Remember to read through them again if you've forgotten them after RTT. Even though there are a total of 9 stamps to be collected for this prac., basically there's nothing much to learn. Besides the whole lot of traffic rules to be familarised, this prac. doesnt test your skill but it's your general riding.<br>Take note here : (1)lane changing. Most students still cant do it correctly. When you want to do it fast, is not by turning the handle bar, but the throttle is most impt here. (2) close following distance in filter lane. It's not right to follow too closely &amp; it's dangerous.<br><br>1st time - fail. (1)Incorrect method of checking blind spot. (2)Priority at junction. It's not impossible to pass 1st time but you just need to know clearly what to do.<br><br>2nd time(2 days later) - fail. As I was down with fever, I had done even worst than the 1st time. Didnt stop at stop line, sometimes the checking of blind spot was as good as didnt check.<br><br>3rd time - pass. I took a ten days break. Luckily me, same instructor for these 3 times for the same practical.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical 7</span><br>Coming Soon</div>
