            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical 7</span><br>You will be thoroughly briefed on the class 2B test route. This test route is different from the road u go at prac. 6, so dont try remember pract. 6 route. This test route is much simplier, should be able to remember on 1st attempt. Try do your pre-riding check faster so tat u get park your bike behind instructor. You might even get to lead the road on the last few rounds. So if u make mistakes on 1st time u learn it, rather than make it at later stages. U-turn also not that tough, just relax, look out for traffic, dont dream.<br><br>1st time - fail. I was the first bike behind instructor &amp; was told to lead the last round. Still unfamiliar with the test route, almost went off course at times, but learnt alot from it. U-turn still going too wide.<br><br>2nd time - pass. Done it on the same day but this time at night. Last session, extremely smooth traffic. Was cruising most of the time. This time purposely do pre-ride check slowly, was the last bike in the pack. U-turn also no problem this time.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Road Revision</span><br>Same as road practical, cost $30 excluding GST. No detail briefing, just get your bike practise 2 rounds of circult first. Road is about 2 rounds then return back to driving school. If there's still time, do 1 more round of circult.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical 8</span><br>Coming soon...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical 8</span><br>As usual, do pre-ride check, 1 round circuit, after the last course which is the e-brake, wait for instructor by the side to bring u out to road for 1 round. When u come back it's the actual thing. This pract. u r allowed to chose your bike &amp; use it 4 the whole evaluation. Also they dont go according to tag number. Advise to 1st timers, no matter how confident u r, your 1st attempt dun be the 1st bike to go, coz u havent been through it. At some point of it u might not be sure what to do, so u might get nervous. Dont get intimidated if some guys tell u they went 4 times, 6 times or even more for the pract., coz if u r good, 1st time the instructor will also let u pass. Just believe in yourself.<br><br>1st time - fail, 24 demerit points. It was raining but there's no problem on circuit courses even if u r going slow. Was the 1st bike throughout the whole pract. Also 1st bike behind instructor for warm up lap on the road. Here I made mistakes coz he purposely proceed when the green arrow was flickering, i simply followed him. For two junctions I got cutthroat warnings by him. But I did it again on the actual evaluation, costing me 8 pts. Found out that we could actually sound the horn if any vehicles try to endanger us by not giving way.<br><br>2nd time - pass, 16 points. Usually there will be 6 students for this pract. First instructor will follow behind the 1st three students &amp; 2nd instructor will follow behind the another three students. So it's broken up into two groups. Try be the last bike (which is the 3rd) in the group, coz the instructor is directly behind u &amp; could clearly spot your mistakes. After the whole session, he will tell u  your mistakes that you dont even realise making.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Things that I just realised</span><br>6 points - Incorrect posture when moving off/ stopping. Didnt hold on to front brake after stopping. I simply hold rear brake &amp; rest my hand on rubber grip. Crank course never release clutch.<br>4 pts - Fail to check blind spot. Just coming out of filter lane, when changing from left to right lane, there's still need to check blind spot coz u r doing lane change. This is in circuit, where u just came back from road into the bike parking area.<br>4 pts - Give wrong signal. When doing a fast lane change dont check mirror, signal &amp; change lane at the same time. Make sure u see mirror( must show instructor la), signal, then move in.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Finally Waiting For TP**</span><br>To all those who have been reading this &amp; also to all those going through class 2B now, hope that I've provided enough insights on my learning.
