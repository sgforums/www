            <div class='col-md body'>I have been riding motorcycles for many many years now back even in those days when full face helmets were banned.<br><br>I have seen many bike accidents and also had my fair share of them too. I had friends who lost all their front teeth in accidents or had their chin smashed and deformed thereafter when they hit the road face down in an accident. Nobody rides a motorcycle facing backwards.<br><br>I have even been fined by the TP for wearing a full face helmet during those days when it was banned. And I kept on wearing it coz I value my life more than the stupid fine.<br><br>What amazes me is why today I still see people wearing open faced helmets when full face helmets are easily available and totally legal!! I shiver at the thought of what will happen to their pretty face and teeth in the event of an accident.<br><br>Like I said, I have been involved in 2 major accidents before and thanks to the full face helmet I wore, I can still smile at people today. If you can see the cracked and scraped chin guard fo the 2 helmets... you will understand why I wear full face helmets all the time.<br><br>Never never think that an accident won't happen to you. You may super safe in the way you ride but there are alot of dangerous people driving on the roads especially taxi drivers. All it takes is for them to make a mistake and you pay for it.<br><br>We as bikers, should be attired in a manner that would afford the best protection in the unfortunate event of an accident.<br><br>Some people think it is cool to wear an open faced helmet, especially those Harley wannabe Phantom riders. Just think how cool you look with your teeth all smashed in and mouth and lips torn and all bloodied up.<br><br>Ride smart. Ride safe.</div>

I myself am wearing a fullface.<br>but not agree with  you on your view with phantom rider. I am a phantom rider too, but not a Harley wannable. I am more interested in showow 750 but only can ride it in 2 years time becasue i just got my 2B. I have also see many phantom rider wearing fullface on the road.</div>

Quoting one incident is not enough as a proof to point out that there's no difference between full face and open face helmets. This way of thinking should be changed. Old timers should be the ones who comprehend the importance of wearing good quality full face and advise younger riders.<br><br>Talking about experience, I was involved in a full frontal collision with a van about 13 years ago. My face smashed the door of the van, managed to walk away with just a bleeding nose. When I took off my helmet, there was a long stretch of car paint on the visor (no intention to dramatize the situation, just want to describe the force of the impact). Things wouldn't be the same if I had worn an open face.</div>
