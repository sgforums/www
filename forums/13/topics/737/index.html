            <div class='col-md body'>When I was in secondary school, I was already thinking about riding bikes, especially sports bikes...I really had a strong affection about them.<br>My parents especially my mum is strongly against me taking 2B lessons. My dad also rides bike, he also hope i dun take.<br>In the end, I decided to take 2B lessons secretly and see how it goes, so I went to register when I reached my 18 birthday.<br>During the course of taking lessons, I spent lots of my own money, and my mum was suspecting me. In the end, I owned up. After a whole night of arguing and discussions with my parents, they allowed me to finish my 2B lessons.<br>After I got my liscense, comes another problem, dun let me buy bike. Then after a few days of pestering them, they agreed..but then they disagree on me getting a sports bike!! wtf...my dad wants me to get Phantom or something like tat...so I had to talk cork abt Phantom too heavy ah...all these...then if I buy the bike I like, more likely I would do a better job maintaining it.<br>In the end, I got myself a 2nd hand 1 yr old SP. Starting, I felt like I am blessed, got so many near accidents, but I always managed to siam the cars or watever to prevent collions.<br>But now wat happened to me? When I ride fast, nothing happens, now when I ride slow..I got myself into an accident and coz my gf to suffer injuries...<br>So think abt it again, bikes are really fragile on the road, and always on the losing end. I am not discouraging u abt getting a bike, coz I myself had been in ur situation and I opposed my parents.<br>Come to think of it, I would have lost not juz my life, but my gf's life too....for a dream of riding a bike....</div>
