            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, know what?  its not happening just here, even over at the Chit Chat forums and some others, there are new nicks which appear out of no where with little posts and they are starting to post racist/religious/nonsense subjects.  I am quite certain they are either the work of one person, or a few of the same group.<br><br>I am not surprised.  With the revelation that there ARE terrorist activities in Sg, and religious extremists all surfacing, we are bound to see some monkeys (monkey see, monkey do).<br><br>Like I said in the Chit Chat forum, the best we can do is to simply ignore their posts, do not even respond.  Let their posts sink by itself, or let them talk among themselves.  Just don't fall into their trap and start flaming each other, that is exactly what they want us to do! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
