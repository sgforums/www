He's more like those cannot make it motorsiao who misex around with lotsa SP150 rather than a true breed trackster.<br><br>But I also found that the RS250 is the last batch for 2002. No more RS250 for 2003. The 2 strokes were axed out slowly.  The last to be axed for 250 is aprilia. But its surely a wonderful if you know how to use. RS250 is an extrememly easy bike to ride, great fun to ride on any RS250 from the earlier models to the final models. I really enjoyed my RS250 last time. But the maintenance is also shocking. Better be extra cautious when buying. Not easy to maintain.</div>
