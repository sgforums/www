Tat guy buang in order to avoid colliding with e taxi tat suddenly charge out, and not becoz of cornering. u tot wat, realli so bei zat meh!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Singapore very big meh, still need to emphaise North,South,East,West..........Don't tell me u noe the roads and bends very well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> </span></span></div></blockquote>People go petrol station for wat ah? For me I go to pump petrol! Not to challenge people ok? U want a challenge? Ask for it! Dun blow blow like kids or speed up from behind and cut people's lane, endanger yourself and others! People dun make friends in this way... U wanna challenge wait till we all go on road then u come lah, people resting at petrol station smoking,drinking then u all go out lap lap. I never accept your challenge that night, thats because I'm drinking/smoking, I did not expect TZR to go. Btw that bend only got 2 lanes where your taxi charge out? Sibei zai why avoid taxi until go towards wall? I did not mock, I asked them "Play lah, very nice to play right?"    That night I never play with they all because I dun even give a damn. I blow at them because that guy fall in the middle of the bend,infront of me. Do u know how dangerous is it? Honestly he fall his problem ok, I personally think its not worth to lend a helping hand, fall at middle of bend u got think of oncomming traffic or not? Somemore your Indian friend and my TZR friend still playing infront, who knows wat will happen to them? Of course I care about my own friend lah, stop to help for wat? His accident is caused SOLELY by himself ok. Tell u lah, u all stop at road shoulder also dangerous enough lah, my friend's car approaching the bend see u all liao also shocked lah. Why suddenly got people standing at the bend.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seriously, is this site all about encouraging ppl to race ON PUBLIC ROAD?<br><br>Moderator: instead of curbing the racist's comments &amp; childish racing on roads, u are actually suggesting that it's ok to play on the road even though in the watsoever "sportingly" attitude u are referring to.<br><br>There is nothing proud to say about playing for fun or for spite. Your forum is called Race Trace, not Race Roads. Shdnt you be encouraging track racing instead?<br><br>No wonder every non-riders hated bikers. All this stupid childish playing are disgracing for bikers. Yes its COMMON to tend to "play along" when we are physically on the road, but is there a need to do encouragement ON THE NET? to let youngsters fantasize about being the singapore "andy lau"?<br><br>Instead of telling that i have frens who do this, race that, kup here, wheelie there... why not i tell how some of them hitted cars as they are unable to stop in time and have to go ard borrowing money to pay for the insurance excess and bike repairs due to their own stupid acts? Or hitted innocent ah pek standing by the side of the road and the ah pek was hurted but diam diam limped away?<br><br>But its not something bad about having a site like tat... at least u all posted ur outing plans here and who's going, who's not. The tps will have an easy time to scoop up those "andy lau wannabes". Good luck to all your outing tiuz...</div>
