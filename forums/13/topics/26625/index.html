            <div class='col-md body'>They got so many people still not enough help? I can't imagine stopping and help them. They wanted this and the one that fall may be us, and they will be the cause of the accident. Do u think they will help?<br><br>How to approach them? Don't u think its stupid since they started everything themselves? Play themselves nevermind, cut our lane so fiercely. 8 bikes moving together cutting 3 bike's lane, who's in a more dangerous position?They are puting our lives at risk and u expect us to go help them?<br><br>Actually we had done our part to help by slowing down so much before the bend. If they have the brains to think, they should know its too dangerous to play.</div>
