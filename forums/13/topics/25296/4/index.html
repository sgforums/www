We didn't even wanna ask about it to avoid any embarrassment.<br><br>Wow.. really admire the pathetic fool in the picture, who had to make do with hanging with his own friends, while his gf is out there having Who-Knows-What kind of fun with some other guys...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Amazing thing is.. the boyfriend does know about it, well done! haha I guess it is the typical of 'If you love her, give her the freedom', 'if you love her, respect her friends', 'I just want her to be happy' the kinda crappy stuffs to sugar-coat the fact that he is some backboneless wimp that is ever so 'understanding and noble'.<br>But he himself did admit he doesn't feel comfortable with that, wow... what a wonderful boyfriend! Compromising his own happiness for some b*tch's happiness. He must have really worshipped the ground his goddess walked on man! he must be the kind that will allow the gf to slap him a few times, and still jump around in joy because of the attention she had given him<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Good Luck Fool!<br><br>Well well, if the gf really in her words, 'loves' the boyfriend, will she put him through this kind of uneasiness and embarrassment?

Then again, I shouldn't insult those grandmothers, so I shall take back what I just said. Anyway, as I said, sometimes, the b*tches really made me wonder hard...... to quote someone: 'Wow, if I ever see her naked, I don't think I can control myself....'<br>'...most probably I will foam, puke and go into spasm.'<br><br>Interesting world, isn't it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm sorry to interrupt,... just like to know... if ure gf gets pillion by her friends... which u are not familiars with them? As a guy of cos we would gib her freedom to do what they wish ... But! but what if... something was to happened? If she got into a very serious accident with her "friends" or what if this frenz of hers intro her to another group of friends... ... and these group of frenz so happened to dope her... and took advantage of her... .. its like no matter how much precautions girls take... if bad things were purposely planned or done by those lamer out there.... it would be a history that cannot be changed... it would be a relationship which cannot be saved, it would be a a great price to be paid not by her only but by those who are ard her. And makes thing worst... if all these "BAD" things lead to one unwanted pregnancy... sigh/.<br><br>Just wanna say is,... its a fact that girls always are on the advantage side in a relationship. But that would only be applied to a strong love relationship. But then again they should learn to be more mature. Nothings come perfect. You have to work for it. If you do not wish your bf to pillion other girls... you shouldn't be a pillion of some other guys bike. It takes two hand to clap in a relationship. If both side dun make the effort then basically... its not a love to start with or a relationship to drag on. Think about it. You dun ask for respect u earn it. How u wanna be treated,lt will be how you gonna treats your pple ard you. Peace. Hope i dun offend anyone with what ive said.</div>

And makes thing worst... if all these "BAD" things lead to one unwanted pregnancy... sigh/.<br><br>Just wanna say is,... its a fact that girls always are on the advantage side in a relationship. But that would only be applied to a strong love relationship. But then again they should learn to be more mature. Nothings come perfect. You have to work for it. If you do not wish your bf to pillion other girls... you shouldn't be a pillion of some other guys bike. It takes two hand to clap in a relationship. If both side dun make the effort then basically... its not a love to start with or a relationship to drag on. Think about it. You dun ask for respect u earn it.
