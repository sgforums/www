            <div class='col-md body'>Me, I think when you are attached to another person you have certain responsibilities to fulfil lor. You are no longer single liao leh. Cannot anyhow go around doing things like you are still single without consideration for your other half. Maybe there are ppl out there who will disagree with me but my actions are always geared toward: Will she like it if I do this? Will I like it if she does this back to me? In general I think that the "Do unto others" rule works pretty well in a relationship.<br><br>So you ask her lor, will she like it if you pillion another girl behind her back? sneaky sneaky like that. If she say yes, then well, you have to decide if this is the kind of girl you want to take as a gf or wife. Unless you want to change her or change yourself, which warrants a whole new thread...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>storm</div>

Come on, we know how practical and xian shi the world is, don't we?<br><br>Maybe people can say: we are just friends wad... nothing wrong with that, well, the definition of just friends? Hahaa.. hard to say huh... and how much can you trust the 'friend' of your girlfriend? I've seen examples of girls being pillion around by guys who they claimed as their 'good friends', 'friends only', when they themselves know that the guys who pillion them are actually fond of them. Well if thats the case, aren't they tryin to lead the guy on? And which guy with a sound mind would allow his girlfriend to go out ever so often with a guy who is interested in the girlfriend? Well either the guy is really confident of himself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> , or that he really trusts his girlfriend  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  or the other guy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> that much. All I can say is.. hahaha fool, good luck!<br><br>But i assume in some scenerios, some guys just take their gf as some kind of goddess and ever so afraid that they might lose them if they don't grant them any freedom, haha whats the difference between a dog and the bf?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  The difference is.. the dog has more respect and attention from the gf! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> As much as the girlfriend is a bitch, the other guy is an asshole, the bf is also a fool to begin with to allow such things to happen, isn't it.<br><br>I have seen this funny incident, which nearly made me burst out laughing... it happened last year, when this couple went out with a big group, and the day before, the gf was pillioned by this guy who rides a big bike and interested in her. There they are sitting there, pretending they don't know each other well, and just acquaintances, when everyone else knew this girl is always pillioned out by someone else..
