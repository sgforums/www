            <div class='col-md body'>After reading your post that you may be looking for a new car soon, I would like to offer my suggestion.  I am a Mercedes and BMW fanatic.  Sorry! I don't fancy sport car since I don not think they are safe and practical enough.<br><br>Yes, a BMW is certainly an excellent choice provided that you have the budget for that type of car.  The Z3 is nice, but the body is not rigid enough.  As a result, the body flexes so much that the handling is a dissapoinment by BMW standards.  In addition, over the long-term, you will hear many squeaks and rattles, since the body will flex even more as the car gets older.  I don't know about you, but it annoys me like hell if I constantly hear those rattling in the car.<br><br>The Audi TT is a beauty, but I wouldn't buy that car for another year or two.  The reason is that they found out that the car has too much aerodynamic lift at the rear-end of the car at high speed.  There have already been a serious accident reported where the TT rear-end lifted so much during high speed travelling at the German Authobahn that the car flipped over, and the driver was killed.  As I read, Audi has recognized the problem and is now fixing it by adding thicker stabilizer bar and a rear spoiler to reduce rear-end lift.<br><br>If you really like BMW, I would go for the new 323i 2 door coupe or the 4 door sedan.  The six cylinders 2.5 litres 192hp engines is a "sweet sweet" thing.  It runs and sounds like a jet engine at high rpm.  Basically, the engine sounds so "sweet" that you constantly would want to rev the engine to its limits.  It never feel stress and sound like you can run over the engine speed limits.  Ohhh lala!  I am drooling here as I am typing.  HAHA!  And, it gives good value for the money since it comes with so many high-tech stuff in the car.  I think the 3 series coipue or sedan gives the best sporty handling and good ride while giving good practicality.  The 328i is nicer but I think the very slight power advantage it has is not worth the extra $10,000 over the 323i(here in Canada).<br><br>Hope my advice is helpful to you!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thnx man. Took note of your comments. Anyway just one bad news, my BMW was trashed by my sis who had just gotten her license and let a tree kiss my BMW. Sigh... I guess it's bye-bye forever to my car. Luckily she wasn't injured other than a few scratches...<br><br>Going to C&amp;C tomorrow to have a look at other cars. I wonder if you've got any Mercs to recommend too. Perhaps, a Mercedes SLK? Or something that have a little more horsepower/kick to go along the CTE/SLE?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u can give the Honda S2000 a try. it is definitely one of the best cars in the market rite now.. good handling, u name it, she has it.. i'm not sure if the SLK is stil facing a demand over supply situation, mayb u can try asking at C&amp;C.<br><br>i agree wif wat Money &amp;Power has posted, the BMW 323i 2 door coupe is a beauty too and value for money..<br><br>------------------<br><br>who else but me......<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Jeff!<br><br>Sorry to read that you BMW was totaled.  Hope that your sis will recover from her injury and shock soon.<br><br>Mercedes....mmmmm!  What can I say!  It's the best engineered car, aside from BMW, you can buy in the market these days.  It's a benchmark for other cars out there to compare.  It's a real masterpiece.<br><br>Don't buy the year 2000 SLK yet.  I read that the SLK will have some revisions in the year 2001.  Mainly, there will be some minor facelifts to the body and the bumper.  More importantly, they will replace the noisy 4-cylinder supercharged engine with a new 3.2L V6 218hp engine that is much much more smoother and quieter than the 4-cylinder engine.  The SLK is far far more rigid than the BMW Z3.  Also, like any other Mercedes, the safety features incorporate into the car is immensed - many many times safer than any other convertibles out there.  However, as you know, like any other Mercedes products, it's more of a touring car than a sport car.  Meaning, it's car more for cruising in a relax manner than a car that you throw around the bend.<br><br>If you can't wait, and you must have a "sport" Mercedes, I would recommend the<br>year 2000 CLK 320.  There have already been some changes to it for the year 2000, namely revised bumper skirts, additional turn signal indicators on the side view mirrors and better looking wheels.  I think in Singapore, you have CLK 200, CLK 230 and CLK 320.  I would certainly avoid the CLK 200 and the CLK 230.  It's powered by a 4-cylinder engine.  The CLK 200 engine is sluggish and noisy.  The CLK 230 supercharge engine is very powerful but noisy.  The CLK 320 engine is powerful and smooth.  But that depends on how much money you want to spend.  The CLK 320 is more expensive than the CLK 230 and CLK 200.  If you do not want to spend over board, I say settle for the CLK 230 if you do not mind about the noise.  But, again, it's no sports car.  Unlike BMW, it feels very isolated just like any other Mercs.  But it does gives an excellent high speed stability and composure.<br><br>If you do not mind about 4 door sedan, a C-Class is a good choice.  But don't buy it yet, since the new C-Class will be here in 2001.  The C-Class offers the typical Mercedes sense of solidity and reliability.  Again, it does not have the handling of a BMW, but it does seem to build to last a long time.  Also, compare to BMW 3 series, it does give slightly better high speed composure and stability.<br><br>One last thing I would like to add is that what ever Mercedes model you choose to buy, no cars out there can compare to the Mercedes sense of solidity. You will know what I mean if you have driven one.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>time to get a new car huh? lucky guy......one of the best times in life is to got car shopping.<br><br>anywayz i personally think that the S2000 is way overpriced. Last i heard Kah Motors asking about 212K for it.......i think they marked up the price by about 20 thou or something......so that they have a "prestige sports model" in their line up or something like that.<br><br>If i were in your shoes (and i wish i were), i would go for a turbo'd sports car.....still young you see. GTR is a good choice, i think there are only about 2 or three here, i may be wrong.<br><br>Also, the Mitsubishi EVO VI is another choice, but its a bit loud. I read somewhere that Mitsubishi is going to discontinue the Evoultion series cos the WRC rules changed or something, so the EVO may become a collector's item.<br><br>Or may i suggest importing an unavailable model thru its agent or a parrellel importer.<br><br>Anyway, good luck!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry Jeff:<br><br>I would like to correct the information I posted.  The BMW new 323i 2.5 litre engine is a 170hp engine.  It's used to be 192 hp with the last generation 325i.  Now, only the new 328i 2.8 litre engine is rated with 192hp.<br><br>Despite the drop in hp of the 2.5 litre, it is still a very lustful engine.  The performance difference between the 323i and the 328i is very marginal.<br><br>The 2.3 litre supercharge engine of the SLK 230 and CLK 230 is rated at 190 hp I think.  I think the SLK 230 will get you from 0 - 100km/h in 6.8 seconds or 7.1 seconds.  I am not too sure about the CLK 230 but I think it's around there.  Fast!  The CLK 320 is around the same, but it does the work in a much relax manner.<br><br>I wil go home tonight and check the brochures I have with reagrds to the acceleration time of the Mercedes and BMW 3-series and let you know more tommorrow.<br><br>Regards,<br>M&amp;P<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't really know much about the Honda S2000.  But I do know that its price is slightly higher than the Merc SLK 230.  The Honda folding rooftop is pmade of plastic and the rear windshield is made plastic.  Whereas, the Merc. folding rooftop is made of metal and the rear windshield is made of glass.<br><br>The Honda 2 litre 4-cylinder (230hp?) engine is willing.  However, it's intentonally made as a high revving engine.  Meaning, you must rev the engine to somewhere between 6500 rpm and 8000 rpm to extract its maximum potential.  It's quite a laborious process.  Moreover, it's difficult to accelerate to that engine speed all the time in the city with cars and traffc lights.  You may also attract unwanted police attention at that engine speed and noise.<br><br>It's still a nice car.  I totally agree with fingers about it's handling.  It handles much better than the SLK and Z3.<br><br>In short, it really depends on what one wants from a car - some wants sporty, some wants noise and all that high rpm, some like<br>relax crusing, etc...<br><br>Regards,<br>M&amp;P<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the honda s2000 offers the best bhp-per-litre, but like m&amp;p said, the high revving engine's a minus. i think the fiat coupe 2.0 offers the best value for money, you get about a 220 bhp 2 litre engine and pininfarina styling for just 160k, but the handling's a little raw. i've been eyeing that for a long while but the test-drive put me off. the audi TT is indeed a stunner, but i dont know the technical bits, so going by what m&amp;p says you shouldn't buy it yet. if you've got the money, why not get a BMW Z8? at 400 bhp you'll be able to outrun any lians who try to race you.<br>i hate it when subaru-driving bengs with floodlights and revvy engines try to scare me when i drive my dad's car, a VW passat. one day i'll buy a cheap 10-year-old porsche, modify the engine in JB and destroy them all!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well guys, went to C&amp;C and other places to check out other cars but I guess I had my record time at Performance Motors checking out those BMWs. Sigh... Wonder when is the M5 coming. I heard that there are several advance orders being placed already and though I've heard much hype around it for the power, I won't know until I've driven one myself.<br><br>Nissan Skyline? It's quite a beauty with power to match. Looking at it certainly makes me drool over the power. As compared to the M5, I wouldn't know much about it already if we were to put a Skyline and an M5 to race at Pasir Gudang. As a supporter of German cars, I would say that M5 would probably beat the Skyline! (No offence, Japanese Car lovers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">)<br><br>Well Suzi, I don't know if you've a bad case of getting your beloved car stolen (think of the money gone!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">) but the best solution to prevent a car being stolen is to park it at the open carpark (especially if u're staying lower levels HDB) below yur house, clamp your steering wheel and install an EXTREMELY noisy alarm which the people living across the causeway can hear it. The only complete solution probably is to get a wheel clamp to clamp the wheels too!<br><br>I didn't have any experience with stolen cars but rather P-plate Ah Bengs and Lians (especially Lians) trying to race me previously. The trick is not to get ahead of them but HOW to LURE them up the expressway so that you can show em some really neat tricks which will bring em down FLAT! Finish them off in the long run as I would say.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Never thought I'd meet fans of Need For Speed here! I am a big fan too but am now currently playing the 3rd part of NFS as my system is pretty old (a 166MMX). Anybody got any idea if u can run NFS4 on a 166MMX WITHOUT graphics accelerator? Thinking of getting that game (hopefully my car) for my Christmas!<br><br>Thanks a zillion in advance  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
