[/b]I really feel your pain.  Honest.  Your experience reminds me of mine some 6 years ago, before we meet.  And as for nismoS132's advice/comment that this fear would pass, I surely hope NOT.<br><br>Learn from your mistakes as I have.  Eventually this is all we can do after we survive a (near fatal) crash like this.  Honestly if you fully recover (forget) from this crash you are bound to experience it again!<br><br>But as they say, "Even the best will crash".

            <div class='col-md body'>Your fear should subside after some time.  Time is a good doctor that heals many things.  My advice...<br><br>Admit that there are many things in life that is beyond our control. That is reality.  We've got to understand that being mad about some issues and venting it out may prove to be futile, sometimes even counter productive.<br><br>Or worst if you bottle it up in side you too long you may die a really lonely death.  Now the smartest thing to do is to focus on healing yourself.  If you notice just about everyone you meet will go through some kind of calamity, some even more often than others.<br><br>But I think there are two kinds of people, achievers and the losers.  You can tell the achievers by their REACTION.  Those who CHOOSE to break through and make a difference in their lives, and those who constantly complain and blame others for their Â“luckÂ” or Â“fateÂ”.<br><br>Basically you have to choose between living your dreams or break down and fade away.  Do choose wisely my friend.<br><br>Cheers.<br>(I am beginning to talk like Ms. GohÂ…)</div>
