            <div class='col-md body'>hi everyone, sorry for the recent RVF barrage. i've consulted my RVF friend, btw he's some guy who wrenches his own bike for track use. the words with "&gt;" is what i said to him, and the rest are replies... as far as technical knowledge goes, i really trust this guy, and he's using this mod on his own bike. no problems....<br><br>FRANCIS!!! read the thing about the one headlight thing!!<br><br>SARAH! read and tell francis!!!  :p<br><br>&gt;what exactly goes wrong with it?<br>Commercialization.<br><br>&gt;how do you tell?<br>Mild defect - weak voltage reading across battery terminals, via multimeter. We need to rev the machine. Get it changed fast.<br><br>Serious Defect - Main fuse blows, bye bye Mr Rect. Until a new one is put on, machine gets stuck where Rect gets roosted. If your far away fm Sg, goodluck!<br><br>Corroded, oxidised connections btw rect and connector = resistance. Wires start melting.<br><br>A damaged rect basically kills the only way how excess voltages are dump, putting the stator/coil at risk.<br><br>&gt;Solve the problem<br>Pentium P3 heatsink, thermal compound btw mating surfaces of heatsink and rect, plus cooling fan. relocation of rect fm "HOT" spots to somewhere cooler, if the stock wiring harness allows.<br><br>Tell your mates :<br>NOT to cut the wires leading to the socket of the rect, rather clean the contact points periodically.<br><br>Keep a spare rect if riding overseas.<br><br>Relocate the rect to the rear, LHS, under the pillion seat.<br><br>Put on a HUGE heatsink, and a fan(connected via rear tailights 12v source).<br><br>That it doesn't matter putting on a SRAD rect.<br><br>That if the rect is well and good now, it doesn't mean it remains the same way tomorrow in stock trim. It WON'T. (check nc30 forum for references. Everyone gets it! Honda is a cash cow I tell ya!)<br><br>That having one headlight off, they make the rect work harder since there is more excess volatges to dump now.<br><br>The stator/coil is part of the alternator that stays. The other integral part of an alternator is the rotor, which spins since it's connected to one end of the crankshaft. Stator/Coil + Magneto/Rotor = Alternator.<br>Part of the alternator, yes. Alternator, No.<br><br>------------------<br>rock hard... ride free...</div>
