            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Before a long haul of a trip, there are a few things I would strongly recommend you to do.<br><br>1.   Replace your engine oil and oil filter. No need the synthetic kind unless you are riding like Valentino Rossi and redlining the bike most of the times.<br><br>2.   Replace or if not at least carry spare spark plugs with you.<br><br>3.   Check brake pads wear, especially the front as 70% of your stopping power comes from there which is why they wear out faster than the rear.<br>And mind you, you will probably be going fast at some point of the trip.... that might be a time you don't want to find you have fading front brakes.<br><br>4.   Check the wear on your drive chain, replace it if it is almost worn to its limits. Drive chain wear tends to accelerate when it is nearing the end of its useful life.<br><br>5.   Carry a can of chain lube with you. Long distance riding plus rain plays havoc with chain lubricants. Dry chain equals friction equals heat equals melt sealed grease within O ringed chains equal wear equals elongation.<br><br>6.   Install a fuel filter if your bike does not have one. Malaysian fuel is dirty. Trust me... I know. Stripping your carburettor to pieces or trying to figure out the fuel injection system in the middle of the NS Highway is no fun.<br><br>7.   Carry a raincoat. Riding wet for half an hour around Singapore is OK, for longer than that, cramps can set in especially on the fingers. Whilst trying to e-brake to avoid colliding into the back of a palm oil tanker is not the time to find out that the fingers on your right hand have got the cramps.<br><br>8   Avoid following closely or riding alongside tankers and trailers, especially empty ones. The empty ones normally go fast. In an emergency brake... the backend of the rig will tend to fish tail, more so if it is empty, good luck to you if you are close behind or right beside them, you will be smacked off the road like a housefly.<br><br>9.   Carry only bills lesser denominations than RM10 in your wallet, The big notes stash some in your pants or elsewhere. When stopped by the dirty Malaysian cops, and they want coffee money from you.... show them your wallet and say you got not much money left and can give only offer them mebbe RM10 or RM20 only. Needless to say you are a dumbass if you carry stacks of hundred dollar bills in your wallet.<br><br>10.   Plan your trip rest points. Never rush. Book your accomodations in advance. It is no fun riding round in circles in the rain looking for accomodation at night in a strange place especially after you have been riding the whole day and just want to bathe and rest. You will feel like killing people at that time.<br><br>11.   Ride smart. Ride safe.</div>

Unequal elongation of the chain will occur. How you know?? Rhythmic grinding sound heard as you ride even when you pull in the clutch and let the bike coast.<br><br>2.   Unequal elongation will lead to stretching of the chain as a whole. Cutting off one or two links to shorten the chain to make it usable is the stupidest thing you can do. Due to the change in pin distance on the chain plates, the chain will not sit snugly in the sprocket but rather on the forward side of the sprocket teeth. This will result in the wear on the forward portion of the teeth and result in one directioned wavy looking sprocket teeth. This will cause the chain to slip or at worse jump off the sproket. Jumping off the sprocket will cause the chain to jam the rear wheel which will be like stomping on the rear brake pedal to fully lock the rear wheel. Not funny if you doing 120kmh on the highway or worse still when you are trying to overtake the chio bu on the scrambler.<br><br>I maintain my own bikes and service them myself.

I buy everything else but that.</div></blockquote>From what you have described about the grinding noise from your bike, a new chain is not optional... it is mandatory.<br><br>Your bike chain is going to give up soon. Just remember that grinding sound is coming from your engine sprocket. It is wearing out because the chain is not sitting snugly on the teeth. Soon you will not be replacing the chain only, you will be replacing the sprockets too, and trust me... it is cheaper to replace chains. And if your engine sprocket is already damaged by a worn chain... it will damage your new chain real fast.<br><br>That is why alot of people always complain that the chain on a new bike seem to be able to last longer than the replacement chain. These people need to take a look at the engine sprocket and alot of them have never looked at them. Engine sprockets tend to rotate 4 or 5 times more than the rear sprocket so they wear out faster.<br><br>What you want with a new touring jacket for??<br><br>So you look cool standing on the roadside of the North South Highway next to your bike with the broken drive chain?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
