            <div class='col-md body'>Mini-circuit need to be in gear 3 meh?  I understand that one need to be in gear 2 after moving off, but I dun remember shifting to gear 3.  Anyhoo, if the circuit gets too congested, dun shift to gear 3.  Moving slowly on gear 2 is as good as gear 1, hardly able to stall.<br><br>U always need to use ur own intiative.. dun always follow by the book.  Later when u get out of the circuit to practice hi/lo stopping, the intructor will tell u to stop from the 4th gear.  Dun be surprised if traffic condition only allows you to ride at 2nd gear only! So just stop in 2nd gear and pretend to keep kicking the gear down lor.</div>
