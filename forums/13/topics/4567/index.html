            <div class='col-md body'>On nite shift tonite. Turned into BKE with a van ahead of me. But we were doing about 100km/h on the right most lane. Then this car came up behind me ... and was coming a bit too close for my comfort. He kept the close distance or a while until the van decided to move off to the left lane. Then I opened throttle to 120km/h, and pulled some distance between me and the car behind. But think he still not satisfied and came up behind me again, close. So I found a spot and moved off to the left, and he sped off at about 130 ~ 150 km/h. Then some distance ahead, I caught some red-blue flashing lights ... I was aorund 110km/h, so I braked quickly. The guy infront ... sighh ... too late liao ...<br><br>Then, after getting into PIE from KJE ... it happened ....I was in the filter lane from PIE exit 24 getting to Jurong West Ave 2 .... Single lane ... there's a super 4 infront of me .... my speed was about 90+ km/h. Then suddenly, a flash in my left mirror ... Before Iknew it, a white car was beside me, and really really close. The f*.k din even brake when he came in. And the f*.k was probably doing something like 160 and above. So he sort of brushed past me ... and I was kind of shocked .... then the super 4 in front ... I horned ... but the f*.k was so close behind the super 4 before he started braking .... think the clearance was only centimetres .... fortunately, din crash into the Super 4. The Super 4 was carrying a gal pillion and was doing about 90km/h also when this f*.k came along. Then the 3 of us stop at traffic light ... I took a look at the f*.k ... he was smiling ... shit ! ... He was SMILING ! .... Damned .... I dun know much about cars ... But I think it's a white Honda SiR .... Damned .....</div>
