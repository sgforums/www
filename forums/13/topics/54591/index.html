Just wanna say drive car oso dangerous, ride bike oso dangerous, but 1 adv of bikes is that its much more convenient than cars, when you ride your bike out you will know why. Furthermore, if your age is bout 19-22, it is much more affordable. Most bikers have their own passion for riding even though we have to absorb sunlight and rain water. Most impt is in which you prefer. May the force be Wif you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dangerous or not depend on all road user themselves, when accident involved, it can be a rider or driver fault, when on road i believe most season rider or driver can see that some rider tends to ride faster than and near the car plus like to cut in and out even thou they know it will endanger their life, driver on the other hand tends to turn abrupt out of the sudden or changing lanes without signalling or signal at the last min. All above mentioned may result other road user not able to react in time.<br><br>so end of the day, it depend on the road user whether they can ride or drive consciously.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with SingaporeTyrannosaur.. furthermore, even if a bike rider r very cautious on the road, they may still get into fatal accident becoz they cannot prevent other people especially those driving car from banging onto them.. heavy vehicle just need to give u a light bang and the whole bike will lost control liao.. so very dangerous... if u suey suey met those drunk or bo license driver then u die liao..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
