            <div class='col-md body'>atom, are u aiming to get ur class 2A or 2 later on?<br><br>If yes, my advice, get a ah-peh bike to ride first.<br>Ah-peh bikes:-<br>1.) Honda CG-125<br>2.) Suzuki GN-125<br>3.) Yamaha, RXK, RXZ (earlier models)<br>4.) etc, etc.<br><br>Why?<br>1.) It is cheaper. In terms of bike price, insurance, etc.<br>2.) If u buang, u dun feel the pinch. can't be said if u buang a SP, and the fairing goes everywhere.<br>3.) If worst come to worst, u want to scrap, also dun feel the pinch also.<br>4.) It is more fuel economical.<br><br>My experience.<br>When I got my class 2B, my mind was already set to get a 400cc bike. So I  rode on my dad's honda CG-125.<br><br>Yeh, I look ugly, no doubt. If u happen to see a gorilla riding on a bike during 2000 o 2001. Thats me. But thats only for 1 year. After which, I got my class 2A, scrap my class 2B bike and got myself a 400cc bike. Now, I have passed my class 3 planning to take up Class 2.<br><br>So just bear wif it for awhile then u got a powerful bike to ride liao.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>come to think of it... there are very few class 2B sports bike on the road liao hor?<br><br>these 2 days tried to take note while riding. didn't even see any TZM's. if there is sports bike, then most likely its a KIPS.<br><br>I ride phantom 200. very smooth pickup, very fuel ecomomic (abt $12 for every 300km) and doesn't look dat ah-pek. <strong>Problem is</strong> pickup a bit slow, the original IRC tyres sucks (have to change), cannot corner too fast, top speed abt 95-105kmh, and of course, it's everywhere. Would recommend it as a beginner's bike.<br><br>I tried out my fren's Piaggio X9. Very nice bike.. easy to control, very smooth n quite fast pickup, a lot of boot space for your stuff, no gears scooter. but think it's a 2A bike rite?<br><br>kinda agree Octega.. altho u dun have to go to dat extreme as CG-125.. haha.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The few common 2B ferring bikes to date are quite limited.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yamaha TZM / TZR </span>(older version of TZM) : Mostly are thrashed and a few of them are illegally modified with through pipe (means if caught by TP means $500 to the govt).<br><br>And the price is more exp compared to KRR and SP, even though the bike is quite old. But said to be the fastest amongst all 2B bikes.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Honda NSR150SP</span> : Alot of them also already thrashed liao, very few with favourable engine condition. Looks nicer than a KRR (at least to me), price higher than a KRR generally (depending on vehicle plate), but cheaper than TZM. Stock bikes can go up to 180 kph (or less? I ain't sure, somewhere around there). And Honda parts are generally cheaper.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kawasaki KRR150</span> : Light bike, thus its pickup is slightly better. (Used to ride a KRR) Relatively cheaper and newwer than SP, 2nd hand bike can get at less than 3K. Cheapest than TZM and SP generally. But it also means the bike has no resale value.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Honda CBR150</span> : 4-stroke machine, pickup slowest compared to the above. A light mahine too. But it's definitely more fuel-efficient than the rest.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aprilia RS125</span> : Has new and 2nd hand bikes. First hand bike is very exp, can get a brand new Super 4, 2nd hand is very cheap, but the engine and outlook conditionmay not be favourable anymore. Nice bike with nice posture to corner, but pickup is quite slow compared to TZM, SP and KRR.<br><br>Italian bike, aka high maintanence bike, even a mirror by itself costs $80. Not recommended if you have a budget.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm about the vibration of the bikes in SSDC i tink it is due to poor maintaince and oso abuse of the machine.. because i haf actually rode on a few of the CG125 which actually i dun feel the vibration.. and it actually feels more powerful, not like the other bike which vibrate so much.. i dunno hw to describe the feeling.. but i jus turn the trottle and half clutch the bike move effortlessly.. the rest of the bikes dere always vibrate alot.. when moving offf... not smooth.. izzit my skill or jus the bike?</div>

I sounded alittle hash... I apologize.<br><br>Anyway, the 2 bikes. Depends on individual likings la. Getting either bike will be  good but remember. Get a good working condition which can last you at least 1000km.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i would recommend you to go for Honda cub, either Wave or Sonic. Reason is they r reliable, fuel-friendly, lastly most importantly they r nicer in design and spare parts is easy to come by.<br></div>
