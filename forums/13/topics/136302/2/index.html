But said to be the fastest amongst all 2B bikes.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Honda NSR150SP</span> : Alot of them also already thrashed liao, very few with favourable engine condition. Looks nicer than a KRR (at least to me), price higher than a KRR generally (depending on vehicle plate), but cheaper than TZM. Stock bikes can go up to 180 kph (or less? I ain't sure, somewhere around there). And Honda parts are generally cheaper.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kawasaki KRR150</span> : Light bike, thus its pickup is slightly better. (Used to ride a KRR) Relatively cheaper and newwer than SP, 2nd hand bike can get at less than 3K. Cheapest than TZM and SP generally. But it also means the bike has no resale value.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Honda CBR150</span> : 4-stroke machine, pickup slowest compared to the above. A light mahine too. But it's definitely more fuel-efficient than the rest.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aprilia RS125</span> : Has new and 2nd hand bikes. First hand bike is very exp, can get a brand new Super 4, 2nd hand is very cheap, but the engine and outlook conditionmay not be favourable anymore. Nice bike with nice posture to corner, but pickup is quite slow compared to TZM, SP and KRR.<br><br>Italian bike, aka high maintanence bike, even a mirror by itself costs $80. Not recommended if you have a budget.</div></blockquote>Hey.. Would like to check regarding prices of these bikes <strong>2nd hand:</strong><br><br>Honda CG-125<br>Aprilia RS125<br>Honda CBR 150<br><br>Anyone noes the 2nd hand price for these 2?

Can put box some more, very convenient.<br><br>After 2 years, get 2A and trade in the bike. This way, you won't lose too much hard earned money.<br>I had a SP for 30 months before switching to Super 4.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi,.<br>if ur looking for performance,i would like to recommend u kips,150.<br>result show that this bike won many illegal drag race.result doesnt lie.<br>And if u wanna buy it,buy second hand,coz if u wanna sell it,shop take very low...So than u wont lose so much,the best if u could carry on installment.this would save u hundreds,maybe thousands.....Anyway there are many spare parts in johor.so u did not need to worry abt parts.<br>Some says its the rider who win the race,but without a trusted bike/horse,u can't win easily.<br><br>And if ur looking for a budget bike,i would recomend u ybr125.its the most economical bike on par with most cupcai bike but the disadvantage of cupcai is their tank which full tank is about $5-$6,where else ybr125 if im not mistaken more than $10......this is important if u top-up petrol in jb.<br><br>just my 2 cents...<br><br></div>
