Tiang guess different ppl had different chracters some maybe like veri good some maybe veri bad. in another way u can said actually it doesnt matter  whether hw other behave i felt even ppl dun change their attitude no anybody can do anything. As a example look at wat milky reply you when u ask this question. Think abt it no ones cares in a manner. This is hw the world is and it will be hw it goes on for no matter hw long the earth is still in the galaxy( maybe a little out of point) but think abt it. It isnt a matter of making frens or foe. is hw we look at the matter. i jus find tat ppl attitude doesnt reali concern us regardless they are mad ,wild,bad or good. The most important is tat wat is their position in our mind. Are they frens or foe???  Look at it this way u said if they are making foes here and ask them to restrain themself frm chatting here. but think abt it again they are still ppl saying tat forum is a place to chat all you want as in another point it stand for a place that is freedom of specch to eveybody. So tiang i think maybe u got to noe tat ppl attitude isnt control by human but is control by it human itself. (hope u get me) simply we cant reali do much men. As i learn tat lives goes on men. Isnt matter anymore hw ppl are but hw we were at first.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Over the Mr PG issue, I'm quite sure many of the pple here know that he's actually faking many things. Cannot run but want to act can run that kinda type. So the best is to ignore him and channel our energies on something more informative and profitable. eg. Sales of biking equipments, organising track activities, Q&amp;A for technical support etc. In this way, flamings will be avoided and the braggard will eventually die down.</div>
