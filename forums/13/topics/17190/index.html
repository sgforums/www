He an extra. Ok anyway what bike are you riding? Your b/f prefers going to malaysia service bike than to accompany u rite? But have u ever thought, he bought the bike so expensive, then got problem sure must fix right? If u don fix a bike when there is problem, u will get MORE AND MORE problem if you sway.... and that time he will have to work work work more OT to earn money repair. Have u ever thought of that? Maybe by not accompanying u for times might save his bike. hahaha... and maybe he have an appointment with the bike shop there leh? U never know right?<br><br>Anyways, for learning to race, u can prepare ur passport, meet up with Derrick (Pasir Gudang) and he will bring u to pasir gudang in JB to learn. Cheers~</div>

Anyway, no power is 1 thing, coz I also dun know why? Maybe, u guys can help me out, but still it's Ok lah! Wat Derrick says it's true also, me ride this bike juz 2 travel, not 2 race! Even got power also no use lah! Especially in this small little island. Somemore, who buay kia si? Right? Perhaps, in the very 1st place, it's the design of the bike that had attracted me leh, u know lah, that time juz get licence dun know anything about bike mah, very paisay lah! Now, still Ok lah, as time goes by, get 2 know the bike better, I mean the handling wise, not the theory! My knowledge about bike juz the basic, can b say not as expericence as u guys out there! Once again, paisay lah! U can count me on 4 the kopi session, no problem! Provided the time is right 4 everybody, it's my pleasure 2 meet u guys. ;-)</div>
