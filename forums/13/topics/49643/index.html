            <div class='col-md body'>dear Sir/mdm<br><br>on the morning of 21st June 2003 i was travelling with my friend in his vehicle along bras brasah road heading towards suntec city at about 0130hrs.<br><br>We were travelling in the middle lane and somewhere around the arts museum, a blue color cab (SH6386) came alongside with us on the left lane, during a bend, he swerved into our lane without any intention such as signalling nor did he check his blind spot when he moved out. My friend sounded the horn and applied emergency brake to avoid hitting him.<br><br>The driver then wave some gestures at us and sped away. At the junction near suntec city, he stopped for the traffic light, we came alongside with him and he started staring at me, he then proceed to roll down his windows.<br><br>He asked me what is the problem and i explained to him that his actions just now nearly result in a collision, he then replied that there construction by the road side in front and WE SHOULD GIVE WAY TO HIM.<br><br>In my opinion, if he would have signaled and gave us ample time we would have give way to him, i told him his way of driving is wrong, and hes endangering the lives of other road users especially motorcyclists.<br><br>he simply challenged us, if we are not happy, we SHOULD have just simply hit his cab  just now at the bend or if we want we can still hit his cab now.<br><br>i am not sure about the repair costs agreement between comfort and their drivers but he is giving me the impression he need not pay for anything should there be an accident.<br><br>when the light turn green, he sped off and gave me many vulgarities gestures. His actions is jeopardising the image of comfort and it is the threat of many road users.<br><br>The driver is middle age, bespectacled and is balding, i have lodged a complaint thru the booking hotline handled by CSA named jeanie during the night of the event but i believed i got the roadname wrong.<br><br>I hope Comfort will do something about it before he hurt somebody one day, i am very hesitant to report to traffic police as i know he is making a living.<br><br>hope to hear from you soon,<br>gd day</div>
