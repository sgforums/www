            <div class='col-md body'>i disagree wif u, the reason y their resale value is low is becoz they are old, one day, maybe 3-4 yrs, KRR n SP will have low resale value also, KRR? disturb, chiat corner see who buang first lor, the best bike is not about speed only, its about the handling and the rider too...</div>
