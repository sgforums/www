            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys n gals,<br><br>Actually i`ve come to a point in life where i`m able to choose with these 4 options cuz finally i`m gonna grad soon..<br><br>cant really find a better place to post as SBF all the forums are group biased...<br><br>I was really considering all the 4 options: NO FLAME PLZ<br><br>Option 1: Hayabusa<br>Just for once in my life wanted to own the fastest production bike in the whole @ss world while i`m still young. For the looks, style and raw power.<br><br>Option 2: STX<br>It`s a really wonderful bike that haf all i wanted in a bike, reasonable spped and comfort and storage space and not to mention, it`s killer classy looks, very exec looking.<br><br>Option 3: GSXR1000/R1<br>Raw power and the fastest accelration bike in the world, a true sports bike in sense. commands respect from roads and track. But for me really, it`s more for the SEH and looks as i`m not really a competitive person.<br><br>Option 4: OPC + keep current bike<br>Yes, it all boils down to practicallity, IT COVERS ME FROM RAIN! really hated the times when it rains and i`ve to cancel my outing or delay my timing. and not to mention abt the times i was caught halfway in the rain. but biggest con is to pay the most of these few options to get the least use.<br><br>To all bikers and nonbikers, hope u all can give me some insights to where i really should be heading for my limited budget. PS. getting a car ( non-OPC ) is comfirm out of the question as i`ve no money for that.Thx for your imput.<br><br>BaByBoY</div>

In return, maybe you can help them with their high tech handphones (which they dont always know how to use.)<br><br>And there is young folks there, below the ages of 30 so you might just find yourself in a comfortable group for touring or track with the older folks giving experiences and advise that you might not know you need till you really needed it.</div>
