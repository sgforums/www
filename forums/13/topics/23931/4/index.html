I swear as i wasn't the only one to clock him, Me and a G1. [/b][/quote]<br><br>so i believe that the thai riders who ride highly mod 125s can hit 1:36 on pg are fantasy characters?? and thus proves that NO 2b bike can win a 2A bike??  so u clocked a pgm4 going 210kmh with non hrc card... so is that something to shout about? when there are nsr150 sp's that can hit 220? wow.. wat a pgm4! cool...<br><br><blockquote><strong>Haha all your silly theory again, if i got the money to buy class 2 which is 15K and above. And if i only got 2a licence, do you think i really care about how much it cost to mod my 2a bike? Rs250 cost 5K, i use another 5k to mod still is cheaper then a class 2. But comparing the class 2A bikes, i may be one of the fastest. </strong></blockquote></div></blockquote><strong>well well this boils down to EQ... why cant wait a year till the 2a turns green and then go get class2 and then upgrade?? delayed gratification always worked for me.... so if u got eQ u would do that, rather than having the fastest 2a bike and then next year ur peers all upgrade and get just a stock r1 or something and then outrun u at every traffic light and on the way to KL?? which is kinda lame... erm and if u pay a minimum down payment and pay instalments over 4 years... i dont think u have to fork out 15k straight... unless u CASHED your bike then its a different story of course mr busa...<br><br>[quote]<strong><br>Peter maybe fast in s'pore, but do u know he always get second in every race he participate!<br>Come on, you have never ride before a 400 or a 250, best is to keep your comments to yourself.
