            <div class='col-md body'>250 and 600 are mainly made for track. I personally rode a RS250 and GSXR600 on track. I must say a RS250 has superb handling and definately suited for 'slower tracks' (Tracks with more tight corners). I managed to hit 1'55" on the RS250 stock while GSXR600 only 2'00". The main reason is due to engine brake and power. But I must say both are fantastic bikes and I enjoy the aggressive handling.<br><br>Of course those pple who prefer the more straight up posture (NSR250 and R6) may find the GSXR600 and RS250 a chore to handle.<br><br>Mainly depends on the rider preference. No such thing as the better bike.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no offence on big bikes or small bikes on PG,,,,,,,did u all ever see  kup kias or rxz on PG when first corner or mostly other corners they dun really press brakes when cornering and they can go past bigger CC bikes even when they are in cornering? its all depends on the rider in skill n how well the bike performance on the day itself,,,,,,,so such things about bikes in which is faster can win the race are not so accurate,,,it all depends on the handling of bikes,,,the race which had just past which valentino won are just pure luck,,,,even though his bike is the fastest bike but no matter how hard he try he is still behind the first two bikes,,,,,just that they crash and valentino won the race,,,,the rc211v is very fast but not suitable for the german track becos of too much corners and the handling of it is quite hard for rossi to press harder to get past the two bikes in front,,,, so different bike different track  will get different results,,,,,lets not compare which is faster or better handling,,,, PGM4 is a gd bike but maintainece is very high,,,,,if really wan it to be gd condition,,,,,must always servcing and around half year will need to  overhaul the bike,,,,,to make sure the bike is in a gd condition,,,,,for RS 250,,,,,italians make the bike is meant for racing in GP,,,,,in sg,,,,,its really hard to keep the bike in tip condition as it will easily cost yr wallet a hole as the parts are expensive and it also need to be done the same as PGM4,,,,,as for cheaper maintainece is PGM4 but not really cheap also.....so its up to each individuals to maintain the bike.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>different ppl different thinking.....wat u might think is worth it but others may not think the same as u,,,,so its ( I BUY THE BIKE I SHIOK N NOT USING YR MONEY TO BUY) WO SONG TIO HAO <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
