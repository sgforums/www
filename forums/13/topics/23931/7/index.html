so what about that? u saying that i am similar to a bangladeshi? and if so... whats wrong? but i can feel u are having some descrimination towards a certain race...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   look properly at my posts... and everyone who reads through can see that i use wit to rebutt rather than insulting words that u keep insisting on using...<br><br>for the rest of the pple that frequent this forum, there is a difference between pple who think before they speak and those who dont.. and its obvious u are the latter..<br><br>the kinda reply u post mr tzr reminds me of the kind of child hood bikerings i experienced in kindergarten with the girl students... go figure...<br><br>lastly, i was thinking about how i was when i was ur age, and younger when i was riding a 2b bike... and how i spoke or replied to ppl online who were riding bigger bikes and had more experience than myself... i noticed that the ppl ard me than who were also riding small bikes.. and younger in age and experience would respect the older guys and riders for their knowledge and wouldnt outright question them and debate with them... because we know that no matter what that guy has been riding for a longer period of time and is handling a bigger more powerful bike and thus could really have more things for us to learn... and until we prove our worth when we meet up and go riding... like to desaru and to mersing, thats when we start talking a bit more... and when we do talk, the phrases were always more of questions than statements... coz of respect...<br><br>thats whats lacking today.. not just online.. but everywhere around 18, 19, 20 yr olds riding kr, sp, tzm, rvf, pgm4 etc all seem to know everything and like to come shooting their mouths away... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>do u know anyting about Team Big machine??

I mean.. sometimes it has become like casual chatting and meaning response to friends..Is that the function of a forum? Save those for IRC and ICQ since you guys have your own channel!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Give this guy a break.. at least he knows his stuffs and know what he is talking.. and at least he is not abusive in his speech.. nothing to ban him about.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>I guess forum is about freedom of speech.. yes maybe to you guys this forum is for some other purposes but keep it at that, some other joking comments at your own peers can be posted some where elses. Come on people.. bring on more wits and posts that contain substance.. i think that will be really nice<br>cheers all.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  yeah my first post hehee</div>
