Thumbs up for you. True, no matter how docile one can be, when many ppl forms a group, and the group becomes larger, there will be quarrels. Be it bikers or what, this rule applies to almost all.<br><br>What is the point of keep persisting in your views if someone is not willing to believe in what you say, you know you are right, you are right. No need to brain wash another to believe in you. Maybe sometimes, we should just let go of the ones that are not willing to accept changes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okie no offense to all to regarding comments.<br><br>PGM 4 is big and runs quite well and maintanance is affordable.As for the perfomance for RS 250 with tio top condition,it can easily beat any CBRs.Its really fast for a 250 cc bike with 2 chromed exhaust pipes sticking out but aprilia maintanence is damm high and parts keep spoiling and they wear and tear fast.So i guess its up to the rider to decide.As for looks i go for aprilia..<br><br>Next about RVF....u think its fast? i saw a drag race in CCK cemetary involving a RVF and a solid yamaha R1.Rvf was given headstart of 4-5 lamposts and the R1 juz zoom past him leaving him eating dust.So it all depends on the rider or the higher cc performance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TZR... all u have replied to me so far is outright trying to bring me down... where i have already shifted the focus back to the topic u keep insisting on bringing it on... i've checked my behaviour and refrained from using strong words like stupid, idiot, f!#@#@ and stuff like that... but u are the one who is spewing all sorts of nonsense... u have done me a favour and shown everyone here who can actually post politely and who cant....<br><br>i wont say what i think of ur intellect, but i think its plain to see.. those who read ur posts should actually know what u are made of already... seriously u have proven this to me... that i shouldnt think much of u, whether as a rider... or as an individual...<br><br>as for certain aspects of ur rebuttal, bringing in pple of different races as a means of referring me to them? so what about that? u saying that i am similar to a bangladeshi? and if so... whats wrong? but i can feel u are having some descrimination towards a certain race...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   look properly at my posts... and everyone who reads through can see that i use wit to rebutt rather than insulting words that u keep insisting on using...<br><br>for the rest of the pple that frequent this forum, there is a difference between pple who think before they speak and those who dont.. and its obvious u are the latter..<br><br>the kinda reply u post mr tzr reminds me of the kind of child hood bikerings i experienced in kindergarten with the girl students... go figure...<br><br>lastly, i was thinking about how i was when i was ur age, and younger when i was riding a 2b bike... and how i spoke or replied to ppl online who were riding bigger bikes and had more experience than myself... i noticed that the ppl ard me than who were also riding small bikes.. and younger in age and experience would respect the older guys and riders for their knowledge and wouldnt outright question them and debate with them... because we know that no matter what that guy has been riding for a longer period of time and is handling a bigger more powerful bike and thus could really have more things for us to learn... and until we prove our worth when we meet up and go riding... like to desaru and to mersing, thats when we start talking a bit more... and when we do talk, the phrases were always more of questions than statements... coz of respect...<br><br>thats whats lacking today.. not just online.. but everywhere around 18, 19, 20 yr olds riding kr, sp, tzm, rvf, pgm4 etc all seem to know everything and like to come shooting their mouths away... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>do u know anyting about Team Big machine?? and The eagle boys? this extreme teams in singapore which boasted riders who had balls of steel... and did things that u and i wont dare to do now adays... they did it just because they had the balls to do it...<br>going down the whole stretch of serangoon road all the way to the present lee motor at ave speed 160-180 at night... and two - three bikes at a time.. maniac street racing.. tell u the truth with the kinda traffic there and the amount of pedestrians... i wont dare to do it... but this pple to shout thier mouth off.. when they speak they share info only... they have riders who would blast 250-270 all the way up to thailand of course sometimes slowing down but maintaining that kinda speed all the way for 900km... dont think its easy coz it aint...<br><br>testing top speed is not just about opening ur throttle and pinning it there.. and not  just anyones grandmother can do it... when ur bike can hit 330kmh and above... lets see how many pple dare to do it.. when for certain one error when near top and u will definately die. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>have u been there? have u tried those stuff? have u gone on long trips to thailand cambodia? have ur tire punctured half way back from a long trip? tested speeds above 300? crash at speeds above 160kmh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ? fly for hundreds of meters and end up waiting for ambulance coz cannot move <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ? ride at 180+ and see two other bikes in front of u crash and u brake through the smoke and debris avoiding them? and seeing them die <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ? have u modified ur bike till everytime u open ur throttle a little harder the rear wheel spins out? and leaves black lines all over the floor <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ?  have u taken a 170 bend with bike at full lean only to see that the blind bend infront got road works <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> ? have u taken jumps and keep gettin great air time and on 3rd gear pin the throttle and take off <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ? so what have u done???? that u have so much to talk about?? and to criticise someone with more experience than u obviously and such???? what have u??<br><br>even rossi being so skillfully <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  blessed and a champion listens to mick doohan and jeremy burgess.. simply because they have more experience than him. if doohan didnt coach rossi... when his first season of 500cc racing.. he would definately have crashed many more races... where doohan came along and told him to ease off at times and strategize... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>so mr tzr <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> .. i know so many riders who i respect and learn from and whenever they speak i listen and never rebutt them simply because they have ridden longer than me.. seen more than me.. and experienced worse shit than me..<br><br>so what have u to reply this time?? what do u have that u should criticise me? <strong>bring it on~!  </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
