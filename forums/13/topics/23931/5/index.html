            <div class='col-md body'>I guess, it'd be better for us to leave offensive remarks behind. Lets just share our points of view but not force others to have the same view. Everybody sees different things differently.<br><br>Anyway, I do ride up to the Northern Malaisian territory occasionally and visit the track alone or with friends when I have the time and money. My timing is only average. 1'55"-2'05" (RS250 stock), 1'57"-2'08" (G6 stock) I'm not sure how does Mr Knee slider fares. Maybe it'd be nice if we organise such trips together and thrash it out on the track.<br><br>I'm a young 'Almond' (Mecedes Benz 7 tonner) mechanic, still learning about vehicles. But I still know something about bikes. Whether its a RS250 or PGM4 or G6 or R6 or whatever bike it is. The difference lies on the rider to make a difference on the track. But on a straight, most of it depends on the mechanic. I've thought of things like equipping a turbo charger on a bike etc... So its still possible for any bike to beat any bike on a straight. Except for excessively high bhp bike vs a too much lower bhp bike.<br><br>Why not we discuss such topics peacefully?

When you like something to be done in a way you like, it does not mean that everyone has to follow your code of conduct.<br>Yes, making comments are always welcomed. Be it good or bad, we should just voice out whatever we have to say. Not like KNEESLIDER and NISMO and others, keep arguing about their own idea and target questions at individuals. Come on, everyone here for this topic is at least above the age to 18. Maybe we should just keep your cool and voice only YOUR opinion. Rather than flaiming one another.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess we just have to express our point of views. I agree with some of your points posted earlier. Some pple may not agree, but we'll just have to respect them. Different pple sees things differently.<br>As for Nismo Henry, I guess you need to re think about some of the things you portrayed. There should be some miscommunications between you and others that caused pple to think you're a show off etc. I've come across many forums and pple around having the same negative impression about you. Perhaps you should try and think why pple think that way, maybe you were wrong in some places? Of course this is only my suggestion.<br>Why not we talk things out nicely and consider about how pple feel?<br><br>Yah I agree that different points of views can seperate pple and might cause enimity. So we have our Racial Harmony Day in SAF to acknowledge the importance of harmony in our multi racial society. Just like our biking world, I don't like Honda bikes and will not buy Honda bikes doesn't mean its lousy. It may seem very suitable for some other pple. I don't find the bikes I support (Suzuki, aprilia, MV Agusta, Benelli) are being widely supported by many pple too. But they aren't lousy bikes too.<br><br>mmm...OK?<br>_____________________________________________________<br>(HQ ARMCEG Maint.
