            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings,<br><br>As u know that 29th Dec is approaching soon, are u guys have the same urge as me; looking forward for the grand BBQ outing between both RaceTrack as well as Sggirls forums? Well, I think where should have some queries about things happening on that day itself, the attendance as well as the things that are necessary to bring along if u want to. Scroll down and take the necessary notice to make sure that the outing would be a success.<br><br>1. Place<br><br>The confirm place for the day of event is at East Coast Park. For those who are not sure about the actual place, please click on the link below:<br><a href="http://streetdirectory.com/new_sd_member_no.cgi?x=36856.4000&amp;y=31519.3300&amp;level=3&amp;star=1&amp;heading=EAST%20COAST%20RECREATION%20CTRE,%201000%20%20EAST%20COAST%20PARKWAY%20(449876)&amp;areapostal=449876" rel="nofollow">Map of actual location</a><br>The above link will bring you to the Recreation Centre. The obvious landmark will be the Macdonald as well as the Coffee Bean. If u had seen the above stated place, you are 95% confirm that u had reached the correct place.<br><br>Once u had reached there, please walk to the back of the 7-11, turn left and walk along the pathway, be sure to look out for those oncoming bicycles and such. Take notice of pit Number 28, and there u are, have reached the correct destination where the fun will take place...<br><br>2. Time<br><br>The stated time will be 3pm, pls take note that u all should be arriving not later than 3.15pm. It is to make sure that everyone will have fun and laughter together and not to waste other ppl's time in waiting for u. The whole event might possibly end at 10.30pm or early. I sincercely hope that you will stay till the end..<br><br>3. Dress Code<br><br>It is advisable for you all to dress as simple as possible becoz we are near the beach and not going to attend a dinner or something? And, pls be informed to bring extra clothes so as to change to a clean suit after all those programs lined up for u all.. Dont say i didnt inform u all about this..<br><br>4. Food and Drinks<br><br>The food provided are for 30pax. Pls do not give any excuses as to say, not enough food to eat. There are plenty for everyone. And also, no alcoholic drinks are allowed to be brought in for the BBQ because this is a healthy outing and too much alcohol is not really good for ur health.<br><br>5. Money and Valuables<br><br>Pls take note that u are to pay the Organiser $10 on 26th onwards. This is to pay off all his effort made for the success of the BBQ. And also, please do not bring too much valuables along to the BBQ due to the fact that everyone will be enjoying participating in the programs and god knows who will be able to patrol around to take care of those valuables. And we will be boycotting ppl who brought camera and such devices to the outing. We will have our personal photographer on that day, so, dun worry..<br><br>Everyone is strongly beckon to join all those activities lined up for all of us. Throw all ur worries and ur attitude plus ur anti social aside while u are at the BBQ. Pls, Pls, be friendly and cool to everyone around. You all also can meet at a place and come to the Pit together. Most importantly, pls do not be late... if u are, pls call and inform... Till then, take care.<br><br>(ps: Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year For All)<br><br>Sincercely,<br><br></div>
