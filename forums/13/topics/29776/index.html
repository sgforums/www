            <div class='col-md body'>I tink it's a good idea to put on safety belt for cars lor. No matter wat it's juz a safety precaution for all pple. For banning motorcycles, do you tink that everyone can afford their own cars, I dun tink so. It's a cheaper alternative for pple to have their own transport and not squeezing with others for public transport. That's my point of view.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
