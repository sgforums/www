            <div class='col-md body'>Initially,i said : Even those sitting behind the front passenger and car driver have to put on safety belt... What about the motorcyclist ? Don't even have to wear any safety belt~ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">My point is,should the government ban motorcycling as it's dangerous because there's no safetly belt. Motorcycle ramming onto an obstacle is equal to a 'fly to the front' ride.. <strong>Or should the government redraw back the stupid safety belt rules ?  </strong></span><br><br>Look properly at the words in bold. That's the alternative ! Should i say that you guys should open your eyes wide and read carefully before commenting ? Or should i say that you guys are just narrowminded people who are so straight about things.<br><br>The title of this topic was written by my sarcasm. I did that intentionally and makes it sound real stupid inorder to let my readers to agree with my alternative idea which is stated on the above in bold.<br><br>Wise people will be able to see and agree with the alternative idea written by me in which the government should consider while the other bunch of people wouldnt be bothered to look at my alternative idea because they are simply so straight and narrowminded.. I believe that you guys can clearly see who are these bunch of people and the names they should be called..<br><br>For all of your infomations,i am not yet a driver nor am i someone who is against  the riders and bikes. Nor was i fined before for not wearing safety belt. I am a obdient citizen of this very land.
