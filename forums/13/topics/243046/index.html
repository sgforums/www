Everyone on the road will give you respect!<br><br>RXZ.....you will feel like the lowest form of creature on the road.<br>Trust me on this....when you start riding with your P-plate on it...you will know what I meant!<br><br></div></blockquote>im not a rider. im a driver.<br><br>but from the post u have said, i feel that is really too disappointed to hear.<br><br>our fren here just got his class2B and u expect him to wait till he get class2 then ride a bike which is abt another 2yrs+ time? then wat for they have class 2b and class 2a for? might as well go straight to class 2? he is asking for class 2b bike, not class 2. i not sure if u are trying to boost to tell everyone here u ride a R1 here or wat. and mind ur words, with the senstance u mention, u have offend alot of ppl. no matter wat bike ppl ride on, is not wat lowest form of creature on the road. if u want to say till like that, i will say ur R1 is one of the lowest form of creature in class 2 cos u lose to Hayabusa(sorry if wrong spelling). will u feel happy?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually before u get yr 1st bike maybe u shld consider yr pupose with it<br><br>1. from point A to B distance wise certain bikes is not comfortable to ride for long distance<br><br>2. the kind of rider u are. are u like large .. small bulid.. what kinda of bike u handle better and feel better with<br><br>3. how technically well versed are u. so u can get the lesser mantainance bike<br><br>Cost involve<br><br>if u are a young rider with P plate .. the insurance will be a killer expecially if u get bikes on hire purchase.<br><br>road tax is anything under 200 for a year<br><br>if u get a RZX which is a nice bike to ride with lesser mantainece except topping of 2T and petrol and pumping of tires. It can be bought for under 2k with everything in. Dun expect a looker though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this guy is a bloody joke. . . i don't even think he's riding at all la. You maybe running on one of the fastest bike in the world i don't care...ultimately it's not the ride, it's the rider. A probably a dumb fuck like you would not even dare maximising the potential of the R1. So suck on this you slut...<br>..!.. ^_^ ..!..</div>
