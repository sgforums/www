            <div class='col-md body'>I think only some drivers lah... Not all drivers are that reckless &amp; inconsiderate... If i should say, some riders are juz as bad... Drivers should at least try to give way to riders as riders are smaller vehicles on the road as i should say... At least think of the rider's "LIFE"... Driver dun die if they bang onto a rider but they rider might die juz b'coz of the driver... "4" wheels is sure to be safer than "2" wheels... Am i wrong to say that? If u want to be treated like a human being, act like one first...<br><br>------------------<br>[THIS IS A COMPUTER GENERATED MESSAGE THEREFORE NO SIGNATURE IS REQUIRED]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all again,<br><br>ermmmm i am not actually that good lar, i mean i still make mistakes once in a while when i drive, so not really that 'safe' as some of u mention, haha...... just that i feel that life and staying alive is more important than anything on the road.<br><br>ermmmm yah i dun quite like taxi drivers as well but like what some says, not all are bad lar, so lets try not to sterotype them. can u pple imagine having to drive non stop for 8-10 hrs? Wow think i will be lazy and get frustrated by then also, heh.......i dunnoe. But yes, do watch out if driving behind them.<br><br>Bikes or cars, to me they're passions, not diff class.......... just like some pple like fish and some like vege. Nobody thinks eating vege is 2nd class, i mean, maybe they are even richer than those eating fishes.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I drive cos its my passion to cars ........ what abt u pple?<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>
