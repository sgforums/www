But majority can only hit 170km/h now.2T maintenace is a thing not to be forgetten.<br><br>Phantom 200 has got faster pickup. But low topend. Heard 150km/h on meter. This is what I heard. I tried my frenz bike, his max max also cannot touch 130km/h. So dun ask me about how others hitting 150km/h.<br><br>Fuel consumption, TA200 is the best. Full tank can hit 380km. (Inclusive of reserve)<br><br>But, please take note: The design of the bike is not very good in terms of handling. Wobbling while moving of is a daily routine. Braking is also not that ideal though its a 2-disc brake. To improve its braking, getting good brake pads and steel braided brake hose will be a good alternative. TA200 one thing I don't like is the sound, and the vibration. Rather strong at higher rev.<br><br>4-strokers require more compression than 2 strokers. Torque for TA200 theoritically is better than TA150.</div>
