From the review, it seems that the BMW M5 has crushed along all other competitors with it's design, power and speed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Would like to check it out ASAP.

            <div class='col-md body'>apart from being expensive (initial payment), the maintainence is also quite high. note that cos of high tech., u are unable to maintain ur car outside apart from the agent of BMW. heard that one time cost thousand odd for checking<br>personally feel that high performance car does not suit s'pore road, cos too many red light, fuel consumption will also increase cos of fequent engaging 1st gear<br>heard that lexus 200 or 300 not too bad. probably gives another choice.<br>look out for horse power difference between cars (same CC but different horse power) and the engine formation they use.<br>advise u to read up car magazines for more information</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BMW is a great car.. BUT unless u go Malaysia often.. You do not have a place to run it....Get a Jap car... repair and maintainence lower... cheaper to change parts.. anyway since in sg u can only go 80-90... Any cheap car..(even perodua Kancil) can make it... a honda civic, GLXi, Megane should be able of offer some fun... and at the same time offer low roadtax, low consumtion, low maintainence.<br><br>------------------<br>It takes a moment to have a crush on someone,an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone,but it takes a lifetime to forget her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No doubt, for the amount of money you pay for an M5, it is an engineering masterpiece.<br><br>But I have to agree with Dakar and alex that the maintenance and repair costs are just too excessive. for an M5.  Unless you have tons of money to throw around, I, personally, would not recommend an M5.  Cars of this type is very fussy when it comes to maintenance and repair.<br><br>Moreover, it is very unlikely that you will speed up to 250km/h in an M5 on any part of the world roads with exception of the Autobahn.<br><br>If you are a BMW lover, I would strongly suggest a 323i or 323Ci.  It gives the best value for money.  It runs great and it defnitely would not dissapoint you in terms of performance, ride, handling, practicality and safety.  Although its maintenence cost is still higher than most ordinary cars, it still cost much much less than an M5 to run.<br><br>Regards!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jeff007:<br><br>From you previous posts, I understand that you work.  Does your work require you to regularly pick up clients in you car for business functions?  If you do, and if you can afford it, a Mercedes E280 or E320 is the one to go for.  For some reasons, if you drive a Mercedes, it tend to convey a message to people that you are a successful business person.  You will really impress your clients if you pick them up in a Mercedes.  Basically, nothing beats the prestige of the star on the grille.<br><br>If I can afford it, and if I were to choose between a Mercedes and a BMW, I would go for a Mercedes.  No insult to BMW, it is just a personal perference.<br><br>Regards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with money &amp; power. japanese car doesn't have the prestige compared to german cars. Besides, those big bosses of major comapnies tend to drive benzs. Although because I am a BMW enthusist, I would think that the 540i is a good subsitute. &lt;-- dunno if there is 540 in spore.<br><br>------------------<br>!Don't Worry, Be Happy!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jeff007:<br><br>Since I am living in Canada, I actually drive an American car - a 1996 Chrysler Intrepid sedan with 3.3L (3,300 cc) V6 engine.<br><br>Actually, in Canada, you could buy a brand new Mercedes C230 Kompressor for about Sgpore$34,000.00 before taxes.  A base BMW 323i sedan would cost about Sgpore$32,000.00 before taxes.  Add 17% taxes to the price.  That's cheap compare to Singapore where prices of cars are beyond reach.<br><br>Although I could run to the showroom and pick up a Mercedes anytime now, I have other priorities that I would like to achieve first before considering buying a Mercedes.<br><br>Since you are a BMW lover, a 323i would be an ideal choice.  If you want more space for the need to accomodate your clients comfortably, a BMW 528i is more ideal. The BMW 528i is one of the best executive sedans around.  In short, the choice between a 323i and a 528i would really depend on your need, affordability and priority.<br><br>I do not have much to say about Japanese cars, since I do not know a lot about them.  But I do know that Toyota is one of the best.  It is extremely reliable.  In fact, it is even more reliable than a Mercedes or a BMW.  But it's safety system is not on par with Mercedes and BMW yet.<br><br>Regards!<br><br></div>
