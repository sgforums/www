            <div class='col-md body'>U take up the lic first, be it class 2B or Class 3. And dun need to buy a bike after u got lic. Buy it after ur NS or atleast after BMT and u know where u are going to be posted, vocation type,etc.<br><br>Why?<br><br>If i buy ur bike now, u are going to start to pay $$$ for ur bike and for person who is not earning or not earning much. It can be really burning the pockets. If u get pocket money from ur dad or ur dad is paying for the bike, I can see why the reluntance of u owning a bike.<br><br>2nd, NS. Trust me for BMT atleast 3mths u are not going to be using ur bike because for most BMT in the army dun let Recruits drive or ride in. Be it in tekong or u mono-intake somewhere else. PLUS after u post out, u have no idea wat vocation u are going to be in,if suay suay kena siong one, confirm dun need to ride liao (maybe except on sat/sun). This means u will be paying $$$ for the bike but using it only for less than 1 day. And NS is 2 years and allowance is miserable already. Bo hua leh.<br><br>From wat u have posted, ur dad doesn't seems to mind his children take up biking so taking up a lic for u shld not be a problem. Just tell ur dad that u are not going to buy a bike for the time being.<br><br>If ur dad insist u take up driving, just take it up lor. Trust me, (like me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) sooner or later u will out grow ur bike phase and start to look into cars liao so its handy to have a lic first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no harm taking a class 3 licence and then settling your bike licence after that.<br><br>First things first, this is the way I see things.  I pay for the car, I use it whenever I like it.  So if you are going to 'borrow' the car and someone who is forking out money wants to use it, then there should be no argument.<br><br>Now, riding a bike is dangerous like most say.  I'm not too bothered by those comments at all because I love riding bikes.  Unlike the previous poster who has had a 'bike phase' and grown out of it, there are people who love riding bikes even if they can afford 5 cars.<br><br>But unlike those people who can afford so many cars and yet they still purchase a bike to ride, you on the other hand have serious budget constraints.<br><br>So what I suggest now is that you get your car licence, if you get a chance to get to drive the car then good for you.  Otherwise there's no point arguing over a car which you have no reason to argue about anyway.  Get a bike licence when you have time and money.  At the end of it all, if you really still wanna own a bike of your own, then you can take out your calculator and start counting how much money you have AFTER you've gone into army.<br><br>Unless you can fully support a car or bike, I don't see any reason why a student can't get around in public transport.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>Get a Class 3 first would be a better choice for uyr case, from what i see.<br><br>1stly, you are going to have a car in the family, imagine on days wehn the car is available for ur use , but you are without a license , wouldn't u be more "dui" ?<br>Hehe..<br><br>2ndly, getting a license early is good when u can afford to buy a car for urself in the future. Insurance companies will take into account of how long you have been holding the license , when deciding the premium to load you. Furthermore, if you dun drive or ride, for 3 years, that also means you dun kenna any demerit points. You will then be eligible for the certificate of merit from the TP. That is another 5% savings on top of ur insurace NCDs. This is especially helpful, for people who buy cars like integras and mx5. The insurance for a 25 yr old will cost from $4k onwards per year without NCD, and with a class 3 license that is 1-2 yrs old.<br><br>In a sense, it pays to get a Class 3 license, even if you dun forsee urself driving one or much in the near future.<br><br></div>
