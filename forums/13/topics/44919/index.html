            <div class='col-md body'>Personally feel these products I used are fantastic...<br><br>Brake pads:<br>Carbone Lorraine<br>Grading : SBK3 [supersport] (front)$45per pair, C42 [pure racing] (front) $75 per pair.<br>Grading : RX $45 per pair (Rear only) (Don't pay anything more than the above prices)<br><br>Carbone Lorraines really grip. Even in wet weather. Many of my friends switched from Daytona to Carbone Lorraines all say its fantastic. The SBK3 is best buy. Good for road and track and wet and dry. Dial 68422360 (David Aw)<br><br>Engine oil (4T):<br>Motul 300V Factory Line (5w-40) ($20/litre - $24/litre)<br>I've been using the Motul 300V Competition (15W-50) for a long time and really felt that this is very good compared to Castrol RS (now R4) and Motorex. Then I tried out Factory Line for a change. I can't believe that there's something even better than competition grade!!! It's more responsive and more smoother. Dial 63960230 (Joseph Lee)<br><br>Tyres:<br>Pirelli Supercorsa SC2 (presently its $550 per pair)<br>Really sticks on the road. Short life span. But very very stable. Wonderful for track racing. But only meant for 600cc and above. But really must try if you want real grip real performances. Dial 68422370 (David Aw) or Dial 63960230 (Joseph Lee) or Dial 68424566 (Works Performance\ Mr Lam)<br><br>Metzeler Rennsport RS2 (Prices can 'fight' with Pirelli)<br>This tyre feels very responsive when you dive into corners compared to SC2. But lacks a sense of stability when you're whacking braking points on straights before diving corners unlike the SC2 which is good for that. Dial 68422370 (David Aw)<br><br>Suspensions:<br>Ohlins Rear shock: ($1400 per unit)<br>This shock really performs. When I changed into this from the original Showa, I immedieatly sensed the difference. It reduces tyre load when on hard trashing. Fully adjustable for preload(hydraulically), compression and rebound damping, ride height. The damping really works even on very hot temperatures. The Ohlins damping capability doesn't fade like original shocks. And its fully servicable at $150. That means you can trash your shock like nobody's business. Pillion a very very heavy friend for long periods of time without worrying that your shock can give way. Because with $150 you can rebuild your shock and it will be as good as new. Therefore 2nd hand Ohlins are also wonderful buys. Unless you're lucky enough to clinch someone selling it also. Dial 63960230 (Joseph Lee)<br><br>Racetech gold valve ($250-$300 per pair) Ohlins Spring (approx $150)<br>This is a wonderful alternative if you find Ohlins Front forks very expensive. This is a cheaper alternative by re valving and re sprung your front. Combined with 5W fork oil in front for cartridge forks... it really shows you what real suspensions are. With the Ohlins shock and the modified front, I can tune up my suspensions properly and it really is stable when I take corners. The differences from my originals are really very much. I seriously recommend this for serious suspension improvers. Dial 63960230 (Joseph Lee) or 68422370 (David Aw)<br><br></div>
