Pls. ask proper question. Its aprilia using a smaller silencer pipe. Nobody says any arrow pipe can be used in this forum, once again its a smaller pipe. <strong>Don't misunderstand.</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">Not Arrow</span>. Arrow is a racing special part even the whole world won't allow aprilia to use the pipe on the road.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Amsyari:<br><strong><br><br>Friend, who says aprilia can use [b]arrow</strong>. Pls. ask proper question. Its aprilia using a smaller silencer pipe. Nobody says any arrow pipe can be used in this forum, once again its a smaller pipe. <strong>Don't misunderstand.</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">Not Arrow</span>. Arrow is a racing special part even the whole world won't allow aprilia to use the pipe on the road.[/b]</blockquote>Sorry, i have mis-represented myself. I do refer to the smaller pipe that was shown in the bikeshow at suntec on the RS'es. There was NOTHING said with regards to that at all even till now with HUNTER from AOC beside MAH's boss.<br><br>We cant doubt anyone now as its just your words versus Huntor's. But from ur first posting, its kinda misleading. I think its either you provide true hard fact, (for instant any number which public can call? or any emails?) or do not confirm this news at all. U are free to inform this hearsay to others but unless u have real facts to back ur words, else leave it to the authorities.<br><br>You never know who will be reading this and some other sporeans who happened to be abroad might go ahead to purchase the exhaust system and came back sg to realise it's just a hoax. It's a waste of money and it will poorly reflect on the reliability of forums' infos. What's the point of being in a forum if in the end, all news are just fake news?<br><br>Again, i hope u understand my point, i DO NOT doubt you TOTALLY but i do have my reserves and to convince me, it just need more than just your words.</div>
