            <div class='col-md body'>LexZeus,<br>normally, 2b class bikes dun get overheated easily. It's the bigger cc bikes that get overheated more easily. Sometimes, they even have to shut down their engines for it to cool off and then restart before they move off. But for 2B bikes, overheating shouldn't happen.<br><br>What kind of bike are you having ? Did the dealer tell you the bike takes a coolant liquid or just plain water cooled. Some bikes need coolants, like mine. Some are water cooled. If yours is water cooled, you can top up with plain water, but if yours need coolant and you pour in only water ... well I never try that, dunno wat will happen. Check what kind of cooling system your bikes needs. If you need to top up coolant, you can get Castrol Radicool at any petrol kiosk. You dun have to mix with water. Just buy and top up. It's already mixed peoperly for you. And please, no coconut juice for coolant hor ....<br><br>By the way, I was caught in a jam for about 15 to 20 minutes. But my temperature never rose beyond 1/4 of the scale. It is not normal for temperatures to go up to 3/4 of the scale, not that I know of. I think you better take your bike to a workshop and ask them if they can help you. You already smell something burnt. Best to ask them to check if there's really anything burnt or not. Dun overlook a heating problem. One of these days, if your bike catches fire .... let's hope not ....<br><br>[This message has been edited by Noah (edited 12 September 2001).]</div>
