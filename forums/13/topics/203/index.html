He went there to do insurance claiming.After collecting his bike, he realised that everything repaired was not new but just repair the damaged parts and fixed it back eg.muffler.Initially, the boss said that the insurance company of the rider who knocked my friend could only allow my friend to claim that much. My friend got furious and demanded the boss to change it. The boss agreed to change for him but till now my friend still did'nt collect it.

As a new bird in 2A bike, i didn't realise it is a lousy bike till now.When i requested the boss to fix for me, he told me to do OVERHAUL!!!!I just bought the bike and he said must OVERHAUL!!!! It sounds too unreasonable to me. He also cheated me out for my refunded insurance money for my 2B bike(abt. $500 plus if refund). At that time i did'nt know i can refund back insurance $.

            <div class='col-md body'>If u want a good piece of advice from me,i suggest to ask your friends not to go there anymore if they want to claim insurance.<br>Normally, at other motor shop, u have to pay first regardless whether your insurance case win or lost. But at xtreme,u can pay after the insurance claiming has been processed and get your bike first.He will just any how repair your bike.By right xtreme should change all the damage parts with new ones when claiming insurance but he did'nt do so.When claiming insurance there, they will any how claim fr your insurance company. He will most propably claim anything that was not damage. If you win your insurance case, lucky for u. U don't have to pay for the lousy and HIGH cost repairing. But if lost the case, then U HAVE to PAY for the poor repairing at a HIGHER COST! U see, either way the boss will earn $. I know people want to earn $ but the way he did it was dishonest and incorrect. I wonder what kind of values dose he has?<br>I sincerely warn u guys to be careful.<br>If u don't believe, u can still visit that shop but pls. ask everything properly before letting them proceed.</div>
