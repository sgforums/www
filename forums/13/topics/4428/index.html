            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I too agree that littering is a great offence to the environment and the inability to use toilet facilities cleanly reflects badly on our society, that is why I take heed that I myself do not do such a thing. So since emptying spent oils into the sewer system is also the wrong thing to do, shouldn't we, as responsible adults, do our part by disposing of it properly?<br><br>I am guessing you tell your friends who do not think litter and dirty toilets is wrong how much "harm" it is; we are doing the same thing here, which is to bring to attention and focus on a practice that you might have miscontrued as acceptable, where in reality it is not.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ah_tee:</div><div class="quote_body"> jus like pple think it does not do much harm to litter and dirty toilets, i think its alot of harm<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>eh while we're on the topic...<br><br>daniuge: have you ever worried about people saboing your bike? cos the engine oil cap is just a simple black screw on-and-off type right? i got a couple of enemies in school, and ONE of the reasons for not getting a 4-stroke is that i think it's easy to get saboed, like those bo-liao people can just unscrew the thing and put sand or whatever inside. i know there're a lot of other ways to sabo a bike lar, but still this is rather difficult to fix, and damage can be quite serious... (still there are other sabotage methods with the same outcome... but...) what do you think??<br><br>anyway, while i was searching for touratech accessories for the varadero 125, i found out they sell this tamper-proof engine oil cap... check the segment on touratech oil plug.<br><a href="http://www.bracken.co.uk/touratech/catalog/epvar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bracken.co.uk/touratech/catalog/epvar.htm</a><br><br>sounds like a good idea, cos only your allen key can open it. but if the boliao person really don't like you, he'll bring along a whole set of allen keys to test lar. and i wonder if these oil plugs would fit other bikes other than the varadero...<br><br>------------------<br>rock hard... ride free...</div>
