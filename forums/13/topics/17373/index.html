I bet, this is happened because US and Israel walked out from UN some days ago ...<br><br>The worst thing, this will worsen the global economy crisis nowadays. I just read a book called "The Nine Angels", tell the true story about Angels which is sent to man name John and prophesy him what will happen these days. The book said, the economy will be worse and worse and many disaster will occur: flood in China (happened already), earthquake in Australia, even Europe which have never been earthquake before, will have earthquake until the Eifel tower fall down.<br><br>The book doesn't tell if the global economy will rise again, eventually ... it won't arise ... is this true or not ? ... better be prepared ...<br></div>
