            <div class='col-md body'>There are 5 types of super4 out there in the market. The Project Big 1 (PB1), Version R, Version S, Vtec and Vtec Spec 2. Version R and S is the same only the headlight is different. Powercut at 13000+ rpm. Anything below 7k rpm, the bike feels heavy. But above 7k, is where the kick comes in. PB1 is the only one that comes with a main stand officially. Coz Spec2 the frame allows owners to buy a main stand to fix. Last heard $280 from HKL. PB1 is without powercut. All the other versions comes with a 4-2-1 exhaust system only PB1 is a 4-into-1 exhaust system. Vtec is lighter than the previous models plus pickup is alot more faster than the previous models, but if play dragging of gears, the other models will be able to catch up. The engine oil amount for PB1, Version R and Version S is max 3 litres with change of oil filter. Vtec and Spec 2 is 3.5 litres. A super 4 no matter how you mod, max output is only 210km/h. Provided powercut removed and with proper jettings and maybe a dyno jet kit. Vtec power cut steps in at 13500rpm. Removal of powercut is good to get top speed, but not good for the engine. Powercut at the RPM is to  protect the engine. Spec2 and Vtec biggest diff is that the VTEC kicks in at 6350 for Spec2 and 6750 for Vtec. These versions consumes more petrol due to the VTEC technology. But if you dun run fast enough to open the Valves, consumption is low.<br><br>Maintenace is good coz its a realiable bike. There is a large market for Super4 so the parts are realitively cheap. Look wise, there are also alot of add ons for the bike. But if you really out to squeeze the top for your bike, get a CBR or other bikes. Coz their top ends will be higher. Like about 240km/h.</div>

Both Version S and PB1 is lower in terms of petrol consumption when compared to VTEC. But VTEC is really faster in terms of pickup. Want to play with VTEC, you will have to drag to above 10000rpm then can play. If not you will be behind. But top end is the same. Super4 is a inline 4 engine, so the number of spark plugs is 4. Depending on the plugs you use, you will be able to attain longer miles before feeling the plugs weakening. Normal original HONDA plugs will be able to reach about 15000. But 12000 best change. Then DENSO IRIDIUM plugs has higher voltage, thus the bike will have better response. Mileage also around 15000. As for the engine oil, there is cheap and good ones. Cheap ones go around 3.5k best change. Better ones can go up to 5k-6k. Depending on the rider. For every 2 times of engine oil, you will have to change the oil filter. If dun change, the engine will be dirty and pistons will jam due to the carbons that built up. Every change of oil filter, you will have to top up another 200ml of engine oil.<br><br>Super 4 the biggest problem is in the rectifier. The only improvement was seen in VTEC. But still it has the problem. Only at Spec 2 was it solved.( Solved or not solved is on theory because Spec 2 is only out for half 3months in singapore.) A rectifier will cost around 75 to 125. $75 i heard is LAB production. Lasts less than 2 month. Original ones normallly last above a year only. A gixxer or bandit can last for 5 years. Version S can use VTEC's rectifier as VTEC's rectifier has fins, which is actually a radiator. I heard of ppl connecting CPU fan to it. This will further prolong the life of the rectifier.<br><br>A Super 4 can only hit around 210 max. If you are intending to go beyond that, you are recommended to get other bikes, cause at 210 you are already over stressing the engine already.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PB1 is actually older than other model, but then again, there are newer ones that is the FQ plates. It is using Nissin brake calipers for front and back. The biggest draw point of a Version S is that the front brake calipers are BREMBO. The rear is only Nissin. Dun ask me why is that so becoz they didn't summit the proposal to me when producing the bike. There are 2 batch of version s and pb1. The older ones the tail board are 2 pieces but the newer ones is only one piece.<br><br>PB1 is cheaper, might be that some ppl find the main stand too ugly. But with a main stand, when you wash bike, its the best thing ever to be present.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by milkshake:</div><div class="quote_body"></div></blockquote>That is called the engine breather. There are 2 type of connections. One is to the engine oil case and the other is to the engine itself. This is done to allow the engine to have better ventilation in order to let the engine running in a cooler enviroment. For 2A bikes, the heat is not as hot as compared to those class 2 bikes. Fairing bikes yes, they trap heat better than a naked bike. But ifyou din really always wack your little pony for long long journeys, dun use it. Coz your engine in return will work in too cold enviroment. Which is not good. Super4 generally dun need to do it. RVF truthfully, dun need it as well. But use it on a class 2 bike like a K1 or K2, you can see smoke coming out of it. Another thing, your bike will take longer to warm up in the morning or after parking too long.</div>

There are 2 type of connections. One is to the engine oil case and the other is to the engine itself. This is done to allow the engine to have better ventilation in order to let the engine running in a cooler enviroment. For 2A bikes, the heat is not as hot as compared to those class 2 bikes. Fairing bikes yes, they trap heat better than a naked bike. But ifyou din really always wack your little pony for long long journeys, dun use it. Coz your engine in return will work in too cold enviroment. Which is not good. Super4 generally dun need to do it. RVF truthfully, dun need it as well. But use it on a class 2 bike like a K1 or K2, you can see smoke coming out of it. Another thing, your bike will take longer to warm up in the morning or after parking too long.</div></blockquote>hmmmm <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
