If a person rides an elephant and bangs a wall at 100km/h, compared to a person who rides a horse (I substitute the cat, you can't ride a cat) bangs a wall at 100km/h, assuming the wall is stronger than the elephant, I'd say the impact to the rider won't be much different <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>The advantage of riding an elephant can be felt, if the elephant is hit by a bull. Most likely the elephant will still be standing tall. If a horse is hit by a bull, the horse will be flown off.<br><br>Now back to real-life situation. If an accident had already happened, the type of bike doesn't really matter anymore. The heaviest production bike is still lighter then the lightest production car (so the elephant hit by a charging bull analogy is not applicable), and you don't have to balance yourself in a car. The bike rider will always be the losing side.<br><br>We're talking about the advantage provided by a bigger bike to avert an accident. It's more stable, so it's not easy to be blown away by a gush of wind when a huge trailer passes by. It doesn't fall off easily when slightly knocked. Nobody can deny that. But IMHO, it's just a small factor in ensuring safety in riding. The rider's attitude and riding style plays a much more important role. A reckless Hayabusa rider is not safer than a wise and careful Honda Cub 70 rider.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

How often you see goldwing engage in accident? </div></blockquote>How many Goldwings are there in Singapore? I also dunno the exact figure, but I believe the ratio between Goldwing rider and SP/RXZ/KRR rider is at least 1:10, or even smaller.<br><br>Let's assume the accident rate is the same for all bikes, say 1% per year. If there're 100 Goldwings in Spore, there's only 1 accident involving Goldwing every year. And the chance is, you're not there to witness the accident. On the other hand, there're 1000 SPs in Spore, and there're 10 SP accidents every year. Your chance of witnessing an SP involved in an accident is 10 times higher, then.<br><br>Now back to the main factor, which is the rider. Most Goldwing riders are bike enthusiasts, who are not in their 20's anymore. They have years of riding experience, and ride responsibly. Goldwings are not designed for high-speed racing, anyway. They're big, heavy, and fat, and when you're stuck in a traffic jam, you're as good as driving a car. You can't slip your way easily between cars.<br><br>Who rides SP/KRR/RXZ? Mostly teenagers or people in their early 20's. Some are inexperienced, and young blood boils easily. Hence, the reckless riding style. So logically speaking, who has the higher chance of being involved in an accident?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>.........wow, thanks for the info. Well, rider's style of riding do contribute to accident, but of course skill also la. As for me, i just ride slowly and carefully <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  And i seldom see big bike accident, maybe their bike are more stable and rider more experience and skillful, hor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
