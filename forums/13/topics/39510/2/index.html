But I really doubt that the TP will be very active to help actually.<br><br>I have reported an incident before also but didn't even have any reply from them despite the fact that I have get their contacts from the Ministry of Home Affair.<br><br>Some of the car drivers on the road really think very great about themselves and think that us, bikers are too insignificant and our life is just cheap.<br><br>There was once when a car cut into my lane in front of me when I am going striaght into a filter lane. And guess what, when we both stop in front of the traffic light, he even got the cheek to talk to me and say that I am riding a bike and he was riding a car and I should let him pass me, depite the fact that he actually nearly hit into me even when I horn at him. This is simply ridiculous. But what can us bikers do? Even the TP also cannot do anything to the reckless drivers, so I guess we can't do anything either.<br><br>The most recent case for me was that a super reckless driver continue to cut into my lane ferociously even when I horn at him. I have modified my horn before and the sound is even louder than that of a car but he just don't bother. I mange to chase him and stop at the side of his car. But guess what, he didn't even say sorry despite the fact that I confronted him and it's his fault. He just don't bother about me, like my life is nothing to him. Btw, his license plate is SDN 2583A (Black Toyata Corolla 1.5M). Just want all the brothers here to take note of this reckless driver and becareful when you see this vehicle. The driver has simply no morole.<br><br>Just hope that one day, there will be a better law system to protect us, bikers and I personally find that the punishment for those reckless drivers that cause the death of bikers, are simply too light. From newspapers, those drivers that cause the death of bikers or pedestrians, just being punished by getting their license revoked for a couple of years and fined. That's all they get for causing death to a living person. Does that mean they are driving a car means they are great? The answer is definitely NO.<br><br>To all brothers here, let us all be more careful when we are on the road since we will never know which reckless drivers will knock into us.<br><br></div></blockquote>if i have the time, i will ty to trail the car, note where is its season parking place...<br><br>give this car a new car wash with paint removal chemicals.<br>or a new coat of black paint<br></div>
