            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday, I went home, went to car park, I see my bike scratches on right and left fairing, the security guard tell that someone hits my bike from the right then the bike fall to the left!! Waaah ... I love my bike, only 700km milage, and wash every week, no scratch... but now ...<br>Uh, then I ask the dealer if I want to change the whole fairing, it cost $600-700... so maybe I will repaint it..<br><br>The security guard said, it was a girl (who did it), and if you have friends who knows about this or gossip around abt this(girl after hit motor should not be diam-diam also right?) please inform me ok? My bike is NSR FT plate, my office is opposite Aljuneid MRT station (near shell petrol pump)... She never put note or contact number, it is just irresponsible ...<br><br>Somebody going to respray the bike soon? I have no choice but to respray it... if anybody want, then can respray together, ok? my budget is around $450... (maybe CBR600F4i design - <a href="http://www.cbrworld.net/CBR600/main.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbrworld.net/CBR600/main.htm</a>  )??<br><br>thanks!<br><br>Alex<br><br>[This message has been edited by LexZEUS (edited 12 October 2001).]</div>

I dunno why the guard let her away for nothing ... must ask her the contact number at least... he also rember my plate number, but he don't know the girl's plate number who hit my bike ... siauw ...<br><br>If I can find the girl, can I ask her to pay full repair payment(change fairing, polish this&amp;that), or must half-half? anyway, she is being irresponsible like that... if she refuse to pay, can report to police onot? if report, will she get the fine, and I get the bill to repaoir my bike?<br><br>[This message has been edited by LexZEUS (edited 12 October 2001).]</div>
