It never goes down to lubricate the gears, and the transmission oil (engine oil as you put it) never goes up to lubricate the piston.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I wouldn't agree engine oil in 2-strokes doesn't need to be changed as often as 4-strokers ... when it goes that mileage ... when it gets dirty and loses its function ... definitely have to change ...</strong></blockquote>Well, if you had a 2-stroker and a 4-stroker, and you want to change the engine oil of both bikes at the same interval, it's entirely up to you. But a simple search on Google will show that most bikers agree that transmission oil in 2-stroke bikes has longer "lifetime" compared to its 4-stroke counterpart. This is because it has less task to do, and doesn't get dirty so fast. The task of lubricating the piston is done by 2T oil. Of course you still have to change, but at a longer interval.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I will only say 2-strokes no need to change that much as in the volume of engine oil .....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </strong></blockquote>That's because in 2-strokers it's only used to lubricate the gears. So the volume needed is less. But don't forget the oil needed to lubricate the piston is burnt and has to be topped-up. In my case, I burn 1 litre of 2T oil every 800+ km. So in total a 2-stroker might consume more oil than a 4-stroker does.</div>

But better check your manual book about running in. If it's in Thai, you can still try to figure out the numbers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
