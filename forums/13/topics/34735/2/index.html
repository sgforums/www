            <div class='col-md body'>Cheer up pal!!! Things are bad for the time being onli.  Life is not a bed of roses pal. You have to understand that life is a journey full of obstacles. Nobody is perfect everyone has their own share of problems. Its the degree and magnitude of a problem that ties a person down not the amount. er......a simple life is never possible. Everyone and i mean everyone in the world does not have a rosy life. There is no easy way out.  Even when u are travelling on a road to anywhere, u are bound to face bends, holes in the roads, upslopes, downslopes and narrow roads. U see....there is no such thing as a flat, wide, straight road in the whole world. So wat makes u think that your life will be flat, wide and straight. Tackle your problems the same way you ride on the road. That is, if you face a bend, you can possibly go straight right? So, adapt to your surroundings, be a chameleon. That way, life will be a little easier to handle. I emphatise with your problems in life but remember, empathy and sympathy will not solve your problems. Your own actions will result in your own consequences so, Decide on your actions carefully.
