            <div class='col-md body'>I remember that time ... ha ha h<br><br>My dad kena accident when he rode a bike in his younger days. Ended up the bone in his leg dunno what happened, had to replace with a metal rod. Very bad. So confirmed mum doesn't want me to ride when I grow up.<br><br>I wanted to drive, so got my class 3. But ended up, I was in financial difficulty, so car was out of question. Then influenced by colleague; bike is cheap ... haizz ... so I kena physco and got my 2B. Mum doesn't know until I got my own helmet one day while still having bike lesson. Then the nagging starts, but I din have my bike yet.<br><br>So, after a month or so, I asked my senior to bring me go buy bike. So he burnt a few Saturdays and brought me around bike shop. Before that he was very worried and warned me several times about bikes.<br><br>Then, got my bike ... rode nervously home and quietly got home. Mum din notice. So it went on like dat for a week, until she got suspicious and demanded I bring her go see my bike. She saw already, got very upset, and the daily chanting begun. But also died down very soon. She knew that there's nothing she could do. So ended up telling me to ride carefully every morning when I go to work.<br><br>Just one thing to say lah .... skilled or not skilled also like dat ... when the time comes, and the luck runs out, you just have to go, whether you ride, drive or walk. But whatever you do, do remember that your mum and dad spent some 10 or 20 painstaking years of their life watching you grow up to what you are today. If suddenly, they do lose you one day, you can imagine how devastated they will feel. So try very hard to stay alive, even if you do meet with a litle accident ... touch wood ... hee hee<br><br>[This message has been edited by Noah (edited 03 May 2002).]</div>
