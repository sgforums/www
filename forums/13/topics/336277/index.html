              <p>I'm looking to enrol for a 2B motorbike licence at singapore safety driving centre.<br><br>However, i would like to ask how many tests do i need to take overall?<br><br>as i'm quite unsure of the process of getting the licence.<br><br>and a personal question is, are scooters safer than motorbikes or no?</p>
              <p>i'm also not sure if i can enrol online, or must go down to enrol.</p>

              <p>usually there will be a test for circuit</p>

              <p>finally your traffic police test.</p>

              <p>fast bike can pick up speed when overtaking, or when people playing punk with u, but u will tend to speed, and more speed more dmg. but i personally think maybe faster bikes are safer if the rider is a safe rider.</p>

              <p>Different cc bikes does not make it slow or fast.</p>
              <p>The important issue about bike is not how fast it can go.  Its how fast the bike can pick up when you need to speed up.  Its how the bike respond to you.</p>
              <p>Same with scooters and gear bikes.  Scoots does not have a good rep because new scoots now are auto gears, and if you dont take care of servicing your bike, the auuto gear response kick in slower then most bikes.</p>
              <p>Also, I prefer small cute scoots to bigger scoots cos the wheel base is shorter.  Easier to manuvear the scoot here and there.</p>
              <p>I've also rode big bikes, but thats not a story you need to know now.</p>
              <p>Get your 2b licence first.  Then maybe pick a decent 2b bike for riding around, get to your higher class licence to experience big bikes.</p>
              <p>Anyway, not all big bike licence fellas rides big bikes.  Most of us will have some smaller bikes for relaxed riding.</p>

              <p><br>Then you missed out the real story of someone riding a 1300 cc bike, speed, hit a bump, bike skidded and he broke both his legs when big trucks runs over him and his bike went to hit other cars.</p>

              <p>Thats why personal accident insurance is very important, so is a comprehensive motorcycle insurance.</p>
              <p>Another fellowbiker was on his GS, was hit at the stop line of a traffic junction from the back.</p>
              <p>The impact made him hit his crotch with the tank and the whole crotch sank into his body.  Needed vacumn to pull his errmm......equipments and balls back out.</p>
