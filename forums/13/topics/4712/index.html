Drivers who tailgate slower vehicles are also a common sight.<br><br>In the event that these errant drivers hit another vehicle, both parties usually pull over to the side of the road to sort things out. If the same thing happened to a motorcyclist, blood is often spilt on the road.<br><br>I believe that putting Class 2B trainees through additional courses and tests is not a cure-all.<br><br>The Traffic Police should also look into the need to raise awareness among drivers with regards to proper road etiquette in relation to other road users, be it other drivers, motorcyclists or pedestrians.<br><br>In the end, no matter how many defensive riding courses a motorcyclist takes, all it takes is for a drunk or distracted driver to slam into a motorcyclist from behind, and the result would be fatal.<br><br>CHONG KOK WAY<br><br>*applauses*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all,<br><br>I'm a driver myself, not a rider, but allow me to say a few things which i think, hopefully to any of you, don't think its biased.<br><br>Be it a driver or a rider, we all should be careful on the road. Nobody wanna get into any kind of accident. But humans, to some extend are careless, and we make mistakes, be it the vehicle fault or our own judgement. I make mistakes too, so no excuse for drivers as well. So lets just be more careful on road, be it drivers or riders.<br><br>But i do admit, youngster like us do speed sometimes, i do also, i mean, who don't. So yah, i believe Quak is a bit biased to give such comment.<br><br>But the known fact is motorcyclist is definitely at the losing end, as compare to other vehicles. Its a well known concern for the past years. Chances of them hurting themselves are much much more. So i guess its good to be aware. Esp there are so much of you guys here being riders.<br><br>Those with class 3 and 2B should know there's always one problem with bikes to drivers, that is BLINDSPOT. It happens so many times before, luckily nothing misfortunate happen, thank goodness.<br><br>So, lets all be more careful on road. We are too young to have anything happen to us. There's no difference being a driver or rider, we all are responsible for our own life and faults. Sometime jay walkers caused accident too, dun they, heh........<br><br>I really hope these pple will stop complaining over the newspaper, its so 'unhealthy' for all road users, that is.<br><br>Regards<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to agree with Atti, the driver becomes very dangerous when they do not check blindspot. I have kena from drivers who do not check blindspot many times when I was driving, I have been on the road for 7 yrs and I know all their stupid patterns esp those who drive big cars or or cars or female drivers.<br><br>The most dangerous drivers I have experienced are the female( those rich tai tais) driving big cars, they drive as if they own the whole farking rd. very very dangerous.<br><br>That is why when I squeeze in between cars during jams, I on my high beam, so that at least the driver who have an intention to change lane will be aware of my presence due to my high beam. Also nother feature is to change to a louder horn. Car horns have no problem, but bike horns (small cc bikes esp) tend to be soft. I have incidents where I press and hold onto my horn for 4-5 secs, the drivers still ignore, or act blur and continue to cut into my path. Luckily I have anticipated his move, so I was able to brake completely in time. I pass him and go parellel to him and give him a long hard stare, dare not even look over here.<br><br>As I have learnt in the defensive driving course, 'accidents are usually not caused by you, but casued onto you, so you must anticipate every driver/rider's move even if he seems to be cautious, cos drivers have their bad days too'<br><br>[This message has been edited by lanxx (edited 29 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the main problem abt accidents on the road is very commonly associated with errand road users be it a driver or rider or maybe a harmless looking pedestrian/jaywalker.<br><br>There shouldn't be any part of the society taking the entire blame for the increasing accident statistics. So it will be unfair for anyone to pin-point at riders or drivers. Just because death tolls on m/cyclists are increasing doesn't mean that riders alone are the cause of the accidents.<br><br>I cannot deny the fact that if the rider who did not get involved in a particular accident does not exist, the accident would've been avoided. But we should also consider the liabilities of the other party who is also involved. (eg. car &amp; bike collision) So i agree with some of your points here that motorcycle deaths due to accidents are not only contributed by the m/cyclist himself.<br><br>Therefore we should look at this matter in a more subjective point of view. Be it a car or bike. Or even a lorry or a pedestrian. We must always exercise caution on the road because the road is not a ractrack where we can do almost anything just to be in front.</div>
