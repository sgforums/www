Juz use soap with water can liao lah, unless it's tough stain then use a bit of WD40, but make sure hose with lots of water after that coz it's too strong for a cleaning component. For lubing the chain, wait till it's totally dry if not the lub will fly all over to your rims. If can , the best is ride a few rounds and make sure the chain is warm enuff for the lub to stick onto it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

For lubing your chain if you know how to tilt your bike with your side stand then it will be easier to do it on your own. Tilt your bike using your side stand and hold the bike using your right hand. Use your leg to turn the wheel. This is what I do when i'm alone lor. But be careful coz it might be heavy when you not used to holding the bike.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>my advice is:<br><br>1) first to wash, the chain. Use kerosene or diesel or any fancy chain washing cleaner from watever fancy brands, although the former is recommended. After you finish washing the chain with a soft brush and cloth, proceed to ride your bike slowly ard the carpark to fling off the excess kerosene.<br><br>2) Proceed to wash your bike top-down. If your swingarm is dirty with the grease and such, use kerosene dapped onto cloth and wipe it off. Rims, swingarms, anything. Use soap to rinse that oily film off. Rinse off all soapy substances with water.<br><br>3) Let dry. Proceed to wax the paintwork parts. Let the wax dry up. Here's a dilemma, you wan shine or comfort? If you wan shine, wax your bike under hot sun. Else, do it in shade at ur own comfort. Next proceed to wipe all parts that doesnt need to wax and polish with autosol/brasso for those chrome parts. After polishing the chrome parts, apply a layer of wax for more longer lasting shine. (dun wipe off first). Proceed back to the paintwork waxed, wipe off the wax with a clean soft wiping cloth. After its done, the chrome parts waxed shd be dry too, wipe the wax off too.<br><br>4) put under sun for awhile, so the chain dru up easier. When the chain is really dry, apply chainlube/oil and let it rest for some time to allow the wax/oil to settle in on the chain.<br><br>5) drool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to use buckets of water, detergent,etc,etc to clean but I found out, also not safe. Bike is metal and metal will rust. So bike and water don't mix at all.
