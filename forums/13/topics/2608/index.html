Never heard of it leh...<br>AFAIK, choke doesn't do anything fancy, it'll just reduce the air intake, hence enriching the fuel mixture. It's necessary when the engine is still cold. After a minute or two, choke can be disabled, then you can continue warming the bike for another minute. Then can start moving slowly, increase the RPM bit by bit until the engine reaches the normal running temperature.<br><br>If the bike can't start in the morning without choke, I think it's quite normal. Some big bikes have automatic choke, which will be automatically enabled when the needed. Of course the bike designers wouldn't make it that way if there'll be problem in the future, would they?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
