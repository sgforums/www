In foreign countries, bigger bikes are all over the place, some pple even find 250 as authentic endangered species. And playing bikes or even to the extend to exploit the bike fully is something which most people does. But to Singaporeans, not all people can get to ride a 'big bull'. The smaller biker if has the background of gangsterism, cannot afford to lose 'shu bu qi' will go around smashing bikes which I think is the ultimate lack of sportsmanship. However, there are still some 'big bulls' who do not cherish themselves go around showing off thus inviting unwanted trouble.<br><br>Anyway, class 2 or 2B, only the difference in size performance and price. If a TZM crashes into a tree at 120kph, the rider is going to die. A R1 crashes into a tree at 120kph, do you think the rider is going to survive?
