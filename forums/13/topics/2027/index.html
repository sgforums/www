Just my thots, since he is going fast, he also might need to change lane too, he follow you cos itz like you 'open the way' for him. In another words, he follow your lead.<br><br>But doesn't means hecan tailgate you. Thatz where he did worng. Did he overtake you? Hope he don't if you are not going too slow. I always respect class 2 bikes. I wun overtake them unless the speed they travel is uncomfortable for me.<br><br>Just my thoughts...

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a 2B rider. True, sometimes I follow behind a vehicle because it opens the way for me. That is if he is faster than me, but I do keep my distance when travelling fast.<br><br>I will overtake any vehicle (except TP car ... hee hee ..) where possible to maintain my speed. I will actually switch over to the next lane completely before coming back although it was possible for me to squeeze pass the vehicle in the same lane. Of course if I have to switch lane too many times, I'll just stay in the lane.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course managed to keep cool lah.<br>Anyway, i think a lot of 2b n 2a riders when get lic all very fierce, i was once at these stages.<br>Maybe humans are like that lah, bike powerful, must wreak!<br>Last time when i 2B that time, was riding a hornet125. Damm this bike is useless, always let aprilla, sp, tzm even rxz lap me.<br>Then the mind set was, "Don't let me get 2a, if not sure lap u all"<br>Haha, when i got my 2A and got a 400, these bike were all my target. I would do all kind of stunts like zoom pass at high speed at their blind spot, boy it was fun. Don't say i bully small bike, when u were torture by those 2b bike, then u would think it is pay back time. (U wouldn't understand till you get a 2A bike, always must be in front of other bikes) Hehe, cannot lose face, must be in front<br>Just after 3 mths of aggressive riding, was caught by the law. Deduct 18 points nearly kantong, went to appeal mp, end up deduct 12 points. So left 0 point for the rest of the year, haha, maybe this is call "Retribution".<br>But u can only blame yourself for the playfulness.<br>Maybe when u have bypass a lot of stages then u will know that your lic is actually very previous.<br>Now, When i riding on S'pore road, be it fast cars or bikes who zoom pass me, i would tell myself, Maybe this guy on a rush or something like that lah. Try to think in another way, and you would live to ride another day. As if you want to play and got caught or accident. You can only blame yourself, remember the finger pointing.<br>One finger point people and three other fingers point back to yourself.<br>Don't say i ride my bike don't speed, everyone like to speed, just that i chose to do it at NS highway. Get caught the most pay the "fine" on the spot.<br>Am welcome to bring anyone there to speed till you get bored.<br><br>Thanks all for reading my story.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the best solution to all these is to just let them be. Whoever that comes at you to irritate you on the road, just ignore them. Be it bigger CC bikes or smaller ones.<br><br>Ultimately, they are the ones who will lose out. Coz they are riding recklessly, so the risks of accidents are higher.<br><br>If they dun treasure their lives and come to fool around wif you on the road, it's their problem when something happens to them.</div>

Either a RXZ or Lau K. 2B is the time where u gain road experience, there sure to be buangs. Getting a faring bike, if buang sure faring kenna. Then $$ to respray or repair.<br>For road bike, cheap cheap only.

Its Dangerous if its quite near, u will never know that he might sudden brake or try to avoid a stone or whatever. You behind him might concentrate more on him then the road condition. Then You might crash onto him or self-skid. Always give yourself some allowance and distance. You don't know when you would perform E-Brake rite?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>
