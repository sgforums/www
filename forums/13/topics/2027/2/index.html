I dun really understand why ppl have this kind of thinking over class 2B riders... Those riding class 2A/2 would say that those class 2B bikers act sud to pull a wheelie in front of them than they'll bypass the 2B biker at a very fast speed... Or should i say slice them? If want to challange also must pick one of yr own size mah... No sportsmanship! Dun "chen ren zhi wei" mah... I'm juz giving my points of view...

In foreign countries, bigger bikes are all over the place, some pple even find 250 as authentic endangered species. And playing bikes or even to the extend to exploit the bike fully is something which most people does. But to Singaporeans, not all people can get to ride a 'big bull'. The smaller biker if has the background of gangsterism, cannot afford to lose 'shu bu qi' will go around smashing bikes which I think is the ultimate lack of sportsmanship. However, there are still some 'big bulls' who do not cherish themselves go around showing off thus inviting unwanted trouble.<br><br>Anyway, class 2 or 2B, only the difference in size performance and price. If a TZM crashes into a tree at 120kph, the rider is going to die. A R1 crashes into a tree at 120kph, do you think the rider is going to survive? So whats the difference.<br><br>Of course everyone prefers to ride a bigger bike. So why not all riders show our sportsmanship on the track, courtesy on the road. It'll make our riding world a more pleasant place.</div>
