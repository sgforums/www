              <p>Other shops, you can try Chiap Lee or MotoWorld. There are many more other shops but I'm not familiar with them.</p>
              <p>Why would you want a open face Arai or Shoei? IMO they won't protect as well as some budget brands full face. I am not sure of the price of open face the 2 brands but it would probably cost $300 at least?</p>
              <p>I will recommend you to put the money to better use and with that amount, you can already get yourself a pretty decent full face helmet (OGK, HJC etc.). If you have no budget constraints, a Shoei X-11 full face helmet will cost around $500 - $600 if I'm not wrong.</p>

              <p>Good advice there, bro. Think I'll whack one cheaper helmet to see me through the learner phase.</p>
              <p>Was looking at Honda's site, I'm a li'l drawn to CBR125R.... But nono, it's not that I want, put into consideration, my personality and pillion's safety...</p>
              <p>Bro, if you don't mind humoring a newbie.. What are your thoughts on CBF150 and XL 125 Valadero?</p>

              <p>What about pillion's safety for the CBR125? It was one of my considerations when I got my 2b last time. Sport-ish look with very good fuel consumption, just that the bike looks too thin which makes it very ugly.</p>
              <p>CBF150 is a roadbike with excellent fuel consumption as well. Though I think you can only see Ah peks riding them, it is definitely an economical bike which can bring you from point A to point B and it will not look weird with box.</p>
              <p>The Varadero would be my choice amoung these few as it's the best looking! Big body which makes it look like some higher class license bike. I am not sure how it performs and how's the fuel consumption though, probably more ex in terms of everything. However, it sure looks stable and comfortable for both the pillion and rider. If you're also into touring, I think this bike would be the one for you.</p>

              <p>The only 200cc bike I can think of is the Phantom TA200. Good bike which can fit boxes and good fuel efficiency too. However, Heard that once it goes up to 100km/h and higher it will vibrate alot, but well, almost all 2b bikes have irritating vibrations given their small CC.</p>
              <p>Yes Ah Boy sells almost everything!</p>

              <p>Bro, would TA200 be too ah peh in your opinion?</p>
              <p>What other 200cc bikes are there to pick from?</p>
              <p>What's the estimated cost of a well-maintained TA200? How bout first hand?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(Read a lot of bad reviews on TA200 and phantom in general, to do with bad steering, brakes and a heavy rear... Would love your views as well)</p>

              <p>Nope, not Ah Pek to me at all. Another one of my choices when I wanted to get my first bike last time.</p>
              <p>Not too sure what other 200cc are there, but a 200cc bike does not mean it is faster than one with lesser CC. If comparing a 200cc phantom with a 150cc phantom, the 150cc will be faster because of the 2-strokes.</p>
              <p>Second hand TA200 is probably less then 2K? I am not sure of the current market price for 2nd hand and brand new as I did not own it before.</p>
              <p>I can't really comment much on the performance of it as I never had the chance to ride it. Only read that it skids easily on wet roads as the rear brakes are too powerful. But I think that no matter what bike, you will be good as long as you are used to it and know how to control it well.</p>
              <p>If Phantom is a lousy bike, you will not see so many of them on the road. So there must be some plus points on it as well.</p>
