That's why i save my speed after i've crossed the causeway.<br><br>And if you're gonna be a pillion, he better be cautious, because i believe if i were to get into an accident, i rather get into one by myself.<br><br>Do not compromise the safety of the pillion because if you make a mistake, its not one life, its two.</div>

If he is in speeding mood, even on a Vespa he can also speed and had an accident *cross finger*<br><br>As a gf, there is nuting much we can do. If we put ourselve in their shoes, it is their passion to ride, we should not stop them but in fact encourage them. But if the bf really care abt us, they shld put themselve in our shoes, and ride carefully and safetly.<br><br>If you are really worry abt him, let him know your worries and try to work things out.</div>
