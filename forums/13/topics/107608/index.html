            <div class='col-md body'>Every motorcyclist who starts riding will go through 2 dangerous phases on his way to becoming an experienced rider. Hopefully... they survive these 2 phases or else they would stop riding totally either because they are dead or the fear stops them or the parents put an end to their biking dreams.<br><br>Phase One.<br><br>They get into accidents because of the lack of knowledge of the behaviour of other road users. To ride too defensively sometimes has a negative effect. It takes guts, I mean it, guts to ride on Singapore roads. If you don't have guts then its better not to ride. I am an aggressive rider, meaning I signal very clearly to vehicles that I am making the move and they should give way to me.<br>I have seen too many accidents which were the result of both parties being hesitant about who should give way to who. And yeah.... if you do not have eye contact with the other driver, he has definitely NOT seen you. Looking at your direction is not enough.... this is what makes motorcylists think that the car has stopped at the junction but it suddenly comes out into their path. And after the collision the driver will tell you that he did not see you.<br><br>They get into accidents because they do not know how to read the road conditions. Those who like to ride close to the road shoulders are the most at risk. Loose sand and gravel will always collect there. Try doing an e brake there and chances are you will go down real quick should you turn the steering. Always take corners as close to the inside as possible. Diesel and loose stuff are always flung to the outside of a corner. And yeah... ride with your nose... you can smell diesel before you see it.<br><br>They get into accidents because they do not know how to handle their machines and its capabilities. The need to learn the technique of hitting the rear brakes only after they have hit the front brakes. It is not easy to skid while doing hard straight line front braking... but hell you can sure lock the back brakes real easy. 70% of the stopping power comes from the front brakes and all the weight is shifted to the front during hard braking so the back brakes are literally useless. 90% of my braking is with the front brakes.<br>In case you don't know, that is why the front has the big 2 discs and the rear a small disc. Most new riders fear hitting hard on the front brakes... they need to overcome this fear.<br><br>They need to overcome the fear of hearing the engine revs going high when they downshift. Some sayang their bike so much that they try not to over rev the engine. If you go round a sweeping corner in top gear.... chances are you will drift outwards. Closing the throttle at that time does not help... on top gear there is no engine braking and the bike won't slow down and that is when the new bike rider starts to panic. What rpm is the best for engine braking.... go check the brochure. It is where the max torque of the engine is being produced, for some bikes that is around 6000 to 7000 rpm. If you too sayang to hear the engine screaming at that rpm, don't ride fast in Malaysia and stay away from the Pasir Gudang or Sepang tracks.<br><br>Phase 2<br><br>A short but more deadlier phase. It is overconfidence and complacency time.<br>They think they are Nicky Haydens, Max Biaggis and Valentino Rossis.<br>Hopefully they come to grips with their OWN personal limits before they kill themselves. Once they have scared the shits out of themselves a few times and lived to talk about it... they have become true blue bike riders.<br><br>Ride smart. Ride safe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Front break is for stopping while rear break is to stabilise the bike. Apply these 2 break correctly and you will not skid on a straight road.<br><br>If you are too fast approaching a corner, do a hard braking on the front follow by light pressure of the rear break about approximately 1 sec after you use the front break.<br><br>Do not clutch in first at this point. Clutch in only when you are about 3-5 meters from the corner. shift to lower gear and release the clutch. at this point of time the bike will start to wobble...that's where your rear break comes in handy. apply LIGHT pressure on rear break to stabilise it.<br><br>Front break, rear break and lower gear engine breaking when apply together correctly, you can stop in time or slow the bike to desire level.</div>

That will allow you to use the engine braking to slow you enough without you touching your rear brakes. Front brakes can be used deep into the corners but never the rear.<br><br>Pulling the clutch just before entering a high speed corner to downshift is guaranteed to send the bike right across the corner in a straight line!!! The machine will refuse to lean over.<br><br>Touching the rear brakes in the middle of a high speed corner is totally suicidal, the back end will go.<br><br>When your bike wobbles in a corner, it has something to do with your suspension set up. Too soft on the damping, or too much preload.<br><br></div>
