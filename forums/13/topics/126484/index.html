            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to hear what had happened, but in the case, the chances of you winning the case is quite low. Even if you employ a lawyer, which may cause thousands of dollars, and you might not win this case. What's more, you might end up paying for the repairs and lawyer fees. Reason being simple that in S'pore, pedestrians are always having the right of way, as they're the most vulnerable road users on the road in comparison.<br><br>This kind of shit always happens, especially in places like Geylang, Little India (worst of all as those workers think Little India = INDIA!), Orchard etc etc. So always keep a lookout for those lim-bei-owe-the-road pedestrians.<br><br>You can try fighting this case, but do consult your friends in the legal field and ask for their advice to see if it is wise to take up this case. However, if there are no parties seriously injured, and the degree of damage to the bike is not high. you may consider heading their advice...<br><br>Good Luck!<br><br></div>
