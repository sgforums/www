Can anyone enlighten me?<br>Does this mean that interest will be calculated from the remaining unpaid installments every year?<br><br>Eg : Need to pay $2000 altogether. So $2000 + 10% = $2200. Lets say first year manage to pay only $1000, left over of $1200. Interest 10% added on this again? Which means remaning debt is $1200 + $120 = $1320.<br><br>Is that how it works?<br><br>One more thing. If someone is selling off his bike that still has installments to clear, why do we need to pay a certain sum to the owner b4 taking over? What does the money given to the owner include? Insurance? Settlement fee? Or what?<br></div>
