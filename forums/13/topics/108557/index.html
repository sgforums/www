Seconds later, Mr Tann heard a 'very loud' bang.<br><br>According to eyewitnesses, after the bus left its lane, the cyclists were forced to slow down and shift further to the left.<br><br>Another member of the group said: 'Some (cyclists) were squeezed onto the grass patch... we were forced to bunch up together.'<br><br>Some cyclists shouted at the driver to slow down, but in vain.<br><br>The bus hit Mr Ang and dragged him for about 7m as it swerved back into its lane and stopped.<br><br>According to the cyclists, Mr Ang's pelvic and left thigh region was stuck under the wheel of the bus.<br><br>Said one of them, who declined to be named: 'His helmet was in pieces and his left leg was totally smashed. One of the riders who attended to him was a plastic surgeon. He told us not to touch his body.'<br><br>Right after the accident, the bus driver was seen shaking his head and making calls on his cellphone. None of the passengers, believed to be tourists, got off the bus, said the cyclists.<br><br>Together with the police, the SCDF arrived about 15 minutes later and rescued Mr Ang, using airbags to jack up the bus, said an SCDF spokesman.<br><br>Mr Ang is now in intensive care. He is believed to have suffered severe head trauma, punctured lungs and multiple fractures to his lower limbs.<br><br>The bus driver is now assisting police in investigations.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr Ang's family and friends are keeping vigil at his ward.<br><br>Said one of his cycling mates: 'When we train together, he never gives up. Even when he is falling behind, he keeps pedalling, and the next thing you know, he is beside you again. But this must be the hardest race of his life.'<br><br>Safety advice<br><br># Wear a helmet and check brakes and tyres.<br><br># Obey all traffic rules.<br><br># Use hand signals when changing lanes.<br><br># Have lights at night.<br><br><strong></strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </span></div>
