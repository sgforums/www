            <div class='col-md body'>ok here comes, enjoy<br><br>Your Fortune Cookie says....<br>----------------------------<br>Congratulations! You are Nastro Azzurro part 2... The Second Coming of a rolling Italian BEER advertisement. Since cigarettes ads are banned in SG, you are henceforth, lucky not to have the Chesterfield stickers on your bike, which surprisingly goes by unnoticed by our ever (un)popular and wise MITA. On the other hand, Nastro Azzurro when translated into English could also mean -Nasty Asshole-, in which I finally get the revelation why taxis and other bikers always gave me the BIRD salute when they passed me by...<br><br>Your bike also confuses stupid passerby uncles who ask "Eh, your motorbike use Diesel ah?" because of the brand Advert DIESEL which is found on your front fairing. These geriatrics are high on their Metamucil medication and Tiger beer, so they take everything at face value and would never suspect DIESEL is a brand of clothing, much less "CHESTerfield" is not a topless female football team...<br><br>Next, IP is Italian Petroleum, which is the sponsored or recommended lubricant behind Aprilia, just like Shell is for Ferrari, and KY-Jelly is for SEX.<br><br>Playstation... An entertainment videogame console for the family. Seemingly popular among bikers and GP racers. I don't know why... Maybe BBDC should consider using Playstation EA Superbike 2001 as their main simulator instead of that stupid $200,000 piece of shit simulator from Honda that has crap graphics dated back to 1990 and the bonus "Wind-in-your-hair" effect.<br><br>Denso is a brand of Japanese spark plugs. It actually means Dense... slang term for stupid in English. But then again, you know the Japanese... Always 'O'ing their way around town.... Example : "Where-O is-O the toilet-O? I-O want-O to take a shit-O. Bah Ge rO!" So you see... these guys are just plain dense-O...<br><br>BREIL... Truth be told, not many people here really knows what the hell is a Breil. I suppose it's a lubricant too or some brand of oil. HEY! Of course it would be some kind of OIL! What else? Shampoo? Soap? Hair Conditioner? For Gawd sakes... it's bike related of course and the only liquids found in bikes besides the coolant would be oils. Then again, BREIL could be related to BRAIL, which is the form of textual communication for the blind... Ehh... you know, the one where they put their fingers on some paper or surface that has miniscule bumps so they can read. Wow... this would mean that your bike is certified safe for blind riders to operate. Try this next time... Use the "Bak Chew Tah Stamp" theory. Stick stamps over your eyes, and ride the bike. USE THE FORCE, LUKE!<br><br>Finally, DUNLOP. That sponsor found at the base of your side fairings. It's *deep breath* a TYRE brand. Yep... that's right... take a look... it's down there. Many people think Dunlop is pronounced as DUHN-LORP... Dunlop.... But actually it is pronounced as Don't Lob. Example... Don't Lob your bike, mate... British term "Lob" means buang. So by using Dunlops, you're guaranteed not to lob your bike even if you make 120 radius corners at 300kph. Millenium tyre technology... it's faaaaaantastic!<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>part 2<br><br>Your Fortune Cookie says<br>------------------------<br>MOTOREX, a brand of high-performance motorcycle oils. It's different from MotorUp, which professes to be an additive or subtitute for normal 4T. It is named MotorUp because of several reasons. One is, once used, your Motor will literary go UP in smoke; Two, upon using it in your MOTOR, its time is UP... and etc.. And now... MotorEx... Why is it named MotorEx? For the simple reason that people who display this sticker know that someday, they will say, "That's an Ex-Motor (As in ex-girlfriend). Yes sir... It used to be a motorcycle before I high-sided hard enuff for it to re-enter the atmosphere."<br><br>Next, we shall look at other stickers normally found on Suzuki bikes.<br><br>TELEFONICA MOVISTAR. An European telecommunications company no doubt... but it could also be a cover for Movie and Porn stars having cybersex over the IRC. Yes! It's true, it's true... It's all hidden in the name... 'cos they had to alter it to make it legal. According to the registry, they were once registered as TELE-FORNICATING MOVIE-STARS. Don't be surprised that riders of bikes with this schema on will one day receive a phone call from J. Lo trash talking you. And so, the hymen in your ear ruptures...<br><br>CLARION is popularly known as a brand of car audio speakers. It is also related to hotels, software developers and whatnots. But ultimately, the Oracle deduces that on bikes, Clarion is actually a nasal de-congestant for bikers. YES! It's for bikers that forget to put their visor down, allowing fo flies, insects, sand and other shit to fly right into the helmet and up the rider's nose. AAAA-CHOOOOO!!<br>"Hey! You need CLARION and I'll sponsor it for you if you stick the product name on your bike..." A done deal! Jesus... What's next?? Vicks Ducati? Tiger Balm Honda? Wait! I know... Axe Oil Aprilia!<br><br>CORONA Extra is a Mexican beer. Just like Nastro Azzurro is an Italian beer, so I guess bikes bearing this banner are in a way, potential drink-riders on the road. While Nastro Azzurro, (See the 3rd posting of this thread) in English could mean "Nasty Asshole", CORONA is a self-advertisement for "COckhead Riding ON A"... and there it is... your bike. So I guess Corona on Suzuki means Cockhead Riding on a Suzuki. Here comes the "Extra" bit. This is only for the top koteks. People think it's an extra strong beer... maybe it is... EXTRA COckhead Riding ON A &lt;Your Bike&gt;.. 'cos the more you drink, the more of a kotek you become.<br><br>And now, Suzuki's proprietry SRAD. It's not a sponsor. It's actually a technology that Suzuki uses. Suzuki Ram Air Direct. Force more air into an airbox and boost the bike's power. More power... more speed... Yeah... Vrrroooom.... And the rider realises that the next bend is coming up fast and he was too busy reading the speedo the see it. Which is why people says it has a double meaning. Suzuki Riders Always Die... because the power of the Ram Air entices them to take their eyes off the road to look at the speedo long enuff to overshoot their braking point... So Ram-Air riders, do keep your eyes off your dash on on the road.<br><br>So that's all I gather about stickers found on Suzooks<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If your camp near to Tuas still can. If not this place is quite out of the way. Everyday go to office also damn sian because so ulu and so far and no chio bu.<br><br>My office is in Tuas. Exact address is No. 6 Tuas South Street 2. If you travel by AYE (Jurong),exit at exit no.24. At TIGER Beer there, turn left into Tuas West Road. (If you go straight, you will end up in the Second Link.) After turning left, start counting the number of cross junction you will pass. On the 7th Juction, turn left into Tuas South Street 2.<br><br>All are most welcome to visit our office and warehouse. Although this place may be quite ulu and out of the way, Feng125 (Ricky) came by the other day.  He lost his direction halfway but i manage to find him and lead him to my place. He said he has not seen so much oil before. But I every day see so much oil until damn sianz.If you guys can come round, please swing by. AT least it give you confidence that the oil is not chiong one. But do ride safely because the road here is very bumpy (especially 2nd Lane from the left) and got many big lorry.<br><br>In case any one interested in coming,  call me @9757 4319 or 862 4733 first to confirm i am around first. I am normally back in the office after 4:00 pm.</div>
