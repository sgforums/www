            <div class='col-md body'>as for the plan, take out the salesman part, you wouldn't want him recognizing anyone. at least henry will be "clean" from the thing should any trouble brews. if really want, keep a look out "ba feng", and warn each other by handphone lor..<br><br>for the irc part, use dialup, and not cable, because the fixed IP address can be logged. given that this guy is such a pervert, he may very well log all the irc chats he has. if it turns out to be something serious like an official police enquiry, SCV can trace the IP address to the user's house.<br><br>skip the blackmail, since you know he's not paying. not worth risking if the idiot decides to call the police. for a blackmail case, they just might investigate. at least the bike damage got no proof or anything they can pin on you.<br><br>sigh.. do it if you must, but be careful and cover yourself well.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>------------------<br>rock hard... ride free...<br><br>[This message has been edited by l3stat (edited 31 May 2002).]</div>

(but u can pretend not to listen) cos what they say may not be true...<br><br>ppl can decide for themselve, they are not small kids, u dun have to decide what best for others... tt's selfish act<br><br>I really dun like all these lor... all those kind of words tt say i dun like so and so, i wanna screw up so n so...<br><br>do u all really like to see ppl break off??<br><br>ppl may not be gd to u, (think) there must be someone making some kind of decision tt hurt u lor, and tt might be ur loved one...<br>[U]I find[/U] tt most of the time, it is always ur loved one hurt u most.<br><br>then now who to blame? ur loved one? and the case is tt we always blame someone tt we dun really care or love... although our loved one hurt us...<br><br>i wish u guys better luck next time...<br><br>Fall in love... u also know how to say fall in love... tt's FALL in love lor... those who in love sometimes will experience it lor...  FALL down lor...get it?? fall down then stand up again lor... try hard, try harder n harder n harder....<br><br>( i m sure some of u dun agree with what i said one... then shoot me back... i dun live to please ppl... but as a friend here, i must tell u, u are not alone when u face problems in life... but taking revenge is not a gd way)<br><br></div>
