FJT and eversuccess just have lower prices because that's where every other shop in SG gets their parts from. it's cheaper, compared to getting it from your regular mototiam.<br><br>i've seen far too many NSRs left to dust at shops just because they're waiting for those bloody pistons to be flown in from japan.<br><br>i'm not gonna go into a debate over octane ratings with you, go read the older threads if you wanna see my reasoning.<br><br>all clutch plates go through wear and tear, the dry plates just happen to do it slightly faster, but even then it'll take a year at least with extreme riding to even grind it to dust. you're putting it as through i need to change my plates every month.<br><br>i dislike KRR purely because it's ugly, same reason why i dislike aprilia, vespa, scramblers, lao Ks etc. performance is secondary.<br><br>i've never compared the NSR to a 2b bike, get that clear. there are many many people out there that believe that their STOCK 2b bike is faster than the STOCK NSR, precisely because the NSR is cut at 180kmh, while they can exceed 200.<br><br>a 150 maybe fast, especially if you throw in the heavy mods, then you should compare it to a 250 with heavy mods as well, rather than compare it to a stock one. and please don't give me crap like "it's the rider not the bike". we're talking about the bike, not the rider.</div>
