            <div class='col-md body'>saw this article off another forum<br>might be good for all of us to read this<br><br>This has been taken off BikeNet  <a href="http://www.bikenet-racing.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bikenet-racing.com/</a><br>Most riders are pretty good at basic machine control Â– itÂ’s normally hazards on the roads that catch us out, or to put it another way, other drivers and road users. Most car drivers are nice enough people but are just a bit thick. Oh and theyÂ’re all nearly blind too Â– at least when it comes to bikes. The only way to keep safe around cars is to avoid them like the plague and assume that the drivers are not going to see you. When you see them at junctions expect them to pull out in front of you. When you pass them in traffic, expect them to u-turn across your path. By building up this level of expectation, you will naturally begin to react to events that may never happen. When they do of course you will have been a little more ready, slowing a little, giving a wider berth perhaps and so more likely to survive.<br><br>Whenever possible try to safely overtake cars and other vehicles. They can do a lot less harm 100 yards behind you than they can in front, so the best bet is to get past them. Remember to hang back from trucks and caravans etc, so that you have a clear view past them. If you sit on their tail you wonÂ’t be able to see round them and they wonÂ’t know you are there. If you approach a left hand bend, you can move into the kerb to see round the lorry, you will be able to see up the inside.<br><br>You also need to remember that riders can go so quickly that car drivers simply have no concept of how fast you are moving. If you are doing 150 mph donÂ’t be surprised if the car driver pulls across in front of you as you overtake. When he checked his mirror you may well have been a dot in the distance Â– if youÂ’ve never been at high speeds you have no concept of them!<br><br>When pulling out to overtake always indicate and make sure you sit in full view of the cars mirrors with your indicator on for a second or two to be sure he sees you. This is a good time to remember the passing light that most bikes are now fitted with.<br><br>If youÂ’re overtaking a line of traffic watch out for gaps in it. TheyÂ’ve usually been left by someone for a car to pull out of a side road or car park. You donÂ’t want to be there when they do!<br><br>You need to be most vigilant if youÂ’re on the roads just before dawn<br>(Most drivers are sleepy, in a hurry or both...Riders could also be sleepy, in a hurry or both)<br>Birds are a real problem as the airflow round a bike will often not be enough to divert them as it does with a car. Most birds will crack a fairing if they hit it, but if they hit you at 70 mph they hurt like hell. A large bird in the face is almost certainly going to result in hospital care.<br><br>The last and often worst hazard is all the mates you go riding with. There are a few simple rules for riding in groups:<br><br>DONÂ’T show off! It always leads to problems. If youÂ’re not confident enough to ride without trying to impress your friends, then either get new friends or stop riding.<br><br>If you are behind other riders keep your eye on the road ahead of him. For some reason his back tyre will become fascinating but if you are looking there youÂ’ll hit him if he brakes hard. Look ahead at the road. At night hang a bit further back and look at his headlights to see the road ahead.<br><br>The safest place to be is at the back of a group so that you can see all the mistakes they make (but of course they cannot see you so you can be a riding god) and react to them well in advance. If you cannot keep up then fall back Â– donÂ’t try to keep up with people who ride faster than you or the conditions allow. It really is better to be last than dead.<br><br>Remember, you are more likely to have an accident in towns than countryside so you need to be very wary in built up areas. Nearly 40 % of all bike accidents happen at T-junctions so watch out here most of all.<br><br>One final word Â– about 4 years ago a chap got off his bike doing 140 mph on the motorway. He was in a critical condition for several weeks but finally recovered. When interviewed as to what caused the accident he revealed that he had simply stepped off the bike. An over use of Play Station games had led him to, whilst dozed by the hypnotic monotony of the motorway, believe he was playing Â“bike racer 73Â” and decide to stop and go to the loo or something. If you are a sad game player Â– make sure you take a reality check before jumping onto your bike.<br><br>------------------<br>************************************************<br><br>(C)copyright 2001.josean PTE LTD.All Rights Reserved.<br><br>************************************************</div>
