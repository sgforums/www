But as long as u build up a relationship with a certain bike shop, normally the prices go down, and the servicing becomes better. I choose loois motor coz of the superb servicing and chief mechanic there called Ah MEng or Meng Tong.. he tunes very well and i dare to claim he is the best in singapore at the moment. Unity motor is also quite good located at alexandra village, Ah Hsiong from malaysia is the chief mech there, although he is quite young to be a chief mech, at least he is dedicated to help your bike meet its full potential. Alex from MotorSalesCentre at ubi is also superb, and plus point, they have a dyno machine there to see how much horsepower your bike is putting out... that certainly helps to know if you are getting what u want. Kuang tai lee to me is a nice frenly shop if u know alex but otherwise i cant say much for the tuning. there are other good shops around but you will have to check them out and bond wif the mechanics there first. Sporting motorcycles at lavender is a good shop for learning about track especially pasir gudang and sepang. they dont really service bikes but they do have engine oil 2t and bike accesorries tyres etc... i trust them enuff, though some things are pricier, at least i can talk to JOE and learn about how to corner faster and which lines to take in the track. i think he does about 1min 42 on the ave at pasir gudang and thats good enuff for me! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span><br><br>ps whatever the case is, make sure ur mechanic is good, some shops have good bike price, but have no good mechanics at all! whats the point of getting ur bike 500 cheaper at one shop only to have to spend about 1000 of repairs later on coz of FAKEY bike diagnostics??? makes sense? battery weak they ask u change starter motor, brake pads faulty they ask u change brake disc. etc etc.. especially for the newer riders...<br><br>some shops bike price more ex, but they got super mechanics there like those u watch on tv that can spot a problem just by hearing your engine rev... hahahah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Its your bike, u decide....<br><span style="color: yellow;">_____/</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
