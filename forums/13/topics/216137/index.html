            <div class='col-md body'>Today, I witnessed an accident while I was taking my Class 2B Practical 8 at SSDC, Yio Chu Kang .<br><br>As part of the road test route, we riders are required to do a U - Turn at a traffic light controlled junction around AMK ave 5 .<br><br>Though the light was green, there was oncoming traffic and a SSDC car had to wait at the U-turn section. We riders had to line up behind the SSDC car.<br><br>When the SSDC car inched forward, it made a wide turn and stopped halfway through the turn to give way to an oncoming car in the 3rd lane.<br><br>The 1st rider in the queue suddenly throttled forward and squeezed himself between the SSDC car and the kerb, intending to do the U- Turn before the Car could do so (in short, he was "cutting queue " ) .<br><br>As he opened the throttle further and zipped into the 2nd lane, a taxi suddenly appeared and slammed into his bike!<br><br>The driver probably didn't saw him(he was hidden from the cabbie's view, thanks to the SSDC car ) and couldn't brake in time.<br><br>The impact was rather bad, the driver's side window was completely smashed in, the front right headlight of the taxi was hanging loose and there was a nasty dent and some scratches on the taxi's door.<br><br>The bike was wrecked with 1 crash bar crumpled.<br><br>The instructors immediately told us to move to a side of the road as they brought the rider and the bike to the pavement.<br><br>After the road was cleared, 1 instructor led us back to the driving centre as a medic was sent for the injured rider who was still concious.<br><br>Later at the school, we found out that the crash bar had took the brunt for the rider... had there not be a crash bar, the rider's leg would had been crushed!<br><br>So riders, the next time u want to squeeze through traffic, do be extra careful.<br>Other road users might not be able to see us hidden among the vehicles!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
