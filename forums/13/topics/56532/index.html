            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. i got my class 2B and 2A license at CDC, located at UBI. So i'm only able to tell you roughly how much each practical cost.

            <div class='col-md body'>It used to be very fast last time..... but now may take a slower period. You will bring $100 and two ic colour photos. $72++ for the enrolment and straightaway book your prac 1. Total $90++. At CDC, there's a ATM. And if you are going to CDC, you will have to deposit money with them( this they will explain to you ).<br><br>Let me share with you the fastest way to your license. When you enrol, bk prac 1. And check out when do they have lessons, you will need completion of lesson 1 to 4 to bk for your R.t.t. It's best to go on dates that has two lesson in one day. Upon completion of prac 1, you should have booked your R.t.t. The waiting time is around one and half months, during this time, you can try to complete your circuit's obstacle evaluation. R.t.t. results will come in 14 days, with it, you can get your pdl in order to proceed onto prac 6 to 8 and finally your test. Gd luck, take care when riding.</div>

Some drivers see you learning, they can play with you.... may cause you to fail or even worse, accident(touch wood). Enrolment is required, motorcycle not the same as car. Car don't need enrolment oso can take basic and advance theory test. Prac is paid one at a time.</div>

But when you are going to pracs on the road then you have to take basic in order to have pdl. I haven't take class 3 but i have pass my basic quite a time ago. If i'm not wrong, the best is to take all circuit pracs, obtain a Pdl, then take road pracs. While taking road pracs, take advance theory. Pdl don't take too early because it only last for six months. So R.t.t. is needed to obtain a pdl, which allows you to take pracs on the road. Same as the purpose of B.t.t.. Right?</div>

Right? </div></blockquote>that's right. because prac 1 to 5 is in circuit, you don't need to have pdl (and therefore don't need to pass rtt yet). in addition, you'll need to attend lessons, which are quite boring and redundant, as well as pass the school's rtt before you go for tp's rtt... like prelims and o levels... if not wrong, total 4/5 lessons then you can take the centre's rtt liao...<br><br>as for choice of centre... i think jacobs is correct. alot of traffic around cdc so maybe harder to pass... i went to ssdc before, but the instructors there quite unfriendly (shout into loudhailer at my friend), but dunno still like that or not... bbdc, if still the same, is 10 pracs in circuit and 3 on road... it's easier to clear pracs there, and easier to pass cos less traffic... only downside is more human traffic, like aunties and students cross the roads and stuff... but dunno if still the same or not cos i got my license in year 2000...<br><br>hope this is useful... cheers</div>
