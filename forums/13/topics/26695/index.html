            <div class='col-md body'>hhhmm... its true to say every GP race see rossi win abit sian... but looking at the brighter side of things he did not lead frm 1st corner and win all the way... so at least we get to see him overtake <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>i think that rossi is a really smart rider and with a gd team in the pits showing him wat he needs to noe on the boards and fine tuning his bike the way he likes it.. if u can remember at the start of the season while he was trying out this new 4 stroker he said its a totally diff riding style with his beloved NSR500.. and he had a hard time with the bike... now... everything seems so natural to him..<br><br>in the next season the mighty DUCs will be joining in the fun... but i seriously doubt they will mount a big challenge on the current factories as these already have lots of expierence... toking abt bayliss his riding has been rather poor after his winning of the SBK.. on and off on and off... not much consistency..<br><br>i must agree its so sad to see gibenau crash on the last GP... he had everything under control and just lost it with a minor mistake...  same with checa this week... with him pushing up the pace at 1'59s and the rest of the field doing the early 2'00s he should be winning rather easily...  guess he pushed too hard and crashed just abt 5 secs after taking the lead.. not a real surprise though... how many times have we seen checa with a gd ride ruined by pushing too hard and losing his front...<br><br>with all the shifting of riders next season.. and biaggi with honda... lets hope it gets tougher for rossi... as he said " winning everything is boring.. " he was quoted in a mag saying that if he keeps winning there will be no challenge for him and no point staying on... as we see once he conquered the 125cc he moved to 250 and 500 and now GP class.. so if someone dun come up and stop him... guess he wont be staying for long.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>
