Once again thank you all....<br><br>P/s: Raider, some of us here are just saddened by the sudden departure of our dear friend. Hence, we may just be venting what we feel. Whether or not the driver is going to get his fair share or even full responsibility, that would be up to the reinforcers to decide. Neither you nor i have the last say to that. However, What we have mentioned is what WE FELT (due to the loss) would be just, although nothing would bring our beloved friend back. You wouldn't feel anything, cos you have no relations with the victim whatsoever, so it would be much appreciated if you would kindly STOP scrutinizing on what has been said.</div></blockquote>Understand...<br><br></div>
