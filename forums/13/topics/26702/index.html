            <div class='col-md body'>how long did u park ur bike there?<br>if it was less than 2-3 hrs, really damn suay<br>haizz, i tink last time got one thread regarding parking places in SG. orchard also got a few....<br>all i know that the infamous mosque carpark is oredi cash-cardised, so i tink very few of us will ever park there again..<br>normally when i go orchard, i will park at the CKtang/Marriot carpark<br>the turn-off is that must go up slope til about 2-3 storeys high, then when coming out, stil must go up slope to 4th storey n then let ur bike roll down the spiral all the way... sian!<br><br>but if u r at orchard area nearer to somerset, u can try the underground parking at the fitness center opp cineleisure.<br><br>I heard oso that centre PT also got free parking for bikes... correct me if im wrong<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
