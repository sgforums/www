            <div class='col-md body'>How The Broquet Works...<br><br>Broquet is an advanced fuel catalyst that is designed to treat modern fuels. It is a combination of semi-precious alloy metals, uniquely processed and formed into 22mm domes. It can be inserted into the fuel tank or fuel line of any gasoline or diesel engine.<br><br>Broquet works as an oxidation catalyst on either petrol or diesel. When fuel touches Broquet, it is chemically altered to a state where combustion is greatly enhanced. Unleaded fuel that has been treated with Broquet not only burns better, but burns very much like leaded petrol. The speed and temperature of combustion is regulated which prevents microwelding between valve and valve seats; thus preventing valve seat recession. This allows all cars to use unleaded fuel safely and will protect them against engine damage. The fuel is burnt more completely thus greatly reducing air pollution and this improved combustion will disintegrate, burn away and prevent build-up of carbon deposits, gums and varnishes in the engine.<br><br>In a nutshell, Broquet is a very powerful fuel catalyst that acts like a permanent octane booster, a combustion enhancer and combustion chamber deposit cleaner.<br><br>Broquet improves power and saves fuel in two ways. Firstly, the progressive cleaning effect effectively removes carbon deposits in the combustion chamber and around the piston rings to seal the combustion chamber, therefore optimizing combustion efficiency. Secondly, the more complete combustion of the hydrocarbon molecule effectively "squeezes" maximum power from the fuel. There have been many tests done on the fuel saving and power-increasing effects of Broquet by DTI (The Department of Trade &amp; Industry, UK) and many independent test laboratories. All test results conclude that Broquet increases power and saves fuel over time. In Singapore, Ruf Automobile SEA Pte Ltd was commissioned to perform a test done on their MAHA 4-wheel rolling road Dynamometer. The test vehicle was a 1995 Mazda MX-5 Miata (with catalytic convertor). Results showed an increase in road wheel power by 4 KW (about 5Hp) and more importantly a torque increase of 8 Nm!<br><br>Broquet is not a fuel additive. One installation of Broquet typically lasts for 400,000km (usually more than the life span of the car). Broquet goes one step further than the conventional additives; not only does it improve the overall performance of an engine by regulating emissions, it also makes a brand new engine perform better. In many cases, the fuel economy improves beyond manufacturerÂ’s specifications.<br><br>Broquet would start to work improving your fuel as soon as it is installed. However, the engine cleaning and cylinder optimization processes take some time to work before any improvement is felt. Typical users feel a power improvement after about 3-4 days but the full effects are usually felt after about 1-2 months.<br><br>Broquet is reasonably priced and the value-added benefits are much greater than the cost of the product. Remember that a single installation of Broquet lasts 400,000km and the savings would eventually pay for the installation! In comparison, using the best available fuel additive in the market that costs just $3 for every fillups would cost you $3000 for 400,000km traveled!<br><br>Broquet has been sold in the U.K., throughout Europe and the USA for more than 10 years. Users vary from individual car owners to Garage owners to Corporations with fleets, various police and health and public utility authorities. In Singapore, more and more individuals and even corporations, like TCS, Delifrance and Tuck Lee Ice Works are finding it both financially and environmentally beneficial to install Broquet in their fleets.<br><br>------------------<br>WARNING: "Privileged/Confidential information may be contained in this message.
