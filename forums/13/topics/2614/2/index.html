            <div class='col-md body'>Was I talking about law? Maybe you've gotta brush up on your ENGLISH, and read my posts again. Anyway for your info, I'll be going ahead with the offical complaint. And we'll see who you really are.<br><br>I've checked out with my friend who's an ex-inspector in the force. And he agrees with my views, and have adviced me on the correct course of action. Guess who's the one with the big hat now huh? Dispute cases are really small and most of the time, ignored. But I'll personally see that this goes right up.<br><br>AnywayZ, either way, if you happen to be `NOT' a police officer..... think it'll be worse.<br><br>[This message has been edited by tniki (edited 16 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>toapayoh, if you're reading this, I'll be listing my every movement of complaint here.<br><br>I've gone ahead with contacting administrators/webmasters of this forum to get your IP Address. Have got no responce till now. Will be waiting 1 more week before I finally head-over to your work place to settle this dispute case personally. Would like some justice, as I don't think civil-servants should abuse their given authority. And I'm totally against it.<br><br>I did send you a gentle reminder to remove your post as it upsets people who read it. But you ignored it and gave more remarks. Though I'm no moderator of this forum, your action is regarded as unlawful and I know I had to do something about it.<br><br>Looking forward to seeing you in person.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, i see this thread, is all shootings and vulgar and.... sorry to say... i thinks all the conversations are like... Hai... *cannot make it* Guys, we all 20 years old people liao... why still tok like this? Open mouth "lan" open mouth "fuxx".<br><br>using vulgar and shouting at people aint gonna solve problem. By swearing and losing temper means u have already fallen into the person's trap. Thier purposes is to make u angry, mad. We must keep calm, m i rite?<br><br>1stly i don think he is a police. Coz a genuine police have gone throught trainings and understand Laws better than us. A police should know the consequences of abusing thier authority. Person like Toa Payoh who said such things is definitely someone who has not gone throught police trainings and Law lessons.<br><br>We should learn to see through people, with our eyes. We shd learn to ignore, people like these.. am i right? If such small matters we wanna fight/swear until like mad, so how are we gonna do big stuffs un future? right?<br><br>I hope that all our riders here, can ignore such comments/people.</div>
