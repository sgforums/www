            <div class='col-md body'>hi huat...<br>u got a daystar 400 or 125?<br>anyway, my estimation is that a magma 125 cost ard 2.5k for second hand. But that's jus my guess, coz i hae seen quite a few times on classifieds for GHC, they are selling second hands magma for 2.5k. So do u know how much it cost?<br>and if i were to get a second hand, i may change the battery some internal parts so that it wont spoil so easily.<br>one more thing, a magma 125 can only go up to 100km/h uh?</div>
