Most of the motorshop are opened by past mechanics or those who race before and such. So in a way, I don't really expect them to give u a good customer service like for example you bought a tv from Courts or Best Denki, whereby they will call u up if there's anything wrong with your order. The only call they will give u is when there's problem with your bike or you delay your installment, that's when their customer service come in to service. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
