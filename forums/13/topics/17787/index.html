Sub 1 took me 3 attempts and sub 2 took me 4 attempts jus cos of slow speed control. Dun get disheartened jus cos ppl u know sems to be zai and clear easily.... wat matters at the end of the day is u urself, getting something u realli want.<br><br>Strict standards or not, it shouldn't be a worry in the first place. The more pains u went thru, the more u'll appreciate ur license. Dun worry too much and create self-inflicked pains though.<br><br>Good Luck!

            <div class='col-md body'>I took practical 1 for 3 times too.  At first I also don't understand why I need to go thru it so many times.  But come to think of it, the most impt part about safety with bikes is the moving off and slowing down, and you use them most of the time.  So just press on for that.  It will help you ride safely, the more times you go for it, the more steady you will be with your bike.<br><br>------------------<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>~~~~~~~~~~LAWLIPOP~~~~~~~~~<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>

The former has clutches but 4 wheels , the latter 2 wheels but no clutches , so if you are good in either of them it helps alot.<br><br>I love cycling when young , so when it came to cornering , handling a two-wheel you tend to be more steady.<br><br>One practical advice about nervousness is to not want to pass so badly. Sometimes the harder you push yourself , the worse you perform. I realised i passed easily for every pract after i became very unmotivated about getting a licence. ( hehe that was when i helped to amputate a young lad's leg)<br><br>So try to ride naturally as in your body and bike flow into one.<br><br>You will find that all the reflexes come naturally after a while and you don't consciously have to think about blindspot/clutch in etc. Also during each lesson , think that you don't mind failing , then when you pass , it comes as a very pleasant surprise.<br><br>Remember my TP , i was super relaxed , no pressure at all cos i thot i will confirm fail one, then surprisingly , i passed first time. 19 out of 80 pple.</div>

Practical 1, 2 and 3 are foundations. Maybe, instructors want u to have strong basic riding skills that's all.<br><br>But what I noe is that TP test are much more srict than before.<br><br>But hey...dun give up.... keep on learning. I once know a TP officer....before he join the police force, he himself took 2B at Trg centre.... oso take pract 1, 5 times....hahaha</div>
