            <div class='col-md body'>Tragic story. But this is again all because of stupid pride. Is an apology worth your life, futhermore it is a case of motorcycle V.S car.<br><br>Just live and let live. You be happier and have fewer repair bills to pay <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But there are times when I find motorcyclist have themselves to blame and the unfortunate car driver often appears to be the bad guy. Right or wrong, it will be the motorcyclist who ends up injured on the road....and the police will always sympathise with the injured party <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Those big super bikes squeezing between cars, they are playing with their lives, it is at times very hard to see them in the mirror, especially if you insist on coming so close to the car. Then there are those who insist on right of way by all means.....is it worth your life? The car would just roll over you.<br><br>My own uncle got killed in a CBR years back, I acknowledge the dangers bikers face and give them room whenever possible, but for bikers please bear a thought for drivers, cars are much bigger with more blind spots and take up more room than your two wheelers. Do not assume because you pay road-tax, you automatically have access to a car's dimensions and road pressence. In short, please dun take up two lanes, straddle lanes and obstruct faster traffic.<br><br>Then there are those irritating buggers with their kup chias that alwasy squeeze right at the front of you car....you are at the stop line but these jokers still insist on shadowing your front fender. If they move off fast fine, but more often than not these lawn movers, fustrate you but cruising down memory lane. If you are that slow please go to the left-most lane <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>It seems the TP should nab these two wheel hogs too.<br><br></div>

I travel CTE daily to work and PIE back. And almost everyday. I can see cars gets into accident for no apparent reasons. Does that make driver stupid by generalising them together? I understand that some drivers have big ego that dislike motorcyclists to cut in between them without "queing up". But imagine should every motorcyclist travel in an ordely manner... How long will the jam be? And most make up motorcycle accidents are caused by? It could be hit and run by "Driver". Or "Drivers" jammed brakes for no precise reasons? I hate the person that created ABS.<br><br>Today I had seen the most stupidest people on earth... It was the chain of accident created by drivers...
