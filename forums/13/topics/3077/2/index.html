            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly to Yinnig - Its best for you to get wr200. Its very ideal if u wanna trail a bit and use it for transport abit. Get an FQ plate.... and the resale value is quite high for wr. KDX is a no-no.<br><br>Its actualli not very expensive to maintain a scram. If u use it purely for transport.... then the maintenance would be the same as in any other bike. Its only when u trail....then u can see dirt everiwhere. Suspension a bit loose.... its those kind of stuff.<br><br>Zechs's DT piston jammed??? wow.... never heard of DT getting its piston jammed. But i believe his DT is a bit old rite??? got send to check it up ornot???<br><br>Klamath - eh....u funni ah....u dirt rider but wanna challenge ppl using r1?? At least put African Twin not that far from dirt bike rite??? Dissapointing....<br><br>TZR - I did open my eyes big-big and i think....sometimes i feel i think too much. Its not hard to 'think' that everione in this forum got something against scrams. In case, u have missed it....take a look at TZM's reply. He admit it...he hate scrams.<br><br>TZM - OK. So u hate scrams. Hmmm...but who cares??? I myself hate nsr and i tink tzr is a history bike. tzm....is ok... quite good actualli. This is what i tink. But wat i tink is none of ur concern. As long as u like ur bike.... and i like mine...is it ok that we just keep our opinion to ourselves. Even if u feel that the urge is too great, at least be constructive...pls. I read about ur forum...about how we should stop flaming ppl...can we realli do that? I admit....Klamath has gone quite far wif his reply to ur opinion abt scrams..... but admittingly, ur opinion abt dirt bike can realli get on someone's nerve. Just imagine, if i had said the same thing abt tzm....would u have done the same thing too??? Oh ya....and wat the hell is a mat yo-yo???<br><br>I just hope that this place can accomodate each and every type of bike there is. This is after all a race track forum. One for motor-cars and bikes...</div>
