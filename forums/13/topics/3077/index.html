So far, this is the best dirt bike for 200(my own opinion). It is cheaper to maintan and the spare parts are also cheaper. FQ and FP plate would cost u abt $7K and $5.5K - $6K respectively. It's heavier than KTM and actualli also heavier than nsr150 (i tried my frenz repsol) but due to the high center of gravity, they tend to feel veri light when going at high speed. A finely tuned engine can give u an excellent km per litre ratio. My wr travels ard 23-25km per litre of petrol. Full tank is ard 8-9 litre.<br><br>KTM200 - Gives the most power but also veri expensive to maintain. It drinks petrol and 2T like water. 15km per litre and full tank is at 10 litre. A new bike cost abt $10-$11K(price at 2 months ago).<br><br>GasGas - Quite powerful. Rare to find oso. Veri expensive to maintain. Not much info....<br><br>KDX - Old bike. Quite problematic i heard. Not much info....<br><br>XR200 - You forgot this bike. 4 stroke engine. Not veri fast but excellent for road travel.<br><br>DR200 - Quite similar to xr. Heard this baby can give 35km per litre. I'm not sure if this is true.<br><br>If u do some light trailing.... it would be better to get a wr. If u are into heavy trailing.... its best to get a ktm(for trailing only)and another bike fo road travel.<br><br>Surprisingly, WR and KTM are quite easy to control even if u are travelling at 90km/h. It's unlike what people say. However, u cannot play corner lah... rainy day oso must be careful (but which rider shouldn't???).<br><br>Hope u find wat u r looking for....cheers!!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by operator (edited 13 November 2001).]</div>

Is it true there are really no more new WR 200 liao? very sad leh... =( and the KDX wah really tt problematic ar...keke... so 'old' liao ar keke... =) and are there any other 200cc scamblers around for our preference?</div></blockquote>These are the 2B scramblers common in Singapore. Or u can try DT200R. Almost the same style as wr but a bit old-fashioned looking. It sports a conventional fork, rather than inverted fork that wr is using. Although, its not that powerful as compared to wr.<br><br>Its true, theres no more new wr.<br><br>Just like what toons9 said, its dangerous if u dun have enough height....coz stopping, veri chialatz one.<br><br>Scramblers are unique and it is in a different class on its own. A racer is a racer and a scram is a scram. Its called dirt bike bcoz its meant to get dirty.....<br><br>To TZM and TZR: I dun noe why u have such hatred towards dirt riders..... but pls...we only seek to get more knowledge here. I believe this forum is open to all riders.....from sccoters to scrams...to racer. With all due respect, both of u are 'lao jiao' here....dun be discriminative.

            <div class='col-md body'>i recommend DT200 for newbies..i'm riding one myself..with a bit of tuning,it's comparable to WR2..dun expect KTM,GasGas power tho, it's not very pretty either but it's a star for reliability and economy..abt 20km/litre and i'm not an economy rider.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> it does wobble a bit at ard 105kmh and higher but the keeping yer legs tite to tha bike shud tha trick..it's a low for a scrambler, so install smoothies and u can play corner oredi..and yes if ride scram eventually, dun forget tha elbows up, armpit ventilation pose..heheh..</div>
