I agree that Klamath's reply was unruly, but if you really look at TZM's inital post.... you would have notice that he was the first one that made such remarks that scram is poser bike....fucked up...picked up nia...etc.<br><br>In this case, I believe that TZM made the intial mistake and Klamath made a bigger one but 2 mistakes doesn't make a right. We can all be happy if we all just cool down a bit here.<br><br>If anibodi is talking about 'blowing' and posing, I think it all comes down to the rider himself and not the bike he is riding. I myself get 'blown' by scrams at junctions. I also get 'blown' by TZM, nsr, tzr....u name it. It's no use challenging. Either him or you, will one day got stop by TP... and its worth it.<br><br>A friendly piece of advice. Now, TP stepping up their patrolling frequency. They are everywhere!! but as long as you never mod or speed and practice safe riding, there's no need to worry. Cheers! </div></blockquote>so what he is saying scrams suxx? Isn't it true there are lots of posers? Not true meh?<br><br></div>
