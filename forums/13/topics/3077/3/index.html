OK. Inverted fork is supposed to reduced fork flex. Fork flex causes uneven suspension and reduce steering accuracy or this is wat they say. But for me....like the same leh. But there's always fork brace.....hehe.<br><br>I ride scrams only coz i go trailing sometimes...if not...mab i'll be driving or somethin... but i have tried a couple of bikes b4 and i find tzm, the best....followed by my wr...hehe.<br><br>Haha...never regret gettin my wr...or even mi previous DT. Mainly...if its Yamaha...i like it...hehe. I tink Yamaha scrams are veri reliable....and if u take care of it appropriately...shld not give u any problems one.<br><br>Aniway....how come u got preference for KDX?

            <div class='col-md body'>Appearance i tink u shld noe by now. WR is more sleek looking. 2T inlet for wr is at the back while DT is at the front...near the handle. WR got no batt but DT have....emmm...let's see. Oh ya...and the seat cover got a bit of diff.<br><br>Maintenance wise is almost similar... I normally send to wash carb and clean air filter everi month. Would cost u anithin from $15 to $25. See which shop u go lah. Then change engine oil everi 2 month. Oso, 1 litre of 2T would last 1 month...mab more. I generally spend abt $30 - $40 per month on maintenance on the average. To be honest, my style is considered over-servicing alreadi liaoz...haha.... but this is too ensure no prob mah....oso...i dun always trail( no time...werking and studying now)<br><br>I did the above to my DT and during my 1 yr ownership.... never break down. The only time I had to go to the mechanic is to service my fork....coz got leakage then.<br><br>Latest WR is FQ plate. Price $7k. On the road since 98. And as for DT, FR plate, out since 99. Price ard $5k. Resale value for DT not veri good though but WR is otherwise. You can see that the demand for WR is quite high. I oso last time dissappointed WR no more.... but lan-lan liaoz...<br><br>Seriously...u can consider getting a WR. It's top of the list so far.</div>
