Have your friends with bikes pillion you to the Lim Ah Boy's shop and get yourself a Cheap, Open Face Helmet with clear Visor &amp; the SPRING Sticker at the back.  Yours friends should be able to advise you.  They would most likely be thrilled to help you out.<br><br>As for KRR &amp; SP, they are just the small cc sports bikes.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm new to bike too and am thinking of taking up lessons. I'm kind of curious that on average, how many lessons people go thru before they are actually eligible for the test and do I have to take and pass any theory before being able to take the practical lessons? Oh yeah, roughly how much in total is it gon cost to take up bike? Sorry my knowledge on transport is almost close to nothing</div>
