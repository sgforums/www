            <div class='col-md body'>There's something i find quite disturbing about softdrink's remark. I'll quote "so what if i don't study much?? what for???"  Well I'll answer his "what for???" Take it this way softdrink, 10, 20 years down the road, you're gonna have kids, one day they'll ask you, "Pa, how come sun will rise and set?" " Pa how come this black metal will stick to metal and not plastic?" How are you gonna answer ALL their questions? Throw them with you o-so-plentiful money and tell them to go play hide and go screw themselves? Young man, knowledge, we study for knowledge. That is something you cannot buy. It's up to you to set a good example yourself for your next generation. Definitely there'll be times you ask yourself questions that you dun know how to answer. Try this, go ask any degree holder ANY questions of science, you'll get a satisfactory answer from them. Even if they don't know, they'll give you a reasonable answer. Being able to answer questions with certain amount of clarity is fulfilling to you mind and soul. Don't it just hurts to know you gotta pump petrol but don't know WHY it MUST be petrol and not water? Why petrol burn and not water? WHY you must pump petrol and not diesel? I think i made myself clear.<br><br>Quote : "so long as i am able to make big money study so much work for ppl, earn pity money. never study do business earn big money"<br>Are you sure it's PITY money? Diploma and degree holders are considered, PROFESSIONALS. In case you don't know, professionals are people who specialize in there field of expertise. Let me tell you this, if everyone thinks like you, one day you'll be on the operating table and the uncle selling ba chor mee at your school, if you have one, will be your surgeon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Wonderful world a? Will you at that time say, so long as i am able to make big money study so much work for ppl, earn pity money. never study do business earn big money. So don't say it's pity money. How much you earn is relative. To you 1K a year may be earning BIG money. To someone else who choose to be less shallow then you, saving lives and making a difference to the world beats the crap outta earning PITY money, PS: It's PITIFUL, not PITY. And using a sentence like, earning PITIFUL bucks or PITIFUL CASH makes a better statement than PITY MONEY. Image is very important in the world of business, how you present yourself gives confidence to your client <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Quote: "at school pong tang sleep, and you study hard and hand in your home work on time and be a teachers' pet. know so much thing for what??? " Well there's this saying, there's no stupid question <strong>(know so much thing for what???), </strong>just stupid people. And, there's no stupid people, just lazy people(<strong>at school pong tang sleep</strong>). Which brings me nicely to this not so clever question -<br><br>"in this world, <strong>$$$ that counts</strong> i don't know if you agree with me or not loh, that's my thinking."<br><br>Well how stupid can a lazy one get. All he gotta do is just put a <strong>IT'S </strong> in front of the $$$ and I would have nothing to say. Well for me I don't let MY money do the counting, I COUNT IT <strong>MYSELF!</strong> You know it's actually quite nice when you got lots of it. PS: You should really brush up on your language, you're really hurting my eyes with your hard-to-ignore, stop sign at brain, one way through ass , bengish remarks. Hard to make "BIG" money if you cannot get your message across to the other by <strong>FIRST </strong>pharsing it in the right manner through your BRAINS, yes the thing up there, not the fleshy bun-like twins you're sitting. O don't go blaming yourself for sleeping in class and stuff. You reap what you sow, you sow shit, duh.... YOU GET SHIT! Simple as that, didn't your math teacher teach you that?<br><br>At 21 you may think a world of yourself for having what others can't have. Your mentality is to fulfil yourself by indulging in materialistic objects to compansate for the lost in pride and dignity to your peers who have advance up the ladder of education. My advice to you, be contented with what you have and be humble. No good man will look down on you even if you're not adcadmically inclinded. And you need no look up to any gifted who look down upon you. Just have a full life living for yourself and not try to triump over everyone whom you think you lost to cause you lost to no one, there wasn't a competition to start anything anyway.<br><br>To sum it all, knowledge compansates and compliment experience.  Experience can be gained and everyone will have their turn in time. But education is best earned when young cause then you'll understand what you experience in later part of live.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Shackle:<br><strong>There's something i find quite disturbing about softdrink's remark. I'll quote "so what if i don't study much?? what for???"  Well I'll answer his "what for???" Take it this way softdrink, 10, 20 years down the road, you're gonna have kids, one day they'll ask you, "Pa, how come sun will rise and set?" " Pa how come this black metal will stick to metal and not plastic?" How are you gonna answer ALL their questions? Throw them with you o-so-plentiful money and tell them to go play hide and go screw themselves? Young man, knowledge, we study for knowledge. That is something you cannot buy. It's up to you to set a good example yourself for your next generation. Definitely there'll be times you ask yourself questions that you dun know how to answer. Try this, go ask any degree holder ANY questions of science, you'll get a satisfactory answer from them. Even if they don't know, they'll give you a reasonable answer. Being able to answer questions with certain amount of clarity is fulfilling to you mind and soul. Don't it just hurts to know you gotta pump petrol but don't know WHY it MUST be petrol and not water? Why petrol burn and not water? WHY you must pump petrol and not diesel? I think i made myself clear.<br><br>Quote : "so long as i am able to make big money study so much work for ppl, earn pity money. never study do business earn big money"<br>Are you sure it's PITY money? Diploma and degree holders are considered, PROFESSIONALS. In case you don't know, professionals are people who specialize in there field of expertise. Let me tell you this, if everyone thinks like you, one day you'll be on the operating table and the uncle selling ba chor mee at your school, if you have one, will be your surgeon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Wonderful world a? Will you at that time say, so long as i am able to make big money study so much work for ppl, earn pity money. never study do business earn big money. So don't say it's pity money. How much you earn is relative. To you 1K a year may be earning BIG money. To someone else who choose to be less shallow then you, saving lives and making a difference to the world beats the crap outta earning PITY money, PS: It's PITIFUL, not PITY. And using a sentence like, earning PITIFUL bucks or PITIFUL CASH makes a better statement than PITY MONEY. Image is very important in the world of business, how you present yourself gives confidence to your client <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Quote: "at school pong tang sleep, and you study hard and hand in your home work on time and be a teachers' pet. know so much thing for what??? " Well there's this saying, there's no stupid question [b](know so much thing for what???), </strong>just stupid people. And, there's no stupid people, just lazy people(<strong>at school pong tang sleep</strong>). Which brings me nicely to this not so clever question -<br><br>"in this world, <strong>$$$ that counts</strong> i don't know if you agree with me or not loh, that's my thinking."<br><br>Well how stupid can a lazy one get. All he gotta do is just put a <strong>IT'S </strong> in front of the $$$ and I would have nothing to say. Well for me I don't let MY money do the counting, I COUNT IT <strong>MYSELF!</strong> You know it's actually quite nice when you got lots of it. PS: You should really brush up on your language, you're really hurting my eyes with your hard-to-ignore, stop sign at brain, one way through ass , bengish remarks. Hard to make "BIG" money if you cannot get your message across to the other by <strong>FIRST </strong>pharsing it in the right manner through your BRAINS, yes the thing up there, not the fleshy bun-like twins you're sitting. O don't go blaming yourself for sleeping in class and stuff. You reap what you sow, you sow shit, duh.... YOU GET SHIT! Simple as that, didn't your math teacher teach you that?<br><br>At 21 you may think a world of yourself for having what others can't have. Your mentality is to fulfil yourself by indulging in materialistic objects to compansate for the lost in pride and dignity to your peers who have advance up the ladder of education. My advice to you, be contented with what you have and be humble. No good man will look down on you even if you're not adcadmically inclinded. And you need no look up to any gifted who look down upon you. Just have a full life living for yourself and not try to triump over everyone whom you think you lost to cause you lost to no one, there wasn't a competition to start anything anyway.<br><br>To sum it all, knowledge compansates and compliment experience.  Experience can be gained and everyone will have their turn in time. But education is best earned when young cause then you'll understand what you experience in later part of live.<br>[/b]</blockquote>well said</div>
