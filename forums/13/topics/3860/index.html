It may not look as exciting as a sportsbike, but i am very happy with it. If you are thinking of cost, get an RXZ or TZR. 2nd hand, $2500 for the former , $1000 for the latter. Somemore , maintenance at JB is possible, low fuel consumption, low insurance.<br><br>Brand new RXZ are $6000? Whereas in Malaysia the same bike with new fittings is  about RM5500. It's not advisable for you to get a new bike. As a beginner, it's advisable for you to get a cheap bike and a second hand one, in case you buang or you scratch , not as xim tia.Imagine if you scratch your aprilla or brand new SP( touch wood...)<br><br>Paikuakia, not true that 2B bikes only single disc. My TZR has double disc brake.<br><br></div>
