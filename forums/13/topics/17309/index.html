Ok delbro, i tell u what, i just forget abt what u've said the other time, but i hope we all can tok kok. I don mind toking abt aprilia actually, coz i myself also love aprilia. Just that last time i have wasted alot of $$ thats why i changed bike. Anyway, have u used arrow b4? I tried both RS and Arrow last time, arrow is still the best. But air setting is also very important, where do u set your air settings? </div></blockquote>let me share some info with u, this is what i've heard and i think that this is a fact that ALL 2 stroke bikes are problematic cause they can't last long unlike 4 stroke bikes, how long have aprilia, mito and tzr been in singapore?? and how long have tzm,sp,krr have been in singapore??have u heard that in malaysia tzm is quite problematic bike the pv breaks easily, the problem with this 125 bikes is they were here first b4 the 150 and all the owners have been riding them like they are racing in the gp 125 series that is why they are such a problem bikes right now don't u think so??</div>
