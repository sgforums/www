            <div class='col-md body'>At about 1 am, at the Aljunied flyover on the PIE towards Tuas, Peter, 18, lost control of his Yamaha motorcycle after he hit a bump on the road.<br><br>His bike skidded and crashed, spinning from the middle lane to the left side of the four-lane road.<br><br>But the youth was thrown off his machine and his head was slammed against the road divider.<br><br>Wee Keong, 19, who was following behind, tried to avoid his friend by swerving to the left. But he, too, lost control and fell off his Honda motorcycle.<br><br>The pair suffered multiple injuries and were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics at about 1.30 am.<br><br>At the wake yesterday, Mr Jack Ho, 46, said his son Peter was working part time as a salesman while waiting to further his studies.<br><br>The youth, the second of three children, had just graduated from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and was due to start a two-year industrial technician certificate course in mechanical engineering in July.<br><br>He and Wee Keong, who had just joined the Air Force, had been friends since their primary school days and were very close because they lived near each other, said Mr Ho, a mechanic.<br><br>On Saturday evening, the youth had left his Bedok North home to go to Wee Keong's flat a few blocks away in Bedok North Street 3. That was the last time his family saw him.<br><br>A tearful Mr Ho said that he had pinned his hopes on Peter to take over his garage.<br><br>He said: 'Peter passed his riding test in January and asked his mother for money to buy a motorcycle. But I was against him having a motorcycle.<br><br>'So, when he passed his driving test in February, I gave him a car and told him to sell the bike and return the $6,000 to his mother.'<br><br>He said that he had seen his son driving the car.<br><br>He did not know that his son did not sell his bike as promised until he was told of the accident at about 3.30 am yesterday by his son's friends.<br><br>'Maybe he wanted to keep it because all his friends also have motorbikes,' he said.<br><br>Eye-witnesses should call the Traffic Police on 1800- 547-1818.<br><br>Extract from <a href="http://www.sgbikers.com" rel="nofollow">www.sgbikers.com</a><br><br>------------------<br>--Appreciate what you have now and not what you don't--</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>really sad to hear this.<br>guys, don't speed. it's really too dangerous. a bump or a hole on the road, will cause you to lose control.<br><br>just now at TPE near the Yio Chu Kang exit, at the road shoulder, saw a big fat tile (those they use to lay the pedestrian pavement ) lying directly on the white line. the tile was white too, making it even harder to notice, imagine if a rider had ride along the inner lane, and ram into it? with such a big tile, you don't really need high speed to cause you to lose control.<br><br>It gave me a shock to see it there. such is an example of the real road hazard.<br><br>to all riders, careful.</div>
