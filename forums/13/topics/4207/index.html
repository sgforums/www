            <div class='col-md body'>My name is Ryu and I live in Singapore and I am a big fan of Aprilia bike. Last year I bought a Replica RS125 and confidently thought it was the best 125cc bike around. But alas!! I did not notice Singapore Government ( I live in Singapore ) ban the original Aprilia RS exhaust pipe and fitted on a lousy fat Â“miloÂ” exhaust pipe which kills the top speed of the RS125, 200kmh to a slow 150kmh. Not only that, the temperature of the bike increases rapidly because the Â“miloÂ” exhaust pipe refused to allow the hot air out more efficientlyÂ… that is a major cause on why RS125 encounter plenty problems. Imagine your body cannot release the heat out for a prolog period of time!!!<br><br>RS125 is a very good bike but because of Singapore Government, itÂ’s now a problematic bike. Unless Aprilia Company fights for their original RS exhaust pipe to be allowed in Singapore, if not IÂ’ll be selling off my Aprilia soon. I am sure thereÂ’ll be lesser and lesser people buying the 125cc Aprilia in the future if this goes onÂ… Â…<br><br></div>

But, the rs pipe here there's a "ARROW" logo on it, which is everybody knows lah, is illegal. Yet, the new rs pipe there's a "APRILIA" logo on it, that's wat I heard it from IDEAL MOTOR SPORT, it's legal. So far, haven't heard of any news when is it official in SG, juz the mechanic told me around mid in this yr, but yet 2 confirmed. As 4 wat u said "ported engine", I got no idea leh, very paiseh lah!</div>
