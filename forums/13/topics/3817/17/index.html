(i really know nuts about riding a bike, pls 4give me if i've offended you, coz i really buey hiao)<br><br>{Like what s2c said, when you are new to kick starting, and have the starter bounce back and hit your ankle, you know what I mean. Especially for s2c, because she's riding a scrambler. The height is high and she has to balance on only one foot while trying to kick start with the other. ... ahah h a ... Wah s2c, how you managed this har ? Idol leh ... ahah ahh a}<br><br>5. specially 4 noah, how did you go abt getting ur bike through ur mom? coz sama case here, family oppose....HELP!!<br><br>It's a difficult case lor. My bike is a 2nd hand bike. The previous owner bought 2 weeks then returned to shop. Mother din allow, and forced him to return it. Ended up with me. Basically, my mum dun allow either and I am the only son of the family. (yah, I am a guy, not gal). But I have the ultimate decision and say in the family lor. I bought the bike without her knowing. After the first 2 weeks she became suspicious and then I told her about my bike. There's very much nothing she could do lor. Actually I din like bikes one. Too dangerous and I am the gia si type. (no gal fren, haven enjoy life, dun wan to die so young) But no choice, work place far, and I dun have $$ to buy car. So turn to morotrcycle. Now that I have the bike, the next thing is buy a lot of insurance and do my best to stay alive and accident free.<br>I can't offer very much advice on this, cos everyone situation different. You will have to find someway to convince your parents lor.<br><br>Lastly, welcome to the club !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

The paint flaked off and got some white powder. Used WD40 to spray. Later I think need to get a wire brush to brush away the rust then spray primer and then spray grey paint.

I know nuts about such maintenance .....<br><br>Oei, your insurance company haven't pay you yet ah ? Must call them everyday on the phone and pester them until they dun take your phone call.
