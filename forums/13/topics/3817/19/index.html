Every refuel full tank. To go 200km the tank is like going to out of fuel already, so will have to switch to reserve soon. But I usually refuel before I hit past 150km. Kiasu. Scared cannot find petrol kiosk.<br>The reserve dunno can go how long. But I estimate that if reserve also burn, total range of the vehicle is like 250km.</div>

Every time got something, I go to my mechanic. One thing is I dun have tools (no, not even spanners). 2nd thing, I lazy, 3rd thing, I scared do wrong thing. Besides, I dunno much about bike mechanics. So I thought, go to the mechanic and learn what are the things that usually go wrong, how to dismantle ... blah blah blah .... so for your case, is suggesting that you go to a mechanic and ask him to check for you. Once you establish a relationship, got problem, go ask him and most probably, he would be pleased to help you. By the way, would like to make a guess. Think the pedal got something to do with your chain. Go to the motortiam and ask them to check for you lah.<br><br>Oei, remember to tell me what is your bike hor ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think girls look good on sport bikes or scram.  Last time when i was in NS, got one very chio girl, captain Jennifer or something like that.  Always see her wear sleeveless, long hair, riding scram, in and out of the camp, while i was doing stupid guard duty.... wah.... damn chio man!<br><br>But as for sports bikes, it must be a big cc one lor, small one for girls, to me, looks a bit out of place lor, although its still ok.<br><br>As for scooters, trust me, unless u r uncle uncle, ride 60km/h on left lane type, don't ride scooter, it is not very safe.  Trust me, after riding my skipper for so long, it totally screw up my riding skills and habit.<br><br>As for those who think girls are poor rider, think again.  I have seen many on the road, driving centre, who can ride as well, if not better, then any guys.  Don't presume that they are all bad, just like not all guys are good riders!<br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
