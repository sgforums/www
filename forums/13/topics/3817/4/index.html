I think I have to give up the idea of getting a TZM with only $2k, cos TZM seems to be a new bike and actually quite impossible to find anyone selling a 2nd hand at that price. Anyway, my email add just in case: macross3@singnet.com.sg. (actually, I dun like to talk on telephone, so can try email first ?)<br>Think I have to settle for a TZR. Hoping to find a TZRR though.

BUT RACE WITH BIG BIKE ON THE STREET MUST HAVE CONERING. 400CC NOTHING, BUT START FROM 600CC  STRAIGE ROAD LOW CC SURE LOST WANT. STILL GOT ONE THING NOT EVERY BIG BIKE CAN WIN LOW CC BIKE IN STRAIGE ROAD BECAUSE YOU GO 200KM TO 240KM THE GUY DON'T DARE TO GO ALSO WILL LOSE YOU. RACING NOT DEPAND ONE BIKE IS THE RIDER, FOR RACE IN TRACK ALL RACER SKILL SOME  EAQUAL SO THERE WILL FIGHT WHO'S BIKE CAN GO. TRACK BIKE DON'T MODIFI SO MUCK A BIT ONLY ACTUALLY, BUT ALL THE THINGS THERE CHANGE IS BRAND NEW PARTS. IT OK ANYWAY, THAT DIDN'T MEANS I GOOD. ME STILL LEARNING, HOPE WE CAN SHARE OUR THINGS.

            <div class='col-md body'>FOR s2c :<br>What you say is the correct thing, but nothing to do with your engine it because your gasket spoil. All you need is just a new gasket and change it, if the shop say must change the things in the engine parts call him go to the toilet and eat up all the shit and think how to fix your bike. Your bike no problem only the gasket spoil, you need to remember that it. Don't let them touch any of your parts.<br><br>FOR TZR,<br>TZR acturlly many problem y you take but mostly not your piston wan but i must see. Your brother case is that's a small or big part of your brother piston break into small pieces and drown down to the bearing and jam the whole bike, sp seldom jam mostly due to what i say above. SP seas that's mean the bike stop working half way that's mean the piston jam but for honda n yamaha bike still moving wan. TZR, TZM coming with us too. But first can both and s2c intro, me (19 years old, live in woodlands study in bukit badok ITE. NAME DERRICK.</div>
