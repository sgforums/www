Possible to get one ?<br><br>Thanks !</strong></blockquote>Although your question is addressed to TZM53, I think I might be able to help you with your queries.<br><br>U R looking for 2nd TZM? I saw one in Singnet Classifieds, selling 7K, used only 1 odd year coz it's a FS plate.<br><br>And your budget can't get you a 2nd TZM, unless the 2K you're using is for downpayment. Usually TZM 2nd hand very difficult to find. I've found one which is the cheapest among all I've asked and the OTR price is 5.5K, FR plate.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well basically.... in 2B if u are into racing bike... etc 150cc... then dun bother about brand cos they all come from thailand...is you want something cheaper and dun waste too much $$$ and still look good wif enuf power a tzr would be a nice choice.. if u want a scrambler.... u have to ask yourself are u into thrills, if you go dirt there is a lot of $$$ contain inside if you want a glamour bike... well KTM and WR are the only choice left....any doubt u can reply to me.</div>
