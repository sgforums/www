I think they need to retain your IC for a few days to process the transfer of COE and to make the insurance for you. Meantime you won't have your IC, but they will issue you an acknowledgement slip. I am sure the people will guide your through the process. The important thing is to ask what kind of insurance the bike comes with, or rather, I think you can choose. Best to get a first party insurance. More expensive but more advisable for new riders. This covers your machine and the other party's machine. A 3rd party insurance covers only the other party's claim, but does not cover your machine. (ZM, am I right about this ? I am still very blur about all these things.) Mine is a Mitsui Marine insurance. Normally covers one year.<br><br>If you are paying by installments, ask about the interest rate per annum. Normally is 5%. Some shop goes as high as 6, 7%. In my opinion that,s far too high, and you will be better off looking at other shops. After that, ask the dealer to work out the payment plan step by step for you to see. My installment lasts for 2 years.<br><br>Then, you have to look at the bike. Choose a colour you like. Mine is green. I didn't have a choice, because mine is a 2nd hand bike. Check the general things. Look at the kick starter, see if it's installed properly. Mine wasn't. If you are buying a new bike, generally, there isn't very much to look for. Just look for things that are obviously wrong. Also look out for rust and corrosion. Test the engine, hear how it sounds. Best to have somebody who knows about to accompany you. Can offer you advice. Check the lights, the meters, the controls (ask how to operate them), the odometer reading (make sure reading isn't wrong the bike when it's supposed to be new ? eg. how can it read 500 km when it's supposed to be new ?) Ask about maintenance. When to send your bike in for maintenance. Where to send. Warranty. Tool kits, manual (but the stupid manual of mine is in Thai, so I can't read a thing). Ask about the tyre. For some reason, mine is a tubed tyre. Best to have a tubeless tyre. (I think I kena conned) Free gifts ? What kind of fuel it drinks. Test ride the machine, feel the clutch and transmission.<br><br>Generally, I am a newbie like you too. So I dun really know what to look for. You may want to ask people like TZM53 in this forum. They have more experience than I have. If you are buying a kawasaki, it takes octane 95 type fuel. I am using octane 98. It's ok to use a higher octane number, but dun try to use a lower one. 98 is a bit more expensive. Get someone to show you how to pump fuel. I din know how to and had to get someone to show me (maybe I am dumb).<br><br>For equipment, you have to get your own helmet. Look for the SISIR approved sticker, with clear visor. Of course there are those unapproved types which are cheaper and better looking helmets which I was very tempted to buy. But I din have the guts and I din want any trouble with the Traffic police. My advice is that, if you are new, follow the rules. And best to follow the rules still even after you are familiar with all the things. You have to consider getting a raincoat also. I bought mine for $30. Consists of the shirt and the pants. Then, you have to get your P plate. I got mine from Ah Boy (also near bike production). But I think they sold me an illegal one. Cost me $8. Faded liao. I hope the police won't catch me. I din know there are illegal type of P plates then. You should be getting the more expensive 3M P plates. Those won't fade, I think. Cost around $10~11. Or you can ask the old birds if they have any for sale. After that, you might want to consider a tank bag. This bag sits on your tank and holds itself with magnets in the bag. But this bag is expensive. Got one from Ah Boy at $50 (actually was $80). This bag is not necessary, so you decide for yourself. (I think I am the only guy around using a tank bag. If you see an idiot on a green kawasaki with a black tank bag, that's me.)<br><br>Now, you better go get some parking coupons. Go look for the nearest carpark around your area and note its block number down. Actually not necessary. You go to your area's HDB branch and apply for seasons parking. The people there is supposed to locate the nearest parking lot for you. Hopefully you won't meet those unprofessionals who will give you just any parking lots that are far away (that's why asking you to note down the block number of the nearest carpark.) You may want to buy a parking coupon holder to hold your seasons parking ticket. Make sure it's a waterproof one you are getting or the rain will soak up your tickets.<br><br>That's about all I can think of for now. ZM, can you go through all the nonsense I have written above and see if I have made any mistakes ? I am new after all. Hey, there ought to be a website to guide the new riders on all these things. I din know anything when I got my bike. Lucky I got my all-time good friend with me to show me the ropes.<br><br>Thristy liao ... think I go drink water liao ......<br><br>Good luck, I am waiting to hear your good news. Send me an email if you have any problems. I will be happy to help you.</div>

I din know anything when I got my bike. Lucky I got my all-time good friend with me to show me the ropes.<br><br>Thristy liao ... think I go drink water liao ......<br><br>Good luck, I am waiting to hear your good news. Send me an email if you have any problems. I will be happy to help you.</div></blockquote>hmm....woa professor noah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
