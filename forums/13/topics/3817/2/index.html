            <div class='col-md body'>i totally support if u girls wanna ride bike...better than those lame rich girls who drive mercedes...look so blur...so more scary... however i hate it when girls panic.. most girls will jam all the freaking brakes w/o no freaking reason...tink they too full of anxiety or something...anyway, since u like scram s2c, go for WR..i tink its got the best balance(maintenance, acceleration, fuel economy compared to ktm) anyway its much heavier than ktm, so much more stable...ktm comes with race components(this is what my fren said lah....but i dunno)... its kinda too powerful...tried it b4, feels like a bicycle, but very fast...the best is, try all of them out, see wat u like....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Downpayment Usually 20% of the bike cost and interest rate is usually 5-6%per year but some bike shop interest rate is calculated in another way example the interest rate is 9% but they add the interest of the amount owned each year as 4 the season parking u require log card which state ur vehicle spec or u can produce insurance they do accept</div>
