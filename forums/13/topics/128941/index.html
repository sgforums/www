But the popular choice would be the Phantom.<br><br>If you plan to upgrade your license and bike in future, it is recommended that you get a 2nd hand bike.  But if you get a first hand bike and it breaks down, it is either yours or the manufacturer's fault.  I feel better if my bike conks out and I know that I am the cause of it.<br><br>COE you will have to check the COE listings every month.  Other than that the bike shop will tell you how much the COE is.  I normally don't bother about this because no matter what the bike's COE is still cheaper than a car's.<br><br>Insurance is dependant on your age and what kind of bike you're riding. Young person on a sportsbike, high insurance.  Old man on a less appealing bike, cheaper insurance.<br><br>Road tax is dependant on the bike's cc.<br><br>For instalments, different shops offer different rates.  When you hear 5% over 3 years, it is 15%. The last known range I heard of would be 3%-5%.  I can't remember because my last bike I paid full.<br><br>The plates you hear kinda let you know what year the bike was out... FR, FQ, FV... the current plate now is, FZ.  So in future people mention a FZ plate, you can roughly gauge that it was out around 2004-5.  But like cars, there are people who buy number plates so if you hear anything special, then the generation of the bike isn't accurate anymore.<br><br>I used to ride a phantom 200 and for a full tank inclusive of reserve costing $11-15 took me 250-300+km.  Parking charges, eh I can't remember I pay by GIRO.  It's still cheaper than a car. ERP, depends on how often you go in.  Don't forget to put some money aside for fines.<br><br>Where to buy bikes? Hmmm there are a few shops, depends on whether you want good after service or some other factors.  Some shops sell cheap, you get your bike and then they don't care about you.  Some require you to pay more and you can send it back for servicing for around 3 sessions without paying anything.  Its a give and take situation, you gotta know what you want.<br><br>Hope this helps.  For any incorrect/outdated info, pls provide the correct/updated one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depending on the handle bar - foot peg position there are 3 categories of motorcycles.<br>Racer : Handle bar forward and low, foot peg to the rear, causing the rider to lean forward.<br>Easy rider : Chopper handle par, foot peg to the front, causing the rider to lean  back and relax.<br>Tourer: The middle of the two above.<br><br>For SG roads, you have to decide what the bike is for.<br>Commuting or leisure.<br>The racer is best for riding position while commuting.<br>The tourer is for long distance riding, like into Malaysia.<br>The easy rider, for 2B is not recommended as they are not stable.<br><br>Concentrate on going through the Class 2B course first. It will be about 8 months to a year, maybe even more, before you get your licence. Thats a long time to dream.</div>

In total, took me half a year from start to getting the Lic.<br><br>This inclusive to retaking some lessons this will happen as you progress to the later stages where it is harder to pass. And I took my TP twice too.<br><br>Since u want ur lic, must have alot of patience and determination.
