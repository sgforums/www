            <div class='col-md body'>If just for transport bike, don't go anything less the 125cc &amp; not more then 180cc.<br><br>My first bike is Piaggio Hexagon 180cc 2 stoke water cool. Bought $800 for 8year old bike. Very fast scooter bike. Maximum speed I reach is 150km/hr. Skidded once during rain &amp; bump by a stupid driver once when I was fully stopped at a junction. No injury involved.<br><br>Then I changed to Honda Wave 125cc 4 stoke air cool. Maximum speed I reach 110km/hr. Petrol not more then $60 for 1200km per month. Insurance is $99 per year third party depend on your age. Bike brand new cost $3700. I would never sold it if I did not get an overseas job. Super transport bike that can carry a lot of things. I have 2 basket + box. No accident on this bike.<br><br>Last July I bought an Piaggia Sifera. 80cc 2 stoke air cool for my holiday trip to Singapore. Maximum speed I reach 90km/hr single person. It's too cheap to pass by. Bought S$500 only 2 year old bike with less than 3000km on the meter. Third party insurance is $100. Road tax $80 a year. Petrol is heavier because smaller CC &amp; Scooter. Not recommend for daily long transport usage cause high petrol &amp; no power at all. Short daily transport very useful &amp; relax. No accident on this bike.<br><br>See my reverse trend of getting smaller &amp; smaller bike? Because I always think, if I have more power I risk my life on the road. If I have smaller power, I take every precaution. Still Singapore road do not have to run so fast. average 60~80km is more then enough. This only people who have involved in accident will fully understand. Don't speed.<br><br>Furthermore, the first 1~2 years on biking is your most dangerous period. Also when you buy bigger bike &amp; on loan. If involved in accident, medical fee, repair fee, bike loans, laywer fee &amp; fines all comes together. I personally seen a few people riding 250cc 500cc or bigger bikes in such situations. They have to sell the bike after repair at huge lost of $ &amp; go take bus or convert to smaller bikes. So beware.<br><br>DO NOT SPEED &amp; KEEP RIDING LESSER CC BIKE. I know it safe my life. I really hope people out there understand this. Best if someone can pass this to Traffic Police &amp; promote on small CC bike. Give us Road Tax rebate or some benefits for converting to smaller CC Bike. It save life, make our road safer, cleaner air &amp; more people are there contributing to the Country.</div>

The dangerous ones are those on 4 wheels, they are very dangerous to those riding 2 wheels ones right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> They just need to give a light kiss to those riding 2 wheels ones and can easily make them lying flat or even fly away on the road!

Brand new scoots from distributor may cost highest $10,000/-<br><br>Then there is considerations for the Road Tax, ERP Units, your insurances &amp; the parking fees.

No need pay one shot.

They are SSDC, CDC &amp; BBDC.<br><br>Singapore Safety Driving Centre~Ang Mo Kio<br>Comfort Driving Centre~Ubi<br>Bukit Batok Driving Centre~ As the name suggest.<br><br>Please do a yahoo search for them online and find one nearest to you.  Preferably one near your school or work place so you can go for lessons after school/work.<br><br>and yah....when you register for the course, it includes in theory lessons &amp; the basic theory test liao.  And Yes....you need to pass your basic theory test before you can proceed to book for the Final Theory/Bike Theory Test and then the practical test that provide you your licence.<br><br>2) There is no difference.  Singapore does not have private PRIVATE riding schools.  They are all private limited <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>3) You can register online, but you still need to go down to the school in person to hand over passport pictures of yourself, take the eye test &amp; collect your dates &amp; the booklets for your lessons and book your basic theory test.<br><br>Bring along your IC, photographs and roughly $130/- cash to pay for stuffs.<br><br>4) Yes. You will most likely have to pay for registration and some lessons as well as book your date for your Basic Theory Test. And if you got spare cash, can pay for your practical lessons first.  As and when your credit runs out, then you top it up with more cash to ensure smooth booking of other practical lessons and the final tests.</div>
