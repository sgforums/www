And also because of the high ratio of 2T, ur engine will die easily when just start(cold) without warm up. But the white smoke should get lesser when ur engine warms up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Another thing bad about too much 2T is that ur engine tends to have carbon and deposits clogs faster.<br><br>Adjust 2T, change to new plug may help.</div>

And it's always best to warm up the bike to let the engine oil lubricate all those moving components of the engine.<br><br>For your bike, 2 strokes bikes are famous for piston jamming due to insufficient 2T in the combustion chamber. SO i would advise you that it'll be safer for you see more smoke than to see no smoke and a jammed piston coupled with a broken conrod<br><br>lastl throttle response can be adjust from your fuel-air-ratio, and your 2T intake , and your jeting.<br>however be warned that if you run too lean you may be putting your bike in danger of a piston jam if there isn't enough 2T lubrication<br></div>

I can't tell you how much slack as I dun have the figure on hand, so let the experts tell you that.<br><br>I can tell you why though ... actually, when the bike is not loaded (not carrying any weight), the chain has some slack. But when you sit on your bike, you compress the suspension and the swing arm actually moves about it's pivot, as a result, tightening the chain.<br><br>Furthermore, I think there is a chain tensioner in your gearbox or something. When you kick in your gear from Neutral, the tensioner will tension your chain making it even tighter. So you can imagine what happens if your chain is already very tight when not carrying any load; you'll stress the chain even further when you sit on your bike. And imagine what happens when you cross a hump heavily .... Your chain might break.<br><br>The chain cannot be too tight, neither must it be too slack. When the chain is too slack, it probably jump some teeth on the sprockets, and wear out both chain and sprockets prematurely. Worse, the chain may even come away from the sproket and imagine what's going to happen after that ... think the chain will jam in the gearbox and ... you know lah ....<br><br>That much said, you must realise however that over time, chains that were at correct tension will eventually gain more and more free play ... this is normal wear and tear. This is why you should tension your chain properly on a regular basis.</div>

When you kick in your gear from Neutral, the tensioner will tension your chain making it even tighter. So you can imagine what happens if your chain is already very tight when not carrying any load; you'll stress the chain even further when you sit on your bike. And imagine what happens when you cross a hump heavily .... Your chain might break.<br><br>The chain cannot be too tight, neither must it be too slack. When the chain is too slack, it probably jump some teeth on the sprockets, and wear out both chain and sprockets prematurely. Worse, the chain may even come away from the sproket and imagine what's going to happen after that ... think the chain will jam in the gearbox and ... you know lah ....<br><br>That much said, you must realise however that over time, chains that were at correct tension will eventually gain more and more free play ... this is normal wear and tear. This is why you should tension your chain properly on a regular basis.</div></blockquote>Hi, I understand what u mean my chain is quite slack so i plan to go tightening the chain... i also understand about the free play.... now is after i tightening the chain the chain, i pillon my gf.. after i short ride the chain turn out very tight.. and even my bike put on side stand the chain still very tight... today i go losese the chain... but not long still same y?? what really happen???</div>
