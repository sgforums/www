            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has said the deadly bomb attack in the Indonesian resort island of Bali confirms that terrorists are shifting their theatre of operations to Southeast Asia.<br><br>Singaporeans must accept this, react in a rational manner, and try to enlarge the common space here.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>One step in this direction is the Code on Religious Harmony, which will soon be discussed with Singaporeans.<br><br>Mr Goh made these points during a dialogue with community leaders about the recent Jemaah Islamiyah arrests.<br><br>Offering his condolences to the families of victims of the deadly blast in Bali, Mr Goh made it clear that Singapore strongly condemns the nightclub bombing.<br><br>"The bomb blasts in Bali confirm what we have warned all along: that terrorists are shifting their theatre of operations to Southeast Asia. Terrorism is not a faraway problem. It is here at our doorstep," Mr Goh said.<br><br>"These terrorists are ruthless, and have no respect for human lives. Whatever their motive, Singapore strongly condemns their dastardly acts which have killed at least 187 innocent people, and injured more than 300 others," he said.<br><br>With these strong words, Mr Goh kicked off a 20-minute speech to nearly 1,700 community leaders on dealing with terrorism.<br><br>He stressed that Singaporeans have to decide their response as a nation because terrorism is a national, not a Muslim problem.<br><br>"The JI threatens our national security, our national cohesion and also our economy. And while the JI members are Muslims, and claim to be advancing the cause of Islam, they do not represent the Muslim community," Mr Goh said.<br><br>Because the JI is such a complex challenge, the Prime Minister said that Singapore's response must be multi-faceted.<br><br>First, it must acknowledge there is a terrorist threat in the region and at home, even though only a handful are involved here.<br><br>Next, Singaporeans should react in a calm and rational manner; non-Muslims must not succumb to unfounded suspicions and must rein in their fears, he said.<br><br>But he stressed this is not a one-way street -- Muslim Singaporeans must also do their part and reach out to others.<br><br>"If you become exclusive and different, this will reduce your interaction with non-Muslims. And if Islamic extremism grows in your midst, this will cause them to look at you with disquiet," Mr Goh said.<br><br>Mr Goh also welcomed the statement by Muslim groups here denouncing terrorist groups using Islam, but he said more can be done.<br><br>He suggested they study the ideology of al-Qaeda and JI to be better equipped to insulate Muslims here from their influence.<br><br>Quoting terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna, Mr Goh said that while al-Qaeda can be tackled militarily, it is only by challenging the Islamists's misinterpretation and misrepresentation of Koran that the world can inflict long-term strategic damage on the group.<br><br>Calling for a larger common space, Mr Goh said people must remember Singapore is a secular, multi-racial and multi-religious nation.<br><br>"I think, therefore, that this is a good time for all religions in Singapore to consider a statement to shore up inter-religious confidence," Mr Goh said.<br><br>"This statement is not some legal agreement or a law. But I feel that if we agree on it, and practise our religion in accordance with the spirit of the statement, it would contribute to even better relations between Singaporeans of all religions."<br><br>The Code of Religious Harmony will, among other things aim to prevent religion from ever being a source of conflict.<br><br>Concluding, Mr Goh said he could not guarantee there wouldn't be more arrests, but reassured Singaporeans the JI's operations here have been disrupted.</div>
