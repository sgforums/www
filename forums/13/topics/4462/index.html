            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys.<br><br>Now that you've mentioned about this "Black" Shop, i have something to add as well. don't buy any bikes from this shop, they promise you things that are free, but in the end, they deny it all.<br><br>If you happen to buy a bike from this shop, and want to sell it away still having installments left, you will not be able to do so. You are required to pay the whole amount for the bike before selling it away, or the buyer would have to loan the whole amount inclusive of the interests to buy the bike over.<br><br>I'm currentnly suffering from the above mentioned. Still waiting for the buyer to respond cos i lost his ctc number liao... die liao lah.... FYI, he has been added to my sub-rider list, so currently riding it.<br><br>Anyway, just be forewarned of this shop lah. Don't want someone else to suffer the same fate as me.</div>

So i explain that i would just be happy if i could push in my bike and trade in for another bike. Then he tell me he dun understand wat i toking about and made me repeat 3 times. Then after that, he simply told me "i dun wan to eat lor, wat can u do?"<br><br>I was damned pissed. feel like giving him a slap siah, nabeh want to do business do la, dun wan then just say nicely. give this type of attitude who will go his shop? i am sure someone will teach him a lesson these days. He is rather plump one, never wear specs, dunno whether he is the boss.. </div></blockquote>eh i think i know which one.. he was the one who attended to me when i went to ask about the honda varadero 125, abt 2 months back. he sounded okay to me leh.. except he kept saying "varadero" as "valialo". hmmm.. maybe he lost money on man utd vs arsenal... dunno!<br><br>next time shoot him back "are you the boss or not? if you're not, fuck off. get someone who can make decisions to talk to me."<br><br>------------------<br>rock hard... ride free...</div>
