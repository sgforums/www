            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>On the 060802 Friday evening. 2345hrs<br><br>3 TP bike was camping at Raffles Bvld after the bend towards ECP just after bus stop. The traffic police wore long sleeve blue from top to bottom.<br><br>Traffic was heavy, and slow.<br>The TP stop ALL BIKE SPOTTED. CLASS 2 bike were let go after awhile. The others class 2a and 2b riders were all told to surrender their IC, Insurance and Driving license. After around 30mins, about 60 bikes was stopped and had their document surrender.<br><br>5 more TP bike came down to the scene. Most of the bikers didnt even had chance to speak to the officer or question by them as there's too little TP but too many bikes held. The bike range from CBR, GSX, S4, SP, Apprilla, Krr, FSX, Phantom, DT, XR even an old suzuki GN125 I think.. etc... u name it u got it.<br><br>Around 12.05am 170802, All riders and pillion was told to start their bike and in twos follow the TP back to their HQ at UBI. The rider were all confused as the traffic police didnt even inform them why we should follow them back and base on what charge. But as all the riders' IC, License, Insurance were detain by the TP all had no choice but to follow.<br><br>The convoy of 60 bikes of all kind moves off slowly from Raffles Bvld to Ubi. The convoy hit the ECP at around 40-50km/h and was stretch upto 2km long with only 8 TP bike escourt. The large convoy taken up all the left lane on ECP and exit at Fort Road. Filter lane were all block by TP and traffic light without camera were too block by TP for the large convoy to move. The convoy was freaking long imagine 60 bikes 2 by 2 taking up centre lane on Gullimard road.<br><br>At the TP HQ, riders were called 1 by 1 and were than told that the TP is going to impound their bike and awaits LTA inspection as they were being suspected of having illegal modification. They were given the date for the inspection. Some were lucky to have the date early this few days but the latter got to wait upto a week or 2. No one was spared everyone's bike was impounded. No excuse or reasoning, they just dun bother abt why u were there.<br><br>After the rider pushed their bike to the impound compound parking and surrender of bike key, They were allowed to leave and report back the day stated in the notice given.<br><br>Speaking to some of the "Victim" I learnt some had just finish movie with gf and was just going to send the pillion back. Some had just finish work ard suntec area and was going for supper. Most were wondering why they were all unlucky.<br><br>Did the TP consider the factors that in this convoy there were alot of 'P' plates and how many riders are comfortable and confident in riding in such a long big convoy with close following distance. No briefing was given before moving off and riders do not know the reason of going to TP HQ and route of advancement.<br><br>Though the convoy was slow but the leading TP bike travelles at irregulate speed, and occasion do fast acceleration. How can so many riders from different part and different riding style keep up with the unfamiliar speed of travelling. Everyones was not familiar with each other riding style some were going fast and close some were slow and keep a safe following distance.<br><br>We have seen lots of tragic incidence occurs during large convoy riding and realise the importance of safety detail planing and briefing. I am very surprise by the TP decision &amp; act in this incident.<br><br>As the bike got impounded some though a few days and some a week or 2 but no doubt it definately would cause great in-convenience to the "victims". Imagine those stay in Sembawang and study in NTU, How about those leaving in the EAst and work in the far west? HOw many of them lost their income this weekend from the lost of use of transport?<br><br>If during an accident, the "victim" can cliam lost of transport. Than in this case if we were proven innotcent after the LTA inspection can where can we make our loss claim from.<br><br>The TP definately has the right to take all the action listed above, but is their action in this particular incident justifiable? What is their rational behind it? Why did they target all Class 2a and 2b bikes? Why did they suspect all had illegal modification when they didnt even take a good look or even start the engine of most of the bikes or even question the rider.<br><br>Can someone enlighten me and also if u happens to be the "victim" too pls reply ur views. Thanks you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wanna ask, especially the two (i think) riders here involved in this: on what grounds did the TP suspect the bikes for illegal modification? ok, u ride racer change the pipe mebbe can tell straightaway, some more if i not wrong those TP in blue uniform as opposed to the white ones specialise more on registry and modifications (i think). but then u mentioned all sorts of bike including phantom and i rarely see phantoms modified, unless you consider handlebars/foot rests as illegal modifications?! are those bikes realli realli modified in terms of their performance as opposed to just accessories? or worse still is it they anyhow impound to be checked? i think a more serious problem would be if they cause such undue inconvenience without valid proof. i dont want i happily riding without breaking any law the TP suddenly take my bike away for a few days or weeks and some more expect me go home from tp hq just like that when i realli nebber modify my bike. appreciate if the 2 fellow riders can share what the tp see to impound the bike, i cannot accept if they impound like dat without seeing anything at all.</div>
