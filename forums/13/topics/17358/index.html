            <div class='col-md body'>hi, bikelovers. i m allan. I wanna get a cagiva mito. Can u all care to tell me how much is first hand or second hand? If i buy first hand, how much is needed to spend on the maintainence per month? Since it is a first hand, will it have less problems? what models does cagiva have, aprilla got y2k, replica, extrema, so what does cagiva have? Should i buy first hand or second hand? i guessed that second hand got lots of problem. where can i buy a mito, which place is a authorised dealer? i dun wanna get cheated buying a mito. Is mito using a approved arrow pipe? what is its top speed? the most important is how much is its overall maintainence which include oil and 2T.

First hand abt $10000/- +++. With that price, U can buy two KRR 150...Think abt it....High buying price....low resale value!

But not the power.If you like the looks so much. No harm buying. But if you want, get a second hand one. Coz its cheap. DAMN CHEAP! $700 can get you one MITO. The latest MITO is EV. Looks nicer than an average bike but when you wana sell, its will drop like shit. Up to you lar, $$ is yours not ours. Think it through.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my opinion is that you should not get a mito.<br>do not let your emotions control your head.<br>better choices will be nsr,tzm,krr and last but not least APRILIA.<br><br>in singapore roads, you do not need all the trick parts that comes with the mito cos its restricted to 12 hp.<br><br>why waste the 10k?<br><br></div>

Thank you, guys. i know you all know a lot about bikes.</div></blockquote>Mito 1st hand cost abt $12000, on the road abt $13500. And the top speed is 130-140km/hr, at a damn slow pick up. It uses the new gagiva pipe, which inside is with alot of air chamber blocking the air flow, thus losing damn lots of power.  Its high, and heavy. Sitting position will definitely be more uncomfortable *very steep*, and it will cause your back to ache easily. Resale value? Very low. Maintainence? Very high. Spare parts can only be found at Gagiva agents located at "MINARVA" along Balestier Rd. (u can see many Ducati 996 bikes in the showroom) And there's another shop along Tanjong Katong road, near the "Bak Kua" shop, they are Mito's agent also. Forgot the shop name. The boss is David.<br><br>PS: My ex-friend last time bought a 1st hand Mito, he downpayment $2.5K, each month installments $340x36. If u can tahan, go ahead.</div>

If it is S$13,000 on the road, you will need to pay a downpayment of 20% which means S$2600 upfront.
