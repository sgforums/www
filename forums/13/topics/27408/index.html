            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from gixxer.com bulletin board<br><br>Quote:<br>This day began as planned. Went to Frankie's garage where he keeps his bike to put new locks on it with his mother. Came home, ran a few errands. Nothing too exciting.<br><br>Just one more thing to do before I go to the hospital. Walk the dog.<br>While doing so, one of my friends approaches me on his bike, shaking his head he says, " It's ******* terrible right? That Frankie Died?"<br>I said, " Where the hell did you hear that. I was just with his mother 2 hours ago?"<br>To which he replied," He died an hour ago. "<br>Checked my voicemail and sure enough, there was Frankie's mother's voice crying hysterically, pleading with me to call her.<br>As it turns out, while we were at the garage, the hospital was calling her home frantically trying to notify her of his death.<br><br>Just last night, the doctors were saying that Frankie had come out of the coma, but was still under heavy sedation. They said that with in 2 weeks or so, Frankie could begin physical rehabilitation. They were just hoping that this infection that he had would go away. His fever went up to 103 last night. And this morning it was up at 108. His heart gave out at around 12:30 pm Tuesday afternoon.<br>They have NO EXPLAINATION FOR WHAT THE HELL WENT WRONG. What caused the infection? How the hell did his heart give out when as the doctors put it, he had a very strong heart, and this should not have happened? He was 29 years old when he died. An only child with no children of his own.<br><br>We all gathered at his house, and there we consolded one another from 3 pm this afternoon, until 1 am Wednesday morning.<br>I am sick to my stomach!!! <span style="color: red;"><strong>GET RID OF THE ******* HALF SHELL HELMETS GUYS!!!!!!!!! AND TO THOSE OF YOU IN STATES WHICH ONLY REQUIRE YOU TO WEAR GLASSES, KEEP IN MIND THAT GLASSES WILL NOT KEEP YOU FROM CRUSHING YOUR </strong></span><strong>SKULL. </strong>Frankie had a full-faced helmet sitting on his bed in his bedroom today, where he had left it wednesday night when he came out to ride with us.<br>That decision cost him his life. I realize that unless it's close to home, this will probably not be enough to get some of you to think twice about half shell helmets. BUT WHY DOES IT HAVE TO TAKE FOR IT TO BE CLOSE TO HOME, MAYBE EVEN YOU ON LIFE SUPPORT, TO <strong>STOP USING THEM HELMETS. </strong><br>If you own one, read the inside label.<br>It says that it is a "NOVELTY ITEM, AND IS NOT SNELL OR DOT APPROVED, AND IS NOT TO BE USED WHEN OPERATING OFFROAD OF STREET VEHICLES"<br>Why the hell do they produce them if they aren't supposed to be work on off road or street vehicles? A NOVELTY item, is meant for displaying on a shelf.<br><br>My friend has died,and today I had to look in to the eyes of a grieving mother and tell her how sorry I was that her son was no longer with us.<br>BARE IN MIND THAT HIS DEATH WAS NOT THE RESULT OF A STUNT GONE BAD. JUST A SIMPLE CASE OF A PEDESTRIAN WALKING OUT IN FRONT OF HIS BIKE AS HE WAS RIDING, AND IT HAPPENED TOO QUICKLY TO DO ANYTHING TO AVOID IT.<br><br>He wasn't struck by a car. Wasn't doing a wheelie. Wasn't rolling an endo. He was just trying to get from point A to point B, and ****, he's gone now.<br><br>I don't mean to preach, but ****!!I don't want to EVER see a post on this board regarding the death of a rider due to improper gear. I'M ******* SICK, AND I JUST WANT TO TEAR MY EYES OUT.<br>It will all hit like a brick the days of the wake.<br>Thank you all again for all of your prayers. Thank you for following this thread<br><br></div>
