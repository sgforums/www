            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Bryan, I checked out the ZX12 and you're right on the power! 175HP is impressive even for a car! Busa looks very ugly to me so I won't be considering it (no offense to Busa riders).<br><br>One reason I"m looking at the Blackbird and ZZR is because I want an older bike as I don't want to spend too much on them.<br><br>I've owned mostly Hondas, and never owned a Kawa before. How're they like in terms of fit and finish, reliability, parts quality and durability and parts price?<br><br>Thanks!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey redname,<br>That was exactly the kind of "insider" info needed. Things that I would not have thought of, like parts taking a long time. Yes I'm going to buy 2nd hand, possibly a 3-5 yr old bike.  I've also had the same experience as you. The worse dealer experience I've had was with Suzuki, and the 2 suzuki bikes I've owned, the parts were not very sturdy and the bikes were not very reliable. Don't think I'll be even considering a Suzuki bike.<br><br>I've owned 2 hondas and both of them were super reliable and built like tanks. They never let me down. The dealership is also well organised, and its easy to get Honda stuff off the net.<br><br>Thanks once again for the info on the kawa dealer, that's really important in my decision making.</div>

Parts wise for a class 2 Bike u still have to order in...Kawa is famous for raw power...Honda is boring esp if u wanna mod it into higher horse pwr...U can spend on the same mod on the kawa and honda, but the kawa will have a higher horse pwr gain...<br>I suggest u go to loois motor..Have a look...They r reputable and many groups like storm riders and easy riders goes there...Their mechanic meng tong is very good...<br>But if price is a factor, BB might be enuf for u...Compare the price and riding posture is the most impt...Power u can increase it urself after u buy...<br><br></div>
