            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ....<br>from experience I can relate to 2 areas ...<br>1. Your clutch cable. Is the cable at the correct tension ? Because it happened to me when my clutch cable got loose and when I clutch in using the clutch lever, the clutch mechanism did not disengage fully, causing me difficulty in changing gear, especially when I'm at low gear stages. Tightening the clucth cable tension corrected my problem.<br><br>2. Is your clutch mecahnism ok ? I once had problem with my gear change pedal. Same thing, stiff and wouldn't really engage neutral. When engaging 1st gear, the chain would tension with a loud "thud". It was real loud ... until one day, something snapped. My gear change pedal lever linkage snapped. And I had to call a tow truck; the whole pedal just dangling there, the connection to the clutch mechanism lost. After I changed the pedal lever linkage  ... nothing unusual happened. I guess it's just out of the blue stuck or something,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>The other thing ... just to be sure .....<br>Your sprocket. You mentioned you changed the chain before. Did anything happen to your sprocket ? When you changed the chain, did the mechanic inspect the sprocket ? It seems unlikely the sprocket would be causing the problem. If supposingly the sprocket lost a tooth or perhaps got bent somehow or whatever, you should be able to feel somthing wrong while you are riding ....<br><br>There, that's all I can contribute. Good luck !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>according to wat I know, gear oil doesn't cause problems like yours. The oil is simply used to lubricate the gears. At most, if you used the wrong type of oil, the engine gears might wear out faster than normal. Or maybe more carbon deposits due to thermal incompatibility. But mostly, if you use oil labelled 4T, the viscosity and themal compatibilty should be there. At least, that's what I think ....<br><br>By the way, it doesn't mean thin oil is necessarily good. the idea is correct viscosity with the right load carrying characteristics. If your oil is overly thin, the oil may not be able to carry the load imposed by the gears in operation.<br><br>Depends on what condition is your sprocket, you may feel things like higher vibration level, unusual sounds. Of course, you need to observe what your bike sounds like and feel like when it's operating normally, otherwise you wont be able to tell a difference if there really was.<br><br>Have you go see your mechanic and ask him to inspect your gear change pedal lever linkage ? Oh, by the way, when you engage gear, another mechanism that tensions your chain (chain tensioner) will be activated. Your last chain was badly worn out .... could it have been too tight or wat ? Have you asked the mechanic why the chain was worn badly ? Was the chain used for a long time already ? If not, shouldn't have worn out very badly. In any case, in my opinion, the tensioner is questionable.<br><br>That being said, I'm not a mechanic. Ask your trusty mechanic about your condition and see what he says. Dun forget to share your experience. Good luck !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey duc,<br>depending on the chain. Some brand claim they can last for 5 years. But generally, once you find the chain and sprocket worn out, just change it. On the average, the chain has a good working life of a bout 2 years or more before wear and tear becomes prominent.<br><br>I dunno about your mechanic, but mine don't charge me for inspecting a problem. Maybe if the inspection job is complicated, they'll just charge a nominal fee. I think most mech don't charge if they dun repair anything. Did you ask your mech ? Just ask him if he charges just for inspection and diagnosing .... If he does and the fee very ex, maybe can ask around see if you can find one who doesn't charge at all or doesn't charge as much .... My regular mech is at Kim Keat. There's a popular mech which I heard from fren, from Eddy Ong or something. Not too sure ... just ask around.</div>

One of your plates may have broke or one of the cage arms bend. If its the cage that is giving the prob...get ready to fork out quite alot. If its the plates, you may (I repeat, you may) replace the faulty one. I think 1 plate cost about 20 - 40 issit?? (can't remember!!). Total 7 plate.... or issit 6?? aiyah...forgot also ah...<br><br>I don't think its your clutch freeplay coz that would affect your moving off more.<br><br>I also don't tink its your sprocket. Most of the time, a bad sprocket or chain will generate noise and vibration first....before it really gives you any problem like broken chain or what...<br><br>I hope it help...</div>
