Sometimes when the mechanic has his ORD mood, he'll do some fuck up job to your bike even if he's the most trusted mechanic you have.<br><br>Thats why we must learn. If you have a long term bike, better go to the agent and buy the mechanic service manual. Dun cost much. My G6 manual costed $45 but can last me long time and served me well. the $45 was well spent.</div>
