            <div class='col-md body'>to all riders out there, my opinion is that the irc tyres are good for for sedate street riding in dry and wet conditions.<br><br>all of u talk about cut corners and how gp racers will never use irc tyres. but ask yourself this question, how many of u really have a racing license and know the proper techniques of cutting corner. the answer is most probably none of you.<br><br>as for gp racers, their bike is sponsered by manfacturers and of coure they get all the good stuff on the bikes. moreover they have a racing license while us mere mortals have only class 2b and above.<br><br>those racers in the sbk and moto gp are the gods and semi gods of riding talent in the racing world. we should not compare ourselves with them.<br><br>lastly just beacause irc are made in thailand does not mean they are lousy stuff. these tyres are choosen for normal riding and cornering, not the extreme stuff.<br><br>but of course if u think u are a semi god in the motorcycling world, then these tyres are absolute rubbish. agree or not?</div>
