            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with FADZ. he is not looking down at those p plate and class 2b riders. the main point he is tring to say is that riding skills is as important as tyre choice. only with superb skills can you get the best of those good tyres.<br><br>as for those who say that getting a racing license is easy, think again. if it was so easy, there would be lots of pro racers in singapore competing in malaysia and thailand already and bringing trophies back home.<br><br>i know there are lots of those who think that their skills are damm good enough to qualify for a racing license. in that case i wish your all the best and maybe you will make it to the sbk or moto gp one day and do singapore proud.<br><br>as for the tyres choices, its really up to the individual. as long as u think the tyre choice u choose is correct, then go for it.<br><br>however i would advise that u do not let those bike mechanics psycho u into thinking that irc are crap. after all they wil impress their boss if they manage to persuade u to get new tyres.<br><br>comments?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally disagree with wat fadz says. i think that good tyres are the most important thing to have on a bike. even if u r not going to corner at high speeds... It is a nessesity for safety in case of emergency braking or wet wheather or any other reasons..it is even more important than the skills he claim to have.<br>Fadz i think u r a fool..<br></div>

U all say i bluff coz i say RXZ reach 160 rite? WRONG! i said my bike(NSR150SP) reached 160. see, u all are blind, i never even own an RXZ b4. i said the p-plate guy blow throttle like nobody's business and i advice that it's not a good idea. Clear?<br>2. Counter Steer, wad do u noe abt it?? u think i dunno wat that is? WRONG again, counter steer is wat racers use to term the method of turning and banking i wrote b4(to save newbies asses, not to haolian).. im trying to share a skill and i think its good if u all keep an open mind(dun tink u so good already)... seriously!<br>3. TZM said,"Aiyoh Fadz, u so sud ah, they overtake, overtake lah." U all see, i never even say i was angry at that guy. i was juz saying that new road users shouldn't take that riding previlledge for granted... i did mentioned that i can beat him BUT i didn't coz, i myself dun encourage racing on roads. (Next time read and understand properly b4 shooting me ok brother)<br>4. then fp2075r said, "i totally disagree with fadz. good tyres are a necessity for cornering and blah, blah, blah.." Hello fren WAKE UP!!! i did say that the tyres are fine if u ride 'normally' but i ALSO did mention that im looking for a good pair of gripping tyres to aid my cornering coz im concerned with the safety of my gf... is all that NOT CLEAR to u? are u dumb or something? i said that i need u guys to HELP me recommend some tyres, NOT bombard me as though im the terrorist who crashed 2 planes into NY WTC!!<br>I hope u all can OPEN up ur eyes, read &amp; understand wat im trying to say. im here to share and for good will,not like some people who haf bad blood(u noe who u are) and juz simply have to say words like 'u so sud ah' or u 'i think u are a fool'... look again everybody, i think we now know who are the real fools. Pls, i hope u guys learn something today... pls dun insult or write anything that brings abt anger in people. The message is clear, it's for the good of all.<br><br>------------------<br>Ride Safely Guys!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fadz (edited 30 September 2001).]</div>

U all say i bluff coz i say RXZ reach 160 rite? WRONG! i said my bike(NSR150SP) reached 160. see, u all are blind, i never even own an RXZ b4. i said the p-plate guy blow throttle like nobody's business and i advice that it's not a good idea. Clear?<br>2. Counter Steer, wad do u noe abt it?? u think i dunno wat that is? WRONG again, counter steer is wat racers use to term the method of turning and banking i wrote b4(to save newbies asses, not to haolian).. im trying to share a skill and i think its good if u all keep an open mind(dun tink u so good already)... seriously!<br>3. TZM said,"Aiyoh Fadz, u so sud ah, they overtake, overtake lah." U all see, i never even say i was angry at that guy. i was juz saying that new road users shouldn't take that riding previlledge for granted... i did mentioned that i can beat him BUT i didn't coz, i myself dun encourage racing on roads. (Next time read and understand properly b4 shooting me ok brother)<br>4. then fp2075r said, "i totally disagree with fadz. good tyres are a necessity for cornering and blah, blah, blah.." Hello fren WAKE UP!!! i did say that the tyres are fine if u ride 'normally' but i ALSO did mention that im looking for a good pair of gripping tyres to aid my cornering coz im concerned with the safety of my gf... is all that NOT CLEAR to u? are u dumb or something? i said that i need u guys to HELP me recommend some tyres, NOT bombard me as though im the terrorist who crashed 2 planes into NY WTC!!<br>I hope u all can OPEN up ur eyes, read &amp; understand wat im trying to say. im here to share and for good will,not like some people who haf bad blood(u noe who u are) and juz simply have to say words like 'u so sud ah' or u 'i think u are a fool'... look again everybody, i think we now know who are the real fools. Pls, i hope u guys learn something today... pls dun insult or write anything that brings abt anger in people. The message is clear, it's for the good of all.<br><br></div></blockquote>hmmm ok ok Fadz, i know what u meant lah, ITS JUST THAT, maybe the words you typed are abit misleading somewhere lor... maybe u can add some face expressions like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> or  :p :p to make ur words not so tense... *thats what i personally thinks lah* Hmm... hahaha<br><br>Today i had a chat with Ivan, actually i think last time Ivans words are harsh also lah, hahaha but hey, don worry man, we're all riders what, right Ivan?
