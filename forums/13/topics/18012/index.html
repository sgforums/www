            <div class='col-md body'>I ORD 5 yrs ago liao so now I can act lao jiao a bit to pass on my experience. I also think during the time i am in the army that the whole NS thing is damn wayang. But at this turbulent time when the world is so chaotic and anything can happen, I can start to feel the importance of National Service. You never know when Singapore may become another Israel or Kuwait. This is very real. The skills that you acquire be it as a commando like feng123 (salute!) or an armoured tank commander like myself will come into critical use should circumstances require. However, it doesn't mean you have to be in a damn siong type of vocation in order to contribute. Every head counts no matter if you are a cook, clerk, driver, commander, guards or tankee.  It is the ability to work together with your fellow friends and feeling proud of every contribution that you can make that counts. Take every thing that come along like a man should. Don't try to chao geng, wayang and don't be very very on the ball, xiao onz or hero also. Just make as many friends as possible and make as less enemy. Be as likeable as possible. Then when the time come when you ORD, you will start to feel you are missing something. That I feel is how things should be. Dom, don't need to worry so much one, juz be proud and happily serve.<br><br>Pai seh, act like I damn lao jiao like that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, you can't really choose where you will end up during NS. Except if you sign on, then you can choose.<br><br>What I think is....If you are the chiong type, then go for the best you can...whatever the vocation it is. Chiong sua is confirm siong, but if you put a positive attitude in it, then it'll be bearable.<br>But if you are the siam-slacker type, then you better be super low profile and slack the moment you enter camp the first day.<br><br>I feel you should go all out. No need to sign on. Unless you really thinking of making army as a career, dun think about it. Life's gonna be tough, definitely. But in the end, you become a better man out of the experiences you have in the army.<br><br>I never regretted what I did in the army. Though it was siong, but there were fun times, when everyone suffered together. It was a good learning and moulding ground. Turns a boy to a MAN.<br><br>I had thought of signing on in guards b4, when I was in BMT. But come to think of it, once I sign, I'll confirm stay for life since when run out of contract, I would be rather old oredi. How to compete with young grads outside?<br><br>In the end, I feel good when I know that I chiong instead of being a clerk or something.<br><br>SO...go for it!</div>

Moreover, you may not be upgraded for all you know.<br><br>But you can try for an upgrade, I'm sure the MO will be more than happy to upgrade you if he can.<br><br>No harm trying. If you don't get the upgrade, then you'll be deskbound for sure. May not not a totally bad thing. Well, make it worthwhile wherever you land on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you really learn a lot of things when you serve.. that is, undergo training and all that. matures a boy into a man, and you learn about yourself also. makes you appreciate your family more and not to take things for granted.<br><br>not sure if you'd consider this an advantage, but staying as pes E means you may be exempted from National Service (reservist). after ORD, you'll be on a holding list for 5 years, then after that, they don't touch you anymore.<br><br>i'd say try for the upgrade. it's worth the sweat...<br>but with all that said, let the MO check your eye first..
