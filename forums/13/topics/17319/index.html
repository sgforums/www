            <div class='col-md body'>ok basically, run in means something like "season your bike" make the parts get used to each other, so that means dun thrash the bike,dun ram high, anyway u can ask the others for better detail or your manual, coz mi not riding SP, use 2t? best is fully syntechtic, best to try asking other SP riders(at this point of time, i feel damn extra sia, coz i m not SP rider) anyway, maintenance, wash carb,wash valve, spark plug, gear oil.....simple things, when u get your bike that day, just check 2t n coolant level, the rest should be ok....see u on the rd soon!!</div>
