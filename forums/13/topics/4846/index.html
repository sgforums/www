            <div class='col-md body'>This accelerator problem has disappeared for some time, until it come back today.<br><br>Today went to service bike. Wash carburator, change oil filter, change air filter, change oil. Problem come back immediately after leaving shop.<br><br>I suspect the problem lies with the starter switch (the one on the right at the handle bar, connects to the starter motor, not the ignition switch). Now I usually off it after riding. If forgot to off, engine cannot start smoothly the next day, need to play with throttle. Anyone experts on electrical problems?</div>

Personally, I feel a bit of difference between before and after. The throttle gives more "power" (rev goes up faster) and gear change seems more smoother. Overall, the bike feels "smoother" and a bit more powerful, but the max. speed achieved still the same (maybe that's because my bike is a slow bike)<br><br></div>
