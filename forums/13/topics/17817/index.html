            <div class='col-md body'>Today do some maintenance, then saw a 3 nut tighten cap (is it the oil filter?) at the engine, so open out to see what is it. Black oil starts leaking out, so immediately close back and tighten. In the end the oil leak about 1 plate diameter on the floor.<br><br>Question is: how to check the level of engine oil? My bike is Virago 125, got a gauge at the engine there, but inside is clear liquid leh, so dun is it use for engine oil or not. Also, got no max. or min mark. Inside the filler cap also not dipstick leh.</div>

But if you wana hear what I advise, use the remaining amount of engine oil in your tank and go to a bike shop to change engine oil. You bike is very dependant on engine oil.
