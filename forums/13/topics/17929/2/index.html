            <div class='col-md body'>before getting into biking, i would urge you to seriously consider the dangers of riding a bike. an accident can happen in just a split second and the rider can instantly die on the spot. this is true regardless of what bike you are buying.<br><br>being paranoid is good, being scare is good for it forces you to wake up to the idea that you can die anytime. a bike is very differnt fron driving a car or taking public transport.<br><br>so u still intend to ride?<br></div>

Scrams have gd pick-up and are naturally high, but if you can't control and master it, you may have problems making U-turns and squezing bet cars. Racers, on the other hand can travel top speed and speeding is the number 1 killer....<br><br>But don't be pressured into choosing the wrong bike. Follow what bike you really want and practise safe riding. If you ride safetly, nothing can go wrong.</div>
