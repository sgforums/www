            <div class='col-md body'>The thing about 2stroke is that the power comes faster than the 4 stroke. The power is quite true that 2stroke is more powerful than 4stroke. Come on..thing about it...it takes a 2stroke bike to produce power at every revolution..4stroke produces power at every other revolution. The word "stroke" is actually means a motion. But ppl confuses it with the number of pistons. If you thing...in one second one can go how many revs when you compare a 2stroke and a 4stroke 125cc....or 250cc..or 500cc. Let me tell you...the 2stroke wins. That is why pgm4 or rs250 can win RVF in pickup....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>I am TA150.

Power and speed are, in a sense related.<br><br>Ok, I start from the beginning. Any mechanical student would noe that power is the amount of work(Joules) divide by time. It is very difficult to get a bike that gives you great power yet energy conserving. Why? B'coz, a certain amt of fuel can only give you a certain amt of energy. You want more power, you got to burn more fuel.<br><br>Next.... power is the product of force and velocity. You can see Force as pick-up/strength and velocity as speed. This is where you got to give and take. If you want better pick-up, you got to sacrifice top speed. Scrambler is a good example....<br><br>Enuff is explain about how 2 stroke and 4 stroke bike operates. I will skip that...<br><br>OK, 2 stroke engine are indeed much more powerful than 4 strokes, when comparing with an engine of same piston displacement( what we refer to as cc) becoz of its 1 rev, 1 burn as compared to 2 rev, 1 burn for 4 strokes. Why 4 strokes need 2 rev and 1 burn?? The first rev is to compress the fuel, the next is to burn it.<br><br>If you want a fast bike, get a 2 stroke. If you want solely for transport and easy to maintain, get a 4 stoke.</div>
