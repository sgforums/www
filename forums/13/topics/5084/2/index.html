I'm going to attempt to do it and spray it all silver, so i tried only on my grab rail first, then realised that the paint started to crack after a month bcos the lacquer wasn't even. Somemore where got so much space at my hdb multistorey carpark to put all the fairings while they dry? anybody got any experience u can share&gt;?<br></div></blockquote>metalic silver or chrome silver? Chrome silver must be very hard.. I think u should use air brush not gas spray... Spray one is too strong, so the painting won't smooth. If not smooth, then chrome silver is ugly cos the dropling will be very obvious. I suggest u to ask motortiam to do it for you.<br><br>If metalic silver should be ok one (like those on KRR). But, carefull when doing coating... must be aware from that dropling which drop from spraying hole. Must often wipe it with tissue and make sure that the hole doesn't have excess liquid or not blocked with dried paint residue. So, before each spraying, must try first on something else to be sure. Every spraying, don't press to long... the liquid will surely drop one.. maybe every 10 secs then wipe the hole, then continue again...<br></div>
