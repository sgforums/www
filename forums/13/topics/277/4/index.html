Currently, COEs are at it's lowest in months. That means, new bikes becomes relatively cheaper (or at a glance seems cheaper). Economic condition is Singapore now is pretty bad, many bike shops are stuck with second bikes they can't sell.<br><br>My suggestion is, spend a little money to make-over your bike to make like changing the lights, throttle, seat cover, etc. You'll be surprised it make a difference in the resale price. You will notice that owners will buy from you instead of the hard-bargaining shop people. I know a place where you can do all these cheaply..if you are interested.<br></div>

Slippery also..</div></blockquote>My advice to all fellow Phantom riders: The IRC tires are made specially for new bikes, using more percentage of syntethic rubber than natural rubber. You see, manufacturer will tender to supply tyres to assembler. They have to quote the cheapest in order to win the tender. So the enduser is the end-loser. This is a common phenomenon too with cars. That is why, it is no uncommon to find a new owner trading in his set of tyres when new.<br><br>Don't compromise your own safety with sub-standard tyres. If you can't afford, ride over to Malaysia and have it changed at any motorbike shops. The price is half that of Singapore's and you get good-gripping tyres.<br></div>

First, you can change the air-filter with a K&amp;N type which allow more oxygen to combust the fuel more completely and quickly. Next, you might want to change to a hotter spark plug to stronger firing power. If this is not enough, go look for a second-hand 250cc carburetor that will fit.<br><br>All these will allow a marked difference in performance for a start.<br></div>
