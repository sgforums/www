First, you can change the air-filter with a K&amp;N type which allow more oxygen to combust the fuel more completely and quickly.

            <div class='col-md body'>Both my seasoned riders friends and shop's mechanic advised me to change regularly around 1,000 Km.<br><br>I was subsequently advised to change spark plug every 4,000 to 5,000 Km.<br><br>I feel it is savings on BOTH engine parts and fuel efficiency.  But if you intend to upgrade soon well I guess it is mostly up to you.<br><br>Personally I am able to tell a performance boost after an engine oil and/or spark plug change on my humble 200 cc Phantom bike.<br><br>Finally I try to wash my bike at least once a week.<br><br>Now I am looking for a good mechanic to help me tune up my carburator.  Heard that a finely tuned carburator improves engine performance from 1/4 to 3/4 throttle range.  Which means that I am able to overtake with MORE power around 80 to 90 Km/h.  Which might also mean I am able to get out of some bad situations better!<br><br>cheers<br><br>[This message has been edited by seeprompt (edited 19 June 2002).]</div>

It depends on the frequency of your usage or whether you are the type who do a lot of fast pick-ups. As the owner of your bike, I'm sure you can tell if the firing power has slacken or if your sense any 'bubbly-bursting' effect when picking up, this means mis-firing or the spark-plug is not firing consistently.
