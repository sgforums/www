            <div class='col-md body'>From the Strait Times website (Wed)<br><br>BP to sell petrol stations in S'pore, Malaysia<br><br>It aims to focus on markets where it can be a leading player; divestment 'not a fire sale'; move will affect about 40 jobs<br><br>By Christopher Tan<br><br>BRITISH Petroleum (BP) is leaving the petrol station business in Singapore and Malaysia after 40 years - a move that industry players say reflects increasingly thin profit margins in the sector.<br><br>The company wants to sell 270 petrol stations - including 30 in Singapore - two liquefied petroleum gas bottling plants and its one-third stake in the Singapore Refinery Co as it pushes out of the two countries.<br>Advertisement<br><br>Its new goals are lofty. 'BP's global strategy is to focus on significant markets where we are or can be in No. 1 or No. 2 position,' said spokesman Mathew Yap.<br><br>BP has about the same number of kiosks in Singapore as Caltex, but less than half that of giants Shell and ExxonMobil.<br><br>Singapore Petroleum Co (SPC), the smallest player, has 10 kiosks.<br><br>Across the Causeway, BP has the fourth-largest kiosk network after Shell, ExxonMobil and Petronas.<br><br>The company is likely to use proceeds from the sale of its assets - estimated to be $1 billion - for growth areas such as China and Russia, where it has been increasing its presence.<br><br>But BP is keeping its trading, lubrication, marine, aviation, and gas and power activities here.<br><br>It said that the number of jobs affected would be limited to about 40, or less than 10 per cent of its total workforce here.<br><br>'In our talks with prospective buyers, the interests of staff, including job security, will be given serious consideration,' Mr Yap said.<br><br>The sale is likely to be made through an open-tender system.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that likely candidates include America's ChevronTexaco, which operates Caltex stations here, state-owned Kuwait Oil, Oman Oil and Indonesia's Pertamina.<br><br>Sources reckon Singapore's homegrown oil trader Hin Leong, owned by low-profile rags-to-riches magnate O.K. Lim, could also be in the running.<br><br>SPC could also be in the running, saying that it is 'keen to evaluate this network expansion opportunity'.<br><br>BP's network in Malaysia has interested US group Conoco, Malaysia's Petronas, and the Sime Darby group, according to wire agencies.<br><br>The divestment, said Mr Yap, is 'not a fire sale' as the businesses are profitable, and would be sold as going concerns.<br><br>But rivals seemed cool to the news.<br><br>'They don't have many good sites,' said one. 'These days, all the good sites are in HDB estates, and BP does not have many sites in HDB areas.'<br><br>They also pointed out that bidding would not be aggressive because of diminished profit margins in recent years, reflected by the low prices fetched at tenders for new station sites.<br><br>Last year, SPC secured a 2,256 sq m pump site in Hougang for $15.7 million.<br><br>The most recent tender, held last month, for a Sengkang site of similar size, was secured by Shell for $15.2 million.<br><br>The prices are about half those fetched at the peak - as recently as five years ago.<br><br>BP's move follows similar divestments in places like Hong Kong, Thailand and East Malaysia.<br><br>UP FOR SALE:<br><br># 270 petrol stations, including 30 in Singapore<br><br># Two liquefied petroleum gas bottling plants<br><br># One-third stake in the Singapore Refinery Co<br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>Well...looks like time to cash in my EZ points and switch Petrol Stations  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  .....</div>
