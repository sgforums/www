It uses 2T to lubricate its piston and of course gear oil for its gear. But most of the time ppl mistook the gear oil of 2-stroke bike as 4T. Unlike 4-stroke which uses 4T to lubricate its engine. The amount of 4T require is of course more than the gear oil la. But dont worry, u need to change only after 5000km or 10000km for synthetic oil. As for plugs used on 4-stroke bikes also last longer than 2-stroke bikes.<br><br></div>
