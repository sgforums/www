            <div class='col-md body'>Actually there is human nature I guess. When you change to a bigger bike, the tendency of you going faster is normal. Be it whether you say that riding in the middle of the lane is safer or we should all stay in the middle of the lane, I still think that the most important thing is that you must be aware of what is around you. Look far ahead as well as check what is behind. If you are not sure of what is around you, you are a hazard no matter where you go.<br><br>In peak hours where most bikes are always squeezing between traffic, I always make it a point if there is another bike that is tailing me very close, I will let them go first (and most of the time it's R1) . Probably next time when you upgrade your bike you will also squeeze between traffic faster.</div>
