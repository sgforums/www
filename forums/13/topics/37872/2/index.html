I will check that this idiot will not get too close to me in any e-situation that will endanger my property (bike, car or truck). When on a bike, I will try to speed up and overtake the other vehicles in front; or when driving a 4-wheeler, I will move out of the way to let that guy pass. If situation is heavy traffic, then I will press on my brake or turn on the hazzard light to warn that idiot off my back, and keep his distance.<br><br>Many situation can always be hypothetically dreamed up as possible worse case scenarios for riders or drivers.<br><br>But the word is ANTICIPATE - by reading the road situation AHEAD of you (2 or 3 or 4 vehicles ahead), and be alert to the guy BEHIND you.
