            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br>got this email. Take a look and see if you can help. Thanks a lot ....<br><br>Noah<br>------------------------------------<br><br>Subject:  Appeal for Eye-Witness<br>(Accident that took place on 15 May,<br>Vesak Day at 7.45pm along cross Junction of AMK Ave 1&amp;<br>6)<br><br>Dear Friends,<br><br>My name is Dawn Chia Siam Mui and I have a lot of<br>words to say. Please read on (Please also forward this<br>mail to your friends so that the chances of us finding<br>the witness maybe higher). I don't know whether this<br>method will work or not, but I just hope for the best.<br><br>My nephew, Shawn Tan Yong Ming (he is my elder<br>sister's son and my most favourite nephew), got into a<br>fatal motor accident at Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 &amp; 6 Cross<br>Junction (very near to Bishan Park and Blk 307) and he<br>passed away suddenly due to serious injury in<br>Singapore General Hospital at 8.40pm on the same day).<br><br>The details are as follows:<br><br>Date of Accident : 15 May 2003 (last Thursday - Vesak<br>Day)<br>Time of Accident : 7.45 pm<br>Place of Accident : Along Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 &amp; 6 Cross<br>Junction (the police has already placed the metal<br>plate to look for eye-witnesses at the scene)<br><br>The past few days have been a very difficult time for<br>the family, relatives and friends. He is only 20 years<br>old going to 21 this coming September. While typing<br>this letter, tears just flow out from my eyes. I still<br>cannot believe that he is dead. He is really a very<br>lovable &amp; easy going boy and I cannot describe the<br>hurt and sadness that I am facing now but I am sure the<br>parents and siblings must be facing more hurt than me.<br><br>Shawn is the eldest son in the family and he has left<br>behind his parents (the father is a SBS bus driver and<br>the mother is a stall helper), a sister who is going<br>to the polytechnic this June (her studies maybe<br>postphoned due to financial difficulty because of this<br>accident), the youngest brother who is only in<br>secondary 1 and 2 grandmothers to mourn for him. (When<br>the parents reached the hospital, he is already dead.<br>So, he died alone with no loved ones by his side)<br><br>I always read of such cases in the newspapers and I<br>felt very sad. Never did I know that it will happen to<br>my loved one today (Now, I really know the pain). Till<br>now, I cannot accept that he has already gone, the<br>memory of him is still so fresh in my mind. I really<br>cannot use words to describe how I am feeling at this<br>moment.<br><br>For the past few days, we are busy with the funeral<br>arrangements. So, it is only today that I managed to<br>talk to the traffic police officer in charge of<br>Shawn's case. There is still no eye-witness to this<br>accident at the moment.<br><br>I sincerely begged the eye-witness to come forward so<br>that at least we know what actually happened on that<br>day. It is a cross junction and the time of accident<br>is 7.45pm, thus, I am confident that there must be<br>drivers or pedestrians who have witnessed this<br>accident .<br><br>I know that it is troublesome to be a witness, but,<br>please step forward so that at least the family<br>members know how he died. He is still so young.<br>Although the newspapers reported that the Mercedes<br>Benz driver (52 years old) is currently out of bail<br>and is at fault (because he is on the turning lane and<br>my nephew is going straight), we are still not sure<br>whether this information is accurate.<br><br>Irregardless of whether who is at fault, we just want<br>to know the truth (he is just riding a scooter, how<br>could the impact be so great as to cause his death?).<br>If it is Shawn's fault, we have nothing to say and<br>hope that he will rest in peace, but if it is the<br>driver's fault, we want justice to be done.<br><br>I, as his relative, cannot just sit and do nothing,<br>his parents are not well-educated and if I<br>also "bochap", who is going to find out the truth?<br>The undertaker told me that both his hands were<br>clasped tightly when he collected the body and this<br>means that he died unwillingly and not resting in<br>peace), and I have also seen it with my own eyes that<br>his hands were really clasped.<br><br>Please pass this message on to anyone you know or your<br>family and friends. If anyone has witness the<br>accident, please call the traffic police at 1800-547-<br>1818. If the witness is proved to be credible by the<br>police, we will give him a token of appreciation of<br>$500. We know that $500 is not a big amount, but, we<br>are just an average income family, so, that's the best<br>amount that we can offer (but if the witness request<br>for more reward, we will definitely try our best to<br>raise the money).<br><br>Please come forward if you have witness the case.<br><br>Thank you and Best regards<br>Dawn Chia<br>H/P 94366684</div>
