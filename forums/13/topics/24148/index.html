"maintenance" for an italian bike includes carb cleaning, air filter change/wash, valve cleaning, transmission oil change. how is that different from your japanese bike? jap bike don't need to service at all? how are italian bikes "high maintenance"? oh yesh use the best 2T, if you're going to say that using a fully-synthetic 2T for maximum protection, that costs perhaps $5 to $10 more than the 2T you're using is HIGH MAINTENANCE, i think you're too cheap to ride a bike.<br><br>admittedly parts for italian bikes are expensive. other than the fact that some parts are performance parts, a lot of this relies on again many other factors pertaining to economics, production methods, macroeconomic policies etc. yes parts are more expensive, so are these guys saying that their jap bikes will never break down? or do they get to buy their parts for free?<br><br>for your info, i've a friend who services his mito at 5,000km intervals. problems? none. he ran 20,000km on his bike before he upgraded.<br><br>enough said.. if you take offence at my post, YOUR PROBLEM. for your own sake, think about what people tell you before you believe it like gospel. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> for your own damn good. but it's a good thing that many people feel this way. that's the reason why i can ride what i feel is an excellently designed and manufactured motorcycle, more cheaply than my counterparts who don't get what i do. my thanks go out to you...</div></blockquote>THUMPS UP FOR YOU&gt;<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>good bike i will say good one la.. not say i know you then i say until your bike can fly. looking at the parts you're getting, it's really worth the super high price tag when you pay for a new one...<br><br>eh anyway, i wasn't in anyway saying that jap bikes are crap or they suck, just trying to debunk the irritating myths about italian bikes.. "PROBLEM BIKE! HIGH MAINTENANCE!" parts are ex, but like i said, there're reasons why they are, and not because of the bike. in a way it's caused by us, when less people ride the bike, and even less wanna repair or change worn out parts, the price increase simply because the volume sold drops. agent also must make money what... if not how to survive? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> look at your brakes man... brembo.. perhaps second only to AP racing, but definitely good enough... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>okay la.. anyway, those offended, really just too bad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> don't believe me? your loss anyway... hahaha.. not my problem anyway, i'm happy with my bike and no regrets at all... only perhaps not waiting to buy my friend's mito... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honesty speaking, there are several factors why the brandname of cagiva , aprilla , piaggio and their eurpoean counterparts are naturally associated as "problem" bikes.<br><br>In europe, people ride bikes for style, as a passion and hobby unlike here where bike provides a lower cost of trasportation. Hence most european bike makers design their to be stylish, fasionable and really a joy to ride. Personally i've ridden both cagiva mito 7 and aprilla extrema and can verify that their handling is superb. Nothing reallt comes close to the thrill and eastasy of soaring through the streets in these racing bikes.<br><br>Howevere the downside is that these bikes are Racing bikes, design to be trashed throughly . Racing bikes requires racing maintainces, changing of piston ring after 3000km, chaging of piston after 10000km.Noboby in singapore ,in their right mind will have such deep pockets for these,hence these bikes  are throughly trashed and deem worthless after 4-5 years of usage simpy because their owners do not know the amount of maintaince that the bike is lacking.<br><br>5 years ago, nobody will say that aprilla is a lousy bike because the model is so new that there's no problem whatsoever.<br>Maybe 5 years down the road, SP, TZM, KIPS , will suffer the same fate and we should see a excess of suh bikes like amout of TZR that's been thrashed, repaired , and scraped.<br><br></div>
