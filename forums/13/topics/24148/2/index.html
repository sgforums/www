Hence most european bike makers design their to be stylish, fasionable and really a joy to ride. Personally i've ridden both cagiva mito 7 and aprilla extrema and can verify that their handling is superb. Nothing reallt comes close to the thrill and eastasy of soaring through the streets in these racing bikes.<br><br>Howevere the downside is that these bikes are Racing bikes, design to be trashed throughly . Racing bikes requires racing maintainces, changing of piston ring after 3000km, chaging of piston after 10000km.Noboby in singapore ,in their right mind will have such deep pockets for these,hence these bikes  are throughly trashed and deem worthless after 4-5 years of usage simpy because their owners do not know the amount of maintaince that the bike is lacking.<br><br>5 years ago, nobody will say that aprilla is a lousy bike because the model is so new that there's no problem whatsoever.<br>Maybe 5 years down the road, SP, TZM, KIPS , will suffer the same fate and we should see a excess of suh bikes like amout of TZR that's been thrashed, repaired , and scraped.<br><br></div></blockquote>yeahhhh i agree wif u totally man... i believe manufacturers all have the same problem... high performance or long reliability... italians give a high performance package wif all the best racing bits... but sacrificing reliability... whereas japanese believe in reliability and thus have inferior oem...<br>well the best racing bike would be engineered wif totally different concepts with the best road going bike...<br>where in racing... the best bike would be one that pumps out all its performance till the very last lap and blow up once past the checkered flag... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>so maybe with technology always advancing... there will be bikes that will be of really high performance and low maintainance and long reliability... but now we will all just have to sit around and enjoy our present breed of machines...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

In fact i think they look big and styish. My friend owned a mito b4 and mentioned a few minor problems like the starter motor problem. Having to push start everyday until he changed the starter motor. Also had problems wih the piston cause he took out the 2T pump and was using premix. Had to use a bottle a week.... the cost of 2T per mth came up to be quite expensive. He regretted taking out the 2T pump and concluded that it would be more economical this way.
