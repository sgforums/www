            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for inviting me to race wif you in pasir Gudang on the 25 of last month. It was a great race among the 8 people. And i know that all the riders are no easy meat. I mean they are regular at pasir gudang. I am impressed wif your aprilia cause it has performance and my god playing in pasir gudang is dangerous. The cornering is so fucking deep and once u fall liao already. On that day u just use the aprilia stock pipe which is sort of an original pipe. wat if u use an arrow pipe or Giannelli pipes? I'm interested to get an aprilia and sell off my krr cause my bike cant' corner at all. My friend all wants to thank you for inviting us to pasir gudang. We had a nice day there and u were friendly towards me and my friends. We will be looking forward to go there again and pls. confirm wif me. By the way has the video we recorded there ready? Well give u a thumps up for your performance. It is true that a Grand Prix bike is always powerful! Yeah have u taken your lap time? I was surprise that a 125 bike came first and second whereas the 150 like mine and some of the rider have been left behind. It is so useless that i change my pipe. In my thinking i think it is time to change to an aprilia and regularly go to pasir gudang. I relly enjoy it there! Now its like an hobby. See you again!</div>
