But then to say again, have to see how much u mean to him. Maybe to female, they are more femine to emotions, feelings and stuffs.... but to guys, they are more femine to their own "interests", "hobbies". THATS the DIFFERENCE between man/woman. Sometimes i also thinking, actually women are not meant for guys in this world.... hahaha *That doesn't mean i am gay, don misunderstand"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am so thankful for all of you for the reply. I am with this guy for 4 years already and some more i can't compare from his bike friends. I told him i am sick, guess what is the reply? he say that when people are dying also never complaint so much, me just a minor problem then want him to fetch me home. I decided to give this guy cos never will he treat me fair.He can hack care about me then go M'sia. Though i told him i am very sick, he still ignore me!! I decide to give up this guy cos he is really not worth me loving!!Do all of you agree? If a guy can't even let off something unimportant when his gf is sick so will this guy be serious to his girlfriend! I doubt the answer is no! Do you all agree? Thanks for the console!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Funny, Pasir Gudang say i anyhow say things. Don't you think its a liitle ridiculous. I', his gf for 4 years already. You mean he can't come and see me must pump his bike then can come. Why he has so many excuses? I know him for so many years and all the while i listen to him rather then he does? He always think that he is right, how bout me? Does it mean my advise are wrong. Does it mean that i care for his safety' i'm in the wrong. Maybe i would say i really doesn't suit him cos never will he take a look at me when i'm sick. Do you all know i get to know so many guys which treat me so well, when i'm sick they even don't go for their tutorial just because they feel that i'm important to them. Sometimes he must admit he is really too aggressive. He must admit he don't love me seriously. Because i want to be with him always quarrel with my parents, and some more not even a console from him. When i'm feeling down, all he will care is his bike. He don't even know what i'm thinking that's why i break with him gor half a year. If he treats me seriously he won't dump me aside when i need him.Whenever i feel down, the person beside me is definitely not him. I must admit girls at times are rather a bother. But i just ask for care and concern not after his money, am i wrong? I get to know this guy and he is a degree holder now he is Air force as a surgeon. He 's got very gd prospects. I would say many girls will fall for him cos he has got high calibre and a high income, which girl will bear to drop this sort of guy. He treat me very well. Everyday no matter how busy is he, he will fetch me after work. When i'm sick he will take a day leave and bring me to see a doctor. So not all the guys are like my ex bf right? I believe he won't know how to cherish a girl which wasted so much time on him. Definitely i know i'm a human not a bike, but it seems that i can't compare with even a bike. How useless am i? Let's not compare bikes, how bout his friends in the racing team. I can't even compare with them. If he can't accomplish what i want. What for still go with him, waste another year. I thanks everybody for all the comments.As my main motive is just to let him know that why i chose to leave him. Doesn't mean i don't love him anymore,i hope he will realise what a girls needs. This are not talking rubbish! He knows who i am saying. I hope the people in this channel, if....ever you have a gf, pls cherish! Don't be like us!!!Thanks for everyone's comment!!!! I will accept be it gd to me or not, cos i take it as an experience.<br>Wishing everybody well on the road!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why i openly talk about my personal love life cos a lot of people don't realize that why all of a sudden they lose their love ones or their best friends. The reason is simple. The thinking of people nowadays are too precise and excuses too much. Over self defend may sometimes lead to serious misunderstandings. If i corrupt a racing channel to a love channel, i apologize for it. But please think of the times where people spend too much time on their bikes and maybe they neglected somebody where they don't know. Let me emphasize,no matter what is said to defend himself/herself, this person can only cover the story to the public and make believe to public. But he/she himself/herself will know that who is in the negative side. Sometimes human tend to think too much og oneself and tend to hurt others and he don't really acknowledge it. In this world if there is this word call reasonable i would presume that there will be no war and no fights. Whenever there is a quarrel, to me there is no right and wrong cos when both parties are angry they tend to think that each of them are right!!! So what is unreasonable!! No matter how this person cover himself, no matter how many comments i get!!! I do hope that there will be no more self denfending. Wrong means wrong! Right means right! What i mean is very clear, no mattter how to defend oneself from others, outisders will only know the basic!! The basic is not the truth! I wish all the people in this channel to excel in their racing team but apart of that please remember the supporters behind and don't let them feel neglected. Many thanks for the time in this channel!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe Pasir Gudang believe in fate! But from what you say in the channel already shows that you don't treat girls well. That's already very obvious in the public already!!!<br>Thanks for bikegar's comment!! I really do hope people while thinking of themselves can also think of others.Actually  my topic is also related to bikes!! And just because of bikes we break off! Think of the times when the committment to love a bike is too high. Pasir Gudang are you a serious guy, u know better than me, don't need to say anything! You are a respondsible and serious guy, you won't be so aggressive and arrogant. Anyway i'm going to start recording soon,i wish you all the best Pasir Gudang. In the hope for the near future if there's a chance to meet you down the road, hope you will become more mature and not so seld defending!! Wish every body in the channel all the best. Best prospects for all of you!! Thanks, bye and take care!</div>

I am just meaning other people can don start topics abt love. But since pricess7 have already started this topic, i don mind actually. Ok maybe i am not experience in any kind of love stuffs, and i might sound cruel to say what i said earlier, but i only trying to make things straight that This Is A Race Bike Forum. Just some sort of "reminder" to people out there... u never see i put<br>TO EVERYONE meh?<br>Did i say to PRICESS7? no right?<br><br>Pricess, i apologise if u tot i were saying u. Anyways, i don have g/f or supporters. Just a normal guy who takes bike as a mean of transport now. *coz i m a no $$ guy* If i were to have $$, i will crazy abt bikes. And if i were to have g/f, i will treasure her. Coz i know as to my pattern, i have a g/f is very hard...<br></div>
