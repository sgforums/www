            <div class='col-md body'>I've got a fren.....known her for over 5 yrs.....lately i think she's changed.....for the WORSE!!!!!<br><br>She found herself a "rich" bf. Who lives in a three storey bungalow which is situated at Bukit Batok. Personally , i dun consider this as rich , it is simply well off. It is not as if his bungalow is situated at holland rd!<br><br>Ok , she brag abt her LV handbags , n says that she needs to shop everyday to update herslf with the latest fashion. She uses mostly her bf's money. THE WORST THING is that she thinks tat we are JEALOUS of her! My friends n i juz couldn't stand her. She wasn't like this in the past. She used to be humble n very fun loving .<br><br>Now she behaves as if she is someone rich. She walks with her nose pointing to the sky.<br><br>Juz the other day we went to celebrate her bd at Raffles hotel n she had a fight with her bf, both of them were in the wrong n the guy chose to give in. But my fren juz refuse to accept his apology. Says , she had enough of all this fighting.... blah blah blah.... Then y isn't she breaking up with him? Can't bear to say bye bye to her LV bags?<br><br>My frens n i confronted her n we told her that she has changed alot.  But she dosen't think so.<br>We are not the only one complaining. Even her poly frenzs, her working frenz... She once said to her colleague :" So? I'm Rich!"<br><br>Eh..... who she thinks she is? She isn't pretty , isn't sexy , so stubborn , so arrogant....  Where is the fren i used to know?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, i find that people are sometimes blinded by greed, or perhaps, love. Its juz too seducing that as humans, many juz give in.<br>It could have happened to any1, but if the person were to truly regret after being ditched, i m sure he/she would need frens by his/her side. As the saying goes, to err is man.<br>As for the time being, juz wait for the good show as *|azy has commented.<br><br>"All man make mistakes, wise man learn frm them."</div>
