              <p>Has anyone lost weight after going to MarieFrance Bodyline? I saw how they transform Christy Chung from fat mama to hot mama and i'm so tempted to be transformed too.</p>
              <p>My friend went there last year and lost about 5 kg after 12 sessions. Is that considered good? I was hoping to lost at least 10 kgs coz my doctor said that i run the risk of weak knees due to my weight.  But i tried jogging but pant like crazy after a few minutes. I am 1.55 m tall and weigh 60 kg. I think if i be 48, that will be ideal.</p>
              <p>My dream is to be like her !</p>

              <p>you  need to look at your BMI, and not based on just weight alone. Even the BMI is just a gauge,coz some people have heavy bones.</p>

              <p>Good or bad, at least MaryFrance and all those businesses have served a purpose in my opinion, and that is being an external pressure, so that a person can have the motivation and the structure to slim down.

              <p>Ok good luck.</p>

              <p>I beg to differ, marie, not mary hor, are more established firm, so in a way, you had heard about those con slim and spa shop closing down after making member paid the fees. For MarieFrance, they are stable and sure to fulfil the obligation to serve you well.</p>
              <p>I guess a person going to slimming centre already hv a strong mindset of getting slim, what they need is a proper guides and treatments to see them thru, it do not just apply only in slimming and beauty centres, but also any sports and events a person wish to pursue.</p>
              <p>Between, i am a MarieFrance member, and one thing that they are good is that they are very professional, straight to the point (meaning if you are fat, they will said you are fat, or ugly and so on), you have to take it. The most good in them, is they are not like other citybella or marychia ah sohs centres who keep asking you to buy these and that....for MF, once you go in, they treat you all the way without asking you to buy this and that, even so, they give it to you free or as sample, and also tell you where to buy.</p>

              <p>Anyway, MarieFrance is good, that is why they can carry on with a profitable business, as i said, they are very frank to customers, if one fat gal come in who is beyond hope, they will tell you straight off that they cannot slim her down.</p>
