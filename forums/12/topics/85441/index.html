I'm just amazed how a person could claim to suffer from the past relationship can now have the pleasure of choice to choose to get attached again.<br>Frankly i was touched by the letter to his ex -<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=85341" rel="nofollow">evelyn (frm stranger to lover n frm lover to stranger)<br></a><br><br>Maybe without giving himself some thoughts, if he could give a new relationship his 100%.<br>I'm not sure if he really does mean it when he wrote the thread claiming to wait for his ex. But the new girl seemed to have created a opportunity for his emotional release.<br>My indignance is - If he wants to wait for his ex. And PROMISES to wait. Why was the new girl a option???<br><br>Anyway, my post was to simulate his thoughts to see if he's ready for another r/s.
