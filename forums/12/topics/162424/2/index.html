He was told to get a place for dialysis outside since the place in the hospital are limited if he wants hemodialysis (the one with the machine next to you where it channels your blood out, and dialyse it)...<br><br>Upon hearing this, he shouted and cursed the medical personnels available saying that why he could not get a place since he is a loyal rakyat and has served the govt for so long... He retorted and claimed that he will create havoc if he is not given a place to dialyze...<br><br>Though there is another option where it is called peritoneal dialysis, where he can get it done in the hospital everytime, he wanted a better quality of life and less pain by optioning for hemodialysis...<br><br>He kept swearing and cursing until the medical assistants have to hold him down, but he became aggressive and the authorities are called upon to take him down...<br><br>I was one of the doctors getting screwed by the patients, and I couldn't say anything at all...

Younger patients are prefered. I'm not wondering he doesn't want to have the peritoneal dialysis, that idea scares me off too.<br><br>If your hospital can't provide dialysis for him and sending him somewhere else, then they should find other hospital for him, where he can get it done and book the dialysis for him there, preferably a hospital close to his home.<br><br>Also someone with diplomatical skills should talk to him, calm him down and explain him the whole situation of the hospital and of his health state, offer him all possibilities, give him the feeling that everyone is interested to help him.<br><br>He must be given the feeling, that someone cares to solve his problem and help him, not the feeling that the hospital wants to get rid of him. You must choose a psychological tactics. Doctors often must use psychological tactics.<br>When he has the feeling that the doctors care and want to help him, he won't get excited so easily and accept also the negative news from the doctors without sending the medical personnel to hell or having the idea of beating the souls out of them. As a government servant he expects that the country for which he has been working so long provides proper medical care for him.</div>
