So he finally pop the question. I rejected him quite alot of times,but my colleagues kept asking me to give it a try,hes a very nice guy. Maybe the reason y i rejected him was bcoz i dun really love him(at dat time!!) and secondly, he was nearly 2 yrs younger than me!<br><br>However, in the end i still agreed to be with him. As time goes by, my love grew fonder for him. He was really a very nice bf..bcoz hes younger, he tried very hard not to let me feel dat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>He came frm a quite traditional family.He was one of the few grandsons in the family, thus, everybody in his family doted on him and was very protective of him. His parents was very unhappy with our relationship. they think that i was leading him astray,teaching him all the bad stuffs. His father even sent emails to me telling me to get lost,not to stay with his son. His mother insulted my mum, and threatened to cum up to my hse to see my mum!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>All the while, they were alwaz throwing hurtful words at me, those words dat u'll never want to hear frm ur partner's parents.They forced my bf to break up with me, if not,they'll never let him in the hse again.I oso dun wish to make things difficult for him,so i told him to just end it there. But he was very determined to continue this relationship...i really feel very bad...i love him alot alot,i cun bare to lose him, but if i dun break up with him,he'll have a tough time with his parents..i ever asked him,if he had ever regretted being with me,he said no..i was really touched...<br><br>pple,wat should i do?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>[/b]</div>

How does preception comes about has to do alot with their first impression when he spoke about you AND first impression when they meet you. When his parents form a negative impression of you and finally saw you, perhaps it just reinforce what they think of you, negatively. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>One key point is whether your bf is serious about you anot, which is the fundamental element to your problem. His parents will look for ANY kind of ways make it seemed that you are at fault because of rigid thinking and the only way to make them LL, which means nothing to find fault with. With nothing practical to find fault, its difficult to reinforce their negative views of you. Well, of course this is harder than it is said, but your bf has to do alot of work on this. You mention about his parents calling you to look for him - because your bf dunno go where never inform parents kinda of thing, which gives them the thinking of 'Oh shit, he MUST be with her because our good son never come home so late.' kind of thing. If you bf knew beforehand that such thing gonna happen, he should inform his own parents that today he is not meeting you BEFOREHAND. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Well, its humanly impossible to change their view on you overnight, so you have to do it gradually. The tone of voice, body expression and appearence has to be moderated. Whatever they say, keep your cool and smile, because grouchy character will surrender eventually to people who doesn't even bother it. The more you bother and feel, the WILL know it, and WILL continue to use it against you and you will be at disadvantage. Make it seemed like you are totally prepared and nothing going to affect you. If they throw nasty questions like 'Why can't you leave my good son alone, $%^&amp;' Tell them, you will go only if your son doesn't want you (only use this if you know for sure your bf knows you going to use it, so both of you can plan) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This is a war - mentally and war is tiring. Your only resource - time, will wear down even the most powerful king, because people gets weary on the SAME issue over a long period of time. Remember, even if one day your bf marries you, its between the both of you, nothing to do with the parents. Of course they will be enraged, but 10 years down the road, you think they still give a damn? When got grandson, grand daughter liao, and already primary school, they will be like  'aiya, whatever lar.' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.s: This obstacle must serve to build you both, because at times when it seemed gloomy, you both HAVE to encourage each other and the REASONS for being in this relation. When the rain passes, thinking back will serve beautiful memories enough to last you a lifetime. If either one of you get tired first before his parents does, you will lose this war. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Prays - Email me or post it here to update your situation.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you made a wrong move by making it seemed that you both have already broke up - seemed the easiest way by avoiding, but in the long run It is disadvantageous, because his parents will react even worst when this cover is blown, because lying made it seemed as if you are trying to hide or as if you are guilty over something. But I guess there is no turning back now... so just stick with it for the time being. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>About your bf at 21 want to ROM - well, its your matter, but I think a guy at 21 is too early for marriage - marriage is not just about loving - it consist of far too many factors that has to be taken into consideration that he may, at that age, lack or never thought of.<br>Well, marriage is only a cert - if he really loves you - he should propose to you when he knows that at the point of time, he is able to bring you utmost happiness and security through marriage, and not at a chosen age/date/etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You know what's the shit facts about guys marrying too early? Not material aspect of life, but rather when he see that all of his guy friends are still single, enjoying life, lovey relation with their gf, while he has to undertake new responsible of a husband, for a family and for his wife. This will BOUND to affect him some ways - but its up to him to redirect this view into something positive or negative. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Nah... I am just being long-winded and living up to my title of an essay king... this is just my few cents of thoughts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>
