              <p>Basically it used to be like this,</p>
              <p>It happened a few years ago. I recommended my friend to this person in a pub. (whatever they do later i got no idea, and i heard that my friend run away this person's money)</p>
              <p>So finally this person is finding me because i recommend this friend to him. i have even make a police report but he has been threatening me since last month.</p>
              <p>We moved out of the house because someone(idk is ahlong or bookie or whatever) might come and find trouble even though he is finding the wrong guy</p>
              <p>So they are blaming me for these kind of trouble which i already explained to them it has nothing to do with me just that i know them before. And i already had some issues in camp with my superior who wants to charge me for everything.</p>

              <p>You are lucky.</p>
              <p>You know before hand you are going to be homeless.</p>
              <p>Use this luck to prepare yourself for ORD, instead of slapping your head and pulling your hair out. You are not a kid anymore, but you are behaving like a kid. Your parents provided you a home all your life. Now you must house yourself. That is your biggest concern. You are also without a job, that means no income. Together they make you frightened, and thinking about it, paralyse you. You must think about how to tackle it, instead of thinking how <em>chia lat</em> it is, and show sour face.</p>
              <p>Before ORD see your superior, explain to them your situation, ASK FOR HELP DIRECTLY, don't have the "can help, help cannot help never mind" attitude. Ask them for help directly. If they cannot, ask them where you can get help, get them to refer you to some social help services, or even the MP (Member of Parliament, ah) not the Provost.</p>
              <p>Once you got a place to stay, and a job to pay for that place, you can relax, and then slowly work to improve your life.</p>
              <p>If you think like your life is ended. Then your face will look like a loser, and you will be treated like a loser, and you will be a loser. You will do things and end up at Changi Chalet.</p>
              <p>Remember you are lucky, make full use of it.</p>

              <p>Impp, something doesn't seem right with your story.</p>
              <p>If u are not the one who borrowed money and refused to repay, that guy should not be coming after you for the bad debt.</p>
              <p>If u recommend a bank to your friend. The bank cannot come after u, unless u are a co-sign or guarantor on the loan.  In your case u arnt even there to see the transaction happen.</p>
              <p>You should report to police. Give the police that guy's contact, let them go deal with him.</p>
              <p>Also, you have no idea if it's true such loan exist. </p>
              <p>Just because that guy claim so and so ran away with his money, does not mean you are responsible to pay off someone else's debt !!</p>
              <p>How do u know the whole loan thing is not a SCAM???</p>
              <p>I suggest u do not run away from your family just yet.</p>
              <p>Perhaps u are being taken advantage of due to your ignorance and fear.</p>
              <p>This guy threaten u, then stand up against him. He is nothing but a bully trying to scare the crap out of you.</p>
              <p>You need to defend yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He reminds me of school bullies picking on weaker kids to rob them of pocket money.</p>

              frankly i find it hard to believe your parents will ask you to leave the house over something like that.
              
              in a normal family parents dont chase their children out unless he or she has a big history of causing trouble.

              <p> Believe that you are sugar coating your story. No parent would disown their own children unless they were forced to do so. Either you became a guarantor for Ah longs or you borrowed a lot of money from Ah longs, you unable to pay result in Ah longs coming to your house, vandalising the doors, painting the whole place red and embarassing your family with posters saying that their son owe them money.</p>
              <p>So never borrow money from Ah longs for whatever reason because they are swindlers, they charge an unreasonable interest over what you borrow sometimes can be twice of what you borrow. Its tantamount to extortion.</p>
              <p>You already sign your soul to the devil, moment you borrow money from Ah longs.</p>
              <p>Settle your debt first then work out your problem with your family. Only way is the hard way. You got to work. Be a bus driver or something then maybe in 10 years you can pay your debt.</p>

              <p>another way, since you are really one big idiotic loser, you should engage police help, and go all teh way out to take out his ah long gang. or you can just fight your way through the ah long ranks. who knows kill off some of them probably do teh society some good, before you bleed and breathe your last. safe lost of taxpayers money having to feed you and the longs in jail. that's the least abd best you can do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Ah Longs r businessmen. They r illegal banks, and banks are legal Ah Longs.</p>
              <p>When u borrow money from banks, u sign away collaterals. In promise u will pay back in a timely manner with interest.</p>
              <p>When u borrow from Ah Longs, u give them promise to pay back with interest. But because u don't have assets collaterals to offer, Ah longs take higher risk so they charge higher interests rates... If u don't pay back, the collateral is harrasments and beatings.. Theses kind of practice is known to public.</p>
              <p>A bank can recoup the money by selling your assets away. </p>
              <p>If Ah longs let u get away with his money, he is a epic fail Ah Long. He can close shop.</p>
              <p>A successful ah long is a vicious and harsh ah long. They are not stupid.</p>
              <p>A lot of their business r through words of mouth. They need reference to stay in business.</p>
