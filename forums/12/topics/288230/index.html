            <div class='col-md body'>I got to know this girl when I first got into poly. At first I paid attention to her simply because she is easily the prettiest among the other girls in my course intake that year and so luckily she is in the same class as me.<br><br>Very soon, we became very good friends and we even went out together sometimes, just the two of us. After a while, I realised I had fallen for her even though she already had a boyfriend back then. So I told myself that I shall wait for them to break up because they seem to quarrel quite a lot.<br><br>I waited and waited, they finally broke up. But I wasn't exactly very happy about it, because I didn't know how to tell her I like her. The words are somewhere in my mouth, but it won't come out. And at the same time, she seems sad about the break up, so I didn't want to tell her yet just in case she alienate me and we can't even be friends anymore.<br><br>So I continued to wait and wait. It's already into my second year in poly and I still haven't tell her. Then after the recent holidays had passed, she came back to school with a new boyfriend already. I was so sad, didn't know what to do.<br><br>I still want to tell her I like her, but again, I don't know how to say it and I'm afraid she will think I'm saying that to instigate them to break up. This is not my intention. I am simply thinking I should tell her before I don't have a chance to tell her anymore and I'll regret it. I thought my love for her was maybe just an infatuation, but it has already been close to two years, and I still cannot forget her even though we are no longer in the same class. But I will still find time to eat lunch with her in school, so can consider still in contact.<br><br>Shall I tell her or not? And if I should tell her, how and what shall I say? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
