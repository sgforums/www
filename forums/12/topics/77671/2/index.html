Then you go about finding out if it's for real?<br><br><strong><br>Is this crush or love?</strong><br><br>Does it matter? What's important is what follows from there?<br><br><strong><br>i'm afraid that i'm not good enough for him..</strong><br><br>What's 'not good enough'? Define it...<br><br><strong><br>my bf feel insecure as i have too many guy frenz..</strong><br><br>1st, ask yourself... "Can you be trusted?" If your answer is a FIRM 'yes'. Then ask him, "Do you love me?", "Can you trust me?"<br><br>If need to, tell him you can be trusted and he can have your words.<br><br><strong><br>my best friend for years told me he like me, what should i do?</strong><br><br>What do you wanna do?<br><br><strong><br>my best friend like my boyfriend?</strong><br><br>So what does she intend to do about it?

Does she knows that you know?<br><br><strong><br>what should i do to get his attention?</strong><br><br>Subjective.<br><br><strong><br>How do i know whether he want to take a step further into our relationship?</strong><br><br>Well... You can ask? Of course, there're many other methods but how effective they are would be very much subjective depending on the guy you're interested in?<br><br><strong><br>Does guy like gals to take initiative?<br></strong><br><br>Subjective.<br></blockquote>Thanks for the questions... Very interesting.. Though not really all new but got my head thinking...<br><br>Yes.. Love itself is probably on quite a simple scheme... But it's the complications of human behaviours and relationship movements which make it all so much more complicated usually....?</div>

There're a couple of ways in which I can explain it to you... But usually very much relative to a human's context, defining love can be quite irrelevant. It's just like you asking me how a nice juicy streak should taste? Or a nice steamy natural tasting bun? I can explain and describe them to you...

And after you've tasted them, do you think it's all that important for me to explain them to you?<br><br><strong><br>Why is love always so complicated?</strong><br><br>Because the nature of this world is complicated. It's at least a 'double layerings'... One through the complications of the nature of this world... The other through the mind of a human...

But as of this instance, I think it's still young and might not be mature enough to handle your question in an appropriate manner? Hence, these are my personal thoughts...<br><br>It so very often happens that from time to time, you'll just feel like you've picked up missing pieces from your life... Have you seen the movie 'Lost in Translation'? If you haven't, I would recommend you to watch it...<br><br>How old are you now..? As you grow... You age... At some point of your life, you would start to understand that love comes in so many different ways... And the kinda 'love' that you've picked up on your overseas trips.... The 'feelings'.... Are but just some manifest of it....<br><br>You can 'enjoy' that 'feeling'... Nourish it... 'Feel' it... And very much 'benefit' from it and grow 'spiritually' from it..... Only if you know how to control yourself...? Control it...?<br><br>Anything out of control often spells disaster... That's why you'll need to know what you want out of it in the 1st place... What to do about it... What not to do... Vows of your marriage in check? At points of time, that alone is just not strong enough (depending on the situation and your character).... Ultimately, it's your love for your wife which would guide you back to the path you should be walking....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In view of your request... Here is a 2nd attempt...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">Why always the wrong girl?<br><br>By probablity. Is it's not right then it's wrong. This question can go very much in depth. It's a mixture of your mentality of a 'right girl' and what you're prepared to do to make things 'right'.<br><br>It's also about your ability and instinct to choose a more appropriate girl.<br><br>This is only one of the factors I'm mentioning here.. One might notice that he / she is always attracted to a certain type of person. Instead of going 'I've finally found it!' and EMBRACED the 'love'... Look at the situation more clearly before you decide to 'jump' into a relationship... Don't let the 'feelings' hit the 'stars' out of ya head...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong><br>Why the girl not my kind i still like? </strong><br><br>This... Can go much into the depths too... Simply put, can say that you're a bit too superficial?<br><br>Anyway, refer to example above...<br><br><strong><br>Why i like the girl but after awhile, no more feelings? </strong><br><br>Could be UPs and DOWNs tide in a relationship... Could also be that people have changed? Shouldn't be too surprised too?<br><br>However, if you find this happening to you too often.. You might not be someone who's suitable for a long term relationship...<br><br><strong><br>Why Girls like me when i look like shit? </strong><br><br>Don't quite get your question? Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder?<br><br><strong><br>Why girls want to get married? Scary.</strong><br><br>It's a sense of security and commitment.<br><br>To them, what could be so frightening about that if you're really prepared to spend the rest of your life with her?<br><br><strong><br>Why guys cannot settle down? </strong><br><br>I've read somewhere that guys are more of 'primitive hunters'... They search and they 'hunt'...<br><br>In fact, it's not always true... It depends alot on the mentality of the person.. The lifestyle... Is it routine? Is he contented? Can he be 'confined'...?<br><br>It's a plus and minus thing...<br><br><strong><br>Guy wants sex only? </strong><br><br>As much as many males are quite hormonally charged creatures, it'll be funny to think that they want sex only? It would alot depends of how they handle their 'needs'. Some females could very much be sexually hungry creatures too?<br><br><strong><br>Can relationships really work at young age? </strong><br><br>Yes. Though it's gonna be so difficult. 1st, their parents and seniors are gonna doubt them. It really depends on what kinda life style they wanna adapt and if they can handle the relationship maturely... Though it'll only natural to think that young people would lack the experience enough to cope with a relationship sensibly without affecting their academics and other aspects of their life.... However, I've personally seen young couples who can handle a BGR much better than many other adults out there? Perhaps it's also because of the fact that they lack the 'complications'?<br><br><strong><br>Love and physical contact. How much is too much? </strong><br><br>As long as both parties are comfortable with it. And not get into any trouble from it... Otherwise they'll probably have to face the consequences... One way or another...<br><br><strong><br>Break up...If two persons truly loved one another once. What consitutes break up? </strong><br><br>They might have changed? Why not? Things do change in this world...<br><br>Sometimes reality would leave people with limited options... At least in the eyes of the person who have decided to break up?<br><br><strong><br>Parents Objection. Should we damn the consequences and Love anyway? Or obey and honour our parents?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  </strong><br><br>Heed the advice, but make your own decision. Don't completely damn the consequences... Chances are you'll be fighting a lost battle or at least a difficult one....<br><br><strong><br>Social isolation = True Love? </strong><br><br>Nope. It's a selfish kinda love. Perhaps 'true love' in the way one have decided to define it?<br><br><strong><br>My boyfriend/girlfriend have too many friends of opposite gender. I'm worried....</strong><br><br>Is your gf / bf worth trusting? If he / she is, when him / her know that you trust him / her but state your fears too...<br><br>But ultimately, it's still about TRUST in a relationship...<br><br><strong><br>Would spending lots of time together equate to LOVE? </strong><br><br>Of course not. It's quality, not quantity. Would placing a book in front of you while you watch TV and eat tibits contribute to good results for your exams?<br><br><strong><br>Would spending lesser time not be Love?<br>How much is too much?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </strong><br><br>It depends on the situation... Usually as defined by the 2 parties...<br><br>There is usually a 'range'... The bare minimal amount of time to spend together (subjective to the situational changes of both parties - work, school etc...)... Too long in that state would usually strain the relationship as it's only the bare minimal...<br><br>Then there'll be 'top ups'... Where you add in amount of time together... Because of programme(s)... Because of event(s)... Because you miss him / her.... One thing to note is that some couples just do 'top ups' for the sake of doing it... Which might not be healthy... You might end up having nothing to do... And such...<br><br>Then you might have this 'delusion' that you're drifting apart.. Have got nothing to share... etc...<br><br>It's like eating good food or filling your stomach?<br><br>'Bare minimal time requirement' is to fill your stomach so that your relationship won't starve to death...<br><br>'Top Ups' are just having good munches...<br><br>Throwing rubbish into your tummy (having extra time doing nothing together) is not necessarily a good thing... Though sometimes it might turn out to be a 'good time'. Other times it might not be?<br><br>Practise good control over it...<br><br><strong><br>We are in Love but When quarrels and arguements gets rough. How? </strong><br><br>Get to the roots of things... But that should be the final stage if necessary.. If it's not important or not appropriate..? Sometimes you should ignore it altogether... Just that there might be quite a chance that the same problem would resurface again...<br><br>Just ask yourself a few questions? Do you love him / her? Do you want the relationship to go on? The rest should come later in a 'love relationship'...<br><br>COOL down... Love each... Talk less for now... Cuddle more... Alot of times arguements are because of misunderstandings... And misunderstandings won't be easily handled when both parties are so heated up...<br><br><strong><br>Relationship for years....close to marriage. She/He chose to leave.<br>What am i suppose to do?!? </strong><br><br>Find out what the reason(s)? If there's no external factor affecting... One common reason is a psychological one... Sometimes your partner might just be sort of 'frighten off' by the whole idea....<br><br>By all means, shower him / her with your love... If you've not done any wrong to him / her, show him / her that you've won his / her heart over at least ONCE before... And you can do it AGAIN....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong><br>I love him/her. But i don't miss him/her, is there something wrong with me? </strong><br><br>Not really... UPs and DOWNs of a relationship tide... It'll only be sort of weird if you're thinking of him /her all the time? Probably honeymoon period then...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong><br>When i get into relationship. I fear. Help!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </strong><br><br>Get to the root of the problem... Why you have this natural fear? Probably a psychological problem...<br><br><strong><br>To be continued....<br><br></strong></div></blockquote><strong>Have decided to answer your questions again to repay your help in providing some nice questions...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Thanks!</strong></div>
