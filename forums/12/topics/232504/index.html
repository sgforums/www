            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe its something that you have been through for you. You will have to ask youself when did this happened exactly? You know it started in year 3 of your poly right? Was there some incident that made you that way during that time?<br><br>Even as of now in NS you are rather suspicious of the people around you, you should try to open up abit and talk to some of them. Know more about them and learn of their behaviour. If they are unfriendly, know other people. If you think all of them cannot be trusted, I suggest you go for counselling to help you further identify what is wrong.<br><br>You should NOT give up on yourself or the people around. What you need is someone to listen to you and you being comfortable telling that person everything deep in your heart.</div>

It could very well be the environment which is 'changing' you or could just be a natural process of self and relative environmental awareness..<br><br>Your friends might not even be aware of these 'changes' going on in you because many of these are just mental states going on within yourself...<br><br>It should be relatively for you to think about such certain things sometimes..
