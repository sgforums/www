            <div class='col-md body'>I had this kinda situation before but i did not handle it the way i would now. The best way to handle this is to just let it be. Like jeramy said, you were the one who still insisted on the relationship even after she told you about the circumstances.<br><br>See, this is the problem of most guys nowadays. Hey, sometimes i get the bug too. Its the SNAG bug. Virus if you may. Its what turned us men into little girls and softies. Metrosexual whatever. Bottomline, it is the same thing that's turning gals away.<br><br>Anyway, in your scenario, what I would do if i were you is to do exactly what she's doing to you. Go out with another gal. No, go out with other GIRLS. Widen your social circle. Have fun. If she can do it, so can you. However, when you do spend time with your gf, cherish her. Treasure her like like she's aphrodites herself. When she's not around, enjoy yourself. Just remember to have limits as you still have a gf. And when she is in need of you, come to her aid.<br><br>Hope this is of help... Don't ponder too much over this...</div>

If something triggers off trust issues with my guy, I wouldn't hesitate to refrain from doing so.  And if he was insecure in any way, I'd do my best to reassure him.<br><br>Going out 1-on-1 with another guy makes you insecure, &amp; that's understandable.  Things are usually Not so bad when it's a mixed group.  She should've taken your feelings into account &amp; reassured you accordingly, or worked out something with you.<br><br>The fact that she's so callous about your feelings can only mean that she doesn't respect you enough.

Anyway... It's not like you've got much choice unless you're thinking of breaking up with her...?<br><br>And... It's really not uncommon for a girl to be a friend... A SPACE other than her bf to confide in... Of course, MOST of us GUYS (maybe even for majority of the girls) would WISH to be THE ONE for her when she've got TROUBLES to face... But the FACT is, it doesn't always happen that way...<br><br>To ADD, you're having problems of your own with her... Now tell me... How you suppose she can confide in you on that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, as my ai ai has mentioned above, everyone needs a certain amt of breathing space. Some needs more, some needs less. It all depends on the person you are with. Your girl sounds like she needs a lot of privacy, probably too much for your own liking.<br><br>Have you ever heard of this saying,"Hold the sand loosely in your hand and it will stay, clutch your hand tightly around it and the sand will slowly slip away" ?<br><br>I guess maybe she still values her freedom too much to be in a relationship, because being in a r/s means you respect and consider your partner's feelings as well before you do something. In this case, even though you should respect her privacy, she should also compromise by letting you know abt her problems and asking you if it is alright to spend time with her frens all the time.<br><br>I guess both of you lack communication with each other. Try to get her to spend a day just with you and talk things out nicely <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
