I'm not quite sure if the word possessive is right, but that's all I can think of right now. She and he fall out a lot together and he ends up not even talking to her for days. What else is there?

They might need some standardized test that you need to take before they even consider your application. And most college I know only let students in at certain time of the year, meaning you wun be accepted in immediately if the school semester has already begun...<br><br>And are you sure you can find a job so easily? not to throw a wet blanket, but make sure you bring a lot of cash with you for emergency purpose. If you dun find a job immediatel(I dunno how it is like in Aus, but it is not easy to find a job over here, unless you want to work long hours in the fast food restaurants), you will need some extra cash to survive...otherwise you might even end up in the streets...and you will be all alone there.<br><br>yea, you can call it a holiday if you have enuff money to spend. but she will prolly be busy with her studies.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Tekno,<br><br>1 advice.  Tell tt girl of urs to break up wif her bf 1st before she goes out wif u.  As I see it, her bf has the right to be possessive if she falls for another guy whilst in a r'ship wif him.  She hasn't been fair to him.<br><br>No offence, this is plain speaking.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Tekno:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm seriously not sure what to post here because this is my first time here on this forum and on a forum actually like this one.<br><br>Um, I have these really strong feelings for a girl as she does me, but, she has a guy already, however, he is very... I'm not quite sure if the word possessive is right, but that's all I can think of right now. She and he fall out a lot together and he ends up not even talking to her for days. What else is there? Oh yeah, she's even admitted that I'm the most caring (and funny) out of him. Is it right to try and prove to her that I could lead her into a better life than he?</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another Â“girl with jerk boyfriend and nice guy friend waiting for herÂ” story.  Having joined this forum only two weeks ago, I must have lost count the number of times I came across such a story in the forum within these two weeks.<br><br>Tekno, before you buy the tickets and hop on the plane with the girl to a hopefully "happily ever after" ending, take a minute to pause over these few questions:<br><br>1. Has the girl officially broken up with her boyfriend yet? Has she made it clear to all parties that she has given up on him and has chosen you instead? How do you know if she is not hoping for her boyfriend, after he has cooled down, to join her in Australia?<br><br>2. By pulling off this seemingly Â‘potong jalanÂ’ (cut road) trick, what do you hope to achieve from your trip? Holiday? Study? A new girlfriend?<br><br>3. Knowing what you want to achieve, what have you prepared for the trip? Money? Course of study arrangements? Accommodation? Working visa?<br><br>DonÂ’t wish to repeat advice that has already been offered here, but think carefully before you do anything rash and impulsive. You may be well-off and could afford the short holiday trip on your own, but if you are thinking of something longer-term, youÂ’d better have some good plans in mind. Â“No money, no honey.Â” Australia is extremely strict on illegal workers, and unless you want to work as a dish-washer holed up in the kitchen of some dingy Chinese restaurant or you could get your new girlfriend to support you, youÂ’re better off staying away from trouble with the Australian immigration authorities.<br><br>One more thing. It is common for a girl who was hurt by her jerk boyfriend to appreciate the good things about her nice guy friend while pouring her sorrows to the nice guy friend, but do not <span style="font-style: italic;">ever</span> assume that she has given her jerk boyfriend up for the nice guy friend till she has openly said so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your love makes you unrealistic.<br><br>Of course, any girl would be touched when they see their bfs appearing in front of them as a surprise. But, before you do that, you have a lot of considerations. You haven't done your NS, am I right? At this age, do you know that it is even quite difficult to juz go for a holiday overseas, as the Govt is afraid that you may MIA and avoid NS (applies if you are a Singaporean).<br>Do you have enough $? It is illegal to work in Australia as you do not have any working visa. There is no such thing as Holiday Working Visa for Singaporeans travelling to Australia. Thus, you can't work there.<br>Last thing of all, does the girl really like you? Or, is she only pondering ALOUD that how nice if you were her bf?! Has she broke off with her bf yet?<br>Being young is really good. You can juz go ahead and do wat you want. But, before you do that, please consider if all these can work out...<br>Dun be deported back to Sg!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
