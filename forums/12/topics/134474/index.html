There are many cancer survivors out there; depending on the stage and type (I have relatives and friends who are survivors).

Help her to stay positive and like the other posts, spend more time with her.<br><br>Take care and be strong.

            <div class='col-md body'>had a sibling who also had cancer, still undergoing treatment in fact.<br><br>initial response is of denial/disbelief. even though the patient may show outward signs of acceptance, one may not have completely accepted the fact. as did the counsellor mentioned, "your head may have accepted the fact, but not your heart." i think this is important to take note. dont assume that the patient has accepted the condition.<br><br>personally, the most important thing is for you and your siblings to be on a positive note. it doesnt help if the general mood in the home is downbeat.<br><br>be present when your mom goes for an appointment. ask the doctor what treatment is to be expected. things to watch out for, to expect during treatment. in fact, ask anything that you want to ask. search for information on the internet if need be. ask what are clinical trials. why did the doctor choose treatment A instead of B. etc<br><br>talk about it to close friends. it may be okay initially. however some treatment go on for months. it woudnt be easy nor advisable to carry that around for prolonged periods. it usually feels better after you talked about it to someone you trust.<br><br>bills will be an issue. it is not going to be pretty. for public hospitals, if possible transfer down to ward C. a CT scan costs about 1k, after subsidy, medi shield, etc one pays about 90.<br><br>i dont see how having a specialist would help. there are only so many treatment methods available, some on clinial trial basis and more expensive. ultimately it is how one's body responds to the treatment that is important.<br><br>some posters mentioned distracting her from the cancer. the fact is that it  wouldnt be easy. it is unlikely that you can distract her from her having cancer, especially during treatment. perhaps i would put it differently, treat it just like any other day. what you could do is to lighten the mood. laughter is effective. talk about your day at school/work. talk about a scene on tv. you dont even need to talk to her, talk among yourselves. whatever.<br><br>throughout my brother was in a generally upbeat mood. so i have no prior experience with patients that are in denial for long periods or in low moods.<br><br>realise that most of the work you do would be acting as the crutch, the patient has to do most of the walking.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear January,<br><br>1st of all, I'd like to give you a big hug --&gt; *hugs January tight*<br><br>This must be a horrible thing to endure, the knowledge of someone so close having cancer.  However, please note that cancer doesn't necessarily mean a death sentence.  There have been cases whereby, with early detection, the cancer patient went into remission &amp; lived a reasonably long &amp; healthy life.<br><br>There's this lady I know, who lives in Hawaii.  Her body is full of tumours &amp; cancers, but oddly, she's lived with these cancers &amp; tumours in her body for &gt; 20 years!  Yes, she's in pain, but she's Not undergoing chemo, she just takes medication.  I dunno what she's been doing right to ensure her long life.<br><br>Most importantly, your mum would be devastated &amp; frightened.  Cancer seems to carry a death sentence here.  Speak to your mum &amp; reassure her fears.  Look for articles in which former cancer sufferers still managed to fight &amp; live.  Olivia Newton John survived breast cancer, &amp; she's lived for &gt; 10 years already since her cancer went into remission.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by january:</div><div class="quote_body">she is suffering ....<br><br>i feel confused about this and worried.<br><br>does anyone has any advices.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
