So nice that he took you for granted.<br><br>One tip...I hate this but it will works for you anyway. Try to cry a bit often in front of him...tell him that you felt that he has changed since he went to army. Tell him that you don't feel loved enough from him. You see...the problem here is that you have been behaving too independent already...although you are an independent gal.<br><br>You need to let him know your fears and worries...by crying. Hehehe...tell you why it will works like a charm okie? Guys don't like to see girls cry. So when a girl cries...most guys will feel bad for her. Don't believe? Try to cry sliently in a crowded place, sure guys will come up and console you. Okie...at least I will if you are not bad-looking. Since you got a bf, so you cannot be a goner in the looks department. You need to cry in front of him to activate his protective and caring mood so that he will forget all his troubles for that moment and seriously listen to you.<br><br>Okie...that is the ultimate weapon used by all gals and we guys cannot do anything to resist it.

But ideally, it should be more a more constructive and communicative manner.<br><br>'Crying' as suggested, might or might not work... And in the case where a guy is much stressed e.g. in army camp and such? Things MIGHT turn out to be much worse...<br><br>Regards.</div>
