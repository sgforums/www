            <div class='col-md body'>I m still a lvl 1 newbie at relationships. But if u want my opinion, I think that your bf shouldnt complain to u about army and etc. WHo else dont have troubles/worries ~ He should also be more sensitive and know how u feel and the stress u are undergoing. If i were him i rather keep quiet and treasure the time i spent with my gf becos army is hell  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> lol</div>

Some good some bad.<br><br>Been through working life, not easy too.<br><br>I won't comment about army life or working life. Different people have different thinking and concepts in life.<br><br>My advice :<br><br><strong>Both of you need to know what is happening to each other.</strong><br><br>1. Talk to your best <strong>girl</strong> friend that you both know. Tell her about how you feel. Ask her to talk to your boyfriend. Just a normal chat, telling him abit about what you are facing right now and ask him whether he is facing any pressures right now.<br><br>2. Talk to him face-to-face peacefully.<br><br>3. A counsellor?<br><br>Girl :<br><br>Relax, take a deep breathe in and out. Sit down, look at the sky, stars, buildings and relax, take a slow walk and enjoy the air(that's what i do at times)... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Singapore is abit too fast le...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Smile? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NS does change people, either for the better, or the worse.<br>I guess your bf is having some stress in NS and felt that he had no control over what goes in there. Thus, he complains and grumbles a lot to you. That may be the reason why he's restricting your movements and such as he fears losing you. But little does he know that you are unhappy and felt pressurized by that.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Try telling him your point of view and also that you need encouragement from him too. Or, if that doesn't work out, maybe, you may want to suggest a cool-off period first. During this time, you need to revitalise yourself too.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> He may need encouragement and motivation from you too, as he is pessimistic about life.<br><br>As for your work, I guess there's really no way of changing anything down there as your boss is a sexist. Its actually in your working environment. I guess you just have to face the facts. Of course, it will be best if you can change their perceptions later. If that is really bothering you, maybe you should find another job. But, it happens almost everywhere.<br><br>Its really not easy to be the sole breadwinner in the family. I can only give you encouragement here.<br><br>All the best to you!<br>Cheers.<br></div>

He never stays in a job for long &amp; she has to do 2 jobs to support her kids. He feels inferior &amp; cannot make decisions cos she is the one 'wearing the pants'. Talk to your bf. He must stop being so needy &amp; have trust in u since u have been together for so long. U also need some breathing space. Doesn't mean u have to spend all your spare time with him. Don't neglect your girlfriends, encourage him<br>to go out with his army buddies.</div>
