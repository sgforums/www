You must understand that studies are for ur future, not for other people. You seemed as if you are living for others and not for urself.<br><br>Feeling betrayed aside, maybe it is a crude truth, but the fact is you can NEVER trust humans completely. Listen to people if u want, but don't believe 100%.</div>

And alot people,looked down on ite student.....<br>go where,poly also got ppl like this,jc,uni where also got. Why people like you always suan ite students? get a life.</div></blockquote>Hey relax relax. Yes, i agree with you that not all ite students are the rotten apples. And smoking and drinking does not make a person bad, neither does it determine ones character, its more of a bad habit.<br><br>What i would like to advice you is that, although ite is not a bad path to take, there is still time and chance for you to carry on your academic through sec 5. Lets do some calculation. You are a guy, you need to serve NS in the near future or just some way down the road, if you get into ITE, you spend some time in it, if you are real hardworking, you get into poly, and if possible into uni. Plus all these time with NS and see by the time you grad, how old would you already be. But you could most probable take lesser time using the sec 5 route.<br><br>There is still time now for you to buck up on your studies. As for how you feel betrayed by your friend, take it with a pinch of salt. This might be an exception or he did really study. But no matter what, he is not accountable to you for any results that he got. Neither do you need to decide on your life route while taking your friend into consideration. To each his own, whether to be the shadow of your friend or to succeed using the shorter road through your own hardwork, you decide. Ultimately, its only you who would be accountable for yourself.</div>
