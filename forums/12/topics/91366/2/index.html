But even the great philosophers, with their profound definitions, could not fully touch its true essence. In a survey of 4-8 year olds, kids share their views on love. But what do little kids know about love? Read on and be surprised that despite their young and innocent minds, kids already have a simple but deep grasp of that four-letter word.<br><br>"Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other."<br><br>"Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French fries without making them give you any of theirs."<br><br>"Love is when someone hurts you. And you get so mad but you don't yell at him because you know it would hurt his feelings."<br><br>"Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK."<br><br>"Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it everyday."<br><br>"Love is if you hold hands and sit beside each other in the cafeteria. That means you're in love. Otherwise, you can sit across from each other and be okay."<br><br>"Love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than Robert Redbird."<br><br>"I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones."<br><br>"When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you."<br><br>"You can break love, but it won't die."</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You brought me back to this something which either someone had told me before or I've read somewhere but I can't remember??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You happens to have a VERY NICE BOWL of NOODLES in your hand... You took a small sip of the soup and as if you can't help it... You went on to taste the noodles and the ingredients... SO... 'PERFECT'...<br><br>At this point.. You thought to yourself... WHAT PERFECT SOUP NOODLES... As someone who holds a GREAT INTEREST in COOKING yourself... You went on to take some SAMPLE and 'ANALYSE'... To figure out what chili they used... The base of the soup.. etc... Then you THOUGHT... RARE SPICES and INGREDIENTS... OHhh... So this is HOW they MADE it...<br><br>Then you look at your bowl. MOST of the FOOD has been SAMPLED AWAY... Left a little for you to 'enjoy'..?? Just as you pick up your chopsticks and taste them... COLD... SALTY.. Noodles all BLOATED...<br><br>WEIRD EXAMPLE..? But if you think about it.. It really does make its POINTS...<br><br>BACK to your POST... LOVE... DESPITE what it IS... In fact probably doesn't really matter... For in MOST CASES.. People would ONLY CHOOSE to BELIEVE in what they WANNA BELIEVE in... Much to our limited knowledge... Much to its ambigious status... Much to MYTHS... To how we're CONDITIONED to be.. And this VERY FACT don't only applies to LOVE alone...<br><br>Suddenly my mind drift back to a movie of the recent years... 'BIG FISH'... Have ya watched it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  The way FACTS are... OR the way you want it to be.....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>So you're saying it can be anything you want to be, but nothing you can ever expect?</div>

A human...<br><br>To a politician, it's a HEAD COUNT... STATISTICS... A TICKET?<br><br>To a doctor, it's a BODY... Living organs made-up...<br><br>To a religious person, it's a MIRACLE... A LIFE...<br><br>It depends on from what aspect you wanna see it? From a Devil's point of view, it's somehow PLAIN... 'COLORLESS'... 'Odorless'...<br><br>Even if I tell you what it is, is it gonna make any difference? For the good for better of it? A television ain't really that 'exciting' (well.. At least not to most..?) because of it's made-up, but because of the entertainment values or TV programmes which can be provided....<br><br>A SIMPLE item.. Can LEADS to SO MUCH CHEMICAL REACTIONS...<br><br>To your question...<br><br>Love can be MANY things WITHIN it's LIMITATIONS... It can bring about 'side effects' or 'after effects'.... Because of it's AMBIGIOUS STATUS... It can also bring about things or indirect effects which it ORIGINALLY might not have...<br><br>Depending on what's your 'expectation'... It MIGHT just 'provide for' as previously described... How you handles it... The environment.. The 'products'... How you look at it... What you look out for from the 'products'....<br><br>Hope that answer your question to a certain extent?</div>
