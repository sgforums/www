              <p>If ur results are better than ur class, request for a class transfer might be possible if the class is turning to a NA 1. Transferring class is alot easier than transferring school.</p>
              <p>In life u will always face ppl u dun like, ppl who dislike u etc but u cannot always choose to runaway so just use this as a learning experience rather than just runaway from it.</p>

              <p>I think my only problem now is that I can't think of a good damn reason to transfer school. As I was damn guai lan in the past , all my teachers will treat it as a joke if I said I want to transfer. I regretted my past actions and now I really have the mind to study and wanting to transfer to another school that has affiliation with JCs as I want to get a degree but I can't think of any reasons...</p>

              <p><br>I thought you people must wait until come out of RTC then you will wake up...</p>
              <p>jokes aside.</p>
              <p>Ask the school cousellors for help. They can help you to do a transfer.</p>
              <p>It is really individual effort, your classmates may help in answering some questions but most of the time. you are alone. Even if you are in RI and you dont make an effort to work hard you will still fail. The only driver is yourself and whether school or the environment do not affect you much in reality.</p>
              <p>I study by myself, and usually the teachers, classmates, pia kias will leave me alone.</p>
              <p>From your first post, it just show what type of rotten friends you have. Friends that threaten to beat you, ARE NOT FRIENDS. stay away from them and they usually will left people that is not in their game alone.</p>

              <p>Hi flame,</p>
              <p>Is the harassment made by the troublemakers against you really that bad? If it is, try to seek help from your school authorities, such as your Discipline Master. If they are unable to help you out, and the troublemakers continue to make life difficult for you, then this should be a good enough reason for you to request for a school transfer.</p>
              <p>But as many of the other fellow forummers have said, there are a lot of disadvantages to transferring school, so it is advisable that you think through deeply before doing so.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i find that it is no point for this person to change school. Just suck it up. 1 year. By the time when you Graduate from your school, you are like going to think all the good times that happened to you when you first entered. Trust Me, now your class may be slacking like my class, next year, things change. Everyone will then chiong like no tomorrow</p></div>

              <p>I regret having such friends and I regret coming to this school. My attitude wasn't like this before I joined this school. I used to score A1 to B4 during my early years but ever since I know this friends, my studies began to decline. </p>
              <p>No point continuing in this school when everyone is just happy that they just passed or just failed the exams. I no longer share the same thinking as them but no one shares the same thinking like me, this is damn sad. Next year, my class is going to be converted to the NA stream cause almost everyone failed overall , superrrr pathetic right !  ):</p>

              <p>go to your principal, explain the situation. i transferred schools before, and from what i know, all principals will have one or two good friends who are principals or other principals that they get along well with, and they can pull strings to get you into that school. the important thing is to persuade your current principal.</p>
              <p>and seriously, if you really wish to study, your environment doesn't really matter actually.</p>
