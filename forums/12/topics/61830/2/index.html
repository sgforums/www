However LOOKS are not a... errr.. suitable analysis of one's character/personality as a whole. Ergo, LOOKS are important, but so are other qualities.<br><br>I believe that for girls, LOOKS will get you access to them, but it will take more than LOOKS to continue to remain with them. This is the same thing with Jobs, why the heck did Clinton get minimal crap from scandals? Because he looked good too.<br><br>Face it LOOKS are important, but so are other qualities too.</div>

We understand more of our partner every day and if this understanding is put into use, this love can blossom beautifully.
