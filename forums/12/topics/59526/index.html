Anyway my friend eventually broke up with her but it was really hard on him.<br><br>My view on it would be that, you are in a lose-lose situation. any path you take, you're going to lose. My advice: find a friend with a good listening ear and a comfy shoulder and call it off with your bf. Coz it's obvious he doesn't care about you anymore. Dragging the situation on would just make it worse on yourself when the truth finally dawns on you. Good luck and take care.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Yi Xun,<br><br>I think perhaps i used to be in yr shoes also. Anyway, i'm gonna share with you my story, one that had been a very painful lesson to me.<br><br>I ROM this lady on Nov 21st 2000 (my birthday). Though i was still a NSF that time. We dun mind having to go thru hard times as long as we are together. For her, i went AWOL (Absent Without Official Leave) to work P.T just to save up money for the wedding band. Yes, we got married eventually and i thought that well, i'm a family man afterall. Things didn't went out smoothly for me then. I found a job in a Fish Farm as assistant and has to work till wee hours everyday. I did not suspect anything at all as she will still call me everyday after work and even visits me at workplace. One fateful, i was with a friend and try calling her, but she never answered my calls. Thinking that she might be in trouble or anything, i tried calling her home too but just can't get her. Later that night, she told me that she wants a seperation, i was devasted! I couldn't believe my ears. I kept asking myself wat have i done wrong. Afterwhich, i got to know from her that she has been dating this guy for a few months. This guy even fetches her to work every morning. I went to look for her that night, she wouldn't answer the door. I peeped thru the woman and saw her talking on the phone with that guy.. it really hurts. Her parents came out and gave me a trashing... saying i'm useless and will not be able to feed their daughter. I left her wedding gown and photos at the doorsteps, went to the lift and bang my head onto it.. i could not endure the pain anymore. I was admitted to hospital with actue stress. For 7 months, i couldn't bring myself back together. I just keep myself in the room and rot.<br><br>There's too much to continue but i just wish to tell u something.<br>U have to learn to let go when u can.. coz life isn't about all these. Just treat him as a passer-by in yr life who taught u a lesson to be a better person. It's always easier to say than do, but if i have let go.. i think u can do it. Dun keep yrself in a box.. learn to look out of it and u will live happily. Good luck to you and best wishes to you.</div>
