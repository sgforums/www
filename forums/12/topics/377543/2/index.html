            <div class='col-md body'><p>Billie, I guess.. in your mind, u think tht u will be able to handle everything well. u think that your wife wont find out anything. u think that your children wont know a thing. u think that you will be playing safe and you will take all necessary precautions. u think that maybe after this one year, after the course ended, ur relationship with the girl will also end. or maybe like u said u saw some guys were courting tht girl, so if she got attached with a bf, u would end this affair too... it's like driving a car,u will never know when the accident gonna happen. u are confident enough. u never thought tht ur perfect plan would fail... BUT  Billie, seriously sometimes we do lost control. Dont you agree? u read on the paper everyday, who wants to die? who wants the accident to happen? nobody want it.. and now u r taking the risk and i bet u r trying to see how big is actually the impact might be, worst come to worst... my best wishes for your wife and children! I super hate to see women's heart break because of this selfish man. I hope that your plan would never fail, and the girl would leave after the one year course with you and your wife will never find out and your children will never know anything bout this a.f.f.a.i.r and case close?</p></div>

              <p>Thank u all for all your inputs in the previous threat.</p>
              <p>Just to update, we went out today n she be starting work at my
                                          place part time from tomorrow onwards.</p>
              <p>I accept that there is likely to be no future together with her.
                                          But is there a humane n less painful way for me to cut her off?</p>
              <p>I don’t want n cannot possibly ask her to leave, just after
                                          joining. Even if she leave my co, we will still have to see each
                                          other like 2-3 times a week, as she is likely to be my student for
                                          the next 1 year. I teach finance part time.</p>
              <p>Shall I just tell her my feeling once n for all n highlight that
                                          we got no future together n see what she say?</p>
              <p>I also know that there r some other guys chasing her as I saw
                                          them passing gifts to her, in class.</p>

              <p>A humane and less painful way ? Oh.. you are too funny Billie.</p>
              <p>Trust me, while you want to accord so much kindness to that girl, she has no intention of giving it back to you.</p>
              <p>Does she cares that you have 2 young children who will grow up hating their father ?</p>
              <p>Does she cares that your wife , after devoting so many years of her life to you, will be heart broken and left without a husband when the affair comes to light ?</p>
              <p>Does she cares that your family, including the extended ones will curse you as the family tee koh pek who can't keep his penis in his pants ?</p>
              <p>Does she cares that you may lose your teaching job or your reputation will be ruined when your school finds out ? You will have to take the fall, she will play the young naive victim. You can say bye bye to the teaching circuit.</p>
              <p>Does she cares ?</p>
              <p>Nope. Because to her, you are just a <strong>stepping stone.</strong> Your failure in life is not her problem.</p>
              <p>And look what she has gained from you already. A job, special treatment in class, free meals, free entertainments. What's there to say No about ?</p>
              <p>So what if there be no future with you ? She has a lot to gain NOW.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself, what have you done for your wife lately ? Why arn't you bringing your wife to the movies ?</p>
              <p>Why arn't you wining and dining your wife of many years?</p>
              <p>Instead, you are wining and dining that girl who has done nothing for you, except giving you hard ons.</p>
              <p>Your wife is also a woman, she needs loving from you too. She may be married to you, but I bet her married life must be lonely as hell.</p>
              <p>Go save your wife from the depth of loneliness you have cast her into, for you are the <strong>only</strong> man who can help her, because you are her husband.</p>
              <p>You need to fix your marriage. If not, it's either this 21 yer old, or another 25 year old or some other girl you want to save (for the sake of your self-esteem).</p>
              <p>Ya don't know how to keep your professional life separate from your personal  ??Go see a psychologist. They can help you.</p>

              <p>What a revelation it would be - sadly, i surmise that love is not there or altogether, simply buried under sth else. If it was, he would not be here posting and seeking opinions.</p>
              <p>I do emphatize with his predicament lar. However, like i mentioned before in my previous posting - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">self-honesty</span></strong> is essential. How long can one repress what one really feels or how long can one pretend?</p>
              <p>Whether he stays in the marriage or leaves for this gal or even another - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no difference</span>, it is merely changing, the person within carries the same ....add on. The change is superficial and cosmetic. One is still susceptible to accidents!</p>
              <p>However, with self-understanding, self-acceptance, and self-love - a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">transformation</span></strong> occurs and one is less susceptible to 'accidents' of this sort.</p>
