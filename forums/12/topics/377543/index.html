              Thank u all for all your inputs in the previous threat.
              
              Just to update, we went out today n she be starting work at my place part time from tomorrow onwards. 
              
              I accept that there is likely to be no future together with her. But is there a humane n less painful way for me to cut her off?
              
              I don't want n cannot possibly ask her to leave, just after joining. Even if she leave my co, we will still have to see each other like 2-3 times a week, as she is likely to be my student for the next 1 year. I teach finance part time.
              
              Shall I just tell her my feeling once n for all n highlight that we got no future together n see what she say?
              
              I also know that there r some other guys chasing her as I saw them passing gifts to her, in class.

              <p>i believe the best thing to do and the most dignified thing to do, is to tell no one about ur feelings. suck it up and forget about this. millions of married men and women go through the same thing as u did - met someone new and exciting, found themselves in situations where they could possibly cheat and get away with it.</p>
              <p>attraction between lecturers and students take place all the time.</p>
              <p>but the only difference between them and u is, they do nothing about it. they make no move for good reasons. </p>
              <p>forget the entire matter altogether and devote ur focus and ur heart to building ur career, raising ur child, being a husband.</p>
              <p>at best, the only purpose ur declaration will serve, is buy u a fleeting encounter with this girl.</p>
              <p>at worst, it will cost u ur integrity, business and family.</p>
              <p>i may be wrong, but ur dilemma seems geared towards sounding her out, rather than moving back on track and severing ties.</p>
              <p>if u're moving towards that direction, my advice is divorce ur wife first.</p>
              <p>(if u must) a humane way of cutting it off - cancel her appointment. as a token of goodwill, provide 1 or 2 weeks salary or have her transferred to another office.</p>
              <p>maintain a professional distance from hereonin.</p>
              <p>but like what fugazzi mentioned, the root of the problem stems from ur inner self.</p>
              <p>but that's another story.</p>
              <p>good luck.</p>

              <p>well TS. by right. it isnt even right that you're having an affair with this PRC girl. Considering the fact that you're married, and have kids, this is very very wrong.</p>
              <p>so tell her. Let her know of your other responsibilities (OF COURSE DONT TELL HER ABT YOUR PERSONAL INFO). let her know that you dont find that its right to be with her. Or come out with some other bullshit reason. main point is, cut off all ties with her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also TS, by your post which you've stated. On you noticing other guys courting her... this shows one thing. that you're still attached to her.</p>
              <p>get real her please. Im telling you this for the sake of your family. NO feelings attached. NO MORE!!! This will cost you heavily if you dont do so.</p>
              <p>if you really love and treasure your family, you'd do it for their sake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>breaking up is never easy. but its neccessary!! im not saying that you should disregard her feelings, but dont beat about the bush when trying to convey the point.</p>
              <p>Straight out point blank. No hanky panky whatsoever. so that she understands it 101%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and ts, please please do promise me that you'll never get into another extra maritial affair. Please. Its the main reason why many couples break up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>i wish you all the best and I believe that you will find the courage to do so. </strong></p>
