As a NS guy you have your rights. He can scold you all he wants, he can push you to do things all he wants, but ultimately he has his limits because he is also part of the Member of Singapore Arm Forces. He is not above the law. He and you are part of the rules and regulations.<br><br>Just don't flare up with him over small matters. Bear with it cause afterall he is still your superior no matter how screw up he is. However if he overexercise his authority, you can have the right to refuse to obey him or even accuse him in the Court Martials provided all forms are obeyed and evidences present.<br><br>Army is not just surviving the jungle, but also survival among the scrums. Think hard, Act Smart.</div>
