I had stated mine..  I know my wife loves me and still do, only thing is she don't say it out loud ..  If I am TS's husband and I supposed she will be thrilled as I will always say the 3 magical words, but will I be faithful? that's another issue ... . .  I think it best to go along with your heart.  Listen carefully what it tells you and not go round asking, just because the husband do not say the 3 words, he loves her no more ..  I am saying through experience ...  I am ashamed now I ever doubted my wife ....</div>
