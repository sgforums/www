Don't let it become a habit like 'must kiss in the morning' or else end up next time u will post in the forum "my hubby kiss me every day in the morning, but no feeling one."<br><br>You cannot 'force' him to feel romantic but you can create a conducive environment where he will feel more compelled to want to show his affection. Unfortunately, it means patient initiative, and not demands.<br><br>Do you compliment him? Sometimes adults, like children, need encouragement to do things and a lot of motivation. If he kisses you just once, do you just feel quietly happy, or do you tell him "u know I really find it very touching when you do that." THEN DON'T EXPECT HIM TO DO IT again. (read above paragraph about habits.)<br><br>Also, sometimes certain things might be easy for him to do, but certain things he just don't like to do, then cannot force him to do these to 'show' his love also. Try and find sometihng he is good at that you like, then show him your appreciation of it.<br><br>Hope things works out better for you and your hubby <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS, I am just the opposite.  I am married for 25 years leow ...  all these years I am the one who say "I love you" to my wife, she doesn't response ...  She don't even liked to be kissed. !! initially, I thought she might not love me any more or there is someone else ... then I began to do stupid things - you know - the jealous husband do, check this check that ....   but there wasn't any evidents and it lead to alot of un-happiness ...  I realised I was too sensitive ..  well  these days, I still say it and she still don't response ... sigh ... what to do ...  so beside these, we are living happily ... occasionally she will come very close to me and still don't say the magic word ..... but it felt very good...  so I take it as re-inforcement of our love ....   I hope those guy out there don't flame me for being so un-manly ...  bottom line is I know she loves me, that is the most important thing in our live.</div>
