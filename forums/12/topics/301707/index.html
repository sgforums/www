I din say that it's absolute that parental influence will overrule, but this psychological pattern is very apparent. Albeit itÂ’s likely, but individual evolution have the last say in all things in life.<br><br>To be expressive is an acquired thing - I don't see it as something impossible. Like I say, it's a codex - anyone can learn to download the 'software' into their system, if they have the wisdom to uncover it.<br><br>I am glad for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dont feel that love needs to be stated verbally to make it a true expression of affection. If a person's actions speaks of love, it can speak it louder and with more depth than words.<br><br>For e.g. my parents does not ever say that they love me. But each time they see me after a long time apart, my dad will hug me and my mom will look very happy. A friend of mine, her dad would go and cook for her and clean up house when she has a baby - all without asking for thanks - and that's our relationship with our parents knowing they love without words.<br><br>My husband don't often say the words "I love you". But what he does for me, I can see it with more clarity than in other relationships I had been in, where the words "I love you" had been said. it is in a the small considerations - the fruits he would slice after dinner, putting toothpaste on my toothbrush in the morning. .. the way he looks at me when I being my usual crazy self... etc.<br><br>I don't think it was because there was no love in other relationships, but that while one can FEEL love, and SPEAK of love - to show LOVE is actually something that you need to learn and practice in our daily mundane lives, and not some 'melodrama' sacrifice.<br><br>And it was this which he taught me in our marriage as I struggled to learn how to be less selfish, less individualistic in my considerations, so that I can learn to 'show' that i love him, rather than take the easy way out by simply saying it.<br><br>It isn't easy and I am still learning from my better half.<br><br></div>
