The only person you can control is you. If you are too emotionally involved with her and the results is disappointing, you will definitely be damn sad.<br><br>Instead take from a different perspective. Learn from this mistake and what it can offer. Learn not to be disappointed. All of us have expectations due to our own desires. That's why you must take a zen-like approach to r/s. Learn to be detached from the outcome until she is your gf. Also, it doesn't mean she is your gf there will be no problems. Having her as a gf doesn't mean your life will be happy. As long as she is not your gf, you have no chance at all.<br><br>Now that the result is out, have manners and just back off. Thank her for her time. Don't pester her anymore and go find your own partner again. How young are you? There's no need to feel confused. Some girls just can't feel for you.<br><br>doko</div>

This is not going to be easy, I repeat not easy at all. There will definitely be lots and lots of envy, jealousy, emotional agony. Until now I'm thinking, 'wow, how did i really survive for that period of 1year'.
