            <div class='col-md body'>I understand how u feel. It's similiar in most households. But first thing first before I go directly into ur problem. Maybe u haf not seen it, but to get a good education is for urself and not for them. U have to live ur future on ur education standards, but ot them. They haf already lived for themselves. Maybe in a way they wanted u to learn that doing well in ur academic results must not have a reward for it. Ur own future is ur reward. Good education likely = to good job. At least u will not have to slave urself away in some labourous work.<br><br>Another thing is that when u mention that they dun understand ur feelings or y can't they open up rite?? Y can't u think their words to u?? they do live in a different kind of time period, but it means that likely they will possess their own thinking. Even then, each is an individual?? we haf our ways of thinking as well.. when we say we can't understand other pple, likely is that we are also stubborn with our own ways too. If not, y would we regard other pple as stubborn.<br><br>As to buying things that u like or u wanted veyr much, Haf u ever tot of saving it up rather then asking ur parents to get them for u?? It will be more treasured by u too. Be it be just a walkman, which is already pretty out-dated, but to u it will mean a lot to u, becoz u haf save it up thru' mths of endurance. Furthermore they will not be able to deny u from buying, becoz it's ur own money that u haf suffered the mths.<br><br>I'm sorry if u are really pissed off after reading my reply, but I think it's worth the while to consider pple's feelings and reasons too... Becoz normally we are blinded by our own emotions and thinking. Even now, I believe u muz be thinking that I'm also blinded by my emotions when I'm replying. But hey, it's a big NO, becoz I'm also face with such problem when I was younger too. These are ways which I can equally tackle problems, not being just looking at one straight line.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're definately not alone in all this, my parents have been nagging at me for so long, and i used to ask them for a walkman or receiver etc. Eventually after a few years i got it, But my daddy, after a couple of years, took it to his own advantage and borrowed it from me until it no longer became mine. That terribly sucked didn't it ?<br><br>They often nag that i spend too much time on the computer... i find that right, but there's just nothing to do sometimes. They just don't understand that i can't just take a book and study.<br>But *sighs* they're our parents after all and we just have to understand that studying is our first priority. Maybe after when we grow up, they'll give us the space we need. grow up = above 21<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah......i agree wif the topic sometimes....or rather most of the times.... but let's face it, we r still under the 'control' of them...that is if u r still below 21.......  so, i guess let's juz tahan lor..... this is to prevent any outcomes that might be worse....  personally, i juz keep quiet when they nag or complain.... unless i m in a damn bloody bad mood...  but i juz cannot stand it when they keep nagging u to study, not have too much fun etc...  any suggestions to keep their nagging at bay??</div>
