He went on to start a philosophy based on that, and spent the rest of his life on the project. Not only did he eventually come to terms with that idea that he will be gone forever someday, he even learned to embrace it. You may want to have a look at some of his ideas and see if you can get any answer there.<br><br>http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/63/07879637/0787963763.pdf<br><br>Hope this helps!</span></div></blockquote>Thanks ommyoji, if you haven't posted this, I wouldn't know buddha himself had the same panic attack. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Thanks</div>
