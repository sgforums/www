Not all concept of afterlife at the same, so mileage might vary.<br><br>But what you mean by live life "fully"? There is no such concept as a full life. Life is just existence mah, "fullness" is an arbitary concept created by the neurons in our brains with no relation to reality. Your fear of not having a "full" life is irrational- there is no such thing as a full life. Life is just life, a series of chemical reactions to aid genes to be passed on.<br><br>But yah in that case, why are you wasting precious seconds of your limited life talking about this? If you talk about this or not is not going to change how your life pans out.<br><br>The best thing to do, now realizing that all things like love, kindness, goodness and all that stuff are just chemical reactions... might as well live our life doing whatever it wants, whoever it hurts. After all, conscience does not matter anymore and we should just do whatever we want as selfishly as we can.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>people who believes in afterlife, tend to live their life less fully, more complaining, and fearful. </blockquote>I think science would disagree.<br><br>Quite so, it has been postulated that beliefs in the afterlife were created as an instinctive coping method to deal with the fear of death, and one that has worked since humans first arrived on earth given how it has persisted even in our modern age. The arrivial of post-modernism (which is somewhat of a modern form of afterlife coping behaviour) shows that the modernist approach towards death (the one you are using now to regard death) is apparently highly inadequate.<br><br>Hence, if would be unscientific to say that belive who believe in the afterlife will have a lower quality of life then those who toss it aside, because by all measures, the very purpose of a coping method is to reduce the stress of any stressing factor.<br><br>I'm afraid you are quite wrong in this case, if life is a delusion with no meaning, it logically follows the most deluded individuals are the happiest ones, not the ones who try to scrap together the ashes after the delusion is broken.<br><br>But of course, I personally subscribe to a different school of thought then the materialist view of life. But this is just my view on the materialist way of thought- I simply think it's inadequate.<br><br>Some seem to think that by becoming absolute reductionistsand materialists one can learn the truth... but they don't seem to realize that in that very process they destroy the very concept and notion of truth to the point their answers don't really mean anything. Hence I beg to differ from them.<br><br></div>

And this build-up happens about half a second before your conscious Â”decisionÂ” to move your arm. So by the time you think, Â”OK, IÂ’ll move my arm,Â” your body is halfway there. Which means your conscious experience of making a decision - the experience associated with free will - is just a kind of add-on, an after-thought that only happens once the brain has already set about its business. In other words, your brain is doing the real work, making your hands turn the pages of this magazine or reach over for your cup of tea, and all the time your conscious mind is tagging along behind.<br><br>It is as if, after years of driving around in your car, you discover that the steering-wheel is not attached to anything, and the car has been steering by itself.<br><br>Two neuroscientists working in Australia have taken LibetÂ’s discovery one step further. They found that, when asking people to choose to move either their left or right hands, it was possible to influence their choice by electronically stimulating certain parts of their brains. So, for example, the scientists could force the subjects always to choose to move their left hands. But despite their choice being electronically directed, these patients continued to report that they were freely choosing which hand to move.<br><br>So not only is your steering wheel not attached to anything, but if your car was being steered by someone else by remote control, you would not even notice. Every time it turns left, you just move your toy steering wheel and think, Â”Ah yes, I want to turn left.Â”<br><br>[b]It is possible to get rid of the fear of death... pai me shi fu and I might teach you a thing or two <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong>[/b]</blockquote>Can I 'pai' you as 'shi fu'...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Henceforth, you will try to make sure that your this one life is well lived as possible.<br><br><strong>it is no doubt a bad thing that i shall not exist one day forever, but i no need to be fearful about it</strong><br><br>its not that simple, but just keep practising as i am doing it also. you should try to compare with the smaller things in life that you fear like stage presentation, going after a girl you like or whatever that you tend to worry and fear and realize that this smaller fear can be unlearnt to allow you live more happier and less fearful.<br><br>for me, the idea of me still living and not dead yet pop up in me occasionally. its a good reference and reminder of my existence. its like a angel hanging beside your head actually.<br><br>get used to the panic it brings once in a while then you will get more used to it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to fear dying too. Without leaving anything of impact behind OR taking anything of value with me.<br><br>That changed when I slowly came to the fact all mortals will face mortality someday. We are counting down towards our last breath as we speak (in this case, as we read), so fear of death slowly takes a turn to making something worthwhile while I am alive.<br><br>I hope to impact people positively by the time I take my leave. Seeing too much pain and sadness in this world, we need champions of humanity to instill hope and cultivate love among humans. Superman of DC comics is a good role model.<br><br>Leaving behind a name for myself is of no matter, be it good or bad (hopefully not bad in this case) but I rather see good changes in other people's lives for the better and that they see hope amidst all the dark, barren realities of humanity destroying everything every minute.</div>

He went on to start a philosophy based on that, and spent the rest of his life on the project. Not only did he eventually come to terms with that idea that he will be gone forever someday, he even learned to embrace it. You may want to have a look at some of his ideas and see if you can get any answer there.<br><br>http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/63/07879637/0787963763.pdf<br><br>Hope this helps!</span></div>
