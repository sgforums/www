            <div class='col-md body'>FINALLY, back to you SP51.... I do have to ADMIT that I'm VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD and perhaps even RUDE or CRUDE in my earlier POSTs... I APOLOGISE PARTIALLY (Because I still BELIEVE that PART of it are INTENTIONAL...) for that if I've made you feel that way.... BUT I'm not taking back my words....<br><br>You can still POST and just HANG AROUND as you like... I'll hold no grudge against you... VERY LAZY to do so....<br><br>LAST but NOT LEAST... I HOPE you would LEARN from this LESSON... IF you even BOTHER to...<br><br>1. "Help mi... And I wrong..?" YES... You REALISED that you could be in the WRONG... BUT STILL, you ask people to HELP you?? How SO? You want people to point out your mistakes and SHOW you where you're wrong...? OR do are you SIMPLY TOO STUBBORN to admit that you're wrong and NEEDS MORE SUPPORT for your OWN UNCONVINCING thinking?<br>You then went about 'shooting' at your EX.... Suggesting she don't care about how you THINK and so... But have you gave it a THOUGHT? Since WHEN have you put yourself into her shoes? And you wonder why she've not even say a 'sorry'...? Hehheh.. Which you REALLY THINK you DESERVES...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hehheh...<br>SORRY to SAY, but YOUR 1st POST has ALREADY REVEALED that your idea was NOT to ask for HELP... But to ask for MORE SUPPORT AGAINST your EX.... Based on your WEAK and UNCONVINCING thinking.....<br><br>2. I'll FORGIVE whatever you've SAID earlier on BASED on the FACT that you're already TROUBLED and CONFUSED... But for your OWN GOOD... KNOW what you're talking about the next time round...<br><br>3. Do NOT ATTEMPT to be a 'despictable' guy.... That is the kinda person I give the LEAST RESPECT to.... LEARN to walk on the RIGHT path and be TRUTHFUL to yourself... Otherwise you'll see yourself running in CIRCLE and your life REPEATING itself AGAIN..... It's YOUR LIFE... I'm NOT INTERESTED in teaching you how to run it...
