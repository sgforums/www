              <p>oh gosh... that is really painfu for you i guessed... please forgive me for saying this but your gf is a damn slut.. breaking off with you and already had a new found sweetheart??</p>
              <p>Sorry bro.. you should know by now.. since she already had a new found sweetheart... nothing you do will make her come back to you.... save the gifts.. save the time... dont bother to do them.. save the money!!!</p>
              <p>Girls are sometimes very cruel.. if they ditched you, it means DITCHED!!! no matter what you do you will never get her back.... I know how you feel... i experienced that before..</p>
              <p>So what if she is in your class? Forget about her.. dont care about her.. the best thing for you to do is to do well in your A levels and show her that you are not affected by the breakup... Do not let it affect your A levels... do not throw away your future just because of her... what will happen if you fail or do badly for your A levels, then you cant go university or what? HOW??? Is this how you wanna repay your parents?? Is this how you want to disappoint yourself??</p>
              <p>Forget about the girl.. she will only give you more pain... focus on your studies.. forget about her... forget about your happy times with her... you are still young.. study hard and do well for you A levels... and hope that she flunks her A levels because she is in too much love until she forgets to study...</p>
              <p>Jia you you can do it... forget that bitch.... or get to know more about your other class mates or other girls..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">ignore her and concentrate on your exams for now. score good results. treat it as a motivation. get better results than her current bf. They 2 are busy dating and not focusing on studying hard for their A levels. so by then if they fail. they would end up blaming each other. just move on. you scare you go university no other girls meh?</span></p></div>

              <p>Then in that case just forget the girl and study.</p>
              <p>Your Prelims are coming soon, right? Work your ass off and keep yourself too busy to think about her.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously want her to go on to uni with her new sweetheart while you screw up your A Levels?</p>
              <p>Remember that if you screw up your A Levels and cannot go on to uni, it's two of the best years of your life completely wasted. Use that as a motivation to study hard.</p>

              <p>stop wasting your time lah. just ignore the bitch.</p>
              <p>think about it, she was with you for just 9 mths and she broke with you upon finding a new bf. 2 things, first she obviously isn't serious about you. second, since she broke off to go to the new guy, chances are she was cheating on you behind your back before the breaking.</p>
              <p>take it as motivation to do well and better than them. and also the excess them to study and do well. and if you want, you can hope they both fail because they need to waste time on a new relationship.</p>

              <p>Oh no, another fallen one slain by the opposite gender. I presume she must be really physically attractive.</p>
              <p>When you see her, always smile. Other than that, no contact and do your own thing. </p>
              <p>Hang out with other friends to chill out. One of the best ways to forget her is to know more female friends and then hooking up with them. Always have a healthy balanced life. Your mind is obssessed with her and that's unhealthy.</p>
              <p>Look dude, if she doesn't want you and worse, even moved off to another guy, it can only mean she had found you boring and nothing new. It's like eating chicken rice from a particular stall and have gotten tired of the taste of it. Put it simply, she's sick of you. Worse, she's two-timing you behind your back. Do you want such a girl? Hello? Where's your self-respect? You can never get her back. Stop all the gifts, chit chat and trying to get her back. It simply doesn't work because in her mind she's done with you.</p>
