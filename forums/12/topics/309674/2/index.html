              <p>What kind "quantity of information" you need? What I am asking
                  is is there any way to hint to her I like her without being too
                  obvious so that we will not be too awkward if she don't feel the
                  same way.</p>
              <p>I am not asking you if she like me or not, perhaps you need to
                  read my post again, else your post is wasting space here.</p>

Since it's the same and you know it's like this, why, again, bother to waste space here? <br>There's nothing special that happened between both of you and you want to find out if she likes you, or was there something happened that made you got close with her?

              <p>EH TS, it is true that you should give more infomation because you are asking for help AND you need balls as fatum said because that's the only way to know whether a girl likes you.</p>

              <p>Why do I say so?</p>
              <p>If a guy gives a flower, makes present or be cheeky when talking to the girl, the chances are 90% that he likes the girl.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But a girl can go with you 10 solo dates, talk with you on the phone, tell you personal stuff but as long as the words " I like you" do not come out from her mouth, the chances of her liking you even after she does those things could be ranging from 0-90%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So yeah fatum is right. You needs balls to ask, but do it in an appropriate way.</p>

              <p>I think you can try to be more observant from now onwards for a
              start. Exercise some wisdom in your discernment and be your normal
              self. I am sure you will have the answers in no time. A direct
              approach may not be your cup of tea but hinting can always be a
              good way to start with.</p>

              <p>Like what someone before has said, ask her how she feel about you. You can start a simple conversation like:</p>
              <p>You: Do you have 5 minutes to spare? I have something to ask you.<br>Her: Yup, speak your mind.<br>You: So, we have been working in this company for X years already, yea? I want to know what and how do you think of me.</p>
              <p>I don't think it can get anywhere near being awkward as long as you don't try to be stupid and pop a question like "Do you love me?" during the conversation. If she is intelligent enough, she would know that you're trying to know from her whether she has a liking for you. And you should be able to sense whether she likes you or not from her reply.</p>
              <p>If you find that her answer is not clear enough, reply with a "Hmm...that's all?" or "Anything else about me?", but don't do it more than once otherwise you may sound like you are blatantly beating around the bush. If you are a risk-taker, advance forward and ask her what type of guys does she like, and you might just be on your way on a closer relationship with her. Or realize that you should just give up your hopes of having her as your girlfriend.</p>

              <p>too bad bro, since u ar the guy, u gotta hav to take the initiative.</p>
              <p>be creative, moreover work in same place, confirm can find some excuse to get close to her.</p>
              <p>dun confess so quickly, will scare her away. best option is for you to try get her out on solo date (eg. got free pair of movie tix from someone but nobody to accompany you). be creative, i'm sure u can find something to get her out, without making it seem like a date.</p>
              <p>from there see how she reacts towards you, alone. be more alert, feelings can be sensed. if the feelings are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>right</strong></span>, time to step up. if the feelings are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>wrong</strong></span>, you 2 can just dismiss it as another "outing", no harm done.</p>
              <p>MOST important thing for you to do now is... get her out!!</p>

              <p>OK TS,</p>
              <p>I pose u this question.</p>
              <p>If u play a netball game with a group of gals, then everytime dun know why she will sort of end up teaming with u. AND she will ask me questions like where is the drink stall, aren't u playing anymore, u want to play etc.... BUT i choose to reply her casually like It's over there, nope i not playing, thanks u can carry on etc....</p>
              <p>If u are in my shoes, u think the gal likes me or is she trying to be my fren?</p>
              <p>My answer to u is she is trying to be my fren i think. Y? Cos i never know what the hell gals are thinking these days, so i prefer to think otherwise.</p>
              <p><strong>If u like her, the main thing is sincerity. Prove to her that u are sincere to date her and make her ur gf.</strong></p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents</p>

              <p>But I think it's a little too obvious to ask her out without scaring her. It is kind of weird to suddenly ask a girl out. It's very obvious you are wooing her...</p>
              <p>It is easy to woo a girl you don't know well you like her as you have nothing much to lose if she reject you. But to woo your colleague, thing can go very awkward if it don't turn out well since we still have to work together everyday...</p>

              <p>TS, like you said, feelings grow over time, so try to gradually get her attention alone on you by perhaps talking to her more often, and trying to eat lunch together. At the same time, like you said, you grew to like her as you know her better, so give her some time to know you better too.</p>
              <p>I do not know about the character of the girl that you like, but perhaps she's somewhat like me, the passive but friendly sort. So if you do not come across as being obvious enough that you like her (and only her alone) and treat her more special above the rest of friends and colleagues, chances are, she's gonna think you're jus being friendly and she'll only be extra friendly back to you, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as a friend</span>(whatsmore in a working environment). Why? Because if you are not even brave enough to approach her when you like her, how does she know you really like her enough? Just being merely friendly is not gonna assure a girl you like her enough for her to wanna go into a relationship with you.</p>
              <p>So the key points are to be 1) gradual, 2)consistent, 3)obvious enough to her.</p>
              <p>I know working environment is not exactly the most condusive for a relationship to blossom, but would you wanna throw that all away for a possible love aka most impt partnership in your life?</p>
