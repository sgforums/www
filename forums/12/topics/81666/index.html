            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>if nt is to open a business selling food which my ma expert in. but i still wan to play play till 25 be4 i settle down. is it too late? </blockquote>It depends on situations, some people feels its late at the age of like 18, they already planned for future and prepared to work already, some people still playing at 30 years old.<br><br>But if you feel that money is insufficient, what choice do you have?<br><br><blockquote>i dont have the mind to work i just feel life is nt enough for me...tons of things happen to me but nothing yet make me work even harder..what should i do. </blockquote>Several possibilities why you are unable to push yourself, there is nothing right or wrong in here.<br>1. You already comforted yourself deep inside, although you retained the displeasure outside. So you lost the core motivation.<br>2. Sub conciously, you never blamed yourself but others for your fate. So you think, since it is not my fault, why should I work so hard?<br>3. You feel unappreciated and short changed, especially if all your peers all like able to play all their lives. You ask, why should I work, why can't I play, like others do.<br><br>Motivations are deprived from the word motive, which implies an emotion or desire to do something. The source of motivation is always emotional, but does not confined to what is good or bad. And this emotion must be strong, and persistent, not a 5 second charged of battery. Only than, a desire can be created with goals, plans, etc.<br><br>If you want to work hard, than think of something emotionally strong and persistent in your life, that can push you, than think nothing else. No playing, no distractions of any form. For your case, that is the main distraction.</div>
