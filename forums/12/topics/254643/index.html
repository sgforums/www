Dun pm and ask me about Google Adsense thingy....</div></blockquote>Your post did remind me of my situation. I hope I can give you some advice based on my experience. I graduated with an engineering degree from NUS but it was not a good (Hons) degree. Managed to find a decent job as an engineer during the recession between 2002-2003. Realised that engineering is not really what I wanted. At the same time, I took up a graduate accountancy conversion course part-time while working as an engineer. Those days were madness because I was not studying what I was working.<br><br>After 3-4 years of engineering work and also obtaining my accountancy qualifications, I decided to make a bold decision to switch to become an auditor 2 years back. It was a big paycut I have to take and also working with my peers 6-7 years my junior is a humbling experience. The thing is I am working towards my goal and this sacrifice is worth it as I see more opportunities in the finance industry, and coupled with my engineering skill sets, I believe I have more opportunities than if I were still an engineer.<br><br>For your case, there are many part time masters and courses available. If you seriously think that business/finance is what you wanted and if you feel if you can do it full-time (i.e money is not an issue), you can take a course related to financial engineering, CFA, applied finance or a general business course. However, employer outside still prefer candidates with relevant experience. But the important thing is you have to take action now. Get the relevant qualifications and the opportunities will come.<br><br>Dun brood about last time when you should have taken business modules this and that. Past is past. Have to take action if you seriously desire what you want to pursue.<br><br>If you feel that you need to look for a job, then start looking. Dun worry if it is still programming or computer related jobs. When I was an engineer, even though I feel it was not the job that I desire, I still do it cos the money finances my studies.<br><br>Lastly, you are still young (assume you are NS-served, 24-25 currently). I have frens/juniors who are willing to sacrifice their 3 years to pursue a full time Law graduate conversion program after their engineering degrees. I have frens who are working in finance related industry after quiting from their engineering jobs in MNCs after they took Master of Science in Financial Engineering on a part-time basis.<br><br>After all these years of working and studying and interacting with various people from diversed professions, I have come to a consenses that what they have achieved now is due to their belief that they can succeed in that particular field. It takes plenty of sacrifices and also a strong conviction.<br><br>Hope my advice is of help.<br><br></div>
