              <p>I just meet somebody over work. After knowing her 8 months, doing some project, I ask her out but she rejected my invitation on 3 saparate occasion.</p>
              <p>I know she is not obligated to say yes but I feel heavy and disappointed in myself everytime I get rejected. What you do when you feel rejected or blown off by somebody you want to aks out?</p>
              <p>For me, I just go back home and watch TV and read the good book for encouragement.</p>
              <p>Some people when they break up or get blown off, indulge in getting involve in heavy work. Some go for more exercise in gym to release tension. Some go buy more motivational books. Some go confine with friends. Some go shopping for more expensive clothes.</p>

              <p>Think better you get your emotions on a tighter lease, just in case, if she already have boyfriend, you know maybe, talk about her boyfriend and things like that that made your be aware of things that she is doing with her boyfriend, I know I will get to be more devastated.</p>

              <p>Her rejection may mean she is just not ready yet. Sometimes she wants to see if you are really sincere and not one who just want a one-night stand and throw her aside.</p>

              Seriously, if the girl not interested in me I give up immediately already. I know if you keep chasing her, she may heart soft and give you chance...
              
              But, for me, I rather find a girl who love me for what I am. Then one day when you're rich, you celebrate and give the girl who loved you the best time of her life, for simply believing and loving you when nobody else does. Coz when you're rich, it's much harder to see if the feelings is for real, only when you're down and out, you can see the true side of people.

              <p>Think he knew he had only a very distant chance, all of us knew he had no hope. The girl was already cohabiting with her boyfriend so all of us knew it would be a matter of time before they got married. He persisted though, ordinary useless little acts of concerns hoping that the girl might consider her. He's not the F4 dashing kind of guy, so he will have to shine through his personality through time.</p>

              <p>I just meet somebody over work. After knowing her 8 months, doing some project, I ask her out but she rejected my invitation on 3 saparate occasion.</p>
              <p>I know she is not obligated to say yes but I feel heavy and disappointed in myself everytime I get rejected. What you do when you feel rejected or blown off by somebody you want to aks out?</p>
              <p>For me, I just go back home and watch TV and read the good book for encouragement.</p>
              <p>Some people when they break up or get blown off, indulge in getting involve in heavy work. Some go for more exercise in gym to release tension. Some go buy more motivational books. Some go confine with friends. Some go shopping for more expensive clothes.</p>

              <p>There are so many ladies out there, why stick on her? She already rejected you, and that is not the end of you life.</p>
              <p>There are more better ladies you still have not meet yet.</p>
              <p>Open up yr eye and you will find in.</p>
              <p>But, be careful not to get one that is lazy and unwilling to share your burden when you tight down with her.</p>
