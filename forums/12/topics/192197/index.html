            <div class='col-md body'>to find a person isnt difficult.<br><br><strong>check friendster and webbies like that. </strong><br><br>make sure to browse through your immediate contacts (in the dance class) first and look at their pics (for her) and who are in their friend list. this is going to take very long. even months! so do not attempt it unless u r really serious. and even if u r really really <strong>REALLY</strong> serious about this, there is a high chance that u will fail. so be ready for that.<br><br><strong>check with her friends (or other dancers) casually</strong>. (going to be quite embarrassing nonetheless) wat i mean by casually means that u talk about other topics, and then ask this qn as if its an afterthought.<br><br>wat i suggest is that u contact her through the net first (through either one of the methods), before getting her hp number because if u get her number from her friends, its meaningless. but if u get it from herself, it means that u r interesting enough for her to give it to u to let u contact her.<br><br>not the same class hours means the treat trick has to be ready everytime u go. this can be quite tiresome but with plenty of luck, it may just work.<br><br>all this 'dun be paisey' talk is for naught because u WILL BE paisey. so, talk to her normally and attract her (a few playful negs at the right time would be perfect), NOT move too fast and make her run away.<br><br>and <strong>DO NOT </strong>, i mean <strong>NEVER</strong>, make yourself seem so interested as if u r a drooling bulldog *eewwww* and u will be fine. make yourself seem interesting, NOT interested.<br><br>it would be ideal if u dun ask for her number at all, but make her give it to u herself.</div>
