              <p>Who here have or think that you have depression as you are always worrying and thinking of commit suicide?</p>
              <p>I never see psychiatrist and take medicine for depression but I suspect I got depression as I am always worry and thinking of commit suicide.</p>
              <p>Reasons being:</p>
              <p>1. I don't earn much money. No siblings too. Staying with mother and grandmother. Grandmother is always sick. Mother is already 50 plus years old. Earn less than 2k a year and also got alot of medical problem always need to spend money to see doctor.</p>
              <p>2. Never have a gf before in my life and don't have much friends too. Very lonely person.</p>
              <p>3. Always worry about my future. Now so many foreigners in sg snatch our jobs, make our salary low, cause housing prices to increase.</p>
              <p>I am always worry about how low income people like me are going to survive in the future.</p>
              <p>Always thinking of commit suicide than don't need to worry about the future liao but dare not to commit suicide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who here have depression and always worrying and thinking of commit suicide?</p>

              <p>I agreed to the fact that depression is not a joking matter... i have drug-induced depression before and i did not notice it... it was till my mum noticed that ever since i start this medication for acne, i have become depressed and aggressive without any reason... go see a doctor if you need... </p>

              <p>There are many different types of drugs used in  the treatment of 
                  depression, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs), 
                  atypical antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and  
                  monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Side effects are common in all  
                  antidepressants. For many people, the side effects are <strong>serious</strong> enough to
                   make  them <strong>STOP</strong> taking the medication.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Fluoxetine (Prozac) </li>
              <li>Fluvoxamine (Luvox) </li>
              <li>Sertraline (Zoloft) </li>
              <li>Paroxetine (Paxil) </li>
              <li>Escitalopram (Lexapro)</li>
              <li>Citalopram  (Celexa) </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, I suggest anyone taking such pills to google the side-effects before heading for that.</p>
