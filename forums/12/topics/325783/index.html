              <p>You should sit down, calm yourself down and write down CLEARLY what are your things to do.</p>
              <p><em>when you are too stressed, you can achieve nothing.</em></p>
              <p>Tell yourself how much time is left, and plan realistically what time to finish your agendas on time.</p>
              <p>Finally, have the discipline to finish them at a go! (<em>u will be super tired but hang in there)</em></p>
              <p>It's good to reward youself along the way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are afraid you will face this kind of situation again, anticipate the important highlights of the week <strong>early</strong> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">get started</span> to prevent yourself form feeling so stressed.</p>
              <p>The only person who can save you is the thinking of your mind. If you think positive,  your friend may be a angel in heaven watching you and giving u luck. Treat those politics as though they were meant to pull you down, so brace yourself up and not get down. If you think it is not worth your time investing on the time on the girl for the time being, make it clear to her and she should understand your priorities now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stress is an emotion brought upon yourself, so only you can make it go away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>JIA YOU!</p>

              <p>It's perfectly normal for people to have problems and downtimes in their lives.</p>
              <p>But it's not really beyond your own control to overcome them. It's a lifestyle problem, how you treat yourself will determine your abilities to handle/deal with your own downtimes in life.</p>
              <p>Despite how people in your environment treated you in your life, always remember to treat yourself right is how you maintain a healthy mind and soul.</p>
              <p>Give yourself a treat, watch a comedy, go window shopping with your friends, indulged in your hobbies, go ktv, learn dancing, learn golf, have a religion. Have activities that you will enjoys and will make you happy and satisfied for the day.</p>
              <p>I understand that money are not easy to come by these days, but if your money are not good enough to make you happy when you're down, then what's the point of collecting them when you can't even afford cheer yourself up when you needed to?</p>
              <p>You need to have a change of lifestyle and that will need to start from your mindset, only then will you be able to have a break-out and outgrow from your emotional cycle.</p>
              <p>You can do it, believe for all the good things that will come in your life and they will happen if you wished hard for them to happen.</p>
              <p>It's not our destiny that guides us in our lives, it's our thoughts that we believed in which will form our destiny if we wished hard enough for them to happen.</p>
              <p>Be positive and you will be guided down the positive path towards your destiny.</p>

              <p>I think you are overwhelmed.</p>

              <p>Hopefully by focusing one task at a time, the stress level can be reduced.</p>
