            <div class='col-md body'>I studied @ NYPS too, during the early 90s.  Heard of a boy who got bullied real bad by a group of girls back then.  It was covered up to "protect" the girls.  A small punishment was meted out, a slap on the wrist, but the perpertrators' names were not announced.  The real victim was practically ignored and was expected to get over it immediately because of the stereotyped view towards his gender.<br><br>This incident may scar the boy for life and sow the seeds of hatred, even if on a subconscious level.  I would not be surprised if he develops a contempt of women and grows up to engage in a series of toxic/abusive relationships just so no woman can ever bully him again.<br><br>I fear that Singaporean girls are getting too pampered and ill-disclipined.  Closing an eye to this sort of bullying sends the wrong message and is counterproductive.<br><br>If a girl is attacked by boys, the public is outraged.  If a victim is attacked by a group of punks of the same gender, the public hums with disapproval.   But if a boy is attacked by a group of girls, the public just laughs it off.  How is that logical?  You mean gender equality apply to boys/men, too?<br><br>If we continue to treat this issue with indifference, I really loathe to see how our future generations will turn out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think firstly, bullying does not need to choose a place or time. it happens.<br><br>so the theory about prestigous schools can go down the drain. it is a myth that they are all goody goody students who toe the line..<br><br>to me, in a pressure cooker, the students will have more reasons to do something more unbelieving...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a parent too, and I have a boy who will be exposed to all this.<br>I think I will allow my boy to be expose and see how he reacts.<br><br>Cause I once had a friend, a 10yr old, aus friend, whose head was pushed into the wall. Classic bullying in AUS.<br><br>His dad offered to teach his theory of five fingers, small and isolate, together, they are a fist.but the boy just told his dad, not to worry. It is normal, and carried on.<br><br>so if my kid can just brush it off, no problem.<br>or else, I will ask my kid to stand up to this.<br>And I will be behind him all the way.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by spinsugar:</div><div class="quote_body">I studied @ NYPS too, during the early 90s.  Heard of a boy who got bullied real bad by a group of girls back then.  It was covered up to "protect" the girls.  A small punishment was meted out, a slap on the wrist, but the perpertrators' names were not announced.  The real victim was practically ignored and was expected to get over it immediately because of the stereotyped view towards his gender.<br><br>This incident may scar the boy for life and sow the seeds of hatred, even if on a subconscious level.  I would not be surprised if he develops a contempt of women and grows up to engage in a series of toxic/abusive relationships just so no woman can ever bully him again.<br><br>I fear that Singaporean girls are getting too pampered and ill-disclipined.  Closing an eye to this sort of bullying sends the wrong message and is counterproductive.<br><br>If a girl is attacked by boys, the public is outraged.  If a victim is attacked by a group of punks of the same gender, the public hums with disapproval.   But if a boy is attacked by a group of girls, the public just laughs it off.  How is that logical?  You mean gender equality apply to boys/men, too?<br><br>If we continue to treat this issue with indifference, I really loathe to see how our future generations will turn out.</div></blockquote>This is very well written!
