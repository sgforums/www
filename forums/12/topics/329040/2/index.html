              <p>To be able to exercise FORGIVENESS in a relationship is so much more important than having honesty in a relationship.</p>
              <p>Would you have love her less if she wasn't comfortable to be completely honest with you?</p>
              <p>Don't forget you were in love with her even when she wasn't completely honest with you.</p>
              <p>By expecting her to be completely honest with you for the sake of your love, then it is certain that the feelings you had for her wasn't LOVE in the first place, it is POSSESSIVENESS born from the feelings of LUST.</p>

              <p><br>Rainee, I agree that it is very hard to be completely honest. But we must remember that the truth will surface eventually. That's why I feel it is better to admit something than to let your partner find out himself.</p>
              <p>You may think that by not telling him the truth is going to save him a heartbreak. But will he think that way as well, if he finds out one day.</p>
              <p>Honesty is a two-way traffic. We cannot expect honesty from our partner yet hide certain things from him.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't even bother to question someone about their past if I truly love them. Cos it is unfair to both of us when the event happened before we met.</p>

              <p>Yes, I know it is unfair for the partner not to know, but once he/she knows, it would hurt them big time and their relationship might never get past it. Is it worth sacrificing a wonderful relationship just to reveal something in the past?</p>

              <p>That's why it is important for us girls to be with the one whom
              we are sure is truly in love with us and not just love us to
              fulfill their own selfish lust.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't even bother to question someone about their past if I
              truly love them. Cos it is unfair to both of us when the event
              happened before we met.</p>
              <p>I believe things would have been different in each other's past
              if they have met and together with someone they truly loved
              before they took the wrong path or made the wrong decision in their
              past.</p>
              <p>Life isn't fair, so why do we have to judge one another's past

              unfair lives?</p>

              <p>Quite true. I guess it is the a moment that will break or make a relationship. If the past is revealed and the partner manages to take it and face it as a flaw yes, but also part of the person he loves, then you sorta know that the relationship will be for life.</p>
              <p>But if otherwise...</p>
