Make yourself a familiar face. There's a tactic to ask for his number if you wish:<br><br>You do use MSN, huh? If not, go get it. When you meet that guy for maybe the second time, ask him if he uses MSN. If he does, ask for it. If he say okay, give him a piece of paper and a pen. While he's writing it, say "Oh yea, include your HP number too." There's a high percentage he would just write it down without any thinking. It's in the human mind. He agreed to give you his email, and if you ask at the right time, he won't hestiate. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Needs practice, though. Guys can try it out too.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In any case, confirm your feelings before you decide to go any further than friends with him.

Usually is the other party who initiated to know me, and i happen to like him, thats why.in fact, i do not even dare to look at him eye to eye. juz a peek maybe. Yes, i m a mouse.

I know of a fren who knows him but this fren happens to have a liking for me.  And hes the only fren i know who knows the guy. You know, if i initiate to him, and if it fails, it will be so embarrassing. how to face him during my lectures?<br><br>On top of that, i am afraid of saying things that might offend him. like as mentioned above by other members  saying, 'u pon lesson ah?' will he think that i am always looking out for him w/o him knowing which may be a turn-off. or may even sound like deregotary remarks.<br><br>WHY is it that girls are so easily won over by constant persuing, great personality of a guy, and esp. guys who are nice to the girls. BUT NOT the other way round? is difficult to win a guys heart in fact. Not all pretty girls get to win a guy's. As mentioned, ' if a guy has no interest in a gal, the gal  DUN stand ANY chance at all. ' Like the guy will never be touched by a girl's sincerity? so what is a guy looking for if not a faithful gf who is nice to him?( of cos at least average looking)<br><br>hmm... do you guys think is a good idea to leave a note on his desk during<br>break?</div>

Now kinda regretted not knowing how to grab the chance when he talked to me the other time, should have sat on the bench with him when he was alone cos he decided not to go in as well.<br><br>Furthermore, i heard that he has a gf but thats all,never seen her nor heard anything about her,yet(?). I know of a fren who knows him but this fren happens to have a liking for me.  And hes the only fren i know who knows the guy. You know, if i initiate to him, and if it fails, it will be so embarrassing. how to face him during my lectures?<br><br>On top of that, i am afraid of saying things that might offend him. like as mentioned above by other members  saying, 'u pon lesson ah?' will he think that i am always looking out for him w/o him knowing which may be a turn-off. or may even sound like deregotary remarks.<br><br>WHY is it that girls are so easily won over by constant persuing, great personality of a guy, and esp. guys who are nice to the girls. BUT NOT the other way round? is difficult to win a guys heart in fact. Not all pretty girls get to win a guy's. As mentioned, ' if a guy has no interest in a gal, the gal  DUN stand ANY chance at all. ' Like the guy will never be touched by a girl's sincerity? so what is a guy looking for if not a faithful gf who is nice to him?( of cos at least average looking)<br><br>hmm... do you guys think is a good idea to leave a note on his desk during<br>break?</div></blockquote></div>
