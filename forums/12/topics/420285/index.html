              <p>recently my class(poly) have such a realistic cliques. smart ppl clique with smart ppl, average clique with average and dumb clique with dumb. This happen so suddenly and may i say only this wk. why? cos exam is in 2-3 wk time. And unfortunately i am in the dumb clique. But those average clique are quite ok so it is not them i am talking about. it is about those smart one. Some more a few guys go clique with them cos they wanna increase their gpa. Why so realistic man. It is not like hanging with us will make you stupid or what. Just eat and have fun is it such a problem?</p>
              <p>If they want to study we will not stop them either. If my friends and i will to study i bet they will not even win us. Mainly those who failed are just lazy tt all. Is singaporeans really that realistic? I mean come on la if want to shun us don't make it unti so obvious right? We are a class, we still need to do project together in the future too. What they do i must say i am quite disappointed with it. Make me feel like changing class sia.</p>

              <p>That one while I was walking in school with my group of friends, a group of Advance Dip student walk pass and gave a very scarcastic look *piss off lah!*</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, what you can do is <strong>prove to yourself</strong> that you are as good as them, and remain with your group :) Like that, they will fear you as another competitor, your current clique will treat you well and come to you when they need help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is just they way how society work, and it is very realistic and harmful in a way. Treat it like a working world, because when you go out to work next time, your team may have different background and cultures. Okay *you are getting an exposure to the worlding world already*. Now it's time you learn how to deal with it.</p>
              <p>Changing class only solves your problem temporarily, and it will not solve your own problem. It only way to solve this is to learn how to deal with people who you don't wish to work with. Usually in a company, the management people experience your situation most because they want to prove performance. It transform into a dog-eat-dog situation.</p>
              <p>Yes, in life some times we are required to work with individual who we don't wish to work with, but there is no choice. :) I will say... learn to appreciate other's ability, and share with others what you know. You see, in a team, there are different people with different strength and weaknesses. It's not about looking at weaknesses, but to appreciate and learning from each other's strength.</p>

              <p>Yes it is that realistic.</p>
              <p>People in these "realistic" cliques have more to lose. That's why they fear failure. They are afraid of hanging around people who are not motivated in their studies because they fear that they'll be influenced and become less motivated =&gt; get lousier grades.</p>
              <p>Not everyone can afford to take it easy in life. Many people have to sacrifice blood and sweat to get what they want/need.</p>
              <p>True, they shouldn't make it so apparant that they're avoiding you guys. But then again, this a small price to pay if you want to remain footloose and laze around all day.</p>

              <p><br>My thread successfully reached 250. Fail? It was one with the most high quality post, you loser, Miss bOnker.</p>
              <p>Me being gracious and honourable person, I have decided not to occupy the whole forum and allow other sgforum who have problems to confess to Aunt Agony.</p>
              <p>Gals like me alot. But I am glad Monster Troll like Miss Little Bonker is so so jeaolous of me. Jeolous of my ability to date, make friend and go out with available woman. Miss Little Bonker is jealous of my youthful exuberance, my flexibility and my guyness allow me to go out late at nite. Whereas, Miss Little Bonker is lonely, no fren, have to occupy the internet day in day out, to troll forums and give stupid advice.</p>
