              Why would your family member treat you like that? Was there some bad blood that wasn't mention here? Normal family members will help each other I think, unless some bad arguments happened... Like me for example I left home many years due to argument... Funny thing is only $50 in my pocket and I spent all on cab fare to move to friend's place... But it was during that tough times that I realize I am actually such a strong person that can tahan any shit comes to me...

              <p>When you grow up and became independent, you should have build up your bond with family and friends. You do that by your actions and maintaining contact. Small acts or gestures repeatedly through the months, years would be more effective than a big favour one time only. If you live selfishly alone, don't expect a crowd when you need help.</p>
              <p>Look around you, why some people have family or friends who quickly come around, some have no one. Honestly look at their personality.</p>
              <p>The early signs would be when you are shifting home, how many volunteers can you muster up. When want to hold a function, how many helping hands can you get. When your PC suddenly die, do you call a friend? Do you have a friend? From these you can gauge how much you bonding you have build up with your family or friends.</p>
              <p>Don't blame them, because you neglected yourself with them, and in time of need, there is no one.</p>
              <p>You can't rely on them, because they can't rely on you.</p>

              <p>Be strong my friend. I always live by this motto: Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill.</p>
              <p>There is hope is everything, you just need to seek it, and it'll come to you.</p>
              <p>Always pray to god. This is why we need a religion. If there is no one for you to talk to, your prayers can be heard by god. </p>
