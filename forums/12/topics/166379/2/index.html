It may not be easy to recover from a failed relationship of three solid years - but bear in mind that emotionally, the reaction to this sudden void could be the very reason why all these scenario took place.<br><br>Love becomes very blur and you have people waiting to fill in application... hoping for some success in wooing you. One candidate arrive and you sees him as a potential. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]To you, it probably means that you are too used in being in a relationship that subconsciously, singlehood seemed so alien to you. To this man, it could mean sex, fun and company.</span></strong><br><br>When sex comes into the picture BEFORE a relationship, it is like putting the cart before the horse - all your variables changes. If people could have the opportunity to walk out of a retail store with any items and pay some other day, what are the chances anyone would pay? Even if you will receive some payment, one thing is for sure: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>anyone who pays will delay the payment. </strong></span><br><br>Your man isn't shy - in fact, he is reviewing his stand now. Chances are, his feelings for you may not justify a relationship for him. Things are 'cool' now? Of course things are 'cool'! All the fun MINUS the commitment and responsibility of a relationship... who doesn't want it?

And exiting a relationship is never easy emotionally on someone.  He may feel that there's a risk you may be treating him as a rebound relationship?<br><br>Perhaps before you talk to him the next time, be mentally prepared for the worst.  Then sit him down &amp; let him know there's No reason for him to feel panic, as you've already mentally prepared yourself.  Let him know that his panicky behaviour the previous time you talked made you fear the worst.  Then ask him what he foresees for both of you again.<br><br>If he panics &amp; prefers things as they are, you'll then have to make the decision whether or Not you wanna continue with this dating, or look for someone who's prepared for commitment &amp; love.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Katie99:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi,<br><br>I 've never used this site before but was just hoping for a little bit of advice...<br><br>I've recently came out of a 3 and a half year relationship as I didn't think it was working and have since met a few guys. The most recent guy is quite a bit younger than me (which took some getting used to!) and we've went on a few 'dates', to the cinema and the pub and things. Anyway, we've met quite a few times over the last month and have ended up sleeping together quite a lot too. Thing is, I just can't work out what it is he wants from the relationship. I spoke to his best friend who said that this guy wants to get together with me properly, but is too nervous to ask as he doesn't know what I want. THe only problem is whenever I approach the subject, he clearly gets really nervous. He's quite shy in a lot of ways, so rarely seems to say what he's thinkin (without alcohol <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. After our last date I asked him what he wanted from 'us' and after he'd finsihed practically having a panick attack he said he thought things were 'cool' as they are. I'm really confused - I really like this guy but don;t want to get hurt anymroe.....help!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote></div>
