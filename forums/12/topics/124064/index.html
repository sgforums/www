            <div class='col-md body'>forget it..she will surely think its your plot to break them up and make her go back to you..even if you ask her good friends to help also no use..she will think her good friends are on your side..thus she will be more dependant on the 'other' guy..sometimes when the more you are trying to protect her..the more hurt you are going to give her..she need to learn on her own..to know who is good to her and who is not..if the guy is really a jerk..then let her be hurted by him..its her choice..and maybe through this she will learn more..if you still like/love her..then just be there for her when she needed you..and if you are giving too much and hurting too much..then just let her go..shes not yours anymore..good luck and take care.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
