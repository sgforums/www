              <p>In short, she is currently faithful to you, but you are worrying about her betraying your trust and love.</p>
              <p>The worst thing is that this is partially due to a mental illness which you had, though you have "recovered" from it a few years ago.</p>
              <p>The best thing for you to do now is to see a psycologist and get some counselling and medicine. OCD is partially a biological thing, so you can never truly fully recover from it.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately there is no such thing as a definite permanent recovery. A relapse is not uncommon for those without a strong will ( No offence intended here ).</p>
              <p>If you get another gf, the same thing might still happen. The main problem now is no longer your gf, but yourself.</p>

              <h3><span class="mw-headline">Behavioral therapy</span></h3>
              <p>The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called <a class="mw-redirect" title="Exposure and response" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_and_response">exposure and ritual prevention</a><a title="Exposure and response prevention" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_and_response_prevention">exposure and response prevention</a>")
              or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety
              associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for
              example, someone might touch something only very mildly "contaminated"
              (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been
              touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came
              from a "contaminated" location, such as a school.) That is the
              "exposure". The "ritual prevention" is not washing. Another example
              might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure)
              without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person
              fairly quickly <a title="Habituation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation">habituates</a> to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety
              level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching
              something more "contaminated" or not checking the lock at all—again,
              without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking. (also known as "</p>
              <p>Exposure ritual/response prevention (ERP) has been demonstrated to
              be the most effective treatment for OCD. Using ERP alone, one can
              become completely symptom free. However, the individual must be highly
              motivated and consistent. It has generally been accepted that <a title="Psychotherapy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a>, in combination with <a class="mw-redirect" title="Psychotropic medication" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotropic_medication">psychotropic medication</a>,
              is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent
              studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the
              combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder#cite_note-41"></a></sup></p>
              <p>Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of
              D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of
              Exposure and Response prevention.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder#cite_note-42"></a></sup></p>

              <p>Actually my fears triggered from some HIV scared 5 years back, I've accidently touched some blood and then begin this fear where by i kept on testing blood for up to 7 months and even lost my job because of that.. I've research alot about the disease and read alot of such forums everyday.. Finally on the 7th month, I decided to put it to an end by testing the last time. Results neg but happy for 2 days and then started thinking about the doc may have used a tainted needle on me and I kept on recalling the senarios on that day I went to the clinic to make sure that the doc used a new needle..I knew that the doc uses a new needle but the fears doesn't get away..Until i decided to seek medical help and then it gets away..</p>
              <p>But you read the history of my gf and u should know why my fears come back..I am very scared of HIV..</p>

              <p>If you have choosen her, then don't let her down. As long as she is faithful to you and remains so, then let the past rest.</p>
              <p>There are quite a number of guys like you who will prefer their other half to have them as their first and only man, but nowadays it is very hard for this to happen, given the large amount of screwed-up guys who only toy around with the girls.</p>
              <p>If you dump her now, that speaks a lot for how much of a man you are, but of course it is a different story altogether if she becomes unfaithful to you.</p>
              <p>You are not a bad man, you have been faithful and loving to her. But the most important thing in a relationship is trust. The worst part is that your mental illness is only making things worse for yourself. You should get help from a psychologist as soon as possible.</p>

              <p>I was worried that that was part of the problem too. Good thing it isn't.</p>
              <p>But as I said, you have accepted her, you have choosen her, so you had to live with it. As you said, she is being faithful to you now, so you should give her some of your trust.</p>
              <p>If you find her unacceptable now, then you shouldn't have continued the relationship back then and have broken up instead.</p>
              <p>Of course, all we can give you here is just "cheap talk" advices, ultimately it is your choice now what you want to do about your relationship with her......</p>

              <p>I know I chosen her but now it seems to be eating me up..I duno why too..I continued because I saw changes in her and also those old msn logs which she spoken to her random msn frens way before I knew her..I know that she has regretted wat she have done so she was being played out by people badly..So I accepted her..But then say ok but my mind kept on thinking about her complicated past..</p>

              <p>That is why I asked you to get some help from a psychologist. </p>
              <p>If these thoughts are partially due to mental illness, you will be better off to get some professional help rather than asking a group of strangers.</p>
              <p>We can ask you to stop thinking about it, and some of the jokers here might even give you a list of 108 methods to stop thinking about it, but the only one who can make any change is yourself. You will need to build up a strong will-power to force yourself to focus your mind on other things instead.</p>
              <p>And do not go about thinking that getting yourself drunk is a good way, that is only a temporal escape.</p>
              <p>At the same time, you should also think about where your relationship is going. Since it is starting to settle down now, there is no reason for you to make it volatile again. A very important thing which you should not do is to talk to your gf about her past. You will only hurt both her and yourself this way.</p>

              <p>Please, do understand that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lack self-love</span> and that is why u are in such a predicament. Whatever your gal friend was in the past and even now is her business.</p>
              <p>If u have love within u and most of all trust in your love - everything will be alrite. As for now, I doubt that u are self-fulfilled.</p>
              <p>To be honest, even if u leave her and get a new 'friend' its going to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make no difference</span> lar. What u carry within u will always be there - either u <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reconcile and uncondition yourself</span> and relate or stay put and wish people would change or accept u. It mite happen but that is a dicey affair.</p>
              <p>U may go and see a psychiatrist or seek help from anyone. If u are unwilling to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">acknowledge the lack within</span> - it will sooner or later surface.</p>
              <p>There is no such thing as a strong mind - mind is a divisive mechanism. Good to use at work or marketplace. However, when it comes to matters of the heart - like love, relating and .... one has to be vlulnerable, one has to risk, one has to accept rejection, hurt and chug along.</p>
              <p>All that you are feeling now is cos u are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">listening to ur mind</span> and there is a crowd lar.By crowd, i mean all the conditioning over the years since childhood , egs your parental conditioning, your social conditioning  and so on so forth. </p>
              <p>The oppposite of love is not hate but fear.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, its time that you understand this aspect in you and understand and accept what u are.</p>
