              <p>Look,you know you have OCD.</p>
              <p>You know you cannot get rid of it.</p>
              <p>But you can control it.</p>
              <p>First you need to recognise it.</p>
              <p>Sit down by yourself and write down all OCD incidents you can remember.</p>
              <p>Try to see what is the trigger or cause. Also figure out the counter actions you can take.</p>
              <p>Do this often, and destroy the paper each time you do this exercise. The information on it  is for you and only for you to know. </p>
              <p>As you come to recognise OCD symptoms, you can deal with it.</p>
              <p>Do not curse and hate the disorder. Just accept that it is there and deal with it.</p>
              <p>With practice you can control yourself, regulate yourself.</p>
              <p>Medication and psychologists cannot cure you, they just make you feel better.</p>
              <p>Of all medication is the easiest, because you don't have to do anything, you just pop a pill and you get relief. But it is no cure.</p>
              <p>Start writing and see the  OCD coming, and control it. Develop the habit of controlling OCD instead of the habit of running amok.</p>

              <p>You are just afraid that she will infect you with STD/HIV lah !</p>

              <p><strong>Since you are so scared she will give you HIV/STD( because of her past) , then tell her to get a blood test done, so that you may sleep in peace. </strong></p>
              <p> Are you afraid to open your mouth to ask her go get a blood test ?</p>
              <p> After this thing about her "risky" past and STD/HIV possibility gets washed down the drain with a simple blood test.... WHAT OTHER FLAW are you gonna be "obsessed" with NEXT ?</p>

              <p>Come'on pal, you are being too paranoid. Why keep thinking of something you wanted to forget ? Forget means no remembering but in your case you are keeping it.</p>
              <p>Since you already told yourself that you wanted forget all those unhappy things, then dun even try to think about it. Look forward pal, no point dwelling on the past. That's a start.</p>
              <p>As for the STD/HIV thingy that is buggy you, let it go pal. Since she is tested clean and you wanted to trust her, as long as both of you start truthful to each other then both of you will not get it. I am sure you are aware of this fact, aren't you ?<br>(even if you get those diseases, it doesn't matter whether you know it early or late right? )</p>
              <p>Wish you and your gf a happy life ahead</p>

              <p>WHAT makes you think a virgin will always remain faithful in her relationship ?</p>
              <p>WHAT makes you think a girl who was previously faithful in a long term relationship will not betray you in the future ?</p>
              <p>There are a lot of virgins who married a virgin and end up betraying their own spouse and passed on the infection to their spouses.</p>
              <p>I suggest you don't get yourself involve in any bgr AT ALL. You are not the kind that is suitable to be in one.</p>
              <p>If you continue with your constant unfounded suspicions, you will end up with NO relationship anyway.</p>
              <p>You are only wasting her time.</p>
              <p>Because as long as you cannot overcome this fear of betrayal, the relationship will never be able to make further progress and will die of a natural death.</p>

              <p>Learn to relate to yourself first lar, otherwise this festering wound is going to be the undoing of what u are all about.</p>
              <p>I do wonder if u relate to your gf about your fears or whatever that belies the facade that you project of yourself.</p>
              <p>OCD or not - its the lack of will on your part to fulfil who u are first that has you in a bind.</p>
              <p>Beggarly love has nothing to offer now or even in the future - probably it will legalize love (marriage) n the next thing one (or both) is trapped and mostly, the daily dose of exploitation of each other will wear out both parties and the eventual demise of the relationship or marriage lar.</p>
              <p>All i can surmise is a loveless relationship that is draggin and all these hoping that things will work out is delusion.</p>

              <p><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Your association with OCD might have suggested generic links that might actually require intervention on the biological aspect of your issue other than just tweaking of psycho-social environment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To improve your overall competence in handling your own crisis, you might want to seek professional consultation to decide if your OCD is making a comeback. </p>
              <p><br>If biology is indeed part of the influence, then there’s only so much your environment could do to reassure you. Only your psychiatrist can decide if medication or other form of intervention is needed to improve that aspect of your vulnerability.</p>
              <p><br>However, for everything else, in name of all that mistrust (which you have decided that you can’t help but feel this way), it is but a devil in your emotional mind that constantly play tricks on your negative feelings. Your negativity will perpetuate a self-fulfilling prophesy and you will likely end up immolating your own relationship, even if it originally doesn’t steer towards doom fire.  </p>
              <p><br>The relationship doesn’t need another person to ruin it – by the natural flow of situation (without considering other factors) - this person will end up being yourself; you will suicide this relationship with your doings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see: she doesn’t need to cheat you – your mind would have probably succeeded in cheating you first, by distorting your reality and providing you deluded perspectives. For love cannot be chained – your effort spared to investigate her daily living will promote mistrust between couple and over the time, this behavior will consume you like how a demon would ensorcelled a foolish seeker to give up his soul.</p>
              <p><br>Between Love and Fear – when you end up losing this relationship – Fear would have glee sadistically at your decision to believe in its false reality. And Love, which has the potential to blossom into a great relationship, is now nothing but withering and dead, with multiple stab wounds punctured by a blind man.   </p>
              <p> <br>Love is blind – because most people end up destroying their relationship unconsciously. One that walks with no vision is no different from one that walks with no self awareness.</p>
              <p><br>Both are blinded, albeit in different state. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>The more u know the more paranoid you are. Have you been seeking medical advice as some forummers have already adviced you to? If you don't get some medication to help curb your constant worries, it would be hard for you to maintain this relationship in the long run.</p>
              <p>Shes already doing her best to change and she listens to you. What more do you want or expect her to do? The past is over, nothing she can do to erase them but the future is still blank and waiting for you 2 to create it.</p>
              <p>How about asking yourself whether you are with her because you love her or because of some other reason? Does your family knows the background of her currently? If they don't and you do not want them to look down on you etc, i don't really feel theres a need to tell everyone about her history since what is important is how she is now. If she is willing to change and has changed, you should not let her past forever haunts both of you.</p>

              <p>Jerry,</p>
              <p>If u fear - how can u claim u love her lar - please lar , u dont have to honestly proclaim what u feel here but i m sure u know of such a thing as being honest to oneself - self-honesty lar.</p>
              <p>Frankly, no one needs to approve of ur gal or whatever she is to u. If u and she can relate well and cope with the peak-and-valley expereinces of living that is all that matters lar.</p>
              <p>Understand this - love knows no reason(s) and knows no fear(s) - absent both love abides.</p>
              <p>I have not commented about her - cos all i know is what u say about her and frankly she (in my opinion) is free to be what she is. She is not duty-bound to alleviate your fears and emotional hang-ups.</p>
              <p>One last thing - the most ugliest thing is to ask her to change or elicit a change that works for u. If u love , u love , please lar, she is not a means to your end. If she is - its simply means - u are using her to meet your .... </p>
              <p>She is not here (on earth) to fulfil u lar, she is here to fulfil whatever she mite be incline to be. If u love her and can partake of her when she is with u - its a blessing. U talk about future - to me , its utter crap lar. U fear the future cos u cannot deal with uncertainty and love cannot be made certain cos its a here-now phenomenon lar, a here-now existential experience lar! </p>
              <p>Like I mentioned before the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">essential</span> is missing and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accidental</span> is aplenty in u.</p>

              <p>If you love her, you should not constantly worry about the future. OCPD might be something that fuels that but i would say your own insecurity is also a huge cause in this happening.</p>
              <p>Are you not trusting her and feels that her love for you is only temporary or do you not trust yourself to be able to continue loving her and make her feel love? If you can continue to love her deeply, there is no reason for what happened in her 1st marriage to happen again.</p>

              <p>Made your appointment with your psychologist or psychiatrist yet?</p>
              <p>Don't worry about what will happen before things even happen. Are either of you happy when u behave like this? If you don't start to give her your full trust, there might be 1 day she really gets tired of trying to please you and earn your trust and just leave you. You know how tiring it is for someone to keep trying to please and assure someone she can be trusted yet do not get any trust back?</p>

              <p>But without the women's charter, a lot of women would be on the losing end in Singapore. These laws were enacted to protect the women because a lot of heartless men in the past denied responsibilities of their children and such.</p>
              <p>Putting that aside, after you finished your trip to the psychiatrist, do tell us the results and the advices that were given to you. We would see if there is anyway in which we could help you out then.</p>
