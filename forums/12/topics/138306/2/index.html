Hope i may be of some help.<br>Hey maybe we give this guy some breathing space.. think he's frustrated enough over his situation.. There are prominent bad points about guys and a totally different set for the ladies.. While its trilling to flame this guy here, its not necessary.. Sure does not mean that the older u r the more informed choices u make. And no, girls are not born angry. I see more of character differences in yr problem and would advise u to let her know the way u feel. Have a talk with her to see if the situation can be salvaged. But only if u wnt to. Seems to me tat its better if the two of u go yr separate ways. Useful advise has already been well defined by other forum mates.. I feel its already enough for u to take action and stop waiting for the best advise if u already noe wat u should do. For romantics out there, Sorry cuz in his case his heart is already not where it should be. And for those who are flaming him as immature, pls give him some space as he doesn't want this to happen either. We know not even 10% of his life for us to judge his charater.. so please less scolding, more advise..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> you trying to adviSe  us dude?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the comments. Anyway the storm seems to be over but I'm still pretty clueless as to what have happened.<br><br>For some reason she seem to think I'm looking down at her. All I did was mention she should get a better job than being a waitress and also asking her whats her hobbies except shopping(I thought its a girls universal hobby). Maybe the way I phrase it is wrong or what but she was mad at me for 3 days. And spend yesterday afternoon and night on the phone yelling at me(lots of 'f' word) while I was apologising all the way. So when she finally says its end of our r/s and she will no longer contact me I put down the phone and mentally prepare myself for the worst.<br><br>So it came as a surprise to me that 4 hours later she calls me and started to chat like nothing was wrong. Called me again at noon just now and talk to me and asking me am I angry with her(of course not, abit confused but never angry). So now it seem like we are back to square one again. I know she is rather sensitive at times to people words but her outburst make no sense to me at all. Hopefully its the last time I experience it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
