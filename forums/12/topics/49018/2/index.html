            <div class='col-md body'>This is how I see your situation as a gal. Sorry, for being harsh but no offence intended.<br><br>Firstly: u said he helped u pay for the study fees, hp bills and stuffs. To put it in another manner, maybe he's investing on u? Hoping to reap more than what he forked out initially?<br><br>Secondly: You said he'll travel all the way to see you every wk, then I just need to ask you this, during the time he didn't call you, didn't meet you, do you know what he's doing behind you?<br><br>Thirdly: You mentioned he told me he love u still but bcoz of parents he has no choice but to get a wife whom his parents like. It seems to me throughout the whole situation. HE is the one who told you everything, ranging from parents to the gals to the marriage.<br><br>Have you met the gals yourself before you completely trust what he said? Now everything seems so one-sided. He told you he didn't even date the gals, but how can you be sure???<br><br>I feel you've alot of trust in him. I don't know about this, but guts feeling tell me you placed your trust on the wrong person.<br><br>You also mentioned you can catch him lying, everything he does, doesnt fall beyond ur eyes.. hm.. but love is blind. Are you already too blinded by him to see clearly?<br><br>He wanted you to look for your 'next guy' and if things don't work out both for yourself and him, he'll take you back. This is rubbish to me. I can tell you straight in the face, this is just an excuse to break away from you.<br><br>To you he may be a nice goody-2 shoes.. sorry that's not how i see him. I'm not trying to be negative, but shouldn't you cast aside your trust in him for once and think about it thoroughly?

Sorry, for being harsh but no offence intended.<br><br>Firstly: u said he helped u pay for the study fees, hp bills and stuffs. To put it in another manner, maybe he's investing on u? Hoping to reap more than what he forked out initially?<br><br>Secondly: You said he'll travel all the way to see you every wk, then I just need to ask you this, during the time he didn't call you, didn't meet you, do you know what he's doing behind you?<br><br>Thirdly: You mentioned he told me he love u still but bcoz of parents he has no choice but to get a wife whom his parents like. It seems to me throughout the whole situation. HE is the one who told you everything, ranging from parents to the gals to the marriage.<br><br>Have you met the gals yourself before you completely trust what he said? Now everything seems so one-sided. He told you he didn't even date the gals, but how can you be sure???<br><br>I feel you've alot of trust in him. I don't know about this, but guts feeling tell me you placed your trust on the wrong person.<br><br>You also mentioned you can catch him lying, everything he does, doesnt fall beyond ur eyes.. hm.. but love is blind. Are you already too blinded by him to see clearly?<br><br>He wanted you to look for your 'next guy' and if things don't work out both for yourself and him, he'll take you back. This is rubbish to me. I can tell you straight in the face, this is just an excuse to break away from you.<br><br>To you he may be a nice goody-2 shoes.. sorry that's not how i see him.
