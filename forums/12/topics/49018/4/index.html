My problem is my boyfriend is gonna get married very soon (this year) with a girl whom he does not even really dating yet just bcoz his parents only wanted a chinese girl as their daughter-in-law.<br>My boyfriend is an engineer working with a German company in Singapore.His name is Wong Hoong Wern.Last night,he confess to me that he really loves me very much but he has to make more friends (girl of course) so that his parents is happy and he is recently dating 2 girls behind me. One of them is preety but jobless and the other one is slim and short but only work as an operator. Me myself is a degree student in one of the private college in Malaysia.<br>He also asks me to make new friends (boy of course) and try to date them. I really can't do this because everyone I met is not him. Recently, my ex-boyfriend contact me after so long and my bf seems to be jealous.You see...after 5 years of wonderful relationship without any big problem....suddenly this things happen.<br>But he said if his marriage is unsuccessfull and the same thing also happen to me,he will come back to me because he knows that I love him so much...I love him more than I love my own parents &amp; sibblings....he always knew that....<br>Lastnight,he said to give ourselves a second chance to go out with another fella and he also wants to get married with any of the two chinese girl to make his parents happy.<br>Previosly,he agree to convert to my religion because he is a freethinker but now because of his his parents strong objection,he has to do this as he is the eldest son in the family and his younger brother already got married with a girl who is 8 years older than him and now his parents is very very upset. He is doing this only to make his parents happy.<br>Now I'm really upset and depressed and really don't know what to do to handle this case. I hope freinds out there could help me and give me some advice. Thank you.<br><br></div></blockquote>I can understand how you feel, but from what you wrote, it seems very hard to believe what your bf is saying.. He must be so filial that he can give u up juz for the sake of making his parents happy.. You think for yourself, if you love someone so much, would u give him up and marry someone else juz because your parents objects to your relationship? Maybe he IS so filial, and only you know his character yourself.. you got to assess the situation now. Is he trying to get out of this relationship by coming up with this excuse? Or is he really saying the truth? I cant omit the fact that his brother married a older woman, and MAYBE he really wants to make his parents happy, but is he KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH 1 STONE?<br><br>Farahney, would u wan a guy who because of certain obstacles juz give u up juz like dat? I mean i doubt his mentality if he says he REALLY loves you.... but his actions are so immature! Hes hurting you even more.. so what if you 2 are together and married in the future, some other things crops up and ur husband says, sorry we cannot be together, lets divorce! isnt that even a worse senario then now?<br><br>Sorry if im too direct, but itz really wierd someone who loves u so much treats u like dat... dun u think? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
