            <div class='col-md body'>My relationship with my boyfriend is already 5 years. My problem is my boyfriend is gonna get married very soon (this year) with a girl whom he does not even really dating yet just bcoz his parents only wanted a chinese girl as their daughter-in-law.<br>My boyfriend is an engineer working with a German company in Singapore.His name is Wong Hoong Wern.Last night,he confess to me that he really loves me very much but he has to make more friends (girl of course) so that his parents is happy and he is recently dating 2 girls behind me. One of them is preety but jobless and the other one is slim and short but only work as an operator. Me myself is a degree student in one of the private college in Malaysia.<br>He also asks me to make new friends (boy of course) and try to date them. I really can't do this because everyone I met is not him. Recently, my ex-boyfriend contact me after so long and my bf seems to be jealous.You see...after 5 years of wonderful relationship without any big problem....suddenly this things happen.<br>But he said if his marriage is unsuccessfull and the same thing also happen to me,he will come back to me because he knows that I love him so much...I love him more than I love my own parents &amp; sibblings....he always knew that....<br>Lastnight,he said to give ourselves a second chance to go out with another fella and he also wants to get married with any of the two chinese girl to make his parents happy.<br>Previosly,he agree to convert to my religion because he is a freethinker but now because of his his parents strong objection,he has to do this as he is the eldest son in the family and his younger brother already got married with a girl who is 8 years older than him and now his parents is very very upset. He is doing this only to make his parents happy.<br>Now I'm really upset and depressed and really don't know what to do to handle this case. I hope freinds out there could help me and give me some advice. Thank you.<br><br></div>

Thank you.<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> There is two thing you both can do - one is resigning to fate, the other is fight for your own happiness.<br><br>Resigning to fate and he marrying to another girl and all that crap - I think its totally lame. Marriage is sacred - its neither a game n or a deal (humans are the one who made it seemed like that - which totally degrade and desecrate its highest meaning). He will probably divorce his chinese wife - or continue to date and have affair with you secretly. This will NOT only hurt his poor wife, but rather how long does he wants to keep it going? What if there a child already? &amp; there are many implication of divorcing, what if the parents flared up and stop him not divorcing her because of you? Isn't it walking back to the same problem?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>My take is take on this, but fight rationally. Solve problem from its roots and not its surface. There are WAYS - give it up and follow blindly will only cause resentment, regrets and intense relationship with the three of you. Both of you probably have karmic relationship with one another - cause such a major rift and issue in your relationship after so long. No relationship is smooth going without its cosmic lesson and true love is often the ones that hits the strongest.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> What to do?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I advice you to tell him to stationed into passive mode. There is absolutely no hurry for him to get married - delay that. His mum wants him to get married to those chinese girls - tell him that he has no chemistry. Your parents will still be parents - they will disprove someone they don't fancy to be good, but they wouldn't force you into a hell pit if you really don't. Keep delay time - reduce her parents resistance against him marrying/dating/etc you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> His parents will give up one day.<br><br>I know the issue here is about his parents being gald or not - try throwing in communication first - if all fails, employ strategy and schemes. NEVER ATTEMPT MARRY SOMEONE YOU DON'T LOVE and create another karmic relationship with another person.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Case study:</span></strong><br><br>I had this uncle who fell deeply in love with my aunt, who is a Malay. Female side parents totally forbid her to date him, in the end also cannot stop her. Then when it comes to marriage - he has to change his religion, which my uncle doesn't wished to. (He feels marrying her and changing religion is separate issues altogether.)<br><br>Guess what? He took my aunt to ROM and register themselves. The parents was furious and totally raging. They leave them as it is first, and try communicating.<br><br>Now? They already had two kids; My older cousin already finished Army and working - 20++ years old. Of course now already calm and peaceful already. (Please lor, kids already so big - parents themselves resign to fate..

Dis is YOUR happiness &amp; his too. <span style="color: red;">DO NOT </span>bcoz of wat his parents did stop U... but approach cautiously...<br><br>(Out of topic...)<br>Frankly speaking... I still do not get WHY old fashioned parents r liddat, so "stick-to-da-board", so biased towards foreign race, so RACIST... these parents r normally da 1s who can NEVER see da BIG picture here... They THINK they r in control when in reality all they did was only bear the child &amp; bring the child up! The child is da ONE who decide wat life he/she/it wants!<br><br>To ALL parents &amp; would-be-parents: love yr children, BUT give them freedom too. Your experience &amp; advice may be invaluable, but its their life &amp; they should be the 1s deciding.</div>
