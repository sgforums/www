            <div class='col-md body'>Ariel, No need to get all defensive here.  Afterall, I don't know you nor your bf.  I'm just commenting based on my own relationship.  Moreover, there have also been others who've gone overboard in their "stickiness" what <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Sometimes, I DO forget to eat, especially when I really have something important to do, or something on my mind.<br><br>I won't forget that my guy is in the same room as me, but it doesn't mean I HAFTA pay attention to him every time he is in the room.  I'll give him a kiss, &amp; we both do our own thing.  Just knowing each other is there is enough.  We need our space to do what we like.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ariel_Ong:</div><div class="quote_body">Will you forget to eat?surfnet til morning thn can't wake up in time to go work?Will you forget tat I am in e same room as you &amp; oni remember until I complain?</div></blockquote></div>
