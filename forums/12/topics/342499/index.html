              <p><br>Yah lor.. you are so calculative/petty.</p>
              <p>Your gf will be very proud of you if you show her friends.. how caring you are to her.</p>
              <p>But instead of showing off your caring... you go and make her loss face. How unbecoming !!!</p>
              <p>You envy other gf serve their bf drinks.. you go and seduce those girls lah !</p>
              <p>Other guys are envious of you for having a gf.. you still donno how to appreciate ah ?</p>
              <p>Stop comparing your gf with other girls.. I'm very sure you also don't want your gf keep comparing you with other guys , RIGHT ??</p>
              <p>Be more mature.. don't keep looking and salivating at what others have.</p>
              <p>If yours is really not good enough for you.. then let her go.. she will find someone else who will appreciate her.. and so too will you.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hello all,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Recently me and my gf attended a BBQ, I was BBQing her favorite prawns together with some other friends. After sometime the g/f of my friends who were BBQing with me brought some drinks to them, while I was left out. My g/f was busy chatting with someone else.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">After the food is ready, I brought it to her she didn’t say much but ask me to BBQ some stingray for her friends who was chatting with her, I felt rather piss by then, but at the same time I thought than being a b/f I should be so calculating so I brushed it off and thought that I am being too petty.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But somehow those frds who were BBQing with me notice the change in my expression. Am I being too petty? How can I stop behaving so childishly?</span></p>

              <p><br>No you're not. It's normal for people to feel upset cos people are simply not born to be enslaved.</p>
              <p>Unless you're her servant, butler.....you don't really need to live with that kind of nonsense.</p>
              <p>But if she did asked you nicely and you are too cowardly to refuse her, then you are petty and childish if you really had a change in your expression. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
