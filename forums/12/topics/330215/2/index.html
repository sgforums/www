              <p><br> You would want to react based on your initial intentions of
              knowing her.</p>
              <p>IF you don't really like her but just want to be friends only
              (LIAR), then it wouldn't matters if she's a mother of 1000 kids or
              1 kid.</p>
              <p>IF your initial intentions were to love and be together with
              her, then you wouldn't mind if she got 1000 kids or 1 kid, cos
              afterall those kids were produced by the woman that you loved and
              want to be together with.</p>
              <p>BUT if your initial intentions were just out for a fling, then
              of course you would be upset, disappointed that someone else or
              many other else (1000 guys) got to her first before
              you.</p>
              <p>It depends what do you really want out of this
              relationship/friendship/any-ship with her.</p>
              <p>But <strong>it would be WISE to understand that YOU WEREN'T IN HER PAST
              TO SAVE HER, so why would you think you have any RIGHTS to be upset
              about?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Since you think you should be upset with her past, then Should
              she be upset with you for not showing up at her past?</strong></p>
              <p>She had to LIE to you to protect both the happiness of you and
              her, and when she had to put this happiness that  were shared
              by both of you at RISKS, do you still have any reasons to
              doubt that she's not in love with you? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Its not about how you react, but what you perceive of the relationship. I think she might be looking for marriage, and didn't want to ruin her chances because many men are too narrow-minded.</p>
              <p>If I was you, and intend to marry her...I'll not hestitate to propose since both of you are together for (quite some time). Hestitating further will make her even more insecure, which is the reason she hid the truth from you in the first place. Otherwise, it's prob wise not to waste your own, or her time since age waits for no man.</p>
              <p>*edit*<br>Is she married before, or all along a single mum btw?</p>

              <p> I think the final decision of what you are going to do after knowing this really depends on what do you want out of this relationship. A fling or a marriage?</p>
              <p>If it's a marriage you're after, try accepting her past. Loving someone also means to embrace whatever flaws that the person has or what her past was. You can no longer change her past and stop what has happened from happening. But what you can give her is a happy future =]</p>
