              Ts, 
              I know the most difficult thing is a psycho hangover, emotional hangover for anyone to expereince and that seems to be your predicament for now. 
              They same time heals - frankly, it wont but remain a pschyo scar and impinge on your other pursuits and have you being cynical or doubtful of gals in general. That in intself is unhealthy. 
              
              As for her being not trutful about her ... is understandble but sonner or later this was bound to happen considering the age and moreover when it intuitively does not feel that it was love.
              
              If love was there, she would have told u despite the fallout and you would have understood her predicament despite having to endure emotional pain.
              That it did not transpire is no boby''s fault or sin. Love is for giving hence the word forgiveness. Sadly, many only take and as such how to forgive.
              
              My suggestion is not to try and forget  - it will not work but merely be suppressed though it would appera like it is being forgotten. Trying to reconcile to your emotional discontent calls for lots of inner search and most all willing to die to the expectations/needs that you (and many) are totally oblivious to and misinterpret it as love. Why is the pain there? It is cos your sense of self - that which one identifies and gets attached to has been a prop is no longer there. Hence the collapse and the loss of self.  
              
               Patience and soon the grass turns into milk

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>My girlfriend of 5 years ended our relationship yesterday. I was
              utterly devastated and hearbroken; I cannot concentrate on my
              work.</p>
              <p>We had known each other when I was 22 and she was 20, but I
              digress.</p>
              <p>Last year August she started her first job working as a HR
              Executive and I, as a Training Executive, albeit in different
              companies. We were happy for each other. However, it turns out that
              her colleagues like to bully new staff, so she was getting quite a
              lot of stick from them, and this caused her to be very stress.</p>
              <p>She called me every night saying how much stress she is under
              and how she yearned to quit, but she held on for our sake. A few
              months after that, a new guy in another department joined the
              company and being a HR personnel, she showed him around and they
              found out that they stayed just a few blocks away from each other.
              Hence, they go to work with each other everyday as they were both
              new and needed friendship in a trying environment.</p>
              <p>She began to talk to me lesser and lesser on the phone and said
              that her friend, B, understood the environment better so it is
              easier to explain things to him. She assured me that they are just
              friends, nothing more.</p>
              <p>One day, I found out she lied to me about being at home but she
              was actually out with B. I became paranoid and started to secretly
              check her phone SMSes and call logs. I saw that he always sent her
              lovey dovey messages and they talked on the phone till 3am almost
              everyday. I confronted her and she said I invaded her privacy,
              which I admit I was wrong but she did nothing to allay my fears and
              worries.</p>
              <p>Eventually, she told me that B can text her or tell her anything
              he wants, but she will not respond to him. This goes on for the
              better part of half a year and we had some serious fights over this
              issue, but we still remained with each other. They were meeting
              more frequently and he asked her out for dinner and movies on a few
              occasions, to which she complied once. She promised to be home
              early on that day but at midnight, I received a call from her and
              she says that she will not be home early as she will watch another
              movie.</p>
              <p>Just last month we had a big fight again over this issue, and
              she mentioned to me that I was too controlling and wants to check
              up on her and do not trust her. How can I trust her anymore after
              all that she has done?</p>
              <p>Eventually yesterday, she told me that she loves me a lot, but
              she wants to go out with B for 3 months as his girlfriend because
              she find it very comfortable being around him but very pressured
              when with me. She said that she knows this relationship with B will
              not last as she sees her future with me, coupled with the fact that
              B is a flirt and not serious when it comes to girls, but she just
              want to play with him until the end of the year. She told me to
              wait for her but still remain status quo and she will give up after
              she had a go at the relationship with B.</p>
              <p>I did not agree at all (would any boyfriend agree, seriously?)
              and we had another fight over this. Eventually I told her that if
              you want to be with me, you cannot be with him and vice versa. OR I
              could just tolerate and let her go with him for 3 months, but she
              must break off all contact with him afterwards. She was reluctant
              as she still wants to remain as normal friend with B, and said that
              she will never drop a friend.</p>
              <p>She flared up and told me that she wants to break up, and I
              left. That was yesterday. Today, I texted her and called up but she
              did not reply nor pick up the phone. She has made it seem like it
              is my fault but truly, she is the one at fault here. If she had
              really love me, nothing can make her sway her love. I know being
              controlling and invading her privacy is wrong, but I wasn't like
              that until the first and subsequent times that she lied to me.</p>
              <p>I am feeling downright hurt and hearbroken and all I can think
              about are the years we had spent together, how we went through
              thick and thin and all the toughest and happiest times together.
              She's all I can think of only right now, but it seems like she
              doesn't care about us anymore due to the fact that she did not
              bother to contact me since.</p>
              <p>Can anyone please advise me what to do? I feel like breaking
              down.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>You need her more than she needs you.</p>
              <p>She is a selfish person. More interested in her own desires than yours.</p>
              <p>Let her go, so you may seek your own future elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Even if she comes back to you in 3 months time... she will seek another "adventure" again in another man... and another .. and another.....</p>
              <p>I am surprised you never confront that "other guy" yet. Does he know of your existence ?</p>
              <p>If he knows of your existence and yet is preposterous enough to attempt such act of stealth... it means your gf had been complaining and acting victim of a broken relationship.</p>
              <p>No man will try to snatch a woman from a seemingly strong and healthy relationship.</p>
              <p>However.. it is quite obvious.. your gf is a "complainer". One who complains incessantly to get empathy and sympathy as means of manipulation.</p>
              <p>5 years with such inferior stock is best left to rest.</p>

              <p><br>I disagree. TS should not change to make himself competitive. Making himself more appealing sounds as if TS is at fault for his girlfriend behaving like that.The problem occurred because TS made the wrong choices, unfortunately has to learn from the consequences of his error of choice. TS has done nothing wrong, he is just a victim of an immature and uncaring girlfriend. TS should instead be himself, and find somebody who is more compatible rather than a chio bu. People always tell me, marry your best friend not a chio bu.</p>

              <p> It is painful and devastating esp you are thinking it is kinda  wasted  for this relationship has been going for 5 yrs.</p>
              <p>Sometimes , it is fated when a r/s comes to end unexpectedly .Yeah it is way too shocking to accept the reality.</p>
              <p>But you still have to accept the cruelty .</p>
              <p>You have to move on. You have to get into your life and live it with fulfillment esp without her.</p>
              <p>Get yourself busy with stuffs and stop thinking about her.</p>
              <p>Also not calling or texting her completely and completely erase her from your memory.</p>
              <p>If she just need space to sort things out she would reaches you in no time. Stop begin needy and clingly that even drives her away furtheraway probably landing in other man's arms.</p>
              <p>Hope you can get over this.</p>

              <p>Humm... what to say,</p>
              <p>If I ask TS to let go it will be very hard for him, yes we all know the heart pain, the sleepless nights and the endless tears crying out loud asking heaven what have he done wrong. ( We all have been there we know it hurts.)</p>
              <p>Breaking up is a process no one wants to go through but I just hope TS will take a step back and look at what has happen.</p>
              <p>1) Fact 1 : your gf wants to sleep or have fun with another guy for 3 months knowing he is a flirt and  you have to take her back after another guy had "used her". Wow if you can do it then so be it. Out of 10 guys only 1 actually has done it but sadly that guy was never happy cos he is always suspecting of her cheating.</p>
              <p>2) Fact 2 : Does your gf really love you?  working life is tough so does everyone here in the forum, but does alllow her to go out with other guys and do stuff behind your back. Yes we believe that you love her with all your heart, 5 years is not short but the key question is does her actions not her words show that she treasure all the 5 years.</p>
              <p>3) Fact 3 : What is the point of calling her? Do you seriously feel that she will give up the guy for you? In her heart she has already chosen him over you, the small complains of you, actions of saying she is at home but actually she went out with him.</p>
              <p>My advice is for you is very simple just take a week break from her, that means no calls to her or just refusing her calls. It helps to clear your mind and allows you to think about whether is it worth keeping the relationship. We are all adults, is time to think like one.</p>
              <p>I myself have been through this many times, so this method seems to be the best one I have used so far.</p>
              <p>I believe you deserve someone better, someone who true love you for who you really are.</p>

              The gal  ''going away'' is an excuse, n by that I mean that the cirumstances now surrounding her is such that it is revealing of what she is: she is getting to find out who what she is now (assuming she knows). Right/wrong does not matter. Between ethics n rules, the former is freeing and inclusive and is respectful of onself and the other(s). The latter is simply duty-bound and useful in only in business not matters of the heart. Likewise Ts is also getting to know what he is all about (assuming he does care)
              Only love heals, but the mistake that is always repeated unknowingly is that the other must love in order for one to function as a human being. In other words, the person who is being loved is merely attached and would surely expect that the other only love him or her. This is cos it nourishes one's sense of self. This is like telling someone that you are only allowed to ''breathe'' when u are with me. How can beggarly love offer antying except to use another to prop onself up and in turn if the other is tne same it is aslo going to be of using as oppposed to sharing or giving. One cannot give what one does not inherently has in him/her. Many miscontrue quantity with that of quality. The former is easy - do things, possess materials - hence the phrase, mutual benefit scheme. The latter is that which emanates ffrom onself and one cannot pretend when one is simply lacking within. 
              
              My personal opinion is that neither one of them  is rite/wrong - in the matters of the heart - there is no rite/wrong. it appears all wrong cos the one loves or purports to love from the heart when the reality is that it was never so. Mind is a cunning fox, caluclative! Gratitude is that of being thanfkul that at least one had the opportunity of having spent time with another for a ....  Of course, it can only emanate when one is him/her self  understand the fragility of love and moreover understands that a person is not a thing to be used but partaken of and appreciated while it lasts.
              
              Ts can go about living and doing things - unreconciled to this anomaly (misconception or conceptualized models of relationship/love/life n ...) it is bound to surface or manifest itself in another ....

              <p>My girlfriend of 5 years ended our relationship yesterday. I was
              utterly devastated and hearbroken; I cannot concentrate on my
              work.</p>
              <p>We had known each other when I was 22 and she was 20, but I
              digress.</p>
              <p>Last year August she started her first job working as a HR
              Executive and I, as a Training Executive, albeit in different
              companies. We were happy for each other. However, it turns out that
              her colleagues like to bully new staff, so she was getting quite a
              lot of stick from them, and this caused her to be very stress.</p>
              <p>She called me every night saying how much stress she is under
              and how she yearned to quit, but she held on for our sake. A few
              months after that, a new guy in another department joined the
              company and being a HR personnel, she showed him around and they
              found out that they stayed just a few blocks away from each other.
              Hence, they go to work with each other everyday as they were both
              new and needed friendship in a trying environment.</p>
              <p>She began to talk to me lesser and lesser on the phone and said
              that her friend, B, understood the environment better so it is
              easier to explain things to him. She assured me that they are just
              friends, nothing more.</p>
              <p>One day, I found out she lied to me about being at home but she
              was actually out with B. I became paranoid and started to secretly
              check her phone SMSes and call logs. I saw that he always sent her
              lovey dovey messages and they talked on the phone till 3am almost
              everyday. I confronted her and she said I invaded her privacy,
              which I admit I was wrong but she did nothing to allay my fears and
              worries.</p>
              <p>Eventually, she told me that B can text her or tell her anything
              he wants, but she will not respond to him. This goes on for the
              better part of half a year and we had some serious fights over this
              issue, but we still remained with each other. They were meeting
              more frequently and he asked her out for dinner and movies on a few
              occasions, to which she complied once. She promised to be home
              early on that day but at midnight, I received a call from her and
              she says that she will not be home early as she will watch another
              movie.</p>
              <p>Just last month we had a big fight again over this issue, and
              she mentioned to me that I was too controlling and wants to check
              up on her and do not trust her. How can I trust her anymore after
              all that she has done?</p>
              <p>Eventually yesterday, she told me that she loves me a lot, but
              she wants to go out with B for 3 months as his girlfriend because
              she find it very comfortable being around him but very pressured
              when with me. She said that she knows this relationship with B will
              not last as she sees her future with me, coupled with the fact that
              B is a flirt and not serious when it comes to girls, but she just
              want to play with him until the end of the year. She told me to
              wait for her but still remain status quo and she will give up after
              she had a go at the relationship with B.</p>
              <p>I did not agree at all (would any boyfriend agree, seriously?)
              and we had another fight over this. Eventually I told her that if
              you want to be with me, you cannot be with him and vice versa. OR I
              could just tolerate and let her go with him for 3 months, but she
              must break off all contact with him afterwards. She was reluctant
              as she still wants to remain as normal friend with B, and said that
              she will never drop a friend.</p>
              <p>She flared up and told me that she wants to break up, and I
              left. That was yesterday. Today, I texted her and called up but she
              did not reply nor pick up the phone. She has made it seem like it
              is my fault but truly, she is the one at fault here. If she had
              really love me, nothing can make her sway her love. I know being
              controlling and invading her privacy is wrong, but I wasn't like
              that until the first and subsequent times that she lied to me.</p>
              <p>I am feeling downright hurt and hearbroken and all I can think
              about are the years we had spent together, how we went through
              thick and thin and all the toughest and happiest times together.
              She's all I can think of only right now, but it seems like she
              doesn't care about us anymore due to the fact that she did not
              bother to contact me since.</p>
              <p>Can anyone please advise me what to do? I feel like breaking
              down.</p>
