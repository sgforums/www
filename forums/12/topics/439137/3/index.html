              <p>My girlfriend of 5 years ended our relationship yesterday. I was
              utterly devastated and hearbroken; I cannot concentrate on my
              work.</p>
              <p>We had known each other when I was 22 and she was 20, but I
              digress.</p>
              <p>Last year August she started her first job working as a HR
              Executive and I, as a Training Executive, albeit in different
              companies. We were happy for each other. However, it turns out that
              her colleagues like to bully new staff, so she was getting quite a
              lot of stick from them, and this caused her to be very stress.</p>
              <p>She called me every night saying how much stress she is under
              and how she yearned to quit, but she held on for our sake. A few
              months after that, a new guy in another department joined the
              company and being a HR personnel, she showed him around and they
              found out that they stayed just a few blocks away from each other.
              Hence, they go to work with each other everyday as they were both
              new and needed friendship in a trying environment.</p>
              <p>She began to talk to me lesser and lesser on the phone and said
              that her friend, B, understood the environment better so it is
              easier to explain things to him. She assured me that they are just
              friends, nothing more.</p>
              <p>One day, I found out she lied to me about being at home but she
              was actually out with B. I became paranoid and started to secretly
              check her phone SMSes and call logs. I saw that he always sent her
              lovey dovey messages and they talked on the phone till 3am almost
              everyday. I confronted her and she said I invaded her privacy,
              which I admit I was wrong but she did nothing to allay my fears and
              worries.</p>
              <p>Eventually, she told me that B can text her or tell her anything
              he wants, but she will not respond to him. This goes on for the
              better part of half a year and we had some serious fights over this
              issue, but we still remained with each other. They were meeting
              more frequently and he asked her out for dinner and movies on a few
              occasions, to which she complied once. She promised to be home
              early on that day but at midnight, I received a call from her and
              she says that she will not be home early as she will watch another
              movie.</p>
              <p>Just last month we had a big fight again over this issue, and
              she mentioned to me that I was too controlling and wants to check
              up on her and do not trust her. How can I trust her anymore after
              all that she has done?</p>
              <p>Eventually yesterday, she told me that she loves me a lot, but
              she wants to go out with B for 3 months as his girlfriend because
              she find it very comfortable being around him but very pressured
              when with me. She said that she knows this relationship with B will
              not last as she sees her future with me, coupled with the fact that
              B is a flirt and not serious when it comes to girls, but she just
              want to play with him until the end of the year. She told me to
              wait for her but still remain status quo and she will give up after
              she had a go at the relationship with B.</p>
              <p>I did not agree at all (would any boyfriend agree, seriously?)
              and we had another fight over this. Eventually I told her that if
              you want to be with me, you cannot be with him and vice versa. OR I
              could just tolerate and let her go with him for 3 months, but she
              must break off all contact with him afterwards. She was reluctant
              as she still wants to remain as normal friend with B, and said that
              she will never drop a friend.</p>
              <p>She flared up and told me that she wants to break up, and I
              left. That was yesterday. Today, I texted her and called up but she
              did not reply nor pick up the phone. She has made it seem like it
              is my fault but truly, she is the one at fault here. If she had
              really love me, nothing can make her sway her love. I know being
              controlling and invading her privacy is wrong, but I wasn't like
              that until the first and subsequent times that she lied to me.</p>
              <p>I am feeling downright hurt and hearbroken and all I can think
              about are the years we had spent together, how we went through
              thick and thin and all the toughest and happiest times together.
              She's all I can think of only right now, but it seems like she
              doesn't care about us anymore due to the fact that she did not
              bother to contact me since.</p>
              <p>Can anyone please advise me what to do? I feel like breaking
              down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well when things like this happen. Just end the relationship.</p>
              <p>Obviously this girl has done nothing to deserve your trust. Nvm as a guy be tough, its her loss for not staying faithful. Dont believe her honeyed words easily like love u all lot all that.... after all shes the one who broke all that.</p>

              <p>Last year August she started her first job working as a HR Executive and I, as a Training Executive, albeit in different companies. We were happy for each other. However, it turns out that her colleagues like to bully new staff, so she was getting quite a lot of stick from them, and this caused her to be very stress.</p>
              <p>She called me every night saying how much stress she is under and how she yearned to quit, but she held on for our sake. A few months after that, a new guy in another department joined the company and being a HR personnel, she showed him around and they found out that they stayed just a few blocks away from each other. Hence, they go to work with each other everyday as they were both new and needed friendship in a trying environment.</p>
              <p>She began to talk to me lesser and lesser on the phone and said that her friend, B, understood the environment better so it is easier to explain things to him. She assured me that they are just friends, nothing more.</p>
              <p>One day, I found out she lied to me about being at home but she was actually out with B. I became paranoid and started to secretly check her phone SMSes and call logs. I saw that he always sent her lovey dovey messages and they talked on the phone till 3am almost everyday. I confronted her and she said I invaded her privacy, which I admit I was wrong but she did nothing to allay my fears and worries.</p>
              <p>Eventually, she told me that B can text her or tell her anything he wants, but she will not respond to him. This goes on for the better part of half a year and we had some serious fights over this issue, but we still remained with each other. They were meeting more frequently and he asked her out for dinner and movies on a few occasions, to which she complied once. She promised to be home early on that day but at midnight, I received a call from her and she says that she will not be home early as she will watch another movie.</p>
              <p>Just last month we had a big fight again over this issue, and she mentioned to me that I was too controlling and wants to check up on her and do not trust her. How can I trust her anymore after all that she has done?</p>
              <p>Eventually yesterday, she told me that she loves me a lot, but she wants to go out with B for 3 months as his girlfriend because she find it very comfortable being around him but very pressured when with me. She said that she knows this relationship with B will not last as she sees her future with me, coupled with the fact that B is a flirt and not serious when it comes to girls, but she just want to play with him until the end of the year. She told me to wait for her but still remain status quo and she will give up after she had a go at the relationship with B.</p>
              <p>I did not agree at all (would any boyfriend agree, seriously?) and we had another fight over this. Eventually I told her that if you want to be with me, you cannot be with him and vice versa. OR I could just tolerate and let her go with him for 3 months, but she must break off all contact with him afterwards. She was reluctant as she still wants to remain as normal friend with B, and said that she will never drop a friend.</p>
              <p>She flared up and told me that she wants to break up, and I left. That was yesterday. Today, I texted her and called up but she did not reply nor pick up the phone. She has made it seem like it is my fault but truly, she is the one at fault here. If she had really love me, nothing can make her sway her love. I know being controlling and invading her privacy is wrong, but I wasn't like that until the first and subsequent times that she lied to me.</p>
              <p>I am feeling downright hurt and hearbroken and all I can think about are the years we had spent together, how we went through thick and thin and all the toughest and happiest times together. She's all I can think of only right now, but it seems like she doesn't care about us anymore due to the fact that she did not bother to contact me since.</p>
              <p>Can anyone please advise me what to do? I feel like breaking down.</p>

              <p>Believe there will be someone else out there who is more suitable for you and much better than her.</p>
