            <div class='col-md body'>Ever since my previous relationship ended 4 years ago, my personal life all this while has been in a pathetic state of slump. Many times after work, I would feel that dÃ©jÃ  vu sense of awful loneliness as most of my colleagues have someone to meet whilst IÂ’ll just be heading home as usual. Sometimes I would bump into old classmates and see them happily shopping with their gf, whilst I would have to lie about meeting someone later when IÂ’m actually just shopping alone.  On weekends and special occasion like Xmas, everyone would have someone special to be with, everyone apart from meÂ…<br><br>IÂ’ve been asking myself quite a few times Â– <strong>just whatÂ’s wrong with my life or am I doing something wrong?</strong><br><br>Sometimes I even ponder if IÂ’ve been cursed or what?! ItÂ’s like these few years, I canÂ’t seem improve the state of my relationship life, no matter what I do.<br>Each time I see a gal I like, I would tell myself to give it a short Â– better to fail than regret not trying right. But for some inexplicable reasons, even after knowing each other for some time, she would never seem to call or sms me on her own. Even when I initiate contact, for example sms-ing her, the response is usually somewhat slow &amp; the reply short (like how u would treat someone u donÂ’t rely care about).<br>Whilst she does not detest me and we even meet up occasionally, I know I donÂ’t mean much to that her. Unless I keep on contacting on my own, I would just gradually fade away from that personÂ’s life.<br>And this kind of scenario repeats itself continuously over all the different relationships i've tried to develop these few yrs.<br><br></div>

Similarly, it has also been 4 years since my last relationship. I felt that is more of a release for me as my gf was insecure and eager to settle down that time. There was this joke that she cursed me, during the breakup, in front of me saying that no girl will ever love me and I guess it is very effective till now.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Thereafter, I took up part-time studies (masters) and subsequently embark on a professsional course....partly to upgrade myself and and also to fully utilise my time. I can guess the breakup was a blessing in disguise at that moment because it enables me to do my masters.<br><br>I can understand your loneliness because for me, aside the occassional outings with frens, I have to be at home to catch up with my studies. Worse is during weekends, one will see families having lunches and dinners and it does make one feel whether is it something wrong with oneself. Fortunately, my work is pretty stressful and I worked late so I would not have that feeling of going back on time and sulk at the prospect of not meeting my significant other.<br><br>Just to tell you dun be. The most important thing I have been telling myself is to love yourself first. Dont fret over things that you have no control of, even though it concerns with the affairs of the heart.<br><br>I am also not here to advise you to make tons of money and if a girl is seriously only interested in your money, even if she is married to you, she still can have an all gals clubbing evening and meeting with other guys (substance over form).<br><br>The only thing you can do now is to make use of the time to do what you want to do or pursue. I have ex-coursemates lamenting to me that working full time, studying part-time and raising a young family is not easy.<br><br>I understand that all the pursuit/acheivement of goals and dreams will not compensate for the loneliness/emptiness in your heart but at least these are the things that you have better control of. As some forumers might add, widening your social circles of frens is also another alternative. It can be done through taking up new courses or activities.<br><br>All the best in your pursuit of your own happiness.</div>
