What you did is technically right; the faith and belief that the relationship will go on - but not it is not important. The most important thing is that you did shape your mindset.<br><br>If he wished to end this relationship - <strong>does it matter</strong> if it was for BIG reasons or SMALL reasons? Survivability of a relationship depends on willpower and willing to keep it alive and the minute this desire is gone - so will the flame in your relationship.<br><br>P.S: Fairyland tales and TALES to be enjoyed, not to be taken seriously.
