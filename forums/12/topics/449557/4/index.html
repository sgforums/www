              <p>Thread Starter, reading some of your posts, I still can't make head or tail of the story.</p>
              <p>Just to clarify some finer points - drug consumption and drug trafficking are two different things. The former is less serious than the latter. So which one your friend/relative has committed or is being accused of?<br><br>Singaporean overseas has this repution or infamy of being taken as rich. So there is this danger of rogue Police framing or setting Singaporean up for greater crime to extract bride money! So beware!    <br><br>Caution you friend/relative when signing foreign Police statement. If possible get her to sign Police statement only in the presence of a lawyer!<br><br>What you can do is to search the net for Indonesian pro bono lawyer (lawyer for free) and contact any one to ask if he/she can handle your friend/relative case for free.</p>
              <p>I know it is a long shot but you should try! I have found one but not sure if it's willing to help:-<br><br><a href="http://www.lekslawyer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=72">http://www.lekslawyer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=72</a><br><br>What about the rich playboy? Can his family help? Try contacting him and see how the case goes!<br></p>

              <p>I dont know about Indonesia Law. But generally speaking, drug possession and consumption are not capital punishments.</p>
              <p>It is not the same as murder, rape, drug trafficking! People dont get jail sentence for so long as your friend/relative! Try your best to help her.</p>
              <p>Contact Singapore Embassy in Indonesia to see if it can assist your friend/relative. Contact some pro bono Indonesia law websites and see how it goes!<br>If you can, fly down to Indonesia and speak to the Police yourself!</p>

              <p>KK is correct...Yanling finished her JC 3 years ago and started to work after that.She will be on trial within 2 months.Just on the phone just now with my friend...Heard from him that when Yanling was 15 years old,her mother took her go temple to pray and the fortune teller told her mother that her dotter will have something good very or very bad will happen to her in her 20s and advised the mother to look after her carefully.</p>
              <p>I don't buy this stuff but it seems too much of a coincidence.</p>
