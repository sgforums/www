              <p>I believe the lawyer would advice you guys to somehow push the
                      blame to the boyfriend or share the blame with him. Chances are if
                      able to share the blame for drug possession then the punishment may
                      be able to evenly spread out between your god sis and the boyfriend
                      - ie lighter sentence. Hope your god sis have not made any clumsy
                      confessions during police interogations. Before she say anything to
                      the police - better consult lawyer or else she say somehting dumb -
                      she cannot recant her statement.</p>
              <p>Die die your sis also must come out with 80k. But make sure it
                      is right channel and money not go to conman. Or else your efforts
                      would have been in vain.</p>

              <p><br>Depends la. She can tell her lawyer that she was forced to confess under duress and torture by her prison guards. So recant statement is only hope.</p>
              <p>About the 80k issue - it is always negotiable. Normally the corrupted officials would place a ridiculous high price. It is stressful but you need to be tough negotiator.</p>
              <p>I recall watching the movie "Proof of Life" about Russell Crowe who is a hostage negotiator help to negotiate Meg Ryan's husband who was kidnapped by FARC rebels in a fictatious south american country. At first the rebels ask for $3 million then Russell Crowe negotiate for months - finally got the price down to $600k.</p>

              <p>Cheap stuff!</p>
              <p>It's very common for ransoms to be a fraction of the initial demand. But to do so, you must show difficulty in paying. Pay promptly and you will have the sum increased, or captivity prolonged. Don't show you are rich.</p>
              <p>Hope your local lawyer can be trusted. It's always locals who convey bribes eg in Msia you don't pay the driving tester directly, you pay the the driving instructor and magically you pass your test.</p>
              <p>About paying the right person, you will need to schedule payments such that both sides have motivation to continue. Eg pay x% after the first hearing, x% after the 2nd hearing, x% after release etc. Of course if you take the quick trial, you are saying you are not paying and game over. Taking the slow trial gives you time to offer and adapt.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Game over means can be 10-13 years or even life imprisonment for Yanling?She actually wants to get it and over with cos she is tired of sitting in there for the last 3 months.Sekali,she has already signed the agreement to a quick trial and we cannot do anything liao.</p>

              <p>No, courts work like this.</p>
              <p>We wanna charge you for 10 years but due to uncertainty you can get anywhere betwen 5 and 10. So if we propose you 7 and you agree, some of both sides' risk is removed and lawyer fees are saved.</p>
              <p>In drugs cases the trial is straight forward, you can easily get the max penalty for possession.</p>
              <p>Here the quick option is simply there for signalling you are not interested in negotiating a payment. They have no motive to treat you leniently otherwise it will affect their bargaining position in other people's cases.</p>
