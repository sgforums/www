              <p>I don't know if you know this. If the yanling possess more than the drug limit while consuming the drug - it is regarded as drug trafficking. I don't know the limit in Indon but let say if the limit is 30grams of drugs and she is found possessing 40mg - then she is regarded as drug trafficker.</p>
              <p>Free legal aid lawyers are hard to come by - they are inundated with paper work. So if you so happen to find one - expect a lot of delays and frustration because free legal aid lawyers are too busy to attend to your case and even if they do they appear a short while and then go to the next case.</p>

              <p>In Indonesia seems to me drug possession is more serious than murdering a so-called cult member. Last year a muslim extremist in Cikeusik, Sulawesi was sentenced only 3 months jail for repeatedly butchering a member of an islamic sect who is said to be a cult. Meanwhile an australian woman was caught with drug possession and sentenced to 10 years jail in Bali.</p>

              <p><br>Ya lor. And I am sure she will definetly go to jail for a long time if this case is blown to the media as indonesian authorities will not dare to let her off for fear that they be accused and investigated for accepting brides.</p>
              <p>(once the media knows and she is released or only given a light sentense, the speculation will be that the indonesia police, judge etc accept brides. So they lan lan also will give her a heavy sentence)</p>

              <p>It is a crime that is committed in Indon and partially committed in Sg. You will be extradited to face justice there.</p>
              <p>Eg if you are a Singaporean who prepares in Sg to commit a crime in the US, you will do jail time in the US.</p>

              <p>Wait - she got caught in a night spot rite?</p>
              <p>So how was she carrying so much drugs to be considered drug trafficking?  I mean lets say the police raided a karaoke night spot and they barge into one of the private rooms and saw that the table was full of drugs. She could have just said that she wasn't consuming them and it all belonged to her boyfriend (not hers) - she was just a spectator.</p>
              <p>I think the Indonesian police are so inefficient that they never even bother to conduct a drug test on her urine right? So they got no proof that she was consuming them. All she can just say is that she was accompanying this rich Indon bf and suddenly he took out all the drugs to consume them for himself - and she could do nothing to stop him.</p>
              <p>not unless she was caught at home with a lot of drugs in her walldrobe or somewhere.</p>
