              <p>Obviously the rich playboy is not rich enough. Either that or fucking stupid. Because I am very confident money can grease the ways in Indonesia... My friends got caught taking drugs and they managed to solve the problem and avoid jail... But now problem is your friend in jail, means more people involved, means money need alot more, damn jia lak... these kind of things must quickly resolve on the spot with the police, but now seems like more party involved. crap.</p>
              <p>to be honest, i think embassy may be best help. unless have 100k-300k to play, otherwise very hard to buy enough friends to help her case. feel damn sad for your friend. last time when i do drugs, i tip the necessary people alot, when police come, the bouncers will help delay until we go out backdoor. the bouncers roughly can guess what we're doing but they closed one eye...</p>
              <p>anyway, i just want to say drugs ruin lives... don't do it because most of the time, it will end up in regrets.</p>

              <p>The parents wants to keep the matter from the media too cos it is dirty family linen.Btw,how are the conditions in there like in the jails there?Is it very bad?Going to visit her on business trip next week...</p>

              embassy can help?
              dont you know how strict our govt is when it comes to drugs?
              the only solution to her problem is money.
              if she has none she is as good as finished.

              <p>Sorry to say - your godsis don't stand a chance. Because Singapore gahmen don't give a damn about their citizens. Unlike Australia who have their citizens remanded in Indon for drugs - the gahmen fight for the release of their citizens. So Indon gahmen bow down to their demands and lighten the sentence.</p>
              <p>But Singapore? What to do? LKY's Tough Love. Means you pay for what you reap.</p>
              <p>Drugs - don't play play.</p>
              <p>But you have my symphathies for your god sis. May god have mercy. My opinion is Indon gahmen is very harsh but nobody cares about opinion these days.</p>

              <p>But maybe there is a chance. Depending on how corrupted the Indon gahmen is. Maybe can pay a substantial "fine" then the gahmen close one eye. So as long as the Indon press and media don't make it a hoohah.</p>
              <p>I have a friend who got caught with drugs on a trip to Jamaica. She paid a substantial "fine" and spent 8 months in jail.</p>
              <p>So ask your godsis to consult her lawyer on whether if Indon gahmen can accept this "fine" or not.</p>
              <p>Again - don't play play with drugs esp when you are in South East Asia because its death sentence. If your friend play with drugs - stay far far away.</p>
              <p>I once went to Phuket with this bunch of rowdy friends. They smoke cannabis and did coccaine. I was so afraid I get caught with them. On first night i purposely lock my luggage so they won't deliberately sneak drugs into my bag. Second night i check out from hotel because I don't want to get caught with them. Few nights of pleasure could make you end up on the nooze in thailand for drugs. Mandatory death sentence.</p>

              <p>Here you have a problem. Money talks in Indonesia. If both pay enough, both can go free. But he might have already paid for his story to be believed: that the drugs are hers.</p>
              <p>If you bribe, make sure you bribe the right people. When I was in Indon every fucker with enough balls was asking for bribes, sometimes just for walking past their checkpoint. Some will ask for bribes but can/will do nothing for you.</p>
              <p>I highly doubt you can get any help from your Singapore embassy.</p>
              <p>I disagree that death is worse than Indon prison. If you can't avoid jail, save your bribes for prison officials. Pay slowly, show you are struggling to pay. Don't let them think you are rich or the bribes will increase for the rest of your life.</p>

              <p>Looks like she has to wait until 32 to taste freedom...I advised my friend to ask the parents to send 150 bucks to the jail officials to reduce her sufferings inside and also to make sure she is not ill treated in jail.Hopefully,she can restart her life at 32 after her release from jail.Her parents simply cannot afford the release money demanded from the aurhorities so bo bian let her stay inside.</p>

              <p>If your story is true - your friend has very bleak future. She has to survive prison life. Prison life is not easy - she will be constantly bullied and extorted. Since she is not a gang member - she will have no protection. She has to learn the local lingo.</p>
              <p>There is also potential prison rapes. Less for women. For men especially those white collar criminals always get raped because prison are full of sex offenders. So watch out for lesbians.</p>
              <p>Better ask your friend to get some tough tatoos before she go inside prison. This is to make her look more tough and ugly. If she look soft -she will be bullied.</p>
              <p>Also Indon prisons are very uncomfortable. Matresses are almost non existence. Bathing water is dirty. Prison food is unhygiene.</p>
              <p>By the time she come out from prison - she will find it tough to seek job in singapore since she was an ex convict.</p>

              <p>obsessed by drugs until overstayed for 6 mths, she under estimated the power of cocaine, it's not classified as class 'A" for no reason..... i suppose her health is in bad shape, especially her liver condition, i suggest seek help from our embassy to have her sentence and jail in sg instead of indo, i believe the 'changi resort'  living condition, health care, and security are much better than indo, her parents can visit her more often too. </p>

              <p>She is already in jail...How to go out get tattooed?Heard from the Indo friend who is helping my friend to visit her in Indo that she got slapped and beaten by the cell IC for not understanding her instructions.She shared her cell with 7 others in an all Indo cell.She believes there are lesbians among them.I did not know there are lesbians there....</p>

              <p>The female prisoner is a Chinese Singaporean girl.We shall call her Yanling in case anyone is confused.She is a petite ordinary Chinese girl.She complained that to her Indo friend who visited her that she needed medicine for her sores on her ankles and wrists which were shackled and handcuffed to make sure she does not escape when she is out of her cell cos she had already tried to escape when taken out for questioning at the police station to look for the rich Indo playboy a few months ago.Her friend then brought some medication to the warden so that she could pass it to Yanling.My friend's biggest worry is that she might be transferred to a ulu prison island in some far flung corner of Indo or the worst...getting raped by the lesbians inside.So I will be bringing some clothing,smokes and dry food when I fly over.</p>
              <p>The authorities demanded 80k for her release but the parents simply have no means to raise the money.</p>
