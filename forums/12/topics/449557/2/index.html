              <p>The negotiating people said the most can cut is 10k off the original quotation...70k.</p>
              <p>Yanling's parents don't even have money in their pockets as most of their savings are used for medical bills as they have heart problems and diabetes.They are just small time hawkers in the market.So they also sort of given up as they knew they would not be able to raise the cash.</p>
              <p>Yanling herself signed the confession at the police station and now remanded in a maximum security jail while awaiting trial.Will be around 6 months before her trials.</p>
              <p>When she was there for the first week,she was thrown into the single cell for making trouble for the wardens with legs shackled and handcuffed for the 1st 3 days and after the first week,she was transferred her present cell.</p>

              <p>They started with 80k because she was arrested with a rich guy who got out. They think she is rich. Plus if he paid to blame her, harder to change his story back.</p>

              <p>I don't know the sentencing guidelines. Sentence range depends on the severity of charge, actual sentence depends on degree of responsibility. Obviously a grey area and some people can exploit this.</p>
              <p>She has to worry about the guard's advances too.</p>
              <p>Going to media is not a good idea. When a foreigner case is widely known, the sentence is higher. Publicizing in Sg does nothing for you. Instead ask what Sg consulate can do to help in any small way.</p>
              <p>Above all don't look rich. Price increase plus if she has no family support, when the payments stop she suffers. In a place like that, even having a regular supply of a basic need from your family makes you look rich. She has to bear with it. Also put on a brave front, cos which convict or guard won't like to bully a rich and spoilt person? Hope someone tells her all this when someone visits her.</p>

              <p>If she is being held in a women's jail,then she would be much safer.Won't have to worry about getting being raped.</p>

              <p>But forget about it...Yanling's parents can't raise that kind of crazy money.She has to be prepared to lead a very hard life and grow in the process when she is in prison.</p>

              <p>Yeah,like what I told my friend just now on the phone...Yanling better get prepared for the hardships ahead cos she is not gonna get much help from outside.She is considering the offer from the authorities of a quick trial which she can be sentenced as fast as a month.</p>
              <p>Advantage is maybe,the time spent in remand maybe counted in the sentence...She has up to Mon to respond to their offer.If she decides to wait until Sep,the sentence may be harsher up to even life imprisonment.</p>

              <p>Very simple, when they asks for $80k, it means money can solve the problem, very good. That's a good start. So we know they want money, that's their objective. If she go to prison, they don't get a single cent, problem for them, but if they let her go, they have money (to be negotiated) to buy house in Indonesia, even $10k is alot of money. So we can have a final offer, let them know with certainty if they want their objective to be met (money), then that's it, otherwise it's a lose-lose situation.</p>
              <p>I'm sure they are common sense people. Right now they knew they had a big fish in their hands, and they want to sell for more money, it's very common sense. On your side, you need to let them know either the fish will sell for this amount which you can afford, or they don't get a single cent, let them think. If you put yourself in their shoes, you know which option you want also.</p>

              <p>I believe the lawyer would advice you guys to somehow push the blame to the boyfriend or share the blame with him. Chances are if able to share the blame for drug possession then the punishment may be able to evenly spread out between your god sis and the boyfriend - ie lighter sentence. Hope your god sis have not made any clumsy confessions during police interogations. Before she say anything to the police - better consult lawyer or else she say somehting dumb - she cannot recant her statement.</p>
              <p>Die die your sis also must come out with 80k. But make sure it is right channel and money not go to conman. Or else your efforts would have been in vain.</p>
