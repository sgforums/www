            <div class='col-md body'>I have learnt the hard way that the only person u can depend on is urself. So build up that person inside u. Make it strong such that u can depend on it alone. Of course I have frens, but what's really the definition of frens? Give ur so called close frens a stronger reason to leave u, betray u n they will. It's only human...<br><br>So who can u trust then? Urself... Unfortunately, many pple live their lives dependant on frens n how pple see them. Be smart, be pragmatic. Depend on urself, n dun bother running away. U have no money...
