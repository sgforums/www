I had known pretty sexy girls before, of course i were attracted to them initially, which guys wouldn't? But after getting to know them, i realised their attitude suxx and posessed rotten personality. The pretty exterior is only an empty shell inside.<br><br>Likewise i had known fat and ugly girls, you-see-them-you-wanted-to-avoid- types (no pun intended). If you give yourself a chance to get to know them well, they can be just as pretty on the inside.<br><br>Would you go out with a pretty sexy girl that bore you to death? Or a fat and ugly girl that is fun loving and cheer you up?</div>
