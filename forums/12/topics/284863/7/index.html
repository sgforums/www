            <div class='col-md body'>I feel sorry for you Andrew.<br><br>I left my ex girlfriend a year back when i realized that i couldn't trust her anymore. Even though we were together for a year, the relationship was peppered with problems like strange sms-es and sudden early nights. Also there were always guys around her that sends her lewd messages. One thing i never had was evidence that she was actually cheating.<br><br>The bottom line was i couldn't trust someone i could possibly spend the rest of my life with. it's going to hurt when you leave, but things will not get better if you stay in such a relationship. It only gets worse.<br><br>Here's the truth. It doesn't matter if she really loves you or not. it's about how you can live with the suspicion that when you are not around her, she is in someone else's bed. If you can live with this, hey... by all means stay in a relationship with her. Just don't expect it to be a monogamous relationship. it gives you the "license" to screw.<br><br>All those things about how women operate differently from men are really a whole lot of bs. They are just like us men. Some faithful, many fickled. None of us here can say we never set eyes on someone else. It falls upon our own discipline to stay faithful.<br><br>Whatever your decision, don't let it be out of "love". All the best. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>oh and btw, a P.S:<br><br>in a divorce, a woman is entitled to half of your total assets. Getting a lawyer to prove to the court she ain't worth it will probably still cost you half of your assets.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>andrew you should be really happy that u are only like less then 2 years into the relationship. You did not lose too much time. If be much worst if u both are married / have kids ... etc ...<br><br>if you love her enough to want to salvage the relationship at this point .. you should also love her enough to let her go and be happy doing what she does. If she returns the bond be stronger otherwise ... i cannot think of any logically possible outcome.<br><br>is it the pain of a 2 years effort VS a 2 months fling. You did not lose everything ... you gained experience ... with it comes better success. I think u shld be under 25, theres still a long way to go. Look forward to living life for yourself, u deserved better.</div>
