But when you place the frog into a pool of water and gradually heat the water, the frog will slowly boil itself to death without escaping. This is the frog theory of karmic relationship - of both first and third person perspective. Boundary regression is triggered until a point of maximum stretch length before it snaps like a wooden ruler - in karmic relationship, that result often signifies a partial payment of cosmic debt (CloUdiSm - Yunhaier). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers         </div></blockquote>very chim, dont understand..</div>
