            <div class='col-md body'>my gf has been in her new job for 2 months now. and i suspect she is having an affair and cheating behind my back.<br><br>history: we have known each other for 2years+ and have been together for 1yr+. she started in this new job for 2months already and i started noticing that she has sorta been distancing in the things we talk about and in the schedule of her daily life. so for the past 2 months i trusted her and spent time with her as usual. there was a period of 2weeks where i was super busy and couldnt meet up with her, she didnt even call OR sms me unless i initiated it. i felt we were drifting apart.<br><br>she had a history of lying to me about things previous, small matters, white lies in her own words.<br><br>but yesterday i guessed her email password and managed to get in.<br><br>she has been having a private correspondence with a guy in office, chatting over email, 100s a day.<br><br>as i started prying deeper.<br><br>they had sex on many ocassions. (i recalled and on those days she said she was tired and slept as early as 9pm)<br><br>their conversations were explicit. detailed.<br><br>he asked her if they were dating. she said yes. (inside i was hurting)<br><br>they flirted with each other. courted each other. called each other nick names. stole kisses and groped each other when no colleages were around.<br><br>my god i was hurt. and am still hurting so bad.<br><br>i felt i needed to confront them. but am afraid of losing this relationship...<br><br>how should i go about this??<br><br>depressed.distressed.dejected.<br><br>the hardest part is to hold a forced smile when i see her. sigh.<br><br>we had plans to get married next year. we had so many plans. but she couldnt even resist this simple temptation. while i have been holding on ever SO staunchly to this rs. sigh. he was in the right place. at the right time. i guess that was stronger than the 2years of bond we have built.<br><br>many times she said he was just a colleague, one that gives her a lift to work everyday. i cant. cos i live too far. on the other end of the island.<br><br>he sends her home everyday too. sometimes they head to the beach afterwork. sometimes they go back to their place. and coincidentally her last sms to me would be "fone low bat, ttyl!".<br><br>and the emails on the next day would be full of explicit details. which i shall spare you guys of.<br><br>we had promised each other to a monogamous relationship. but now that i cant even believe her words, what is there left?<br><br>please help me salvage us...<br><br></div>
