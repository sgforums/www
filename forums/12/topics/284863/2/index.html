Ask her what does she want. Does she love you? If she says yes, then ask her why is she hurting you if she does.<br><br>Ask her if she still wants to carry on with the relationship and that despite her cheating on you, you are still willing to give the relationship another chance if she is willing to salvage it and work with you and not see the guy again.<br><br>I know it is difficult if he is a colleague. Maybe get her to change her jobs if possible to start afresh.<br><br>Listen to her point of view. Talk calmly like adults. Maybe let her know if you were to switch roles, it is likely that she will never forgive you.<br><br>I think it is really up to you and the both of you will really need to work hard on the relationship to salvage it and to ensure this won't happen again.<br><br>If she can't promise you that she will put in the effort to make things right and not repeat her mistake, I suggest that you move on with your life.<br><br>Also you need to confirm if she had sex with him<br>And if she did, can you live with it?

(i recalled and on those days she said she was tired and slept as early as 9pm)<br><br>their conversations were explicit. detailed.<br><br>he asked her if they were dating. she said yes. (inside i was hurting)<br><br>they flirted with each other. courted each other. called each other nick names. stole kisses and groped each other when no colleages were around.<br><br>my god i was hurt. and am still hurting so bad.<br><br>i felt i needed to confront them. <span style="color: red;">but am afraid of losing this relationship...</span><br><br>how should i go about this??<br><br>depressed.distressed.dejected.<br><br>the hardest part is to hold a forced smile when i see her. sigh.<br><br>we had plans to get married next year. we had so many plans. but she couldnt even resist this simple temptation. while i have been holding on ever SO staunchly to this rs. sigh. he was in the right place. at the right time. i guess that was stronger than the 2years of bond we have built.<br><br>many times she said he was just a colleague, one that gives her a lift to work everyday. i cant. cos i live too far. on the other end of the island.<br><br>he sends her home everyday too. sometimes they head to the beach afterwork. sometimes they go back to their place. and coincidentally her last sms to me would be "fone low bat, ttyl!".<br><br>and the emails on the next day would be full of explicit details. which i shall spare you guys of.<br><br>we had promised each other to a monogamous relationship. but now that i cant even believe her words, what is there left?<br><br>please help me salvage us...<br><br></div></blockquote>Why u wanted to hang on this r/s? Only one thing to do. Abandon ship!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I give you the best solution. 1st, give her a lot of empty promises. After that, have sex with her. Take pictures and videos of the whole sex things. Dump her after that, told her that you are getting bored with the relationship and having enough fun already. Go to www.laksa.org and upload the pictures and videos as revenge. Just remember to censor your face only.<br><br>You don't have to feel guilty, she cheats you in the worst possible way, you can do that also.

            <div class='col-md body'>it is just a fling, true.. after this guy, she will move on to the next. it will be endless. leave her! do not give in to her. it will only make her feel that she is indispensible and will hurt you time and again. do not even think one day she will come back to you. i think she treats you as an reserve. she still wants fun now. she is so selfish. she thinks that she still has value outside, thus the flirting. if one day she found herself no value(nobody flirts with her, but i doubt that, cos guys are always guys), then she will come back to you.<br><br>do not even think that marriage can bind her to you. it only make her think you do not dare to leave her, and thus result more serious damages. think of these.. if you should really get married, and she initiated breakup, and you beg her to stay, this is one good story she can show off to her friends and her fllings!!<br><br>sorry if i think too far ahead. but anything can happen. so just let your heart pain for a while, rather than make things irreversible in the future. since she doesnt care about you now, what makes you think she will care about your feeling in the future??</div>
