            <div class='col-md body'>hi andrew, when I read what you have written , I'm close to tears, because it really makes me to think back what happened to me 3 years back. My ex was doing lots of things behind my back and I caugt her red handed with that guy (long story, do not wish to say more). I just did'nt understand, how come she will do such a thing, in the end, we ended a 5 year relationship . I'm not sure if she was sad or anything like that. but one thing for sure is I still feel the pain now after 3 years .I can really understand how you feel now.<br>My advice is think carefully before do anything , and NEVER make a decision in a rush or u may regret it.Try keeping yourself busy and do not think so much of unnecessary things.<br><br>Take care<br>/<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Relationship problems have always been on the top 3 list of problems for many. Money and family being the other two.<br><br>It is mind wrenching indeed to have a loved one betray you.<br><br>Andrew, you are in so much pain now that you may not be able to see the entire picture with clarity. Let me help you along, if I may.<br><br>1) Isn't it a blessing now that you have seen here true colours? That she is a human being who's fickle minded and succumbs to lust. If someone can forsake a loved one for another so easily, then what good is there in keeping such a person by your side? She will repeat this vicious cycle on her new squeeze.<br><br>2) No matter what you have done for her, she doesn't owe you anything. This is her life, she is free to do as she pleases.<br><br>3) If a bird wishes to fly out of a cage, would you hinder it? If a dolphin longs for the ocean, would you entrap it in the aquarium? If her heart is no longer with you, it is no longer with you. Do not pine for fairy tale endings or miracles of whatsoever sort.<br><br>Unless you choose to be the love fool that you are now, there is little anyone can do to help you.<br><br>My $0.02 worth.</div>
