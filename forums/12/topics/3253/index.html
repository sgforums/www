            <div class='col-md body'>but c-riously speaking, for me, i do sometimes get tired of being happy.<br>not in the sense of being forcefully happy, but really happy. like for eg, i've been enjoying life, having fun, going out with frenz everyday, going chalets, den suddenly, i'd feel tired. not as in physically, but mentally/emotionally. physically, i'd feel hyper. really hyper. if i stayed at home, i'd wear my family membrs out kind of hyper. but emotionally, i'm tired of having fun, and tired of being happy. at these times, i always feel the need to cry. call me a cry baby if u will, but i just need to release some air........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that no one can always be happy, but we can always try to be happy. Even myself, I  think I have been good in keeping myself happy. it's true that u wun get to solve things when u have a long face. but the thing is no one can evade it. we will haf a long face when faced wif a lot problems at hand. But if we were to think or ways to solve the problem as soon as possible, we will be able to be happy earlier.. then we wun have such a  long face to show others. that's wta I do. Normally I will try to solve the prob, or think of solutions to which I think will be enuff to prob. then after that I will more relieve and be able to bring in the sunshine<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

Do so much also doesn't gain anything. In worst cases, take us for granted...<br><br>But I believe like wat u have mentioned, personal satisfaction. It's feeling that we get when pple walk away feeling happy. It's a feeling felt in our hearts. Pple may not remember us, but we are happy becoz we have helped. Even they took us for granted, they cheated our feelings, we still choose to help others, but to be more aware of the pple.
