              <p>ok u see i have this dream when im asleep... though i prefer to call 
              that as a nightmare =x. Well anyway, about this dream im having.... I 
              was stranded on this empty land. I was walking aimlessly passing by 
              couple of dead trees and strangely, tombstones. i dont know the names 
              when i read those tombstones.. all of them. If i can recall, i think i 
              was crying. Everywhere i go, no one was at my sight.... no one at all. I
               have no idea whats going on but it is really creepy. The sky was dark 
              blue in color and some parts of it is in orange color. </p>
              <p><br>Then i
               saw this huge tall tombstone at the distance but not that far. I ran to
               that location but on my way there, sky is getting darker and darker 
              like its going to rain and it is getting more foggy. When i reach to 
              that tombstone, there is this text.... YES, i do remember what does it 
              said.</p>
              <p>"So alone then, last of my kind in the world I believed futures could be reborn I would go back in time Change what is to come"</p>
              <p>Then
               earthquakes started, meteor came down. I was freaking panic but i just 
              stood there. There is this orange color in a circular form in the sky 
              above me. After that, i woke up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the funny thing is 
              that i dream this twice now. YES YES I KNOW... its not believable but i 
              know what im saying here =_= .. no use bluffing. Its up to u guys if u 
              really believe me or not lol. I just want to said it out here... my 
              friends think im crazy. Really.. really scares me. It is like the world... is going to be like this... in the future or something.</p>

              <p>your dream seems to suggest that you have lost something or have given up on something recently which you feel sad about, and which you wish you didnt lose it...</p>
              <p>you should try to work on your emotions arising from this loss, or get over the grief</p>

              <p>let me tell you my dream</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>I was in this shopping mall in a resort. A kid came and challenge me on who has the biggest penknife. I show him mine and he look quite angry. Then the kid told the police I was carrying an offensive weapon. Somehow magically I was able to move the penknife to my shoes. I was free to go and again the kid look ANGRY.<br>The kid seems to know my powers and told another policeman that I am hiding a penknife in my shoes. Again, I panic and use my powers to move it to my pocket. I got careless and the policeman spotted it. My penknife was taken in exchange for his smaller penknife.<br>Enraged, I ran up to the boy and slash his throat. Shortly after that I was shot and killed.<br>Then I saw a purple portal sucking me in. I escape because I know its the portal to rebirth. When I look down, I saw a murder scene with a chalk-drawn body shape.<br>Then I wrote on the floor "I will not forgive anyone"<br>I begin smashing plates and glass that people freak out to point an "cleansing" of the place was called. I black out.<br>Then I woke up</p>
