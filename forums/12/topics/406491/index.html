At the point of time he could not take it and cold to her . The guy is feeling terrible eventually he makes the girl break with him because he did not want to break because he do not want to hurt her, he really love her alot more than anything else. When they break le, the guy friend go and console her and eventually in 1 week she and his friend get together and they date for 1 week and the girl let the guy did it and the guy after doing break with her.

But unfortunely the girl said " you are too late " . when the guy saw the reply he really heart broken till he just want death. So he decided to leave her once again but this time did not delete her but just never talked again. He really loved her alot till 2009 which is 4 past he still have not given up on her.

              <p>love is just just a part of life, study and working for your future is more important,</p>
              <p>no money = no house = no food = no gf. ( to get what I mean try working for your money instead of asking for your parents.</p>
              <p>sometimes letting go of someone is good for both side. It shows that you respect her and giving yourself some respect instead of begging for her to return.  No point pushing and pushing until the gal is so upset that she gives up on everything</p>
              <p>If i read the story correct the guy is very worried that he will lose the gal again due to past experience and will grip the gf more toughly..</p>
              <p>My advice is to explain to the gf that he understands that she needs time to think it over and gives her a week to think about it. He should respect her decison after she had made her choice. I know is tough for the guy cos I have experience it myself first hand the pain of waiting and the despair of losing the gal but if he truly loves the gal he should always respect her decision.</p>
              <p>Forcing her to make a choice now will only ends up in negative answers, which I myself went through many times in order to learn it the hard way that is better to get people time to think it over.</p>
              <p>So give her some time.. ;)</p>

              <p>Is the girl the same person or two seperate girls ? Sometimes in life, its not just about the girls. If that girl suddenly change her attitude without any warning. She is as childish as hell. Find another girl then. Dont fall too deep into it unless she loves you as much as you do.</p>
              <p>Some girls are like that, sad to say, you met the wrong one. Tui yi bu hai kuo tian kong. The more you want it, the more miserable you get.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Long ago... in 2005, On a teacher day he contacted afew of his friends to go back his primary school to see the teacher. On the way back home he saw some other friends at the coffee shop outside the school which studied in the same primary school. They asked him to come and chat together so he went on. He chat alot of them and finally before partialling he exchanged msn with them.</p>
              <p>So he went home happily and added them on msn. There a girl which is his primary school friend started talking to him everyday on msn. Soon the have a chemistry they meet up more often to accompany each other. They really have alot of fun. But soon after 1 month-2months of happy moments, the guy found out that she actually have alot of ex before him and he also found out she aready did it with other guys. At the point of time he could not take it and cold to her . The guy is feeling terrible eventually he makes the girl break with him because he did not want to break because he do not want to hurt her, he really love her alot more than anything else. When they break le, the guy friend go and console her and eventually in 1 week she and his friend get together and they date for 1 week and the girl let the guy did it and the guy after doing break with her. [All these happens in the holiday the guy did not know untill school reopen]</p>
              <p>When school reopened in year 2006, he heard of him boosting around in class that he fucked his ex, at the point of time he was really sad and angry with guilty. After school on the day he know about this, he went home and asked her about that if its true. The girl told him yes. His heart break down immediately and the guy is suffering from minal depression, the guy have thoughts of comit sucide and stuffs, but he did not do silly stuffs in the end.</p>
              <p>He deleted her msn and hp no. not to contact with her anymore. He did not talk to her for the 1 whole year and while in the year of alone he kept thinking of it and finally he came of a decision that all these are the past, if he really love her why do he need to care so much about it, so he decided to added her back and told her how much he love him and want to be with her again. But unfortunely the girl said " you are too late " . when the guy saw the reply he really heart broken till he just want death. So he decided to leave her once again but this time did not delete her but just never talked again. He really loved her alot till 2009 which is 4 past he still have not given up on her. He had all the guilty in him he could never forgive himself because if he did not break then all these won't happened on her everyday he living in a world of blur day. His world no longer have a smile anymore. He could no longer shows the natural smile which people has, in school he has to act as crazy as possible so that people wont suspect anything for the whole 4 years. She taught him how to love and cherish someone before its gone.</p>
              <p>In 2009 the guy came to poly and he found a girl that is also good. He tried to pursue her and also give himself a chance to start a new relationship. And in 2010 afew days after valentine day the girl he like accepted him. He told her about his past, she say she wont mind, he feel happy and sweet memories came in till yestarday 26/7/2010</p>
              <p>[ He is with her for 5months+ le although sometimes they quarrel but in the end will get back to normal]</p>
              <p>Yestarday morning school was fine, they are happy together but the terrible thing came in at nite when the guy talked to her she give him a attitute when the guy ask him why like this , she said dunno . So the guy give her sometime to cool down and after tat he talked to her again, she said sry about jus now then the guy replied things aready happened , nevermind. she did not give any reply after that. She post on her tweeter that she always make him sad than the guilty keep haunting her, she want to break but the guy dun let cos the guy dun1  to lose her again. [ The guy changed alot for her like attitute and temper ] He dun wish to step in another nightmare again , his afraid but he dunno wat to do all he could do is juz smoke and drink everyday. She told him that they will talk today about the matter.</p>
              <p>So Today has come when she enter the class he rush over and ask her to talk about it then she said talk after school, so the guy wait till school is finish which is around 4+ but once school finished the girl rushed off and when he smsed her she said she went home le, then he was depressed and asked her thought she said that to talk today. She then replied talk another day. The guy wish to cry out but he could not cause his friend is with him. The guy just tried talking to her on msn again but she did not want to reply at all. Please tell him what to do ? anyone?</p>

              <p><br>I would advise The Guy to withdraw his focus on The Girl until The Girl needed his focus on her.</p>
              <p>Nobody can force another person to love and since there is no reason for anyone to be together and fall in love with each other in the first place, then there is certainly no reason for them to be exclusive to each other only.</p>
              <p>If either one decided to leave for good, it's always better to let them go even if you do not have the capacity to wish them well.</p>
              <p>There is no reason for people to come together and certainly do not require any reason for them to leave each other.</p>
              <p>Just need to find the right person for themselves and it doesn't means relationships are meant to be forever.</p>
              <p>People in relationships takes it too easy upon themselves because of their naive thinking that their relationships is going to stick with them forever, nothing is forever except for DIAMONDS.</p>
