I'm not generalising on those seeking advices i'll avoid. But i'm particularly address on those who actually enjoys repeat their sad plight again and again.<br>All i can say is, if i have the capacity to listen and walk with them, i will.<br>it's the counseller who didn't get to the root of their problem or they themselves didn't want the counsellers to know?<br>Like you've said in the last para. REAL problem isn't presented simply because they don't get honest.<br>Counsellers do not hold counsellees by the neck and demand honesty.<br>Neither do counsellees owe counsellers any explaination.<br><br>My conclusion:<br><span style="color: red;">WE are talking about a specific class of people who have the tendency to repeat their mistakes.</span><br>If they truly want to have a listening ear. I'm glad to listen, but if i'm a friend. I'd definately voice out what i see and address the problem with a bigger mental picture, allows the person to have second person view and take different routes from there.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Counsellers can get to the root problem and advise on it. But solving it depends on Counsellee's decision.<br>(Good Will Hunting)<br><br>If he/she wants to share, then make sure he/she doesn't in anyway disrespect the listener by hidding certain important or real reasons behind the existing problems. It is an insult to the listener(personally i feel so)<br>They don't owe me any honesty....but i also don't owe them a listening ear and my time.<br>So if i'm willing to listen, the person better be honest with me, i can smell lacking details very quickly.<br><br>Lastly, they COULD have liked the way they are subconsciously.<br>-They like being in the problem yet hate it.<br>-They like to tell people their sad incident.<br>-They like to create self pity<br><br>No matter what happens or how good the advise is, like what SunriSe replied. One day they'll change.<br><br>Hope you see my perspective.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's very important to have someone there to talk. I'm not refering to people on the other extreme.My colleague has been entertaining her fren who keeps repeating her problems for years...and that will rener profssional help.<br><br>It is normal for people in distress to talk and repeat their probs..because they can't accept the truth, they want to dissect the prob and find out what went wrong...it may take weeks, months...mayb even years for them to stop repeating.. but one thing for sure, the freq will decrease as time passes..<br><br>It is horrible if one can't find anyone to talk to.The hotlines.. some were engaged, some require face-face, appointment cum moneybasis.. and SOS seems to be more for suicidal case...<br>Everyting comes with a price..even advice<br><br>No one owes anyone listening ears or advice, but it will always sound sweet to a depressed person if there is even one person who is willing to listen and genuinely wished for the person to be happy again, be it frens or strangers<br><br>It gives that person strength and the warm feeling that someone still wants to know about hm/her and their stories..that someone still cares.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They just want the <strong>feel </strong>of having someone listening to them. This is a solution in itself. After they let off everything, they would calm down and think more rationally and start resolving them. Not sexist here, but i think girls tend to be in this category.<br><br>Some would just come to you for quick solutions and before you can complete your words, they probably starting think of solutions and asking you; can it be solved this way, can it be done like that. Guys tend to fix in here.<br><br>However, all those who come to you regard you as a friend and trust you. Be a friend to them. Who knows, you may go to them for the same reasons next time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reassurance. In my opinion, i feel they need a pillar of strength and words of encouragement to reassure themselves. A channel for them to pour out their sorrows and frustrations. Letting off steam. That way, it'll make them feel better than bottling their feelings.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>perhaps they are not helpful is because the books tend to generalise, which strictly speaking is not entirely bad; but it does trap the unwary reader.<br><br>ultimately one has to realise that they are dealing with an individual, not some standard robot that came out of the factory;<br>therefore communication is the only way to know the other party, not some books telling you your friend's personality.<br><br>it is this whole thing on communication that these books usually lack and rightly so, since the topic (and its associated topics) is just too big to fit into one book.<br>most of the time, books provide the basic information, the rest is usually up to the reader though.<br><br>listening skills, developing your self-awareness, honesty and lying, social interaction theories are some stuff that are useful to know. no doubt i have missed out some important stuff that i dont know about, but i think these are good places to start from.<br>asking yourself why you talk to the people you do is an interesting way to start and so is asking close friends why they talk to you :-)<br></div>
