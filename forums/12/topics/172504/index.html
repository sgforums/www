I do noe of a few gals who are like that...<br><br>But do not ask her whether she does to other guys as well at this stage. I noe it disturbs you because I have personally been through this before. Asking such a question directly may cause her to feel insulted, no kidding. Perhaps when you two become closer you can hint to her that she should not be too 'friendly' to other guys to avoid giving them the wrong idea. BUT that is only when you two get closer.<br><br>Talking to gals is an intricate art. Hold the brush too tightly and the beautiful painting will be ruined. A relaxed, nonchalant hold on the brush will result in the creation of a beautiful masterpiece.<br><br>Cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Because to some people, being in a r/s officially means a lot more work needs to be done, and of course there is that commitment issue. By telling you that she does not want to be in a r/s, she would be able to be close to you but still has a certain level of freedom.<br><br>Or maybe she just needs more time before deciding that you are the one she wants to be with.
