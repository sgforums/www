It's lasting till today because of both(?) parties' effort to maintain it and keep it intact... But as it's going... It's not hard to notice that there're much 'heat' and 'friction'...<br><br>And yup.. Such are pretty much common in a normal relationship... But there're usually 2 general modes of handling them.<br><br>1. Keeping them IN HOLD.<br>2. OVERCOMING them.<br><br>There're quite a couple of ways in which method (1) can be achieved... Sometimes through 'love' as a lubricant... Sometimes through being more forgiving and understanding... Depending on the matter involved, sometimes things can come back.. Or they might not...<br><br>Method (2) which is usually the more effective method (for more serious problems in a relationship)... In saying 'serious problems', I'm referring to matters of utmost importance to either (or both) individual(s) or problems which are quite persistent in reoccurance (i.e. character clashes, objective / goal clashes in life, difference in beliefs.. etc.) Although the more effective method, it's usually also the more 'painful' one. It involves much CHANGES, especially in a person's perspective of things. It usually won't happen unless much initiated or 'forced' to. And 'forced' situations are usually much more painful... Not to mention that things are probably already on the edge of falling...<br><br>What you'll need to know (and hopefully let your bf know?). Having and imposing such restrictions ain't gonna work on the long run. Unless both of you intend to go into isolation and be separated from the rest of the world? Or something like that...?<br><br>Let him understand that, IF he really LOVES you and CARE about this relationship of yours with him.. It's not about him giving in to you. It's about HOW to make this relationship WORK on the LONG RUN. So that both of you could enjoy your own life as much as you can enjoy this relationship together.<br><br>REMEMBER this. A HEALTHY relationship is as much as about 2 HEALTHY individuals. And if one party cannot be who he / she is suppose to, it's VERY UNLIKELY that he / she would be a happy healthy person. So can forget about the HAPPY HEALTHY relationship too. As long as both parties can be satisfied with his / her own life and yet not step overboard to cross extreme lines. Only then would there be HOPE for a BRIGHTER relationship together.<br><br>RESPECT, TRUST and UNDERSTANDING.<br><br>I wish you LUCK.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
