              <p>It is only going to worsen the problem, rather than cure it. :( </p>
              <p>well, I am trying to rid my mind off this "devil" through focusing on doing (acceptable) men's stuff (such as jogging and watching soccer matches) and doing other things, such as thinking of what story to write to make a film of around 10 minutes.</p>
              <p>Silk shirt? How does it help?</p>
              <p>Of course, I will continue to control myself, and not keep thinking of all these nonsense.</p>
              <p>maybe it is because I am too free nowadays. that's why I keep thinking of these nonsense.</p>

              <p>By the way,<strong> I am currently 17 years old </strong>(turning 18 in a few months' time).</p>
              <p>So, there may be some "adult terms" that I do not understand. </p>
              <p>I am sorry for not including my age in the first post of this thread.</p>
              <p>As I mentioned yesterday, I think this is only because I am too free nowadays, which is why I keep thinking of all these nonsense.</p>
              <p>I foresee I will become more busy, when school starts again soon.</p>
              <p>By then, I am sure I will no longer think of such nonsense and the problem would be solved.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your lovely suggestions to help me overcome this problem. I will continue to make the effort to control down and become normal again. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>By ELANA CHONG<br></strong>COURT CORRESPONDENT</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">HE WAS 17 when he raped his eight-year-old cousin on three occasions at a staircase landing of a Housing Board block 14 years ago.</p>
              <p>   The girl kept quiet about it for more than a decade, and in 2011, she finally decided to make a police report against him.</p>
              <p>   Yesterday, the long arm of the law caught up with the former deliveryman, now 31, who admitted to one charge of raping the girl.</p>
              <p>   The offence carries a penalty of up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning. Both parties cannot be named due to a gag order.</p>
              <p>   Assistant Public Prosecutor Dillon Kok said the victim was seven when she went in 1998 to live with the accused, her aunt and uncle because her parents were going through a divorce.</p>
              <p>   In 1999, the accused was waiting to be called up for national service when he became addicted to pornographic VCDs.</p>
              <p>   On one occasion, he and the girl went to buy food from a nearby store in mid-1999.</p>
              <p>   They were in a lift on their way home when the accused recalled sex scenes he had seen and wanted to try having sex.</p>
              <p>   He took her to the staircase landing but dropped the idea after a passer-by walked past.</p>
              <p>   About a week later, he again took her to the staircase landing, where he raped her. He warned her not to tell anyone. He raped her on two other occasions the same year.</p>
              <p>   The accused will be sentenced next Wednesday, with the two other charges of rape taken into consideration.</p>
              <p>   The girl is one of the youngest rape victims here.</p>
              <p>   Three years ago, a 42-year-old man was jailed for 11 years and given 16 strokes of the cane for raping his daughter in 2005 when she was seven.</p>
              <p>   In 2008, a 41-year-old man was given 17 years' jail and 14 strokes of the cane for raping his three-year-old daughter.</p>
              <p>   Mr Kok argued for a jail term of at least six years and caning.</p>
              <p>   He highlighted the victim's young age at the time, and how the accused had abused his position of trust and authority and acted audaciously.</p>
              <p>   The victim had lost her chastity to an act of rape and coped by "choosing to ignore that it happened", Mr Kok told the court.</p>
              <p>   Even though the crime took place 14 years ago, he said "the passage of time does not diminish the seriousness of the offence".</p>
