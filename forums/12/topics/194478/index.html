            <div class='col-md body'>My friend used to work for this company in Toa Payoh. Lets call this company C1. She work there for less than 3 months. During that 3 months which the company call orientation month, she was told that she can quit at any time during that time. But if she continues, she will be required to serve the bond (a private registered company having a bond!!!??) of 2 years. If they quit within that 2 years, the company got the rights to seek payment as compensation from the employee who quit (WTF!).<br><br>However, for my friend case, she quit on her 2nd month, so its during the orientation period. She she gave the company her letter of resignation on the first week of April (two weeks notice as per normal before resigning). 2 weeks later, she quit C1.<br><br>But a few days back, a letter was sent to her home mailbox dated 5th of June asking her to pay up $3xxx as compensation to C1 for the training they sent her during her stay in C1!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>She asked her friend to send her a copy of the 'contract' and in the contract, it say 'the Company have the rights to seek compensation from employee who quit during the 2 year bond.. blablabla..'. No lines in that contract ever mention anything about the 3 months orientation period!<br><br>So why did C1 ask for payment when they said earlier verbally that the first 3 months will be a so called orientation period when in the contract is stated differently??<br><br>And is the letter received still valid as the date is dated on the 5th of June when my friend quit in April???<br><br>The letter stated that they give her 14 days to pay up or they will refer the matter to the relevant authorities.<br><br>I find this company really sickening really! Friends have told her how the company charged ex-employees thousands of dollars for quiting. And her worse fear was revealed this week.<br><br>Anyone can help? Is there any ways she can defend herself?? Will Ministry of Manpower or any ministers be able to help her?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
