Like it or not, you have exams to take and you better do well...<br>2. Be INDEPENDENT. Want GOOD RESULTS? Be RESPONSIBLE for YOURSELF. Be a GROWN UP. Be ADULT. STOP depending on others for what YOU wish to achieve. And least to speak, blaming others for your own incompetence.<br>3. If you think your friends can give better consoles than your parents, look for your friends then?<br><br>If you're afraid that you may forget what you've studied for during your exams, you're probably not studying the right way or efficiently...
