              <p>as long as TS dont provide more details about her background, how she ended up like this difficult to help.</p>
              <p>selling the body and soul is not always a solution, not always the only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yes hardship and poor. but many times is due to poor or improper management of funds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>see many of our low income families, still surviving with meagre income.</p>
              <p>yes they do get lots of financial and freebies ad, that's cos tof their nationality.</p>
              <p>that's why need to know S background and citizneship stats.</p>
              <p>if its foreugner, i will only offer the best advise to leave and go back to where they cum from. many of them dream to make it big here is sg, earn lots of money. but that's all n the past now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sg os transforming into a differnt economy and a differnt market, and we attract with more niche advance and enhanced package instead of only cheap abundant labor. that type of market only now within cheenaland itself, nomore elsewhere in sg.</p>
              <p>if fireuigners should wakeup and go back to where an actual better life awaits.</p>

              <p>See your Member of Parliament (MP) to write appeal letter?</p>

              <p><strong>Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS)</strong> is the name of a
              feedback/redress system developed in Singapore for citizens to meet
              their member of parliament. The MPS are usually held once a week.
              Many citizens see the MPS as an opportunity to resolve problems
              that they are having with the bureaucracy.The MP will write a
              petition letter to the relevant ministry, statutory board or any
              concerned parties to appeal on behalf of the resident. The letters
              are accorded a higher priority by the Civil Service as they come
              from elected representatives.<br> <br> Cases deal with a wide range of problems. These include, but are
              not limited to, family financial problems (e.g. health-cost issues,
              jobs, financial assistance), CPF matters, various licenses, HDB
              related problems (e.g. subsidized rental housing, obtaining a
              subsidized HDB flat), immigration issues, and appeals for school
              admissions and school fee subsidy.<br> <br> Most sessions last past midnight to help residents effectively due
              to waiting time.</p>

              <p>The process of meeting the MP or Ministers varies from
              constituency to constituency, but they follow a general
              pattern:</p>
              <p>1) Registration and take queue number</p>
              <p>2) Constituent meets the petition writer who pens the letter
              (either hand-written or via PC) on behalf of the MP</p>
              <p>3) Wait and queue to meet the MP</p>
              <p>4) Meet the MP in a separate room, constituent informs the MP of
              his/her problems one-to-one.</p>
              <p>5) MP assures the constituent that they will look into the case
              and send the letter. For urgent cases, the letter will be typed
              out, sign by the MP and hands it to the constituent immediately.
              For normal cases, the letter will be vetted through by the MP’s or
              Minister’s Personal Secretary and sent out within three working
              days.</p>

              <p><span class="bodytext"> <em>The callers typically face troubles such as domestic abuse,

              </span></p><p>MORE calls for social assistance are being made to ComCare 
              Call, a helpline that directs needy people to the right agencies for 
              assistance.</p>
              <p>The callers typically face troubles such as domestic abuse, marriage woes and problems with caring for the elderly.</p>
              <p>These calls for help, advice or referrals accounted for 7 per cent of
               total calls received in 2008, but that number jumped to 20 per cent 
              last year.</p>
              <p>Between January and last month, social-service referrals made up 18 per cent of total calls received.</p>
              <p>During a tour of the ComCare Call Centre in Clemenceau Avenue 
              yesterday, Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports
               Halimah Yacob explained that the increase could be due to the 
              introduction of new social-assistance schemes.</p>
              <p>They include the Centre-based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare and the Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme.</p>
              <p>"People read about it (or) they hear about it...so they call the 
              ComCare helpline in order to ask for more information and to get 
              referrals," said Madam Halimah.</p>
              <p>She added: "They could be families who did not qualify previously."</p>
              <p>In April, the income ceiling for both schemes was raised from $1,800 to $3,500, making more families eligible.</p>
              <p>"It also shows that (the) challenges facing families are becoming 
              more complex," she said, noting that some of the help required go beyond
               financial assistance.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, the helpline is gearing itself up for an anticipated spike in callers, due to the gloomy economic outlook.</p>
              <p>"We are prepared to ramp up the services that we are providing to 
              those who are in need, particularly if there's an increased need because
               of the economic downturn," said Madam Halimah.</p>
              <p>Currently, the call centre has 16 staff members manning 25 lines. It 
              is looking to add three to five more phone operators within the next six
               months.</p>
              <p>During the global financial crisis in 2008, the total number of calls
               to the helpline requesting financial assistance was 20 per cent.</p>
              <p>Last year, however, the total number of calls related to financial 
              assistance accounted for only 15 per cent of the 23,083 calls received 
              that year.</p>
              <p>The helpline attends to an average of 2,500 calls per month. As of last month, it has received 26,900 calls this year.</p>
              <p>The highest number of calls the helpline received in a year was during 2009, when it chalked up 28,879.</p>
              <p>Not all the calls are made personally by those in need, as their 
              friends or families can ring the helpline on their behalf. Madam Halimah
               added that ComCare Call is a key thrust in the Government's "no wrong 
              door" policy.</p>
              <p>She said that if people were unsure about where to go to seek assistance, "they (can) just call the ComCare hotline for help".</p>

              <p>Hi all, thanks for all the advise.</p>
              <p>I'm a Singaporean, married into Malaysia n stayed there for 18yrs. </p>
              <p>My family n relatives are mad ABT my divorcee so they had lost contact with me. Most worst is, dad sold away flat wen knowing I'm coming back to S'pore.</p>
              <p>I dun dare to call the police. Wat happen if they know it's me? Sure they'll starting finding troubles for my children.</p>
              <p>N honestly, it's my fault. In the veri 1st place I shouldn't find loan shark to borrow money.</p>
              <p>The temptation always there when I'm reali in need of money, no one to seek for. As tat time, I couldn't apply any assistant wen the children are still Malaysian status. </p>
