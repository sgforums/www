Couple live with guy's parents until they both come out to work and earn enuff to buy their own house.<br><br>My buddy, knew him for about almost 15 yrs(since lower sec), he's 27now, just got married bcos he got her gf pregnant. His father take care of expenses needed to wedding, they live with his parents also.<br><br>When it comes to such case, if your parents is more to the old fasihioned type, they sure force you to get marry(and help you too), cos the guy's parents will not let their son do bear the bad name of being irresponsible, make girls pregnant and dun marry her. And for the gal's parents, will think that it's a big big shame that their daughter got pregnant but no one want to be responsible for it.<br><br>For the parents of ppl at my age, most of them are the old fashioned type, it's hard for them to accept abortion or single mom. So once they know their son/daughter got "shotgun", they will force them to marry.<br></div>

Finance.<br>It is best not to rely too much on loans or credit cards.  ie:housing loans, renovation loans, car loans etc..<br><br>Too much liability will cause a strain to your pockets and start a number of little squabbles, which will probably strain the relationship.<br><br>And of cos.. an expensive wedding on loans, normally ends up in an expensive divorce too.. MONEY is always an issue.. like it or not.. People do fight, argue over money..<br><br>2.  Age.<br>I wont say u are young.. but spending 40 - 60 yrs is not going to be easy.  There are a numbe rof stuff that can be very unpredictable..<br><br>I suggest that u might want to hold it back for a year or 2.. First.. to save some money... second, for u to meet and see more people..  third, to enjoy the little little things singlehood can offer u for a while more.. Until u reach 25 or so?  By then u should be ready mentally and financially to settle down..<br><br>There are many people who regretted marrying too young..<br><br>3.  Changes.<br>Try not to have too many major changes in ur life within a short period of time/ same time..<br>ie:  Get married, buy a car, buy a flat, change ur job, fighting for a promotion.<br><br>can be very stressful.  Let it come gradually~ then things will slowly fall in place~ And u have time to react~<br><br>Its an one sided opinon of me!  My suggestion is that listen to everyone and all you can.. No harm doing that... But take in what u think can be useful to you and dump those opinons u feel it is not useful..<br><br>cheers~<br><br></div>
