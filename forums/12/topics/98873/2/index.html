I pity your experiences with "Nice Guys".<br><br>The following is my point of view:<br><br>When you say a jerk can be a nice guy that guy in question is no longer a jerk in your eyes but "upgrades" himself into a "Nice Guy". Unless you think that he's a Nice Jerk(pretty oxymoronic eh)?<br><br>"A man can kill and still be the sweetest thing... " Took that right out of a song. I guess that's why you say a jerk can be nice...<br><br>I consider myself as a nice guy... I may not be a "perfect" guy but I know I'll TRY to be as nice as possible to everyone around me. I'm as much a victim of circumstances as the next guy... sometimes... I do things that I'm not proud of but deep down I know I wouldn't if I had the choice. You might say that I'm looking for excuses and thus qualify as a "pretender"... you are entitled to your opinions I guess... shrugs...<br></div>
