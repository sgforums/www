            <div class='col-md body'>i think the main problem is most guys (who are nice/good by nature) tend to be a gentleman in front of the girls and prefer to hide their true personality behind a mask of a goody-two-shoes, in fear that the girls might be offended by their true personality.<br><br>that's the biggest mistake most guys make.<br><br>we guys think by being polite and nice, girls will appreciate it better as they won't view us as rowdy barbarians.<br><br>instead, girls think that by being nice and polite, we're merely putting on a show for them to see. they see us as being insincere in building a friendship!<br><br>read: being nice gives them the creeps. they think you're up to no good when you're being so nice to them. (i think some members posted that before? sorry if i repeated.)<br><br>and because every 'nice' guy that they come across does the same thing over and over again, they begin to wonder about why they should hang out with the 'nice' guys. when you hang out with a group of strangers, it feels uncomfortable right? it's the same theory here!<br><br>and when the 'nice' guys still remain nice and polite after months of friendship, she eventually gets pissed off and decides to demote the 'nice guys' from "friends" to "acquaintances".<br><br>of course, we never knew what hit us. we could only say: what happened?<br><br>so that leaves the 'bad boys' or jerks.<br><br>jerks don't put up with all that formality and manners, because it doesn't suit them. they just be themselves in front of the girls. in other words, they don't hide behind that mask of a goody two shoe, they display their true personality.<br><br>so when girls interact with the jerks, they know that they're looking at his true self. and so, they gradually open up to the jerks and form a closer friendship with them.<br><br>as for choosing a suitable candidate for a boyfriend, it's pretty obvious why they choose the jerks instead: would you choose a guy who puts on a mask in front of you all the time or a guy who just behaves as himself all the time?<br><br>of course, there are other reasons as to why girls dig the jerks and not the nice guys.<br><br>but before i go on, please understand that <strong>girls do not like jerks just because they're jerks.</strong> no girl in her right mind will like a rude asshole/violence freak. they are attracted to the jerks because they exude masculinity. females are naturally attracted to masculinity, just as males are naturally attracted to good looks. they can't help it.<br><br>and because of this masculinity, girls can often forgo the other weaknesses of the jerks.<br><br>i hope that explains why you always see the jerks scoring with the hot/pretty chicks.<br><br>[continued on next post]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when it comes to actions..jerks are much more romantic. why? because they have confidence in themselves! they're not afraid of failure, they're not afraid of embarassing themselves. and so, they carry out their romantic acts without fear.<br><br>ncie guys lose out because they don't have the balls to carry out their actions. either that, or they just worry too much about failure. if not, nice guys can definitely be alot better than jerks in the area of romance.<br><br>i believe many nice guys [who are in need of a gf] would have already read up alot on how to impress a girl, how to blow her away with your romantic acts, etc. when you have enough balls to carry out your actions, the line of girls waiting for you is endless!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Classic Jerk:<br><br>1. Does not give a damn about gers, if they dun like him, "there are always MANY MORE around to chase him"-mentality.<br><br>2. Cocky n Arrogant<br><br>3. Wise-cracking remarks, especially to girls to induce response from them, but to girls' viewpoints they find it charming.<br><br>4. Owns some big piece of hardware or equipment which he brags about constantly.. e.g. car, motorbike..sword etc<br><br>5. Plays some physical game involving sweat and toil and getting hurt, and he is so damn good at it he can brag about howmany goals he has.<br><br>6. Does not always agree with girls, stands up to girls and is headstrong.. girls find this appealing coz it CHaLLENges them and makes them feel that natural feminine submissive instinct.. rather than some nice guy fag subservient to them.<br><br>7. 2 times or 3 times many girls at the SAME TIME to mAXIMISE enjoyment from romance. Usually does not care due to the mentality of 1., girls find this also appealing coz they wanna stick with their jerk even though they don't know about his fidelity issues.<br><br>8. Hardly calls the girl back, waits for the GIRLS to come to him. Vanity-trademark of the classic jerk. Girls find the jerk appealing coz of his vanity, thinking it means STRONG SOLID character.<br><br>9. Turns vanity and cockyness and passes it off as OVERCONFIDENCE <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>10. Does not treat a girl nicely all the time.. his NICENESS towards girls is like 2%, so that the girl REMEMBERS the 2% out of the 98% of JERK thus CHERISHING his BEST 2%!<br><br>To be this STALLION JERK!

            <div class='col-md body'>- loses confidence easily to other men[competition].<br>No self esteem in the first place. But I realize some gals hate guys who are too full of themselves.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">the key word here is 'moderation'.</span><br><br>- agrees with everything she says.<br>But what if she right most of the time? And imagine the effort needed to prove your points. I am too lazy for that<br><br><span style="color: blue;">my point is that you don't be a parrot like this:<br><br>if she doesn't like apples, you will agree that you don't like apples as well.<br>if she doesn't like Jay Chou, you will agree that you don't like Jay Chou as well.<br>if she doesn't like 7-UP, you will agree that you don't like y-UP as well.</span><br><br>- gets too emotionally attached to girls. girls are not born for your sake!<br>Not too sure what this means.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">it means that when she becomes your girlfriend, you suddenly feel so attracted to her that you realise you CANNOT lose her, or not see her for even 1 second. you find out that she is the air your breathe, the light you seek. YOU CANNOT LOSE HER!!! YOU MUST BE WITH HER FOREVER!!!<br><br>girls hate such guys, they're disgusting and suffocating.</span><br><br>- thinks that girls are made of glass: any form of vulgarity will break them.<br>Is it alright to be vulgar but apologies for it? Anyway is it really necessary to be vulgar in the first place?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">apologising is fine. but my point here is that guys are so afraid of making mistakes in front of girls! they're afraid that girls will scream and run away if they accidentally burp or fart.<br><br>girls, are normal human beings like us! they sh*t, fart, dig their nose, scold vulgarities, laugh at people who fall down, talk behind people's backs.....JUST LIKE GUYS! so don't be afraid, be yourself!</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">BUT DO NOT ACT AS A NICE GUY JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S BEST NOT TO OFFEND HER IN ANYWAY. YOU ARE ONLY DRIVING YOURSELF INTO A DEAD END.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">think about it: you act as a nice guy in front of her. how long can you do that? 3 days? 2 weeks? 6 months?<br><br>no matter how good your acting skills are, you will one day be revealed of your true personality. and what happens? you will get accused of lying to her all the while and you will never see her again. wonderful.<br><br>so why bother acting as a nice guy in the first place? just be yourself!</span><br><br>- easily stepped over like a door mat.<br>Not quite. Everyone who knows me well know I have a limit before I.....<br><br><span style="color: blue;">the point is not about tolerance level. being stepped over like a door mat means that you're obeying her every command like a damn genie. when she wants you to do her hw, you will obey. when she wants you to buy a cake for her mother, you will obey. when she wants you to do her project, you will obey. when she wants you to pay for her, you will obey.<br><br><strong>girls will never like a guy whom they do not have respect for.</strong></span></div>
