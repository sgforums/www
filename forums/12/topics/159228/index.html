This i have to agree.<br><br>For me, i like to work from complications to core values and guides.<br><br>From a simple case,<br><br>1) View it in multiple perspective, as many angle as possible<br>2) Break into several catergories<br>3) Analyse in different catergories, using mainly reasonings and theories/formula.<br>4) Simplify and sifting most possible angles<br>5) Conclude.<br><br>From there i realise new theories/studies.<br>I do that not because it's easy or it's my thought flow. I can't help...but to enjoy the thought-process my mind can carry the subject to.<br>Haha.<br>In real life, MC very naggy one. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I don't think it's a gift to decipher those intented smses.<br>I just happen to have this tendency to see what people don't see.<br>Actually, i find my forte in conversations and observations in person. Decoding body language and gestures etc.<br><br>My favourite will be conversations.

Then me tells Ally, 'you like him too!'<br><br>Simple.....?<br><br>Some things self functional one la.<br>Sometimes i say simple things.
