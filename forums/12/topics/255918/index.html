To feel that I've lost her.<br><br>To hear the immense night, more immense without her.<br>And the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass.<br><br>What does it matter that my love couldn't keep her.<br>The night is full of stars and she is not with me.<br><br>That's all. Far away, someone sings. Far away.<br>My soul is lost without her.<br><br>As if to bring her near, my eyes search for her.<br>My heart searches for her and she is not with me.<br><br>The same night that whitens the same trees.<br>We, we who were, we are the same no longer.<br><br>I no longer love her, true, but how much I loved her.<br>My voice searched the wind to touch her ear.<br><br>Someone else's. She will be someone else's. As she once<br>belonged to my kisses.<br>Her voice, her light body. Her infinite eyes.<br><br>I no longer love her, true, but perhaps I love her.<br>Love is so short and oblivion so long.<br><br>Because on nights like this I held her in my arms,<br>my soul is lost without her.<br><br>Although this may be the last pain she causes me,<br>and this may be the last poem I write for her.<br><br></strong></span></div>
