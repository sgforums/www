            <div class='col-md body'>just a bit of advise for the girls:<br>if the guys treat you like a substitute - BREAKUP!<br><br>i don't get it with youth today. the message is simple:<br><br>1) LOVE SURFACES YOUR PAST HURTS<br>Yes, it is true that every single time you really love someone, your past hurts, anger, pain, regret, and all the repressed feelings you've kept inside WILL surface. Why? Simply because love creates a comfortable environment where you are not afraid to come face to face with your hurts. However, most couples treat this entire thing wrongly and end up quarelling. The solution is to tell what we counsellors call "the complete truth". If anyone wants to know more about this, you can reach me and I will be free to share more. It will help heal many relationships.<br><br>2) LOVE IS PATIENT, LOVE IS KIND<br>Let's face it. Love is really patient and kind, it certainly does not envy! So many teens I've spoken to tell me they envy their past relationship and even if this one can't match up, it's ok. They will remember the past and work out this one. Wrong, wrong, wrong! You only end up with deception.<br><br>Let me give you a real-world example: Those guys who are into pornography will end up with an IMAGE they set up in their minds about girls and this carries on into any girl they have a relationship with. The image of lust in their depraved minds then disguises itself as love. In the end, a breakup happens and everyone wonders  what went wrong.<br><br>I'm trying to give a summary of what I need to say. It would probably take an hour to speak everything about relationship issues. Bottom line girls: If you're being treated as a substitute or anyone other than YOURSELF, it's not worth keeping unless the guy learns to get healed from his past (which you can help him do by the way as spoken of in point 1).<br><br>Have an awesome day!<br>Daniel</div>
