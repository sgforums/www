            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: brown;">True. Alot of guys here, advice you to stick to each other through thick and thin, be it his business succeed or fail. I agree with them. Yunhaier has shown you a deeper understanding of a man's nature.<br><br>Earlier this year, my boyfriend said something similar to yours. He told me that if I find a guy that can give me more happiness, he won't blame me for running away. I felt that he was inferior or had a low-self esteem because his business wasn't doing well at that time. He was uncertain if he could sustain me in the long run and that's why he was insecure.<br><br>The man is the bread-winner of the house whereas the woman is his helper. Although the modern woman becomes more independant and can provide for herself now, you will still find most man provide and the woman will support nowadays.<br><br>Being his girlfriend, I understand that being self-employed is definitely, much harder than being employed. I told him that the problem is not his alone and we will bear the cost together. So, I support and help him in his business untill now. Ever since then, he didn't say the above. Man needs assurance as much as a woman does.<br><br>"Be it bad time or good time, I think it's a matter of how resourceful you are, how courageous you are, how driven you are, to prove yourself."<br>- Ron Sim, the founder and chief executive of Osim, who received the "Business Man of the Year" award in 2004 and whose wife continues to stay by his side even though he almost went bankrupt a few times.</span></div>

When this becomes uncertain, threatened or unavailable - a man loses his confidence akin to the inability to protect his woman.<br><br>A man's love, very often, doesn't measure in that of a woman's world of flower and romance (Taurus, Capricorn and Virgo exception). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]A man demonstrates his affection through his ability to provide.</span></strong> This is also the reason why many guys think that with money, they can probably <span style="font-style: italic;">buy </span>love or attract love. The greater monetary powers he possess, his masculine ego expands likewise. (This is inclusive of material stuff that is a indirect boast of material powers like car, house, etc).<br><br>Your man is depressed because he feared that you might make a wrong decision to remain with him, if he is unable to fulfil this primitive masculine instinct. <span style="color: red;">There has never been a better time when your man needs more verbal encouragement, hugs and little kisses to lift his spirit. Are you going through this ordeal with him? Or is he going to fight this battle alone?<br><br>At the end of the road, you will realise that winning or losing this battle doesn't matter... when two hearts unite as one.</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers          [/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm..I would say that he's pretty insecure in this relationship.  He's just not ready to commit into a long term relationship, and business is just a way to hid his insecurity.  My advice is, give him space, and time.  Let him sort his feeling out himself, and don't pressurise him into anything yet.  If he can pass through this stage, no matter what happens to his environment, his heart belongs to you.  If he cannot convince himself that he is ready to love you forever, no point forcing on.  Hold faith, in him and yourself.<br><br>Just curious, is he scorpio?</div>

But after months of dating and after hearing him telling her several times to go for someone who is better than him, she got fed up and broke up with him. He practically doesn't have any faith or trust in the relationship. Might as well she dump him now rather than drag the relationship on, not knowing if there is a future.<br><br>If ur bf really wants to be with u, he would hold onto u and even if his business fails, he will think positively and try to start from scratch again. He should know u well enough that u will not leave him no matter what.<br><br>Have a good talk with him and don't talk about breaking up. Ask him if there is any other way to settle the matter.</div>
