To deal with this kind of person. I have to be rude or else will step over you. I dont treat everyone rude. R hated me for that. During my exams, L spent more time wif R than me. We promised each other to put exams ahead of our relationship. Recently, she wanted a break up, she said she dont love me anymore. she wanted to be alone. i felt devastated. its not like her. she changed into a different person when she knew R. i dont know if R is talking behind me. R is single n likes being single. Now, L doesnt even sms me. I want her back, chase her back but i cant when the situatuation is like this. its hard. R now like flaming me. she claims that im disgusting that i visited her blog to know more about L. I admit i did. cause she didnt sms now. because i still love her i cared. why such big change in her? even im not perfect even i cant provide her much i know she's not a demanding person which is one of the reason i fell in love with her, even if im not good but i treated her like a princess. she's hot headed but i din care, she's rude sometimes but i din care. they say when u love someone u can only see how good she is. i'd never felt so heart broken in my life. not when my favourite grandfather passed away. not even anything. i can really feel my heart breaking. break le also break le, now she got her freedom. then i say nvm. im a man. i want to chase her back. now doesnt want to talk to me. as if i find another girl lidat or did smth bad. i loved her more than anything else even my family. she said what has happened in the past cant happen again. another blow to my heart. u all can say its puppy love but its like something special. a girl i chose out of a thousand million girls you've met. i really have no mood to do anything. and confused. hopes for the coming year dashed by this. its like somebody close to you passed away. i dont know what to do but to cry all day. men do cry. what to do? haiz. i just want her.<br><br>t.y. for reading my long post. just need someone to lend a ear cause i heart just ached again and again</div></blockquote>Sorry bro the whole thing hit you so hard.<br><br>BUT wake your idea lar learn that world is not so easy place to live in.<br><br>So what you treat her well? you think that she must be there always be with you, dream on lar bro, smell the air, you do not like R but you must not show it ma. Show it liao kena backstab by R for what?<br><br>You know what? the only silly mistake you ever make was making an enemy with R.<br><br>Learn this lesson well<br>NEVER EVER INSULT your gf friends as they are the ones who will bad stab you when they were not happy with you.<br><br>Your case is a very good example to all of us.

            <div class='col-md body'>leon_lai89, i feel for you. The comittement and trust between you and L is breached just like that. On what basis did you guys started off? 2 years of being together shouldn't just fall itself apart to the bad mouth of a 'new' friend.<br><br>Given the scenerio now,even if you were to have her back, things will NEVER be the same again. The silent moments you guys share will never be the same again. I'd say let her go. Be strong buddy. She has lost her opportunity, its her lost. Tell yourself, the BEST is yet to come. Whatever happens, it always does for the better.<br><br>There'll be a phrase of breakups you feel you'll never get over from, take this period of time to love yourself better, for where others have failed you, you will never fail yourself. Save your efforts for the one that is to come, not one that is of the past.<br><br>Hope this helps</div>
