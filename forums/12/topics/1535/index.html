            <div class='col-md body'>Well ... I hold the perspective that the guy would not really treasure you if you are the one who "wooed" him.<br><br>"song4 shang4 men2" de ma .. maybe seeking companionship for the time being .. then ditch you once he found someone he really loves. Also, he might ask you to engage in intimacy .. and knowing you likes him, you will most probably succumb to his advances.<br><br>Maybe the guys who have such encounters would care to share their experiences???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

But it's a fact loh from all the gals I knw, but of course they will drop enough hints for the guy to pick up which will giv him courage to make the first move.  If all of u had read the problems I posed in "Aunt Agony", u would knw tt I'm the "chicken" type and it's really very difficult for me to make the first move unless I hav 100% confidence I will nt be rejected...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>
