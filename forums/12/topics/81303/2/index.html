            <div class='col-md body'>I think those who harbor this thoughts are those that have not learnt to let go. You simply grief over someone that is not meant to be yours. So what if you were together? How are you sure that there will not be another one better that comes along. As long as you keep comparing, the will never be an end to it. It is also not very fair to someone that loves you.<br><br>I believe marriage itself is a beginning to another phase of love itself. Marriage is a milestone that both of you decided to take a further step in your current relationship and a commitment to nurture and enhance your relationship. Through times, with mutual trust, care, and forgiveness, the relationship will be stronger then ever. By then, all relationship that you once had look pale compare to what both of you and achieve so far.<br><br>Cherish what you have. True love is there only when both of you take effort to work on it.<br></div>
