Such relationship, very often, have similiar ending - goodbye. Trust is not a good-to-have element - its essential to ensure a relationship to flow hamoniously and properly. Like kidney stone - it hinders the growth of your relationship when it's being mis-placed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: One note for you guys/girls out there - going out with the opposite gender all that doesn't mean anything - the problem only occurs when you LIE about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
