            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there pplÂ…<br><br>Just to share with you guys on my experience with sweaty palms. I have been suffering from sweaty palms since the day I can remember. It has been pretty embarrassing when it comes to handshakes. Everything I touched somehow became wet and sticky. My hands were apparently wet and clammy most of the time. The only time that I can remember my hands were dry was during bedtime.<br><br>I had decided to go for the surgery (ETS) to cure my sweaty palms once and for all. Had a pre-surgery appointment with the doctor and he suggested that I am able to go for the surgery. I was rather apprehensive about the surgery as it had its side effects. However, the doctor assured me that the main side effects of compensatory sweating (CS) was minimal and person having severe compensatory sweating (CS) was rare.<br><br>I decided to go ahead with the surgery for my sweaty palms. Just before my surgery, in the operation theatre, my doc asked me whether I wanted to do the surgery for my sweaty armpits as well. The sweating of my armpits wasnÂ’t really a concern to me at that time. The doc suggested doing both the surgery together and I said yes. Therefore, I decided to go under the knife to cure my sweaty palms and sweaty armpits.<br><br>Now for the post surgery results. The first 3 days after the op was perfect! My hands were dry and I felt that life has changed for the better. Not until the 4th day when I actually broke out sweating at my abdomen, lower back, butt, and the whole of my thighs. This has been ongoing and my doc said it is normal. Now I have to be under the fan or aircon most of the time. Any small physical activity would cause me to have CS. This has become more embarrassing as I have to constantly keep check whether my perspiration gets soaked through my clothes and if itÂ’s visible. I can even soak my clothes while sleeping at night in an air-con room at night. My arms, neck, upper chest and head can no longer sweat and lack of this gives me a burning sensation. Oh God, what have I done?! And mind you, there is no reversal for this surgery.<br><br>I do not know of anyone who had not regretted having this op. For sure I am one of them who has regretted going. I would like to urge everyone to seriously consider before going under the knife.<br><br>Hope those who have gone for this op can share their views and concerns here. I am actually trying to get in touch with people who have gone for this surgery. ItÂ’s tough getting on with life when you are bogged down with such stuff!!<br><br>jagstar19@yahoo.com<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have sweaty palms and i kinda like it. girls don't mind it when we hold hands, and it doesn't impair anything i do anyway. I can manage 8 chin ups (hey, its quite little but i'm only 16) with ease without gloves, so i do not see the need for any special provision of any sort for people with sweaty palms....<br><br>just my 2cents worth =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess everyone can learn a valuable lesson from this doomed surgery: your perspiration has to come out from somewhere....<br><br>If not your hands and arms then surgery simply re-distributes to other parts of your body.<br><br>It seems your doc has not been candid enough to inform you of these side effects. Either that or he DID inform you and you could not fully comprehend the consequences.<br><br>All in all, it points to just one thing: never put yourself under the knife if it's unnecessary...that goes for lasik, plastic surgery, double eyelids, liposuction etc etc...<br><br>if it ain't broke, why fix it?</div>
