Do not know exactly what's your situation, but I can assure you that you'll have my full support for now....<br>In order for me to make further more meaningful analysis, please supply me with. Age, star sign and blood group of the below mentioned, to your possible knowledge. Yours, your hubby, the lady and also IDEALLY if possible, of the lady's EX husband... Would help alot if you can provide for the above, thanks...<br>Also, please update me with information on: How long have you know your hubby; how long have both of you been married; how long both of you know her; how long have it been since you noticed that your hubby's relationship with her deepens; how long have she know that guy before she had his child (if you can...); any other relationship(s) she had after she found out that the guy is married.... I know some of the information above would be difficult to obtain, but all the above would really help in the BATTLE if you desire victory, thanks... Try to give me the YEAR (if better still, the month if not EARLY, MID or END year), if not the period or duration will do. Try to be clear and definitive in the information you give. I know you'll feel a temptation to obtain information from your husband. But if it would arouse the suspect of your husband, DON'T. If you want your information confidential e-mail me as addressed in my previous POST above.<br><br>Your <strong>BATTLE LINE DRAWN</strong> would be to have your husband back on YOUR SIDE.

He's your best chance to the solution, your objection and YOUR HUSBAND. If you want him back, DO NOT DESTROY him.<br><br>I would HOLD my words for now.
