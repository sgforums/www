He will inform you by himself and if he doesn't you should just trust him. What is a relationship without trust... if you doubt him so much then there is no point being together. But if you really want him to what is going on with his life then you could try to tell him why and make him undertsand. Besides that do you do the same or is it a one sided thing? Sometimes, you won't find out where is he or what is he doing... you will never know unless you catch him red handed or see it with your own eyes. Don't believe in rumours, if you doubt him that much then you can trail him yourself. If not, just talk it out with him and hope for the best!</div>
