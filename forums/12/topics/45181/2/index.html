            <div class='col-md body'>hai ger ger,<br><br>I'm just speaking from my heart, hope its ok. Sometimes when guys go NS, it can be a big change for em. Some come out and mold emselves well, like physically and mentally more matured; can take on challenges like a man. Some, end up with bad company &amp; became worse, grumpy, think they veri chiam. Usually commandos or guards are very very pressurised esp. physically. But nt all the units are very siong. My guy frens used to be from diff. camps and hear em complain day in day out.<br><br>At times, in NS. influenced by frens, they go for "greener pastures". Approach other gals during their one - two hour outings or lie that they have to stay late or guard duties. But really ger, he has his pressures so does everyone else! Yes, it's our duty as a gf to take care of the guy and also help him with his burdens. But as gals, we got to also be perceptive: Is e gal be taken for granted or even for a ride? What has changed...any small changes can be veri significant...even changin his brand of cigarettes! I can't deny his excuse about the ger no seemed veri lame...but let's 1st give him a benefit of a doubt.<br><br>I am sure he has his off days. On his off day when he sleep enuf alreadi, find some time to have a good talk with him. If he really treasure e relationship he will listen to wat u have to say, do not accuse him 1st, be tactful ya.<br><br>I know now NS days are easier than those days b4. Every guy of the older generation will tell u that...and erm, he's a driver right, he get to go home right? How abt those stuck in camp day in day out? Those go field trips and practices whole week long? Try not to add too much pressure on him yet, give urself some time to sort things out also. One ting though, if u really no money telll him so, stop providing money for him....every guy go through NS here in S'pore unless for some special reasons, if they can make thru it so can he........</div>
