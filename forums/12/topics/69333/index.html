And I guess RP is rite for ur situation now. What ur bf need now is concern cos he is alone inside there. He couldnt bear to tell u the truth cos he is afraid to hurt u and couldnt bear for u to be hurt.<br><br>He is finding it diffcult to give u a better future based on hissituation now. So the best way to let him noe is to tell hom tt no matter wat u will stil love him and wait for him. Assure him. Mayb u can write a letter to him.<br><br>Like wat RP says, at times when we are upset, we lose all our reasonings. It may be getting tougher but rest assured u haf pairs of listening ears here in AA. =) So cheers up! At the end of the tunnel, there is light!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Learn to read beyond surface.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Why would he say that? I would tell you frankly about a man's love. Generally man are practical bunch of morons. They sees love as someone very much practical and therefore, your wait for him is seen as impractical to him. This is true if he share great amount of love for you because he doesn't want you to waste your time. In fact, you should be worrying when he says 'please wait for me.' (Ok lar, nothing wrong with that, but according to CloUdiSm, his love maturity didn't reach level of space and freedom - to possess is not happiness, to place empathy is.)<br><br>If I was your bf, I would say the same thing.<br><br>Ok, no doubt, his ego is damaged, reputation ruin, etc and by being with him, he will feel that you will be so 'wei qu'. He will think about what your parents may feel, your friends, etc.<br><br>Hey, he is thinking for you, but of course, you don't share similiar views because <strong>you are not in his position.</strong><br><br>So how now? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Action speaks louder than words. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Show</strong></span> your determination, your will, your discipline, your strength and most importantly: your love.<br><br>Cheers[/b]</div>
