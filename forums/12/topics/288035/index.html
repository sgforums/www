Not sure of the current UNISIM system. If you wish, you may find out.<br><br>I don't see a gulf of difference bet UOL and RMIT. Both are based on the British and it's commonwealth systems. These systems stress a lot on understanding academic concepts and acquring language fluency to express them.<br><br>One of the main reasons for Poly to be so well received by the employers is that the syllabus is up-to-dated. High time local private unis do so. This is exactly what UNISIM tries to do. Albeit, at the uni level. If you look at the course outlines, you would know.<br><br>It is hard to say which degree is more employable. Sometimes, employment, like many things else in life, are the strokes of luck.<br></div>

I was in RMIT for business admin(they now change the course name) and like you said, it doesn't have honours system, and also similar to your Poly system.<br><br>RMIT consists of only lectures for 3 hours, while I heard UOL has tutorials. I would consist it to be a disadvantage to study RMIT, since tutorials would mean a smaller class, and u would have more chances to raise doubts than if you would to study just lectures.

I was in RMIT for business admin(they now change the course name) and like you said, it doesn't have honours system, and also similar to your Poly system.<br><br>RMIT consists of only lectures for 3 hours, while I heard UOL has tutorials. I would consist it to be a disadvantage to study RMIT, since tutorials would mean a smaller class, and u would have more chances to raise doubts than if you would to study just lectures. Because almost everyone would ask the lecturer questions during break and after school, which means u would be less inclined to ask questions.</div></blockquote>i thought its the other way round?? RMIT have tutorials and UOL dun have?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>UniSIM is Singapore's first private university with MOE approval to award its own degrees.  In this respect, it ranks equally with all Singapore universities (3 public ones) which come under MOE's control.<br>As for foreign universities - there are plenty from Australia, Britain and USA.  Most of these depends on local educational setups to run their programmes and the degrees are awarded by the foreign universities. They do not come under MOE's control. PSB, MDIS, MIS, SHRI, SMA and many others offer such foreign university programmes. And so does SIM Global which runs RMIT, UOL, OU, etc.<br>Whether lectures, tutorials, courseworks, etc. - it all depends on the university's approach. For UOL, it is unseen written exams for most papers (unless practical ones!). For RMIT, you have combination of courseworks and exams.<br>Unlike on-campus full-time study, you can take your time to do the programme, work or do other things!<br>Some programmes don't even require you to attend courses if you are able to study and learn on your own!  Some UOL programmes fit into this scheme which is ideal for people who are disciplined, capable and can learn with minimum help or mostly self-help. This is quite an uphill task!  <span style="color: red;">It used to be the case where many went thru UOL External Programme on their own bootstrap and really earned their degrees by their own efforts! </span> These days, so many educational outfits are actually conducting classes for these UOL self-learning programmes.<br><br>If you ask me, I rather put my money in UniSIM. It is still young but in time to come, it will gain the recognition that SIM has. America's best and top universities (Ivy League) are private universities. So, don't worry.<br><br>Whether you study full-time on-campus or part-time off-campus, the difference is only the 'student' life.  There is no difference whether you study Statistics in UniSIM, RMIT, NUS or whatever.  The same with Accounting - you will learn debits and credits all the same!!!!<br><br>Of course, those who studied full-time on-campus will have more opportunities and time to be involved in campus activities and to socialise with one another.<br>But do not think for one moment that the degree obtained is any better! At the end of day, it is you - the student that makes the difference. If you are good, any university you go is no problem but of course, if you are that good, you can choose to go to top university - not the second stringers!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(nanren)<br><blockquote>Some of my friends went to Australia to study. What they got was satisfaction at 3 years of campus life, experiencing a different lifestyle and culture, and bascially the days of staying with other people, and forming a deep bond that could last forever.
