Then I will quit my job to stop any possibility of my ex doing anything. She dumped me b4 and hurt me. Even if she likes me, its too late le. Even if I love her so wat? I love my present gf more.

The guy's ex dumped the guy because of work? If the reason is valid enough such that the ex did not really dump the guy because of other reasons like falling for someone else, etc, i feel that the guy should not have found another girl to replace that lost feelings. In this case, i feel the guy's present gf is just a substitute for his ex gf. He has gotten used to having someone by his side.<br><br>However,another way of looking at things, since he has found a new gf when his ex is not around anymore, it may also show that the guy has found someone better than his ex and therefore why should he go back to someone who is not as good as his present gf? As mentioned, both girls are very nice and good, however, there should be 1 girl who will stand out from the two and he should go with the girl he likes most.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What I think is, get over the ex first before you get someone new. If you still have feelings for your ex, then it is unfair to your new gf. If you got over her, get a new gf and the ex really comes back, ( this i think has a very low probability of happening anyway) well, think about it carefully, and after you have decided, think about it again. If you really love your current gf then you wouldn't consider any other gals. be it your ex gf or not. If there is doubt and you are willing to consider, well, that means you don't really love your current gf after all. even if it is not your ex gf that comes between you, it is another gal, the same rules applies. But please be fair to both girls.</div>

Ok time for another lengthy post.<br><br>I am going to divide this post into parts which will let you see clearly why this isn't too complicating like it seemed to be. All he needs is a time to reflect, ponder and consider carefully. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>His problem is attacking him into 2 areas<br><br>I) External factors - ex-gf working same company.<br><br>II) Internal factors - he discovered this new-found liking.<br><br>Basically, I do not know what causes them to break-up in the first place, but since you said she dump him (and you chose the word 'dump') therefore I presume it wasn't a good closure of the previous relationship. Trying hard to forget is NATURAL and the process of trying to leave an old relationship for a new life.<br><br>When she worked in the same company - they spend much time together. This triggers the feelings - chances are, its never liking UNLESS he admits that this present gf is a substitution for her. In love, we fell for a number of reasons - two of them were found here - time spend and begining-similiarity.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Beginning similiarity is a love psychological behavior of sourcing out characteristic that is similar to you and together with long time spend - it attracts. This attraction is very familiar because its the same vibes that draws them together the previous time.<br><br>Now she wants him back, there is two things I would like to point out:<br><br>I) She is the one who 'dump' him - now he is leading such good life, he should go ponder why he should end this 'good life' he is leading now for something he made him fall into misery and left. She came into his life not when he was the lowest point, rather when he was all-well and easy. Her present gf? During his road to recovery - &amp; this is nothing to do with the arguement of responsibility and not love. Rather this is a fine example of compatiability, suitability and such. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) He and her could get along so well without much conflicts is because there is a colleague status. I am pretty sure (85%) - that outside work, there is little similiarity and personality harmony. If he quits the job (like what Bear has mentioned), and try dating her, when the feeling dies, you understand why.<br><br>In love, outside responsibility, we need to know whom are better off when together in a relationship with us. In simple, the compatiability. I have one very good question to ask him: <strong>HE SO SURE HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS HIS EX IS DEFINITELY LOVE?</strong> I don't think he knows for sure - and he is pressured subconsciously by her chasing as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: When you have more choices to choose from - you look not at the facts and figure presented to you, rather you look at yourself and ask what do you really want. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
