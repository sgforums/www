You're lucky!<br><br>This is your chance. Not hers.<br><br>Now that she has confessed to you, time to turn on the spark even more! What do you do? Just RELAX. LEAN BACK. Try and tease her even more, and don't be afraid to offend her in cocky and funny ways. About you telling her that she's irritating, try not to sound nice but at the same time sound humorous.<br><br>One final note: NEVER take advantage of a girl's early confessions or signal to you that she's interested too soon, or you'll may kill your chances to be with her.<br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>Well, if you really DON'T want to be with her and want to reject her, try being a very nice friend instead and do nice things for her, just like any other guys who did the same thing while courting her. She'll definitely treat you as a good friend after some time.<br><br>OR<br><br>If you want to reject her instantly, try telling her straight in the face. I'm sure she'll appreciate it, rather than beating about the bush and procrastinating.<br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>All the best in your decisions!<br><br>yours faithfully,<br>S.H.I.N.</div>

You did not really return ur feelings to her cuz she just broke up with her bf not long ago. She told you she's gotten over it. You think this is way too fast? She's frank with you, telling you almost everything. Known each other thru work.<br><br>Now i start to think she's kind of "fan" aka noisy. Telling me who's with her.. wad shes doing.. etc.. do u tink it's way too much? I mean well u can tell me this.. but she go home with another guy (cuz stay near) oso tell me. Kind of like irritating to me. Any ways to tell her not to be too fan in a nice way?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> </div></blockquote>If you think she pester u too much like housefly, go get some mortein shut her up<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
