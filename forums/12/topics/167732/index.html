Tell him holding hands &amp; hugging is ok but draw the line on petting. Be firm abt it. If he loves u, he will respect your decision.</div>

I learnt to understand the fact that because their organs are external while our's internal, so theirs are easier to... (up to your imagination). Overall, a guy's sex drive is higher than a girl's. Therefore, they are more likely to initiate petting first. If you initiate petting, it's more difficult for them to reject you.

And one good way to reassure yourself is to raise your concern to him. Being a guy myself, i respect all decisions raised by my lady. Afterall there's no point engaging into intimacy of such extent when i know she's not confortable about it. Its like turning my own sexual satisfaction against her insecurity.</div>
