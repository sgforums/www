If your wife is absolutely not interested then your method is the equivalent of marital rape.  I know cus i'm there;  Been married for only 3 years but haven't had sex in most of that time, and not at all in the last year.  Sometimes swooning and diamond rings just don't work.  And mister left-or-right hand isn't much of a substitute if there's no hope of real affection in the future.<br><br>[no email address provided!]</div>
