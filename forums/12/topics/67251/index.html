            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, just a piece of suggestion from me.<br><br>There are many factors to consider.<br><br>FIrstly, you are heading to NS soon, what happens if she's your girlfriend and you have to enter soon? It's very hurting to actually not see each other for so long, esp. the first 3 weeks? or if you are in ppt, its even worse. One of my friend is having this scenario, they know each other for a month and the guy headed for NS. For first few weeks, she's been crying, she felt very torturing. We just have to encourage her to hold on. It's been a tough time for her but now, she's used to it already.<br><br>Secondly, she's busy too. Will she have the time to have a relationship now? With her driving, projects and exams, can you stand her not having enough time for you? esp its the starting of a so-called honey moon of the relationship.<br><br>Okay, make it simple. Do what your heart tells you to do, don't regret when its too late. There isn't any harm telling her how you feel now, have a nice talk with her, she'll understand. Not all relationships fail because of NS, most of them survive. It's just a matter of how strong the relationship is.<br><br>That's what i will do if i were you. If not... wait till you settle down in NS or when you have regular bookouts.<br><br>Good Luck!!</div>
