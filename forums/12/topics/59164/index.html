The factors that also create that haste is due to the fact that she hasn't got a bf before and of course, you touched her in your little ways. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>After three months courtship, you began to wonder if this guy she got is really the guy she wants. Please take note that for first love, its difficult to judge &amp; gauge about the kind of partner you are truely looking for.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Stated reason of starting out too early is true (CloUdiSm Remix III classified as Morning Foundation - simply meant hasty relationship), while compatiability is an excuse. Compatiable love is made from a relationship, not given as perfect partner.<br><br>Advice? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Patch? Difficult to say - Because this relationship didn't turn soured in the first place. My suggested piece of advice would be to let her walk around and so will you. She is just embarking her beginning journey of love and relationship and UNLESS she has experienced hurt, she will not know what she is truely looking for. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let her walk, so will you - keep an open mind and be generous about it. Enlarge social circle and probably friends meanwhile. Continue to keep in contact, as a good friend. My prediction is that within six months - nine months, she will get another bf. Don't go crazy or anything - be generous and let her be.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: If she is truely yours, she will fly back even if you set her free. This is applicable to your case. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree. i am currently going thru a LDR myself and i can tell you its not easy. many of my friends have nto survived it but i''m still alirght so far.(take note of the 2 words <strong>SO FAR</strong>).<br><br>it will be hard for you to let her go but then again if u r going overseas there is a very huge chance u will meet someone else there... and there will be temptation to let this one go.. or u might start comparing.. or regretting that u tried to get her back.. or on the contrary u might be happy being with her.. (emotionally, electronically) but u might not handle to toll on the relationship.. and it might be the next break-up reason as well. maybe we are diff cos i am 14hrs flight away from my gal whereas u are just like half of it..??<br><br>do give alot of thoughts about it.<br><br>like the previoue replies mentioned, if she's yours she will fly back to you. maintain the contact with her so that there is the chance of patching up. if she's unwilling and thinking of excuses to break-up then it is useless for you to try to keep her with you rite..<br><br>i believe wat u want is her heart.. not just a dead body walking ard with you and her heart probably somewhere else... so do think about it and talk it out with her...communication is a very impt tool.<br><br>she may end up with another guy and realise that she was dumb to let u go.. or she might be happy with her new love.. in any way she will be happy.. and the same will happen to you too.. its part and parcel of the love life so dun brood over it and affect ur life.<br><br>good luck to your studies as well...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are going overseas soon..I dun really encourage a patching back.<br>I've been through a LDR for six months too..and it's really tough. Furthermore, me and my bf have been together for more than 3 yrs..and the relationship is very stable..it wasn't easy either..which is partly why I'm now here with him in Perth. I've also come here for further studies after my degree.<br>If a relationship is not strong, it will not to easy to withstand the test of distance. And from your description..ur relationship is terribly weak. Even if you patch back, high chance is that it won't last.<br>I bet your gf still doesn't know about your going overseas decision. If you patch back with her, and she hears about this news, do you think she will be able to accept the decision? And you have been doing all these behind her, not letting her know?<br>I dunno for her..but if it's me..I would not have been able to accept it. For me, it was already tough going through that six months though I have 3 yrs of memories to get me through the lonely nights..and it is the strong love for my bf that I didn't stray. For a weak relationship..it will be easier for the gal to stray if the guy is not with her most of the time and not there for her most of the time.<br>Why do you think so many guys lose their gfs while in NS? Not to mention going overseas.<br>My advice..leave it as it is. Better let her know you are leaving soon too. If it 'wakes' her up that she is going to lose you soon, she might realise inside her, she really wants to be with you, and is willing to wait for you, then good for you. If not, better remain as friends..cos we never know what will happen in the future.</div>

And from your description..ur relationship is terribly weak. Even if you patch back, high chance is that it won't last.<br>I bet your gf still doesn't know about your going overseas decision. If you patch back with her, and she hears about this news, do you think she will be able to accept the decision? And you have been doing all these behind her, not letting her know?<br>I dunno for her..but if it's me..I would not have been able to accept it. For me, it was already tough going through that six months though I have 3 yrs of memories to get me through the lonely nights..and it is the strong love for my bf that I didn't stray. For a weak relationship..it will be easier for the gal to stray if the guy is not with her most of the time and not there for her most of the time.<br>Why do you think so many guys lose their gfs while in NS? Not to mention going overseas.<br>My advice..leave it as it is. Better let her know you are leaving soon too. If it 'wakes' her up that she is going to lose you soon, she might realise inside her, she really wants to be with you, and is willing to wait for you, then good for you. If not, better remain as friends..cos we never know what will happen in the future.</div></blockquote>Hey, thks to all. I felt really better now. Perhaps time do heal the pain. Seems like almost all wans me to step back.

What you should do is lay all your cards on the table for her, meaning you must communicate with her directly... yes I know its hard for you ppl to do so but you MUST. Communication is the key to most problems, communicate and be straight with her, she must also be straight with you.<br><br>You must tell her your troubles and why you behaved the way you did, which she found negative.<br><br>But from what you say... she MAY want to patch up because she said let things take their natural course.</div>
