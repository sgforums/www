            <div class='col-md body'>I think you don't have to worry about your company jeopardise your new job. Every employee have EVERY right to look for a new job - so what if your reason to leave is to find new job? To label you as dishonest is simply them trying to make things difficult for you.<br><br>I think your company's HR policy has serious problems to resort to this. And unless they can prove that your part time studies affect your job performance, they can't force you to stop studying what.<br><br>Well, I htink it is obvious from ur description that your company doesn't give a damn about you or your future. Since you have already made the decision to move on, just do it. You don't owe the company its future.</div>

Don't listen to their advices if they aren't making sense, to the extend of overwriting the norm in society. Realise this, we're all living and working in an environment that is missing in common sense.<br><br>Well, if you have to work under this kind of management who thinks lowly of you...might as well quit again and never to return. It's not as if you cannot find a job elsewhere, but make sure your management feels your loss. To put it bluntly, if they can hire someone else better..they would've already done so.<br><br>Working and slogging your life off for a company just isn't going to work out for us Singaporeans right now. Since there isn't a job security in the market nowadays, then why should employees still hold onto the loyalty in work?<br><br>Accusing you of lying? Tell them bluntly that leaving is the best course of action for you as it is unreasonable for the company to advise employees against further studying outside working hours. Outside working hours, it is none of their business. They don't hire you for 24hrs a day....at least it seems that they do think that they own you 24hrs a day as long as you're employed by them. I got out of my previous job cos one SILLY MALAYSIAN think he owns me after working hours. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Anyway, change your mindset...there should be no loyalty to your work and company regardless of how much you loved your job. But only be loyal to the money that they are paying you every month. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good Luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

But everytime when my management asked me to quit my studies , I just feel that its not worth working there since they only care more about the project than my well being.<br><br>Plus Im sure the amount of task I am taking does not justify the amount of $$ I take home.<br><br>I continued and help just because I felt grateful to the company for giving me a chance to work during the times when I was still a freshie. But I really was confused when my studies/life was put into jeopardy.<br><br>I just do not want to initate any burning of bridges but I guess my management have already start the burning.<br><br>Just worried that my company may go jeopardise my career path when my new company may need to know what I do in my past job. So I hope I can explain clearly but.....<br><br>State of confusion</div></blockquote>eh, brother.....<br>at least wait till you find a job before you leave this job mah....this is wiser...<br><br>so please be on the lookout for jobs while you are free...go to job fair, open your ears, listen to what people say about job offers...then apply and go for interview or wat...when confirmed...then quit your present job... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just remember, there is no loyalty in working life. Management is trying to squeeze as much out of you as possible for the $$ they pay you. If they can get away with it without employing another person to share out the workload, you can bet they will do it. The bottom line looks good - one person can do so many things...<br><br>Your objective is to do the "least" for the $$ they pay you. It's not how hard you work, it's how "smart" you work. Work the minimum and show management you're doing great stuff for them... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Every organization is like a tree full of monkeys.
