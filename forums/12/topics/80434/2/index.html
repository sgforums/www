It may be a cruel thing but if u keep the baby, how are you going to bring up the kid? The girl can't even support herself. She has to borrow money from her family and friends, and if they refuse to lend, how?? And also, is she able to give up her social life to take care of the baby?? Parenting is for a lifetime... She can't just leave her baby at home, then go out with her friends rite? She might end up detesting the baby for destroying her life.<br>She might face another problem if she finds a new boyfriend. Not all guys are able to accept a woman with a kid that is not his. How will his parents think of her??<br><br>It's really a personal choice. Whether abortion is right or wrong, depends on the individual. Doesn't mean a girl who has had an abortion is a cruel person. It's juz a choice that she has made.</div></blockquote>Fully agree ! Too many implications and too many uncertainty. If you think of bringing the child into the world, you must also consider if you can fully provide for the child and bring the child up well. Dun hate yourself or the child in the future and bring up a dysfunctional family.<br><br>Yes there is adoption but when you have made the decision to bring that kid into the world, your first maternal instinct when you see the newborn after all the labour pain etc is to KEEP the BABY and refuse adoption. Giving away a baby isn't as easy as just giving away a favourite toy. So in the midst of uncertainty and being financially unstable etc, you will still wanna keep the baby even though you are not able to provide for him or her.<br><br>Neverthelss, i must add, those teenage girls who bring the baby to term and managed to give him/her up for adoption have my respect. However, I dun think it's cruel or self fish to go through an abortion, it takes alot of courage and emotional pain to go through with it, especially when you are going through it alone.</div>
