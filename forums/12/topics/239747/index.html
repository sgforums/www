            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i admit i'm a very shy person. Like, immensely shy. When i meet new people, i shut myself up like a clam, especially if it's a girl.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Also, i have a quiet personality, which i have no idea if it is something i'm born with, or something that stems from my shyness...<br><br>I have been quite an introvert from young, never ever being confident and upbeat much in front of people. Case in point, stupid as it sounds, i would always "run away" when seeing classmates or familiar people on the streets. I would call that extreme shyness and insecurity...<br><br>Insecurity is also another issue, i always feel people looking at me when i'm on the streets or anywhere for the matter. It's like a paronoia of mine...it's dumb, i know nobody is even looking at me, but still...the feeling lingers. It causes me to fidget in public whenever i suddenly feel that all the eyes are turned on me. I keep telling myself that no-one is looking but the annoying feeling is still present.<br><br>What made me type this post out is due to a recent party i attended. Well, in the party, i knew almost no one except maybe the host and 2 friends. The party turnout was more than 30 people so the odds were stacked against me socially...and of course, my shyness does not help at all...<br><br>I felt pathetic there, i wished i could dig a hole in the floor and hide there for the duration of the party. Everyone has their own group to party at...it could be partly the fault of the host, who did not personally as a person, introduce me to the other guests, but still...<br><br>I see people coming in, who were most probably educated in schools like ACS and those more english speaking schools who have confidence above anything, they entered and took over the room with their charisma and knack for talking.

I just want tips from you people, what should i do to gain my confidence and any tips to avoid problems like mine?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What you lack and need is confidence + determination to overcome this shyness. You see, it is a vicious circle that you have to break out. Otherwise, you'll be trapped in it and the longer you remain trapped, the worse things become.<br><br>Whenever you feel shy doing anything, ask yourself why and what is the worst case scenario. In most cases, any fear you feel is merely psychological and irrational. If this is the case, your head must take over control of your heart and force yourself to carry out the act. Once your head taking overcontrol of your heart becomes a habit, it becomes automatic liao. Especiallywhen your act is successful (like getting to know a girl for example), it will encourage you to repeat the act. In no time, you'll find that the act is no big deal and your shyness has been unwarranted. If you become addicted to carrying out the act, you develop a thick skin and voila, your shyness has been overcome and you are now pah buay see.....!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! What I would like to say is that I also have the same problem. I too, have also ask this question over and over again. Why am I like this and all the replay I get is the same, like what you are getting now. I even go far beyond in reading those self-help books. It did me no good. I maybe crazy, but somehow, somewhere inside me just don't want to change. Its sad really. Sometimes just too angry with myself why others can and I can't. WHY WHY WHY! I don't have the answer as I too am looking for it. I just wish I would really wake up my stupid idea and really break out of the stupid habit. Feel so longly, useless, depress,...<br><br>- just wanted to share my feeling with you, your not the only one</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm to overcome shyness,i think you should start to boost your confidence,one way to be confident,maybe you could try to make yourself look good?<br>Actually i am also quite shy when in a big group of people whom i do not know well.Why don't you start to get to know one person from the group well first before expanding your social circle,to the rest of the group?<br>And when talking to people,try to maintain eye contact,if you are really shy,try to cough abit ,i don't know if this sounds stupid,but it work for me when i feel shy hahah.<br>Don't be sad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i used to share your problem. but i finally got sick of it and i decided to run for the for the student council in my school. the election process forced me to speak to thousands of students. i am still quite shy but after the incident, i felt so much more confident of myself and my ability to communicate. i got elected and throughout my council term i have improved a lot.<br><br>try getting yourself into any situation that will force you to speak up. it will really help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well reading self-help books, attending seminars, etc will help only that much. Ultimately, its about you yourself taking the first step to overcome the challenge about your shyness.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>"The best way to overcome Fear is to face Fear himself.

True, the host could not possibly intro everyone to me.

            <div class='col-md body'>I also have some of your traits. I managed to only glance through, but as to the party thing....OMG I would not even considered going to such a party, because i think <strong>ANY</strong> normal person would be socially uncomfortable in such a situation. I once overheard a conversation where the person also commented that he felt uncomfortable at a party, coz he did not know much person. And the person's job actually required him to be quite outgoing, very confident of himself etc . So to conclude, it was probably the situation more than anything.</div>

If you really mind so much how people might look at you.. Then be FRIENDLY to them! End of the day if you don't get to mix around with people or you don't make any new friends, it's NOT because you're unfriendly! It's because they are! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
