            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys. I am a 16-year-old secondary four student (male), and I am self-conscious and frustrated about my lisp. I had one since I was young and people have teased me about it. I have difficulty pronouncing c's, s's, x's and z's, and mispronounce them as th's. It is so serious that people have told me they cannot understand what I am trying to say. I have become so self-conscious and frustrated about my lisp that I am afraid to speak in public now and when I do speak I try to avoid using any words with the "s" sound. This is very troubling.

Though communications is a very important part of our life, luckily to speak, talking is not the only form of communication. I know people who are like you and I believe it isn't really bothering them that much? Perhaps at your current age, people around you are still relatively young and tends to be more insensitive. As you grow older and strengthen your ties with the people around you, such a kind of probelm can be slowly overcomed. And it's also believe that the more you're too wary of such a problem, the worse it'll become. Sure you can improve yourself on that problem, but try to be more positive about it? At least it's not a physical inability, so through all mean... WORK on it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
