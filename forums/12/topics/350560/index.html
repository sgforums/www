But æˆ‘å¿�ã€‚ <br> He looks down on females so much , it gets to my nerves. Yes,I'm talking about the male chauvinist boyfriend.<br> There are females in his company who are VPs , MDs, AVPs .<br> To that, he will say "oh they are useless, they can't do anything
                  right. They don't even know what's going on, they only make matters
                  worse etc and </span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> because they are females that's why couldn't do things well. </span><span style="font-size: xx-small;">" </span><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Of
              course there are female bosses who are not very useful to the coy but
              It just boils inside me when the view points he makes is so sexist and
              disrespectful.<br> Eg, we are on the topic of engineering.. he mentioned about his girl
                  friend taking engineering in uni because her results are too poor to
                  get into business course. He will go on, alot of people who are in
                  engineering (he is in business) have no choice but to choose engin
                  because their results are too bad to enter business school. <br> I was quite surprised and replied, that's true but there must be some
                  who really likes engineering and think that's the course for them <br> He: Oh but never the girls. I've never seen girls who are good in
                  engin. It's always the guys who are better and even in business school
                  it's the guys as well. <br> Me: but there must be females who scores well too<br> He: It's so rare that i've never met one. Oh and anyway ,are there any great inventors who are females ?<br> I can't think of any in the older days so i kept quiet.. to that he raised his voice, "none! " <br> </span><span style="font-size: xx-small;">I used to complain about my work as well but due
                  to his incessant  negative views on females' cabability, i just hate to
                  share my woes with him anymore. <br> By the way, i am earning as much as he does although he is a degree
                  grad and i'm a diploma holder. And i'm 8 years younger than him. <br> We have been living with each other for coming two years.<br> <br> Is it really common still for guys to have this kind of thinking
                  nowadays? SHould i just shrug my shoulders each time he does it again
                  or should i better make my move from him if i want some respect? </span></span></p>

              <p>Perhaps his overwhelming ego, make him looks down on female. Does his workplace have female colleagues too? Maybe someday he will get reprimanded by those ppl there, who knows.

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">yup there are females at his workplace... they told him
              to control his temper sometimes but other than that he is quite alright
              at work. females or other departments liasing with him tend to like working with him cuz he always help out to get their things done
              quickly and i can't deny the fact that his analytical skills are quite
              good as well.Well , i did give him the cold shoulder before and it worsens the situation. He will end up saying gals are always very narrow minded and pick at everything guys do . SO i can't even have the right to say what i think is right? ... </span></p>
              <p>So, i never give cold shoulder anymore , he doesn't deserve to be treated that way (quotedfrom him). Of course, for this rs's sake, it doesn't serve any purpose for more quarrels if he doesn't open up to my views too.</p>

              <p>Thanks for replying.</p>
              <p>Parn,</p>
              <p>He did menton his mum was narrow minded among the other fonder memories he has of her.</p>
              <p>Recently
                  he axed a female expatriate colleague (indirectly by informing his
                  bosses about her complacency at work) After sharing with me for a month
                  about this woman who is highly overpaid based on the quality of work
                  done by her , couldn't even do <em>kindergarden</em> work and even cried
                  once while working, needed coaxing and whats not. I did wanted to voice
                  out but i prompt myself as i'm only there to listen to him and not
                  strike another quarrel.</p>
              <p>However, at times , when he caught me
                  looking totally pissed with what he said, he will say he treats me
                  differently from other people and he sees me as his equal.</p>
              <p>He was silent about his perspectives during the first year of the rs until i asked him to share more about his views and for me to share mine with him as well. Now, i will avoid discussions about sexism or corporate issues or anything relating to bias of sexes to prevent provoking him or myself..</p>
              <p>It does become mentally restraining overtime and my colleagues did mention about my changes.. and hell , to me it definitely is a sign of weakness..but i wouldn't want to give up yet..which i always remind myself..</p>
              <p>To <a href="../../../users/80958">ShrodingersCat</a>, Other than being a guy who is more than strong on his stubborn opinions , he is a funny and interesting character and i thus cherish the rs which we have thus far..  though at times it could be infuriating but ironically  i never feel i'm wasting my time with him...</p>

              <p>But as a guy i do share some of his feelings about female co workers.</p>
              <p>i started working under capable female managers for whom sex didn't play a part in carrying out their duties as managers. but when i switch companies i had to work with other female bosses who actually thought their places were suppose to be at home and not in the work place even though the one(s) on top choosed them to be there based on track record. this was something that influenced me to quit at at least 2 places as i didn't want to work with a female boss who blames her own sex for her shortcomings.it was demoralising to work with people who kept saying stuff like "oh its ok if i do that or if i can't do that because i'm a girl mah"</p>
              <p>and after working for a few years more often than not, female co-workers i had were like your boyfriend said, "useless" so maybe thats where his thinking came from? i found that my original female managers were a rarity, most women i worked with, practically had no ambitions at all of climbing all the way, only concerned with getting a rich husband or a comfortable position and then stay there with minimium responsibilities.</p>
              <p>one of my co workers wanted to just marry young and stay at home. i actually made sure i supported her bf's decision for her to continue working if they're married whenever we talked about it.</p>
              <p>.I'm not a degree holder myself but from what i hear from my brother and friends they tend to have pretty negative impressions of fellow female degree holders. business or otherwise. most stories revolved around not turning up or not doing their share of work with excuses like "i don't know how to do, why don't you help me". without the same problem coming from guys.  so that might have coloured his views too.</p>

              <p>not really, i see people as individuals, not as sex. i firmly believe if you're going to come out into the society to work you better don't give me bullshit like "i can't do this because i'm a girl." i consider this equality, i certainly don't expect girls to go around carrying heavy loads in my job but you should at least hold yourself responsible for your jobscope.</p>
              <p>as mentioned i had a very good opinion of one of my first female managers, i even rated her more highly than other male managers i've worked with so far but thing is she's a rarity.</p>
