              <p>"Do you love me? " can be interpreted as "Do you hate me?"</p>
              <p>Just as a half glass full of water can be viewed as a half glass empty of water.</p>
              <p>Hence, looking from his point of view, the question "Do you love me?" means he is worried that you will leave him one day. This is probably due to he sense some changes in you. He is trying to look for some assurance from you. With no answer from you, he remind you that he still loves you because of all the things he did for you in the past but not complaining.</p>
              <p>Well, you may find these hard to believe. Especialy, women claimed that they have strong intuition. Ya ya ya... oh well, that is why they say men are from mars... women are from venus...</p>
              <p>You may feel that the glass is half full but not neccessary it is the truth. You may feel that the glass is going to be empy but not neccessary it will be. If both of you sense differently, set a tangible measurable scale to gauge the feelings. Make it standard, fair and dont take it for granted.</p>
              <p>If you feel too bothered, then please by all means leave him. It is good for him. It is good for you.</p>

              <p>Sometimes it gets so frustrating talking to him. But æˆ‘å¿�ã€‚</p>
              <p>He looks down on females so much , it gets to my nerves. Yes,I'm
                      talking about the male chauvinist boyfriend.</p>
              <p>There are females in his company who are VPs , MDs, AVPs .</p>
              <p>To that, he will say "oh they are useless, they can't do
                      anything right. They don't even know what's going on, they only
                      make matters worse etc and because they are females that's why
                      couldn't do things well. " Of course there are female bosses who
                      are not very useful to the coy but <em><strong>It just boils inside me when the
                      view points he makes is so sexist and disrespectful.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>I used to complain about my work as well but due to his
                      incessant  negative views on females' cabability, i just hate
                      to share my woes with him anymore.</strong></em></p>
              <p>By the way, i am earning as much as he does although he is a
                      degree grad and i'm a diploma holder. And i'm 8 years younger than
                      him.</p>
              <p>We have been living with each other for coming two years.</p>
              <p>Is it really common still for guys to have this kind of thinking
                      nowadays? Should i just shrug my shoulders each time he does it
                      again or should i better make my move from him if i want some
                      respect?</p>

              <p>If you can't get through a day without this affecting you and the relationship is still disintegrating after considerable effort, discard and
                                              just go onto the next.</p>
              <p>Good relationships are a combination of mutual respect, trust,
              communication and support. Do reassess the value of your
              relationship objectively. Some forumers here have given you excellent
              advice.</p>
              <p>Surely you deserve better treatment as a woman. And I'm assuming you know a good roll in the hay is not enough to garner the respect you want from your man. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p>Chin up and take care. </p>

It just so happened that you're convinced i've sexual issues when i didn't even mention it in the first place ? So i'm elaborating it for you to judge whether is there a problem?

              <p><br>You are obviously talking to yourself just now. And I don't need to listen to your sex stories.</p>
              <p>You should be smarter next time and bring them to Bar, the guy forumers there might entertain and feed your homosexual fantasy.</p>

              <p>If you can't get through a day without this affecting you and
              the relationship is still disintegrating after considerable effort,
              discard and just go onto the next.</p>
              <p>Good relationships are a combination of mutual respect, trust,
              communication and support. Do reassess the value of your
              relationship objectively. Some forumers here have given you
              excellent advice.</p>
              <p>Surely you deserve better treatment as a woman. And I'm assuming
              you know a good roll in the hay is not enough to garner the respect
              you want from your man. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p>Chin up and take care. </p>

              <p>Thanks for replying. Good news he has become patient and showed in other ways that he is willing to
              give this rs another chance and I'm going to compromise as well and i think this might be a good start to bring the relationship to a new level. . Thanks for your suggestions!</p>
              <p>Gedanken, Thank you for you valuable advises, your patience and time. Your questions make my mind clearer. He has made the change for us and i really do feel it just might work out fine. But if things turn out otherwise, i know what to do . Your words are at the back of my mind and i am certain my chain of thoughts won't be going in circles again. Thank you.</p>
