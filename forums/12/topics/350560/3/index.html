              <p>Ah, familiarity breeds contempt.  You've probably heard it said that relationships take work - this fellow obviously hasn't listened.</p>
              <p>To be fair, I'd see it more of a case of his being complacent, rather than of him wanting to get rid of you.</p>

              <p>As i'm the easily influenced, i agree with what you say.</p>
              <p>When we're in a heated argument which can't seem to come to a solution , i do have thoughts of giving it up.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, he does most of the talking ... on and on.. sometimes, i was there keeping up with the first half of his grievances , but for the 2nd half, it gets too tiring to even response, i can only see his mouth moving.</p>
              <p>Sometimes,i would imagine he is telling a joke and his funny faces... when i woke" up, he is still there, grumbling about all the things he had sacrificed for me. It felt like years had passed me by and i stood there looking at how a year had passed me by, motionless. I was thinking " unless i change to become what he wants me to be which is everything that i am not now , or we will always be in this state.No. Or even if i changed to become what he wants me to be, we will still be in this state. Because, expectations are ever changing.</p>
              <p>I don't know why, but i still feel the excitement when he smiles at me and calls me darling. Or the thought of how he used to be there and make all things possible for me.</p>
              <p>I don't go out with other guys anymore, since he emphasized it's not right to be going out with guys who likes me. Now, barely anyone of their contacts still exist in my mobile. Other than my boss whom i work closely with.</p>
              <p>Is it still possible for him to be head over heels with me again? I always thought this solves everything(or does it?), as long as he is still very interested in me, no matter how bad the relationship is , a willing mind will turn it all around.</p>

              <p>As i'm the easily influenced, i agree with what you say.</p>
              <p>When we're in a heated argument which can't seem to come to a solution , i do have thoughts of giving it up.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, he does most of the talking ... on and on.. sometimes, i was there keeping up with the first half of his grievances , but for the 2nd half, it gets too tiring to even response, i can only see his mouth moving.</p>
              <p>Sometimes,i would imagine he is telling a joke and his funny faces... when i woke" up, he is still there, grumbling about all the things he had sacrificed for me. It felt like years had passed me by and i stood there looking at how a year had passed me by, motionless. I was thinking " unless i change to become what he wants me to be which is everything that i am not now , or we will always be in this state.No. Or even if i changed to become what he wants me to be, we will still be in this state. Because, expectations are ever changing.</p>
              <p>I don't know why, but i still feel the excitement when he smiles at me and calls me darling. Or the thought of how he used to be there and make all things possible for me.</p>
              <p>I don't go out with other guys anymore, since he emphasized it's not right to be going out with guys who likes me. Now, barely anyone of their contacts still exist in my mobile. Other than my boss whom i work closely with.</p>
              <p>Is it still possible for him to be head over heels with me again? I always thought this solves everything(or does it?), as long as he is still very interested in me, no matter how bad the relationship is , a willing mind will turn it all around.</p>

              <p><br>Yes it is possible, but you will need to change and make yourself more attractive to him again.</p>
              <p>The problem is usually because he has already gotten used to you, who you are, how you think, your behaviour, what you think of him....and etc.</p>
              <p>Be someone different for the betterment of your current dull and boring relationship, and attract him to go after you again.</p>
              <p>Since he is not changing, which makes you easier to attract him once more. You should know how he thinks, what he likes, his behaviour, his opinions about you...and etc.</p>
              <p>Change and spark an interest in his heart once more.</p>
              <p>Most people would start changing from appearances but I would suggest you to start changing from who you are and play with his mind SEXUALLY for goodness sake!</p>
              <p>Read his mind and surprise him so that you can confuse him utterly in between your submissive-ness and dominatrix behaviour. Submit and Deny him then give in to him!</p>
              <p>Remember, be sensual....if your man doesn't burn with deep desires for you inside his heart, then you have FAILED TERRIBLY as a woman.</p>
              <p>Denied but Ruthless Temptations are probably the most powerful behaviour ever to be developed by women to be use to dominate men. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Forget about who you are right now, it doesn't matters anymore because you are going to CHANGE.  </p>
              <p>If you don't know what you need to do, then you should knock your head against the wall and then sit down and think about the MEN you knew and their deep desires about WOMEN. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Parn,</p>
              <p>I'm sensual and sexual so much so that he asked " will i leave him if he is not able to make love to me anymore?"  If you would like me to go a little further , i can say , we never have a day without the loving sessions until i've started this thread because a sudden surge of realisation dawned on me ! perhaps the problem is really us and not the sex which what they always say is the best method to keep the man's heart with you. Seriously, i squirt juices more than his cum. I'm horny and sexual, i am usually turn on when he is around because i am hardly clothe. Perhaps only undies. I will finger myself , vibrator , touch him all over , wet kisses , sit on his lap and do anything to turn him on and make me squirt. The most loving time of a day will be after sessions, we'll hug to sleep, After we wake up, sessions repeat and we're off to do our own things and quarrels begins.</p>
              <p>On some ocassions , i got scolded for the one who is controlling the rs, why didn't i know? now, to think about it, it's nt me. It's the lust which is the controller .</p>
              <p>I did try changing and appearing more serious when i'm with him until he starts to touch me all over , how to change? off to another session!</p>
