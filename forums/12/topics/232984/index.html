            <div class='col-md body'>i have a brother, an addictive smoker. he is always hiding in his room smoking. though there is no direct contact as he always close his door, however the whole living room is infested with the cigarettes smell whenever he does that. I can smell it even though i close my door as well.<br>I have had several big fights with him over this, but he jus dun realise he is making the whole family suffer his second hand smoke. as he usually smoke in the late nights, so my parents are usually asleep and they dun realise but when i went into their room, i can smell it as well.<br><br>i am tired of quarrelling with him, everytime i scold him, he will jus scold me back and tell me to shut up. i also dun wanna wake my parents up with our fights. i have told my parents about this. they are concerned too but they could do nothing about it. each time he will jus tell them ok ok, but still he never stops.<br><br>my biggest worry is that all of us are in big risk of getting lung cancer though my family dun smoke.<br><br>what should i do?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Vel,<br><br>I can understand your concern for your bro and your family members. But I hope you are old enough to realize that your brother too is a human being, and has a right to choices. He made a choice to smoke, did it in his room, not infront of you or your parents out of respect. What more you want from him?<br><br>Don't discriminate against your brother just because he is a smoker. He's human too, and everybody's got a vice, one or another. I know you care for him, but love him for who he is too.</div>
