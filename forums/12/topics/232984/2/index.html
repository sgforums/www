            <div class='col-md body'>Ugh.. I know how you feel.  My dad was a terrible chain smoker.. he closed the door to his room, but the smoke would waft into our rooms, and we kids would all wake up in the middle of the night  everyday breathless and coughing because the smoke was so thick.  One of my siblings developed a shortness of breath, but that wasn't enough to convince him to stop.  Just like your bro, he never listened to us and often scolded us for broaching the topic.<br><br>He's passed away prematurely, because of heart problems perpetuated by his smoking habit.<br><br>Sometimes people block their ears out to whatever they don't want to hear... unfortunately this is a personal decision your bro has to make.  If your bro doesn't listen to family, maybe he'll listen to friends.  If you know a friend of his, maybe you can seek help discreetly.<br><br>In the meantime, I find that <strong>apples, vinegar and lots of fresh air</strong> do a mighty good job of removing smoke odor from a room - that is, until the smoke starts coming again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think i understand the threadstarter.<br><br>a) TS needs help in getting the brother to stop smoking in the house.<br><br>b) TS concerned about health of all family members. Parents, herself and smoker sibling.<br><br>c) TS is sharing this information out to create more awareness.<br><br>Hope, i am right on all the above.<br>I am a smoker. 27 yrs old. I smoked since 13yrs old.<br><br>For those who says that smoking in own room is already give enough face and considerate enough, i beg to differ.<br><br>I suppose those that still smoke at home regardless of non-smoking aging parents/siblings/kids,<br><br>1) either you a selfish and self centered person as you take comfort and pleasure at the sake of others.   and/or<br>2) too young to really understand what is respect/concern/care/consideration especially to your own family.<br>and/or<br>3)You managed to get your own place by your own means.<br><br>There could be lots of reasons why... but before i carry on, i think i should talk about myself.<br><br>When i was young around 13+, i smoked because i was working. May sound lame, but the cigarettes made me looked 'adult' and 'cool' so i could blend in the environment. Now people smoke because friends smoke.<br>Guess its the same? To blend in and not to be left out.<br><br>The other reason was i needed the light. I was afraid of ghost at that time and the only light i had was my cigarette. It was my friend and buddy and bodyguard and 'Holy fire' to ward off evil. I had to walk a long distance of dark deserted road after work in the wee hours.<br><br>Ok, now about smoking at home. My own experience.<br>13+ yrs old: i don't dare let parents know. Dad cancer, Mum high blood.<br>Fom 16+yrs old onwards: i started to smoke in toilets, late nights at home. Dad died from cancer.<br>From 17yrs onwards: I smoke in rooms, toilets, living room anywhere i want, anytime i want. I thought i had grown up. I thought why cannot.<br>Around 21yrs old til now: Had lots of experiences in life throughout. Still learning things now.<br><br>Then i realised the world don't only revolve around me and how i am going to do things. After so many years, then i woke up from my hatred and selfishness. I learnt sometimes,<br>1. Giving consideration is recieving consideration.<br>2. Respect if not given is not recieved. Respect is earned over time.<br>3. A man should take more pain and strain to improve.<br><br>In short, i hope the threadstarter and family will be able to get it worked out.<br>And i hope more smokers will be like me, smoke out of the house, don't make others suffer while we smoke with pleasure. Some more is our loved ones who already sound out distress.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>VEL VEL, ok i can appreciate ur frustration over the issue of health.It looks to me u r quite obsessed about it which is still understandable.It also occurs to me that u have a highly sensitive nose too and again thats not ur problem either.It is crystal clear that ur brother is the issue now.Did u ever have a heart to heart chat with him instead of blasting him up everytime u see or smell him smoking?Try the soft approach for a change.I dont know abt u but for me siblings r like once in a lifetime thing.No matter what happens,family is still most important to me.We could scream and shout at each other but at the end of the day,we always remind ourselves that we r family and as in ur case,he is ur brother, not just any good friend or office/school buddy or ur favourite idol for that matter,he is more than that.......he cannot be replaced or be discarded.Just like the Moderator,I am curious abt ur age too.I also hope that u do not hate him for smoking.Perhaps how abt having a family meeting and let everyone know u r dead serious abt this situation and that this must be resolved asap.And when u chair this meeting,pls control ur emotions and speak in a nice tone and manner but of course,project a serious look on ur face to show u mean business.Let ur parents make the final decision.There must  be a compromise somewhere along the line.If things still do not go ur way,it looks like u have to make the next and ultimate move by staying away from your home more often than usual.I am not inducing u to run away but to make a statement.And from there we shall see what kind of reaction u will get from ur parents.Dear lady,i also hope to remind u that in life,things usually do not go ur way as often as u wish.In fact,most of the time they never do.Pls try to improvise to overcome difficulties preferably with a cool head. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

But I hope you are old enough to realize that your brother too is a human being, and has a right to choices. He made a choice to smoke, did it in his room, not infront of you or your parents out of respect. What more you want from him?<br><br>Don't discriminate against your brother just because he is a smoker. He's human too, and everybody's got a vice, one or another. I know you care for him, but love him for who he is too.</div></blockquote>I would like to make a few points regarding your post.<br><br>I sure am old enough to know that everyone is entitled to personal choices. Going by your sentence, i assume u are saying personal right is more important than consideration for others? i jus like to add on that we are not the only one living in this world. everything we do, should not be done at the expense of other people. only then, people will respect u for the choices u made.<br><br>I do not think that by smoking in own room is showing respect for own family, simply because everyone has already expressed their objections as everyone is concerned about his health and the air pollution situation in the house. By ignoring own family's pleas and exposing parents to second hand smoke is respect?<br><br>Lastly, i dun discriminate him nor any smokers. I jus wish for him to spare a thought for others before indulging in his own pleasure.<br><br></div>

My dad was a terrible chain smoker.. he closed the door to his room, but the smoke would waft into our rooms, and we kids would all wake up in the middle of the night  everyday breathless and coughing because the smoke was so thick.  One of my siblings developed a shortness of breath, but that wasn't enough to convince him to stop.  Just like your bro, he never listened to us and often scolded us for broaching the topic.<br><br>He's passed away prematurely, because of heart problems perpetuated by his smoking habit.<br><br>Sometimes people block their ears out to whatever they don't want to hear... unfortunately this is a personal decision your bro has to make.  If your bro doesn't listen to family, maybe he'll listen to friends.  If you know a friend of his, maybe you can seek help discreetly.<br><br>In the meantime, I find that [b]apples, vinegar and lots of fresh air</strong> do a mighty good job of removing smoke odor from a room - that is, until the smoke starts coming again.[/b]</blockquote>thanks a lot for your suggestions.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>usu when the smoke gets too bad, i either spray a lot of perfume in the room or i will open every possible window and opening in the house to circulate while i escape from the house.<br><br></div>
