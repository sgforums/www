            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...the reason why people felt like this is because of a sheer lack of self-confidence. People with self-confidence are always the people with a lot of friends. People are naturally attracted to people with self-confidence...so go and cultivate some self-confidence in yourself and feel good about yourself first. Pick up a hobby, listen to some nice motivation music/songs, do something that you are good at...be it playing games or drawing or any sports. They will make you feel good about yourself. Next, you need to rearrange your mindset to think positively. I know it is not easy to do it if I tell you to do it sincerely. So I would tell you not to do it sincerely instead. Go ahead and lie to yourself in order to think positively when the situation requires you to do so. Lie to yourself shamelessly by convincing yourself that you are the king of the world...if that will make you think and view the situation positively. Never think negatively or you will fall back into your own self-destructive pattern.<br><br>Nobody can give you back your own confidence except yourself. Regain your self-confidence once again and this type of problem/trouble/worries will not bother you again.<br><br>Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

You know the sort where the differents heads think alike. We would go out to orchard road on weekends jus to chill out, go fishing, DIY camping, window shopping, looking at girls and all that. Life was so carefree back then.. cos my frens stayed nearby my block and so almost everyday we would hangout after school to talk crap abt school and all that bull.<br><br>My life faced a drastic change when I stepped into a tertiary sch. More of a culture shock really. There were so many 'fake' ppl in my school and I kinda despised them. When I was in my first year, I didn't have much frens. More of a loner. I was mighty depressed that time and I tried to call back and hangout with those school frens of mine. We met up once in a while and noticed that my frens were no longer the same ppl as I knew them years ago. Everyone got together and brag how cool their school were and how many gerls they dated (ok ok, my tertiary school back then was so uncool. I shall not say out what school that is). Boasting is the main thing in our conversations.<br><br>And yes... I was so depressed. Very.<br><br>When I was in 2nd year, I joined music club. So from there, I tried to open up myself and make more frens. At least better a bit. I managed to play in school concerts. It was cool lah. But still I was kinda shy towards gerls. Yeah I don't even have gerl-frens.<br><br>Enuff of school life.. As usual, went to NS and spent 2 and a half years there. I still don't have any girl-frens that time.. still anti social...haha.. I get to know a few gerls and yeah.. from there.. i did try and error thing.. and uh.. 'i failed'.. you know.. those relationship things.<br><br>And now, I'm in the workforce. The first two years in the workforce was kinda sad because of the transition from school/ns life to real life. It's quite an eye opener to see that there are lot of politics in a workplaces. Backstabbing, unwilling to share knowledge by seniors and all that shit. So my life was more like work, going home, work, going home and the cycle repeats itself. You may ask where are school, NS frens.. they are settling down. Those buaya frens of mine during school time.. yes.. they are settling down.<br><br>I know how you feel dude..<br><br>But now, my life... can say that it's much more happening. I helped my fren doing flea marts, hanging out wif a fren of mine who likes to club (i also follow him clubbing), play in gigs (i got a band lah) and from there, I try to socialise and do some 'networking'. At this point in time, I've met lots ppl form walks of life... some are cool to hangout with and some I really detest.<br><br>Well back to the point.. everyone do feel lonely at times. Me too. We have to face it lah. It's a matter of how you deal with it.<br><br>Maybe u can try befriend back those fellas which u feel u can relate to. Hang out with them, go play pool or go clubbing with them, whateverlah.. Try to stay away from those manic depressives.. this group of ppl can only make u feel worse.<br><br>It seems that u have low self-esteem problem. U should love yourself more dude. Every morning, look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself what kind of person you are looking at. Have more confidence. Smile always. Be more outgoing.. not to the extent of being pretentious(well.. girls nowadays are like that! Outgoing, outgoing.. but so fake! hehe..)<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth.. Feel good about yourself...<br><br>P/S: What kind of person yr gfren is? Wat's makes her so famous?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't worry, I have the same problem as you. I always wonder why people never really bothers to ask me out. But it turn out to be my own problem. I mean they used to ask me out, I always rejected them because I dislike group outing and there are always a few people whom I do not like in the group. Overtime, they grew tired and stop asking me out.<br><br>Also, I only talk to people I close to... It's hard for me to make new friends as I'm very reserved. And I also do not want to take the intiative to call or meet up with them because I am afraid of rejection. I rather myself rejecting them than they rejecting me. It's all ego and stuff... and I do have low self esteem too.. I always have a feeling that they dislike me or something.. and dun tok to them much...<br><br>So like me, the best solution is to sit down and think what have gone wrong. Nobody knows you better than yourself. Once you found out the problem, rectified it, and hopefully, things will go better..<br><br>For me, I'm more open now and I usually will go anywhere as long as people ask me out. But there are still room for improvement.</div>
