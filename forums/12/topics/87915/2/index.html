            <div class='col-md body'>Came across this story in NewMan mag that bears such an uncanny resemblance to mineÂ…<br><br>Â“ In the last few years, IÂ’ve lost clubbing kakis, gym buddies, a well-heeled friend let us use his condo pool, and even Sir Fix-a-Lot, the guy who could sort out just about anything, especially computers (If there was a girl version of him out there, IÂ’d marry her in an instant).<br>By comparison, my girlfriend never seems to lose her friends. On any given Friday night, her phone would be ringing off the hook. SheÂ’d literally fending off invitations to go out with her army of gal pals. Meanwhile, I be staring at my phone, anxiously waiting for a call, any call. Even ones from decrepit relatives overseas suddenly sounded as inviting as a 1-900 chatlineÂ…<br><br>So why is it that I always feel like the one left without a seat when the music stops. IÂ’ve put it down to this: Guys are B****D. Based on what IÂ’ve seen, itÂ’s usually the guy who cheats on his girlfriend.<br>So the girlfriend becomes an emotional wreck and my GF &amp; I have comfort her.<br><br>And now itÂ’s time to announce the real loser here. Who could it be? Certainly not my B***D friend, now armed with his new floozy. Certainly not his ex-girlfriend, who has quickly managed to find someone better. Nor its is my girlfriend, who still has her amazing social network.<br>ThatÂ’s right, yours truly is the one left out in the cold.<br><br>Alright, technically, I could have remained friends with those guys, but that would involve finding my own bimbo to flaunt, clubbing hard &amp; throwing pool parties all the time. But IÂ’d rather be sentenced to a week in Abu Ghraib than destroy my relationship over a pimp daddy fantasyÂ…<br>While guys too enjoy shooting the breeze, topics involving in-dept character assessments would rarely be broached. We could have known each other for yonks and still not share anything remotely personal with another.Â”<br><br>By 1 of the editor of the mag.<br></div>

I think she might be angry with you for some reasons that you didn't know at that point of time. Maybe is your attitude or the way you deal with things in a relationships? Change it for the better whatever the reason is. The way your girlfriend deal with break-up may be untactful but that does not mean she hate you. You are not a unlovable human being and don't be so sensitive!<br><br>It's good to find someone to share your most intimate feelings but sometime when you are so depressed, you tend to make negative comments and some people just don't want to listen to that.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by cool_elf:<br><br>Yo dude, chill out...<br><br>At one pt in time, I went thru almost the same stage as you.<br><br>When I was in pri and sec sch, I was so happy cos I have a lot of frens around me. You know the sort where the differents heads think alike. We would go out to orchard road on weekends jus to chill out, go fishing, DIY camping, window shopping, looking at girls and all that. Life was so carefree back then.. cos my frens stayed nearby my block and so almost everyday we would hangout after school to talk crap abt school and all that bull.<br><br>My life faced a drastic change when I stepped into a tertiary sch. More of a culture shock really. There were so many 'fake' ppl in my school and I kinda despised them. When I was in my first year, I didn't have much frens. More of a loner. I was mighty depressed that time and I tried to call back and hangout with those school frens of mine. We met up once in a while and noticed that my frens were no longer the same ppl as I knew them years ago. Everyone got together and brag how cool their school were and how many gerls they dated (ok ok, my tertiary school back then was so uncool. I shall not say out what school that is). Boasting is the main thing in our conversations.<br><br>And yes... I was so depressed. Very.<br><br>When I was in 2nd year, I joined music club. So from there, I tried to open up myself and make more frens. At least better a bit. I managed to play in school concerts. It was cool lah. But still I was kinda shy towards gerls. Yeah I don't even have gerl-frens.<br><br>Enuff of school life.. As usual, went to NS and spent 2 and a half years there. I still don't have any girl-frens that time.. still anti social...haha.. I get to know a few gerls and yeah.. from there.. i did try and error thing.. and uh.. 'i failed'.. you know.. those relationship things.<br><br>And now, I'm in the workforce. The first two years in the workforce was kinda sad because of the transition from school/ns life to real life. It's quite an eye opener to see that there are lot of politics in a workplaces. Backstabbing, unwilling to share knowledge by seniors and all that shit. So my life was more like work, going home, work, going home and the cycle repeats itself. You may ask where are school, NS frens.. they are settling down. Those buaya frens of mine during school time.. yes.. they are settling down.<br><br>I know how you feel dude..<br><br>But now, my life... can say that it's much more happening. I helped my fren doing flea marts, hanging out wif a fren of mine who likes to club (i also follow him clubbing), play in gigs (i got a band lah) and from there, I try to socialise and do some 'networking'. At this point in time, I've met lots ppl form walks of life... some are cool to hangout with and some I really detest.<br><br>Well back to the point.. everyone do feel lonely at times. Me too. We have to face it lah. It's a matter of how you deal with it.<br><br>Maybe u can try befriend back those fellas which u feel u can relate to. Hang out with them, go play pool or go clubbing with them, whateverlah.. Try to stay away from those manic depressives.. this group of ppl can only make u feel worse.<br><br><span style="color: cyan;">It seems that u have low self-esteem problem. U should love yourself more dude. Every morning, look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself what kind of person you are looking at. Have more confidence. Smile always. Be more outgoing.. not to the extent of being pretentious(well.. girls nowadays are like that! Outgoing, outgoing.. but so fake! hehe..)</span><br>Just my 2 cents worth.. Feel good about yourself...<br><br><span style="color: blue;">P/S: What kind of person yr gfren is? Wat's makes her so famous? </span><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Hi, thanx for ur sincere reply.<br><br>Yup, unlke the many ppl i know, i do not rely feel veri "self-confident". If there is anyone i hate most, it's got to be myself.<br><br>Think she is not "famous"... pretty much like most of the gals i know. Guess it's jus when comparing my pathetic life to hers, my problems seemed veri magnified.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Beautiful mind,<br><br>Was reading thru your post. Haha. i've faced and still going thru this "lonely" part of my life right now. Trust me, at the end of the day, if you had not committed any thing that's not within your conscience, no fear man. I strongly do not believe in the fault being with you alone. The world itself is already screwed inside out. It does not mean people around who are more popular are better socially or physically, for all you know, they might be going thru the same patch as you, only fearing loneliness mroe than you, and succumbed to seeking "friends" and accomodating towards their behaviour.<br><br>Honestly, there are alot more things to life than just finding your "click". I am not saying you do not have to find, but i also believe circumstances and situations in life to play a role in putting the right people before you. Chill.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there,<br><br>Yeah. It gets really tiring constantly "tweaking" ur interests and self to suit the group. However, i somehow still hold faith that the "click" depends on situation and circumstances. If you wanna say friends, sure i do, hi-bye never lacking. I was once in the company of a group of friends whom really took the effort to bond and "click". They were anice bunch of friends who are proactive and warm towards me once they knew me. However, due to circumstances, these were shortlived. Sad but true, life goes on. I also feel it's good to socialise, knowing more people and stuff, but not to the extend of conforming to people whom you know deep down inside the frequency aint the same. I also empathised when you mentioned the fact that you've lost faith in friendships and relationships. I thoroughly know how that feels. Do not give up hope ya? Keep your mind open to opportunities and stuff. You'l never know what might chance upon your path.<br><br>Don't dwell to much on the down side. Life's too short. The world still spins regardless of your existence. Always feel free to share with forummers, like me, for instance.

But i know deep inside me, i was not happy. I don't feel fulfilled. I wasn't clicking with people with the same frequency<br><br>So i started to explore around, opening myself to possibilties and sourcing out potential friend who i can really click with. It's takes utmost strength to remain true to be my own self but i think it pays off.<br><br>Relationships come and go. Only afew friends that i should i hold on to. Don't despair k!
