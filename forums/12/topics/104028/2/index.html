I hope to dispense alittle of how i look at the situation from a guys point of view. Hope you don't mind.<br><br>first of all, I think for a guy to ask you to go book a table for free, is indication that hse's cheap skate enough, and he had to SMS you ard 4am to tell you how much he spent of another girl due to the fact that you didn't turn up to book the free table is a "confirmed chop and sign" that he's a cheap skate.<br><br>As a normal guy without any scheme, he would and should know his financial status before partying so late inot the night and "giving out free dinner". Asked him, why did he tell you the cost he spent? 30+50 = $90? I take it as he wanted to go on dutch with you only instead of the 3 of you. ? my my ... I think next time he will charge you by milage when he send you home!<br><br>From a sentimetal part of it, I reckon perhaps he had build up him self a story about YOU taking a fancy of him and that he's so desirable. Come on, I know girls who does that to guys, so it makes a nature course that a guy will do the same too. Except that when guys wants to do that, he's got to have the pocket to do so. Girls just had to look nice and reveal some cleavage.<br><br>So when I read your story, the first thing that strikes me was that perhaps he was making use of you to make him look good. He's taking advantage of your good nature.<br><br>Tell us, as a girl, when u are out with him alone, does he make you fel like a girl? be frank. He's helping the girl to carry luggage in HIS car. for goodness sake.<br><br>Well, just my two cents worth, if you happen to have taken a little fancy in him for what ever reason and thinks that by being helpful and "sweet" to him by asking him" Why are you angry with me?" and trying to be understanding...... my bet would be to , save it . Save it for some one who can appraciate these subtle thing in life from YOU.<br><br>Relationship is like flying a kite, there's a time to release the thread and there's a time to pull back...I think , maybe you should think about pulling back alittle and don't always expect the wind to be there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
