He's just a player, meaning that he fools around with women and uses them to his own benefits. He doesn't really care about the women around him UNLESS he is interested in her.<br><br>- On the surface, he is inviting you to disco. But his motive is to get you to book a table for him so that he can bring his female friend to the disco later.<br><br>- Think about it, he made you wait there for hours, and he didn't even bother to apologise. Doesn't that sound like you were being used? And it shows that you're not even as important as his female friend.<br><br>- The lie about the table for 3 is just to make you feel guilty, so that you will still do things for him in the future to make it up.<br><br>You must be a very soft hearted person, which is why he can manipulate you so easily. I advice you to just stay away from him, and cut off all contacts with him. You don't need such a friend!</div>

Doesn't that sound like you were being used? And it shows that you're not even as important as his female friend.<br><br>- The lie about the table for 3 is just to make you feel guilty, so that you will still do things for him in the future to make it up.<br><br>You must be a very soft hearted person, which is why he can manipulate you so easily. I advice you to just stay away from him, and cut off all contacts with him. You don't need such a friend!</div></blockquote>On the day he asked mi to go, he got tel mi the waiter's name n to look for that waiter. but i didnt know that mean he bked a table already.<br>According to his 4am sms,<br>he alrady booked a table for 30 dollars, if i didnt turn up b4 a certain time will they still hold the table for him? u been to devils bar? do they charge for booking table?</div>

If he's nothing more than a friend to you then I would suggest letting him cool down for awhile before contacting him again, if he continues to ignores you then so be it, he's not worth keeping as a fren either.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HEy .. He Owes you a dinner? .. Trust Me, the only way to get it back is no way! =P~ First of all, u pissed him off.. Second, U wan a treat back even though he made losses.. The chances of getting that free dinner is 1 to 100 .. =S Continue on with life bahz. This friend is a Psychology abuser. In using you to accompany him and that office lady, hes trying to create an impression that he is desirable, and yet still faithful towards E OL .. And behind the scenes, you'll never know what he has said about you ... playing around with humans sympathy should be that guy's forte. This guy could be potentially dangerous if you continue to hang out with him .. Avoid much eye to eye contact with him. Make him feel lost. Once he loses you as a scapegoat .. He will probably wake up. But if he doesn't, means he has other friends that are willing to be the "sheeps" for his slaughters .. If this happens, Don't, and do not, the most only once in a blue moon, hang out with this guy. He is obsessed with power. I hope i haven't written any information wrongly, please correct me if i did. You probably know him for a long time isn't it? He, doesn't have a religion isn't it? Neither do you? Is he a rising employee in his company? His non verbal actions must be quite proud.. Notice his actions and confirm it. His postures would display much dominance.. This type of people have much needed confidence.. But this could be a case of Over-confidence . Heed my words. In long terms, if this situations persists, avoid him totally, the situation may become unhandable. If you think i am being unpractical, Im sorry, The law of Fairness is that, no matter how much percent you think it won't happen, there would be still a 50/50 chance that it WOULD happen.. TAke Care~ Don't Get bullied again! Stand up for your rights. Being a lady doesn't mean you are allowed to be bullied. =) cheers~! goodnite.</div>
