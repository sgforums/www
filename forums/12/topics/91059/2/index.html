If this problem of the so called nowhere 'aimless' sian relationship persist - <strong>you really need to see if you are hanging onto the relationship for love or duty</strong>.<br><br>No point trying to drag a relationship where even draft solution is not implemented.

This is quite clear from the way you described what he did as quoted above.<br><br>I find that the best solution for a relationship is first and foremost to know yourself and know yourself well!  Not just about what you like or dont like but what makes you tick!  what excits you, what motivates you, what are your goals and how much energy you have to do what you want to do etc...<br><br>without knowing even these simple things about yourself as with many people (even older folks are not spared bec they never took time to reflect about themseleves) they enter into a relationship and guess what... they have no idea what they actually want or need!  They usually become attracted to someone who is not suitable for them long term.<br><br>How did that happen?? well thanks to all the RA tv movies and all those hollywood stuff or now Korean shows etc and all the romantic books which tells us what "love" is... we ended up building a wrong picture of what to expect when we fall in love and even when we fall in love and the type of people we fall for!  Unfortunately, we are all affected one way or another... some more than others and honestly I have not seen evidence that these model of love works!<br><br>What works??  Well, get to know yourself first, thats important!  The other person must also be comfortable with himself. and contrary to popular believes, psychological and social studies shows that opposites actually make a relationship harder to sustain.<br><br>Its rather hard to advise you what it means or what to do since we dont have much info to go by but know this though, sticking around because you fear loneliness is not the right reason.<br><br>My question to you is... why do you love him?  what is it about him that you love?  what are the qualities??  Alot of people think that giving reasons to love is soo lame... unfortunately, it is the reasons that actually sees you though the hard times and not the iffy feelings that comes and goes.  feelings are important but they will always fade and come back and fade again up and down... and if you use that as a guage to determine how healthy your relationship is and whether to stay or go... you will likely end up<br>making the wrong decision... bec sometimes people quit a relation ship too early... bec of no more feelings while othertimes, they quit a relationship too late also bec of these irrational unreliable feelings when their head tells them they should go.<br><br>so much to say and this is super long post!!!<br><br>So know yourself first, then askyourself why you love this man and ask do you see his potential that he will grow into a better person than he is at the moment.... I think this is at least a place to start.<br><br></div>

He could often be too logical for you... And you, on the other hand is a rather emotional person.... Such that he should often find himself out of wits handling you... No doubt, both of you should enjoy romantic moments together... That level of closeness and togetherness... Should be such a spirit...<br><br>Indeed if much of the 'problems' you're experiencing now in your relationship is not handled properly...
