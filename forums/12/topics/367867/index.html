              <p>Here are some methods which I used/ heard from my friends :</p>
              <p>- Pretend that you are talking to an empty crowd</p>
              <p>- Practice often in front of your family/friends/classmates</p>
              <p>- Take a deep breath whenever you finish a paragraph</p>
              <p>- Pretend to cough whenever you know you are going to blabber/panic</p>
              <p>- Even if you speak something wrong, just read through if it is not a major error</p>

              <p>- imagine u are the king of the universe and everybody wants to listen to u.</p>
              <p>One factor why people are afraid of public speaking is because are afraid people will judge them. People judge people. This is a fact. People look at you critising how u carry urself, the clothes u wear, how u talk, how u look, etc. U could be afraid how u will be judge by others, hence the fear. So, psyche urself up, imagine u are the king of the universe, one flick of the finger and people will die. This creates confidence in u.</p>
              <p>- know ur subject matter inside out. (goes without saying).</p>

              <p>i still got some old notes that can help you:</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li>Proximity between the speaker and others involved. This represents the distance and relationship between both parties. (eg. if your topic/speech is going to be light-hearted you can even walk and mingle around with your audience).</li>
              <li>Eye contact is very important in keeping the audience with you. In this way you will build good rapport and more of what you said will most probably be registered in the audience's mind.</li>
              <li>Volume and tone of voice. Try not to be monotonous or too funny. Be firm in what you are saying. Raise the volume and use necessary gestures to emphasize or illustrate a point.</li>
              <li>Keep the speech short and concise.</li>
              <li>Do not speak too fast or gesticulate too quickly. Be aware of pronunciation and enunciation. Make it clear.</li>
              <li>Appear confident and try not to be nervous. Remember that a speech/presentation is a communication is a two way process. Do not try to dictate the speech but have more of spontaneous responses. If you want others to respond yet they are not responsive, you are entitled to drop hints. Respond only when someone have finished talking.</li>
              <li>Do not stare at a particular point or person for too long.</li>
              <li>Speak with authority and confidence.</li>
              <li>Atmosphere must be relaxed as far as possible so as not to create any barriers.</li>
              <li>At the end of the speech/presentation, you must fulfill the objective and achieve your purpose or else everything work out to zilch.</li>
              <li>Do not assume what others know or do not know. Understand their attitudes.</li>
              <li>If possible make a simple handout on the agenda of the presentation especially your TEACHER/LECTURER</li>

              <p>I know this sounds pretty wrong, but you can try going to Youtube and searching for videos of speeches of Adolf Hitler (must be videos with him actually speaking, not just some flowing images set with his speech). Yeah, I know, sounds wrong. But that actually helped me a bit (ONLY to sort of 'psycho myself with confidence', NEVER helped to give me pointers/tips as to important things such as tone, etc.).</p>
              <p>On the other hand, you could search for video clips of other people giving a presentation. On Youtube too.</p>

              <p>you will naturally be afraid of speaking at first since that is something that you don't usually do. that is when you would have to practise a lot. you will get used to it after a while and not be so afraid of it anymore. how do you think your lecturers are able to give speeches almost everyday? they were afraid at first and practised too.</p>

              <p>Grats on that, but as you said, you still got another presentation coming up in a few months time.</p>
              <p>You still have quite a bit of time to not only practice on it, but also try out some of the ideas offered by the forummers here; or which you think up yourself.</p>
