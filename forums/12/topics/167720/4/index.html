He is a person who is not mature enough and always want things the easy way out, this type of person must fall very hard to learn his lesson well but what if he refuse to listern and still countinue on ?<br><br>Can your love for him really can wait that long ? If not then is time to go. If you believe that you can stand his ways of playing with his life and in the end suffer for what he did then go ahead and suffer together with him. I have seen girls who walk down this path and finally give up.<br><br>The main point is if your love for him is so much then stop complaining and love him. If your love cannot stand up to the test then is best to let it go.<br><br>Your problem lies in that you do not have confident in yourself, you are scare that no one wants you after you leave him. But can I ask if you are so ugly then why he had chosen you as his gf ? I have seen ugly girls who never had a bf till 40+ and you are lucky enough not to join them. So why worry? you can get guys anytime cos there are guys who look for good character too..<br><br>take your time and find this time around but first learn to forget your ex becos is not fair to the next bf that you are still thinking of your ex while you are with him.</div>
