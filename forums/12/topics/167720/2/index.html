            <div class='col-md body'>I say get on with your life. A break up is one of the smallest problem in the world. I had an argument with my family member and I've moved out on the day of the quarrel itself, no place to go i went to my friends place for awhile, then rented a room now. I living outside a couple of months already. Even so, I don't think that's a big problem, because life goes on, there are others who have bigger problems than me. You know what big problems are? It's when you have cancer and knows that you're merely buying time to survive, the time will come soon no matter what you do, and that's a big problem because if it is not solved, you will die. Now, if you break up, just find another person, at the end of the day, you still have 2 hands 2 legs and a life to carry on. Now, don't let the small problem appear so big, otherwise you're just overwhelming yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Starfish,<br><br>You've learnt a very valuable lesson in life, as well as in love.  Being good does Not equate to being treasured, loved, cherished, &amp; does NOT equate a happy forever after relationship.  As you've learnt, love, &amp; relationships, are 2-way.  When 1 partner gives &amp; gives, No matter how she gives, it won't be enough.<br><br>Your bf is still young?  Being young &amp; ambitious, he's gotten involved in a company &amp; doing his studies at the same time.  Ambition is Not a bad trait, as some like to think.  It can be good in that he's trying to expose himself, albeit at a young age, to the working world.<br><br>The bad thing is, he's too young to manage everything.  Something's gotta give.  Also, you're at the age whereby you would want a lovey dovey, smelling like roses relationship whereby you can spend time with your darling, etc.  This isn't wrong, it's normal for your age.  It's only later that you'll learn to enjoy the independence &amp; time away from your partner.  This comes with age.<br><br>You're still young.  As I've mentioned above, a relationship can't be sustained by the efforts of just 1 party.  Both parties hafta contribute &amp; be willing to make the effort.  Your bf, or should I say ex, clearly has other priorities right now, as many young men are.  It's part of his growing process, please don't hold it against him.<br><br>There're times when the timing is just Not right, or it's just Not meant to be.  Take this as a lesson in life, cry all you want, as the pain must still be very raw.  But please don't enter a rebound relationship because you're feeling vulnerable.  Learn to love yourself &amp; enjoy your company.  When you're ready, the right guy will come along.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Starfish07:</div><div class="quote_body">                     Recently I broke up with my boyfriend.
