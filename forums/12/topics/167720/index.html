I dun wish to break with him but he left me with no choice.<br>Things are smooth when we started to become steadies. Both sides of our parents had seen both of us and they quite like us.Everything is very happy for us until one day his friend ask hime to join him in the trading company and my boyfriend is super light ear and he joined this trading company in Singapore and most of the time he spend with his friends and training in the company. Things started to change and I quarrelled with him a lot that he dun have time to spend with me. It slowly drain us away and until one fine day, he request to break off with me.. Until then I realised that I should be more understanding towards him and try to be more considerate. So I promised him that I will change to suit him.Just for him.. He agreed to patch back with me and I am so happy and I changed ever since that break up.. Of cos things will be different so as feelings as the tear is there but I am trying all my energy to save this relationship.<br>But in the end I end this relationship with him as loving a guy that is totally empty inside and no longer the same anymore.. How to find good guys out there? Is all the good guys are been attached, married, dead or still finding the other partner??</div></blockquote>I don't know and i don't care... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I also ended mine 2 years back for fear of committment.<br><br>Good points of being single - No need to explain any actions or where your off to. More energy to do things you have always dreamed of doing.  No more arguing, quarelling, stressing myself how to make GF happy.  Remembering when to buy gifts, presents, flowers......etc  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Bad points of being single: Sometimes you just feel EMPTY or LONELY  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Then you can only reminisce of the past (eliminate the ugly scenes of coz).
