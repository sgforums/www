            <div class='col-md body'>Currently i'm facing some problem at my workplace, a restaurant. At first i tot that my boss had terminated my ex manager, and everything should be ok with a new manager,but things doesn't turn out well. My new manager tends to push all the responsibilities. If he's on the wrong, he wouldn't admit but just push the blame to my colleagues. When boss around, he tends to be hardworking, but when boss not around, he will keep smoking and talk on the phone. When busy, he will definitely sent wrong food to wrong table without fail. When my part timer need help from him, he just "run" away from them, so my part timer have no choice but to turn to me. There're time whereby he sent in order late, so food definitely served late, but he just blame the kitchen for slow cooking, this and that. If you were in my situation, what will you do? I need some advise from you. Thanks.</div>

At first i tot that my boss had terminated my ex manager, and everything should be ok with a new manager,but things doesn't turn out well. My new manager tends to push all the responsibilities. If he's on the wrong, he wouldn't admit but just push the blame to my colleagues. When boss around, he tends to be hardworking, but when boss not around, he will keep smoking and talk on the phone. When busy, he will definitely sent wrong food to wrong table without fail. When my part timer need help from him, he just "run" away from them, so my part timer have no choice but to turn to me. There're time whereby he sent in order late, so food definitely served late, but he just blame the kitchen for slow cooking, this and that. If you were in my situation, what will you do? I need some advise from you. Thanks.</div></blockquote>Just do your job and don't worry about other people can? If it is his fault and he blames you, then when the boss ask, just tell the boss the truth. Otherwise if he is so bad and the restaurant suffers, it is the boss' problem.</div>
