Well, what i refer to here is their "love life". I find it quite absurd when people lament about how their bf/gf does this, did that or some people that they like ignored their feelings which made them feel hopeless. Actually i feel that to actually LIKE a person is a happy thing, why must people take it so hard when things are not going smoothly? Setbacks are there to guide you to the correct path, it is to help you understand the situation, understand yourself better and of course the other half. So when you meet up with something that is not favourable to you, take a step back, take a breather and think.<br><br>Perhaps some people place too much feelings and hope onto someone they like til the extend that it is impossible to accept a flaw in that person.
