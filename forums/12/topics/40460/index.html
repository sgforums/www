Well.. me oso.. i older than me bf 3 years..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Like wat Yun explained.. is the reasons being is not becos on maturity.. Is the subconcious mind that you cannot over come.. It keep on telling you that.. he's younger and you're older... and ppl  have the tendency to always come to think that you're young and i'm older.. and when comes to maturity you always think that the other party who is younger is immature...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Being young doesnt really post a problem.. You couldnt leave him.. simply you love him so.. Is not the matter of whether to chose a guy younger than you anot.. And if age really bothers you..Then you wont even be in this relation...but however why in the 1st place you went with him.. there's must be some attractiveness in him.. right? And the age problem has never come across your mind b4.. Is oni when you find that he change and becomes immature.. Then after you start to ponder whether is it be cos he's still young and insensitive.. This is so wrong! With such thinking you had.. this makes you immature rather him..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>You must try to overcome the "age" situation you have.. You see on the street.. some gf are taller than their Bf.. but they dun bother.. they dun care about how ppl look at them how ppl say them.. They are comfortable with each others.. They thinks they are special then the rest.. They always compliment each other.. If height really create a problem here.. would you be able to STILL see any of this couple on the street?? Since they can do it.. You can do it too...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Most ppl are insentitive... Regardless of age.. Even if you were to find someone older than you.. Certain things.. guys sometimes will be insensitive.. They might not know.. but somehow you feel it.. Be more considerate.. Not everyone knows what the other party thinking about.. Don't say guys.. sometimes girls oso insensitive...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Have more confidence in yourself.. Give time to your bf.. and have a talk with him.. If you cant tolerate his nonsense tell him.. Speak to him..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
