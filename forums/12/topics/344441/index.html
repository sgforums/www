              <p>Since young my mum has been controlling everything ( playing
                  computer , when i go out , who i mix with etc .) And now i have
                  reached 16 recently (17 this year ) , its the same . My friends and
                  relatives says she is too OVER controlling ove
                  me JUST becos she is my mother . I admit my O 's levels
                  results are bad because i play too much and i have not been
                  studying . i think this is becos she DONT let me play at all from
                  sec 1 till now ... so I have been rebelious to her and so i went on
                  playing .... Her plans backfired her I tink and now her mental
                  conditions even gone worse ...</p>
              <p>Ps. Some background infomation from me is that my father and
                  mother are not in good terms at ALL for the past ten years... MY
                  father likes to throw temper and my mother's words are VERY hurtful
                  and blunt ... in other words she likes to scold .... whichs
                  irritate ppl easily ..</p>
              <p>Can anyone help me ?</p>

              <p>if i am your mum i will also over control you because u are a kid that have no time concept!</p>
              <p>your o level result is fucking bad because YOU urself PLAY too much. don't blame your mother where everything start with YOU. if u know when to study and when to PLAY she won't be so worried about you. okay</p>
              <p>JUST because she is YOUR mother? she has the every right to do so since u are so ignorance!</p>
              <p>you are 17 but u are behaving like a 7 years old KID!</p>

              <p>----------------------ok joke---------------</p>
              <p>It is stupid that u put the cause of ur bad results to how ur mother treat u! U just got no self-control boy. And probably, u are not good in time management.</p>
              <p>Last time, i used to be in the same boat as u. It's like 'friend is better than family'-so fun horr!. As time flies, i'll understand more that my mum wants the best for me. And now, i can already go out and come back late, all because of trust. And it is good to introduce ur friend to ur parents...</p>
              <p>Oukh btw, we took the same year of exam though im a year older.</p>

              <p>well, TS u noe wad ur problem is. you played too much tt maybe ur mum feel no choice but to be strict with you.</p>
              <p>but on another note, i have know mums who are really overbearing. e.g. doesn't allow their kids to use the internet without supervision (and by kids, i refer to students of sec sch age), doesn't allow handphones etc.</p>
              <p>some mums are really too possessive of their children that they think they have the right to control all aspect of their children's life, with little regards to the objections of their children.</p>
              <p>its ok for parents to be strict during a child's foundation years i.e. primary school. but i think they should ease their control once their child reaches his or her teens.</p>

              <p>do u have the qualities to be a grown up teen/adult?</p>
              <p>obviously your mother thinks you dont have the tools to be one and hence she have to tell you, show you the way.</p>
              <p>but then again there will come a time where your mind is moulded and cannot change no matter what.</p>

              <p>Good thing about Private schools are for you to be discipline and do your own self study.. if you know you don't have discipline.. then i don't think you can even survive going to poly from ite.</p>
              <p>Note : This doesn't mean you're not smart. It is that when there's discipline and good attitude, it will do you good.</p>
