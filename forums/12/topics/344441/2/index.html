              <p>After reading the first post, it sure bring back some of my teenage memories.</p>
              <p>To JonJon92,</p>
              <p>Like you, I was busy playing computer games rather than busy studying in my 'O' level days.</p>
              <p>Like you, my mother is always against me from playing computer games.</p>
              <p>However,
              one big difference is that I belong to the "Mummy's boy" category and
              will obey/listen to my mother eventually instead of being rebellious.</p>
              <p>What I did back then was quite funny: I played computer games
              only when my mother was not paying attention. For example: I only play
              when she is outside or when she is sleeping. And when she is around, I
              do some other things because I know that as long as she does not see me
              playing computer/video games, I am safe <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">.</p>
              <p>Of course, I do not recommend you to å�·å�·çŽ©æ¸¸æˆ� like what I did before.</p>
              <p>What you need more is human understanding.</p>
              <p>You
              must understand that only gamers will understand why gamers like to
              play computer/video games. Something which your mother most probably do
              not understand.</p>
              <p>You should understand that your mother do not
              know why you are playing games and also should understand that you do
              not know why your mother stops you from playing games.</p>
              <p>Mother
              does not understand child. Child does not understand Mother. It is just
              a misunderstanding that should be settled peacefully and not go
              overboard.</p>

              <p>Jonjon,</p>
              <p>None of you is crazy.</p>
              <p>Your mother's heightened anger towards you is relative to your level of rebellion.. the more rebellious you are.. the more she thinks she needs to have a tighter grip on you.</p>
              <p>Now , let me ask you.... why do you think your mother is angry at you ?</p>
              <p>Do you think if you can sit down with her and have a civilised conversation without you saying something to piss her off ?</p>
              <p>Think of it this way... she is "over-controlling" not because she is your mother.. rather... she is controlling because you are his son and she does not wants to see you fail.</p>
              <p>Sit down and have a talk with her.. all she needs is this.</p>
              <p>Admit you have not been doing your best the past few years and is very regretful of your substandard results.</p>
              <p>Give her assurance that you will buck up and do your best.</p>
              <p>Tell her you have done some thinking.. while computer games is your hobby .. you will only play it for maximum 2 hours every week. ( And make sure you stick to it).</p>
              <p>You are 17 this year.. start behaving like an adult.. and people will treat you like one.</p>

              <p>My parents had a very bad relationship. My mum began to vent her frustration on me by exercising absolute control over me. When I had my first gf, she freaked out. She began a campaign to paint an ugly picture of my gf in vain. My dad continued his endless flow of violence until the only time I retaliated in order to protect my then gf from being assaulted by him. It was sheer torture to live in such an environment. I was only 17. Then I responded to the JPSDS program from SAF and started to earn my own income. School fees were paid by the government. My poly results ain't that good but I've never repeated any semester before. And in turn, I learnt to grow up in the SAF instead of a healthy family. I've completed my contract with the SAF for a few years. And even though I am utterly disillusioned and disappointed with the SAF policies, I have never regretted that decision I took years ago. Because of that step, I learnt many things money cannot buy. Priceless lessons.</p>
              <p>.While at this age, you're half a step into adulthood yet too unknowledgable to be considered matured. And being cooped up like a little mummy's boy will get you nowhere either. I've seen worse situations and the mummy's boy at the age of 25 being sheltered totally grew up to become a hegemonist is still unable to support himself, treats his mother like a slave and when she has no money for him, he went to her cabinet and took out her savings booklet and pointed out the little amount there and demanded from his mum to give him that money.</p>
              <p>Dear JonJon92, what I am trying to tell you is that if you are unable to find your home a place for communication, venture out. Start working part time. Experience the bitter side of life. You will find that the working life is so much different from home. Having the opportunity to feel the burden of responsibility will be a good beginning for your route towards maturity. Then take on the yoke of being responsible for other people. Become the safety net for other people to fall upon. Be financially independent, a pillar of confidence to rely on and a person who can be responsible for the well-being of others. Then return home as that person and your family will view you differently.</p>
              <p>Good luck and I hope you will find your direction soon.</p>

              <p>knn lah. JUST GROW UP and stop playing games.</p>
              <p>How difficult is it to just listen to your mom for 1 fucking year and get your O lvls over and done with?</p>
              <p>Just like everyone else, you were in the rebellious phase, we know it, we've been there. And when everyone says you should grow up and be mature, just do it. We know what happens when you don't and what happens when you do.</p>
              <p>When you grow up, you will finally realise why your parents did that and why we said these. Along with realisation of ah beng wannabes, punks and all the secondary school crap like maplestory or whatever kids play these days.</p>

              <p><br>Hi , i failed my O'level 10 years ago. I choose to retain to retake my O'level. I was from a top class in a neighbourhood school. So imagine all the suprised looks from the school when i got retained. For my second retake ,my result was just good enough to enter JC. Sometimes , your mind is just not there to study. Dont think about it &amp; move on. There is some catching up for you.</p>
              <p>Explore your options wisely &amp; then follow it through.</p>
