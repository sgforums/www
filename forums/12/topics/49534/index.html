            <div class='col-md body'>Yo, when its time to let go do let go, or else both parties will suffer. Love is something that needs chemistry. If the chemistry isn't right, its no use being together. I had experienced it before. I love this girl but when we are together, we felt uncomfortable as our chemistry isn't right. After break up, we tried being together again, but the results is still the same. Love is like a chemistry practical, when ya mix 2 solutions, It will either give results or will have no change. So better make a wise choice</div>
