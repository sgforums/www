              <p>yes, no suicidal thoughts please. In fact there are alot of people out there with herpes, just that they do not know themselves that they have it. As long as a person is being sexually active, it is possible to get contracted to the virus. Though there is no cure yet, but it is not a deadly virus.</p>
              <p>Best way to aviod getting herpes is to refrain from having sex, but we are all human ....</p>
              <p>Take care</p>

              <p>I was with this guy for about a month, and I really loved him, so one day we decided to have sex. There was a condom of course, but about 3 days after, my genitals started feeling sore, and I had the worst fever. I thought it was just a reaction because i didn't eat till 5pm, so I dismissed it.</p>
              <p>The next day some blisters popped up down there and it was extremely painful when I peed. Agonizing. Everytime I want to scream, but I force myself not to. I searched online and was devastated when I read that my symptoms matches that of herpes. I confronted my then-bf, and he said that well he had sex with many other women as well, so he might have it. I immediately broke up with him. But he has left me scarred and tainted.</p>
              <p>Not only that, this is the 5th day of my first outbreak and I feel like committing suicide. Partly because the pain is really unbearable, partly because I have compromised my health, partly because society will label me a disease-ridden dirty whore, but mostly because I have let my family down.</p>
              <p>What should I do? I can't tell anybody, I fear they will not understand. Not many in this society does anyway.</p>

Last time i got this friend whom i think got herpes, cus she had ons wif my other frenz while im in the hse, i can smell the pussy smell dam smelly and after which she got tell us abt her conditions and we think it might be herpes.</p>
              <p>Nth happened to my friend, and we didnt know it will spread through physical skin contact, and yes there's more interactions in the club, quite fortunate, nth happened... are there cases where herpes are passed over to the next victim but there are no obvious symptoms?  </p>

              <p>Genital herpes is very common and once infected, you can shed the virus and pass on the disease even when you have no symptoms. Your doctor has prescribed you acyclovir or other members of the same drug family. That will heal the blisters but will not cure it. Long term suppressive therapy (take the medicine twice a day) can prevent relapse and reduce the risk of transmission.</p>
              <p>Guys, you won't get it from an infected person through social contact. If she has genital herpes, it is unlikely that you will get it through kissing either. It is difficult to advise what to do in our society. If a girl tells you she has herpes will you not drop her like a hot potato? If she tells you she has herpes after you get married what will you do? Stick with her but never have sex? Forget about children? Or tell her to take acyclovir all her life (will easily cost you $200 a month) and wear a condom all the time? Even so, there is always a small risk of transmission</p>

              <p>Sure.</p>
              <p>Initially i thought it was from her, I checked but then she doesnt have it. Till now i still duno which cb passed to me. lol. Her reaction is ok, she thinks nothin of it i think. Maybe shes not the one who kena. She still wanted to get intimate but i said lets stop for awhile cuz i dun wanna pass it to her. </p>
              <p>Anyway to topic, for HSV-1 (cold sores), it is already irritating and pain when it starts to split. For HSV-2 (genital herp), i can imagine it's like X10 of pain. </p>
