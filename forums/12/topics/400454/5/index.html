              they are not able to tell me how serious it is, whether is it a

              <p>And also there is the ethic issue, I now never kiss/ share

              <p>if no symptoms at all, how come u seem to suspect you have leh? </p>
              <p>if you are really really paranoid, then u spend some time and go see polyclinic doctor lor. at most pay some $$$ nia. instead of having to worry and suspect so much....... right?</p>
              <p>and yah, dun share drinks better. with gf still ok la, not those outside girls.   </p>

              <p>Hi Newperson,</p>
              <p>U r not alone.</p>
              <p>I'm also a carrier myself and I've been coping with this for 5 years now.</p>
              <p>I got it from my ex bf of 4.5 years.I was devastated at that point when i learned about this.I understand how you feel right now.But we still have to accept the fact,learn to cope with it and get on with life.Although in our present environment and society people are rather conservative about such issues,they are still people with compassion.Don't fear rejection.I know its hard to break this news to people around you.But you will be surprised by the response you will get (just like i did when i told my Friends and my present bf).My friends gave me all the support I needed after learning about my situation.</p>
              <p>Please know that we are as innocent and ignorant during the transition of getting this virus.It is not what we want either.Don't feel depress and bury yourself in self-reproach and depression with negative thoughts.This will make the situation worsen as herpes breaks out even more frequently if we are emotionally depress.</p>
              <p>Just like pink_dandelion experience,she still found a man who truly loves her and accept the way things are by taking another step further with her.I have moved on and I truly believe you can too. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>I was with this guy for about a month, and I really loved him, so one day we decided to have sex. There was a condom of course, but about 3 days after, my genitals started feeling sore, and I had the worst fever. I thought it was just a reaction because i didn't eat till 5pm, so I dismissed it.</p>
              <p>The next day some blisters popped up down there and it was extremely painful when I peed. Agonizing. Everytime I want to scream, but I force myself not to. I searched online and was devastated when I read that my symptoms matches that of herpes. I confronted my then-bf, and he said that well he had sex with many other women as well, so he might have it. I immediately broke up with him. But he has left me scarred and tainted.</p>
              <p>Not only that, this is the 5th day of my first outbreak and I feel like committing suicide. Partly because the pain is really unbearable, partly because I have compromised my health, partly because society will label me a disease-ridden dirty whore, but mostly because I have let my family down.</p>
              <p>What should I do? I can't tell anybody, I fear they will not understand. Not many in this society does anyway.</p>

              <p>If the blisters pop up the next day, most probably she is already a carrier before the sex act. The stress of the sex (just one month r/s) may be the cause of the outbreak. </p>
              <p>The virus is a dormant one, and symptoms appear only when the immunity level is low. Anxiety, fear, excitement, fever, poor diet, anything that lowers the immunity can cause the outbreak.</p>
