              <p>I was with this guy for about a month, and I really loved him, so one day we decided to have sex. There was a condom of course, but about 3 days after, my genitals started feeling sore, and I had the worst fever. I thought it was just a reaction because i didn't eat till 5pm, so I dismissed it.</p>
              <p>The next day some blisters popped up down there and it was extremely painful when I peed. Agonizing. Everytime I want to scream, but I force myself not to. I searched online and was devastated when I read that my symptoms matches that of herpes. I confronted my then-bf, and he said that well he had sex with many other women as well, so he might have it. I immediately broke up with him. But he has left me scarred and tainted.</p>
              <p>Not only that, this is the 5th day of my first outbreak and I feel like committing suicide. Partly because the pain is really unbearable, partly because I have compromised my health, partly because society will label me a disease-ridden dirty whore, but mostly because I have let my family down.</p>
              <p>What should I do? I can't tell anybody, I fear they will not understand. Not many in this society does anyway.</p>

              <p>Go Watsons and find yourself a small bottle that is able to spray a fine mist of liquid. Empty out the contents and wash it clean with tap water. Then pour medical grade hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into it. 3% is the standard medical grade. 20% is also fine. I am saying this because nobody sells H2O2 in a spray form. Those big pharma got too much money to loose because H2O2 is one of the most effective disinfectants, and they cannot patent it.</p>
              <p>Now use this to spray H2O2 over the affected area. There may be some slight discomfort or pain. It wont be too bad. If there are open sores, you will see some white frothing. Its fine. Keep using it twice daily until the condition clears. H2O2 is produced naturally by immune cells in your body to fight off viruses and bacteria.</p>
              <p>This method works very well. Dont worry too much about the herpes. It is something that will stay with u for life, and you are not alone. Nobody in this world can remain virus free from birth to death. Take it as a part of living. Dont let it eat your happiness and waste your youth. Herpes is not a death sentence.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="text" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Genital herpes is spread easily. The virus from contact with an infected person can enter your body through a break in your skin or through the skin of your mouth, penis or vagina, urinary tract opening, cervix or anus. Herpes is most easily spread when blisters or sores can be seen on the infected person. But it can be spread at any time, even when the person who has herpes isn’t experiencing any symptoms.<br><br>Genital herpes is usually spread from one person to another by having sex, including oral sex. Herpes can also be spread from one place on your body to another, such as from your genitals to your fingers, then to your eyes or to other parts of your body. Herpes can also be spread from a mother to her baby when she gives birth.</div>

              </div>
              <div class="text" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">See your doctor as soon as possible. Herpes is easier to diagnose when there are sores. You can start treatment sooner and perhaps have less pain with the infection.</div>

              </div>
              <div class="text" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Once you have been infected with the virus, you'll go through different stages of infection. Each stage is explained in the following sections.</div>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><a class="jumpdowns" style="color: #40637a; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/common/sexinfections/sti/091.html#top">Return to top</a></p>

              <h3 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Primary stage</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="text" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">This stage usually starts 2 to 8 days after you're infected, but it can take much longer to begin. Usually, the infection causes groups of small, painful blisters. The fluid in the blisters may be clear or cloudy. The area under the blisters will be red. The blisters break open so easily that they quickly become open sores. You may not ever notice the blisters.<br><br>Besides having tender blisters or sores in your genital area, it may hurt to urinate. You may run a fever, feel achy and have other flu-like symptoms.<br><br>While most people have a painful primary stage of infection, some don't have any symptoms at all, and may not even know they're infected.</div>

              </div>
              <div class="text" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">During this stage, there are no blisters, sores or other symptoms. At this time, the virus is traveling from your skin into the nerves near your spine.</div>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><a class="jumpdowns" style="color: #40637a; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/common/sexinfections/sti/091.html#top">Return to top</a></p>

              </div>
              <div class="text" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">In the shedding stage, the virus starts multiplying in the nerves. It can then get into body fluids, such as saliva, semen or vaginal fluids. There are no symptoms during this stage, but the virus can be spread during this time.</div>

              </div>
              <div class="text" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Many people have blisters and sores that come back after the first herpes attack goes away. This is called a recurrence. Usually, the symptoms aren't as bad as they were during the first attack.<br><br>Stress, being sick or being tired may start a recurrence. Being in the sun or having your menstrual period may also cause a recurrence. You may know when a recurrence is about to happen because you may feel itching, tingling or pain in the places where you were first infected.<br></div>

              </div>
              <div class="text" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">No. But medicines can help. The medicine acyclovir can speed up healing and can lessen the pain of herpes for many people.<br><br>Acyclovir pills can treat primary or recurrent herpes and can stop or lessen the number of recurrences. Acyclovir also comes in a cream to put on sores during the primary stage or during recurrences.<br><br>Famciclovir and valacyclovir are other medicines used to treat recurrent genital herpes and for prevention of recurrences.</div>

              <p><br>yes u can get h2o2 from guardian or watsons. its real cheap. Oxygenation is the key. Try it and u will be hooked. h2o2 solves many problems - bad breath, skin infections, toothache caused by poor dental hygiene, and of course open wounds. Even blocked noses caused by infected nasal rhinus. I am not asking u to drink h2o2. But go google a bit. There is plenty of information out there.</p>
