              <p>Don't like that la. She has already seeked medical help. When people come to an online forum asking for help, they're looking for:</p>
              <p>1. Consolation<br>2. Community support<br>3. People with similar problems</p>
              <p>Herpes probably hurts the victim more emotionally than physically, so this is where a community can help through conversations, especially when the person is not prepared to let his/her family be aware of his/her current situation yet.</p>
              <p>If every one who has an issue with their PCs or some other IT-related stuff opt for professional help, our IT sub-forum would have closed down long ago. <span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; color: #333333;"><img style="border: 0px initial initial;" title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></span></p>

              <p>I was with this guy for about a month, and I really loved him,
              so one day we decided to have sex. There was a condom of course,
              but about 3 days after, my genitals started feeling sore, and I had
              the worst fever. I thought it was just a reaction because i didn't
              eat till 5pm, so I dismissed it.</p>
              <p>The next day some blisters popped up down there and it was
              extremely painful when I peed. Agonizing. Everytime I want to
              scream, but I force myself not to. I searched online and was
              devastated when I read that my symptoms matches that of herpes. I
              confronted my then-bf, and he said that well he had sex with many
              other women as well, so he might have it. I immediately broke up
              with him. But he has left me scarred and tainted.</p>
              <p>Not only that, this is the 5th day of my first outbreak and I
              feel like committing suicide. Partly because the pain is really
              unbearable, partly because I have compromised my health, partly
              because society will label me a disease-ridden dirty whore, but
              mostly because I have let my family down.</p>
              <p>What should I do? I can't tell anybody, I fear they will not
              understand. Not many in this society does anyway.</p>

              <p>actually my point of view for condoms is to minimize premature or unwanted pregnancies. its effective for a couple who make love only between tthe two people and no one else. unless it tears if not its the safest way for responsible couples.</p>

              <p>LatecomerX, I actually want to thank you for that.</p>
              <p>When I read the bulk of the replies I was more worried. If this is how people react to 'herpes' and if they are online and anonymous, I can safely assume that IRL it would be worse because of the face-face factor and less time to think through.</p>
              <p>Yet this is an Aunt Agony forum. If you feel you are personally qualified enough to give advice, at least skim through most of the thread before passing a comment. It is well-informed advice on what next to do that matters.</p>

              <p>I am more worried about the guy who is till walking scot free. To solve this problem 99.99% we should report a guy that has herpes. the guy should also go see doctor and he should pay for your bills if you need to seek further medical assiatnace from doctors.</p>

Using a water-based lubricant can help reduce irritation. Don't use one that contains the spermacide nonoxynol-9, however. Nonoxynol-9 can irritate mucous membranes, such as the lining of the vagina. Oil-based lubricants are a no-no, too. They weaken latex, making condoms more likely to break. Even if the friction of intercourse seems to be a trigger for your symptoms, it probably won't cause a flare-up every time you have sex. </span></p>
