              <p>Society is not forcing you to do anything. You still have the
              absolute right to turn down the offer, and no one can force you to do
              otherwise.</p>
              <p>What everyone is saying is that since you are already offered the place, turning it down may well be a very big mistake.</p>
              <p>Seriously, what's stopping you from accepting it? A lack of interest in studying? If that's the case, then I can tell you that a few years from now, if you really do want to get back to studying, you will find things to be a lot more difficult.</p>
              <p>A few years from now NTU may change its admissions criteria and not longer accept you. The competition for places might also become stiffer. And even if they do, years and years of not studying would have blunted your academic skills, making things a lot tougher.</p>
              <p>If you say that your lack of interest stems from serving two years in NS, then I can tell you that that was the problem faced by every single local male undergraduate when they first matriculated. Yours truly included.</p>

              <p>Two years of inaction can already rust one's brain quite badly.</p>
              <p>You wait a few more years, and it can become even more corroded.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, TS..... now is the best time for you to go to uni.</p>

              <p>Society is not forcing you to do anything. You still have the
              absolute right to turn down the offer, and no one can force you to
              do otherwise.</p>
              <p>What everyone is saying is that since you are already offered
              the place, turning it down may well be a very big mistake.</p>
              <p>Seriously, what's stopping you from accepting it? A lack of
              interest in studying? If that's the case, then I can tell you that
              a few years from now, if you really do want to get back to
              studying, you will find things to be a lot more difficult.</p>
              <p>A few years from now NTU may change its admissions criteria and
              not longer accept you. The competition for places might also become
              stiffer. And even if they do, years and years of not studying would
              have blunted your academic skills, making things a lot tougher.</p>
              <p>If you say that your lack of interest stems from serving two
              years in NS, then I can tell you that that was the problem faced by
              every single local male undergraduate when they first matriculated.
