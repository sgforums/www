              <p>Rumours and hearsay can be very hurtful and mostly UNTRUE.</p>
              <p>The best thing for you to do is to clarify this with your second aunt FACE TO FACE.</p>
              <p>Your other relatives may be trying to cause a rift within the family.</p>
              <p>Your aunt did her duty taking care of your grandma. You should be asking yourself WHY your grandma is not staying at YOUR house instead ?</p>
              <p>It is easier to hate, more harder to love.</p>

              <p>Hi RoyFang,</p>
              <p>As jojobeach has kindly mentioned, this could possibly be a rumour started by some of your relatives who are trying to sow discord within the extended family. </p>
              <p>If you really want to clarify things with her, go ahead and do so, though things may turn ugly because of this. Otherwise, the best thing for you to do is to just leave things be and ignore what your relatives are saying.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
