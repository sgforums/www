Do that part time or something like that.  I dunno what do you mean by you have great interest for music. Are you very talented but lack opportunities for lessons? Or its only liking for a particular thing, but not passion?<br><br>Passion may leads to a commitment, likings can at most be an on-off thing.<br>So if you have passion for music, go study for it...if you only likes it, then go buried yourself in books for your law degree..<br><br>Right now, you can choose to study in JC and hope to get good grades and study your law..But beware, that you are falling into a Rat Race. However, that can/might guarantee you stability.<br><br>If you pursue music, who knows you might turn out to be the next Sun Yanzi?<br>You can join the whatever crap thing on the campus superstar?<br></div></blockquote>SYZ also made the record company wait for her till she completed her degree. and that was her father's advice too, to at least have a degree before she ventured into singing.</div>
