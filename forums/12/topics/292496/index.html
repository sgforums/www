You know actually for food I was actually thinking to bake a cake personally, but I have simply have no idea how to do it.. even the cake my mum bakes... well lets say I prefer to buy one. ;P<br><br>My mum will murder me if she read that.. AHHAHA!<br><br>Anyway 2nd point is I respect people like you who give constructive advises and such, but if you scroll up and read wat a certain female wrote, she posted twice and yet nothing. Just to +1 here so to speak.. or rather, +2. That kind of people exist too. I believe there are good nice females like you, and you are really rare. But attention seeking whiny insensitive spoilt females are ALOT. Just see how many nice guys out here has been burnt le. Thats why I requested females not to post, cos I know a lot will come here and put rubbish. You, are an exception however, and I appreciate it. At least you dont come here and post "Ohhh I got a pedicure coming up, i am sooo pretty so important and so rich." kind of attention seeking vibe. Yucks. What a cheap easy s|ut.<br><br>When LatercomerX said "Cos a lot of females don't know what they want" Believe it, he knows what he is talking about, and I agree wholeheartedly. Im sure a lot of guys here will agree with me too.<br><br>Furinax suggested the stone.. woah dude, I think Im going to copy it le! Just hoping my fiancee will appreciate it la. Running out of ideas year after year.. haha!<br><br>Do continue to post more ideas please, would appreciate it as I compile it and can last me for another few years..<br><br>I like the guys' advises regarding the gifts here, they been through a lot of trouble before they found out actually what worked for them.</div>
