You know that time actually me and my friends planned a song for her, he plays the guitar and I sing, had a BBQ arranged by my mum for her also on the same day.. hahaha, that one is memorable la, but this one I want it to come from my heart, so I decided to crave the stone like wat furix did..<br><br>Anyway now my visual sensors are so enchanced, that I refuse to acknowledge cheap thrill people who come in to critic and rant about how much pedicure cost. Heck, Im not even going to acknowledge the existence of that... thing. Useless bum, didnt even read properly and try to get the facts correctly, only spam to get +3 and YET still no suggestions or ideas... maybe she doesnt even get any before in her entire life.. cant blame s|utty and easy people, trash... YUCK. Must be a really fat and ugly piece of junk.. with armpit hair.. And cheap too! Give also no man would want. EEK.<br><br>Anyway tmr im going to buy the chisel and tools, maybe spend one whole day chipping at it.. haha! Maybe if its comes out well, Ill post the picture of the end result, im thinking of more like using pink ribbon to decorate the edges of the stone, then carve 2 hearts with our names on it. You know like those decorative feng shui crystal stones likedat. Im not trying to impress her, but I just want her to know that I love, treasure her and cherish her. The stone, its hard work, but its worth it. She is important to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Meanwhile keep the ideas coming bros, I appreciate all the thoughts. And some rare kind girls in here like brownie and udunnome, thanks too. No thanks to cheap s|utty whiners though. :-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first and foremost i hope that nobody's offended in this thread.<br><br>from what i can remember, i took a day off from my FYP every friday to accompany my girl for her attachment. i would make breakfast for her every morning. it ranges from maggie mee, bread with luncheon meat, egg and cheese, to waffles.<br><br>i've been folding straw hearts for her and its really easy to learn. i apologize for not being able to show a demostration to you here but perhaps you could learn it off from friends or the net.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>currently i'm going to fort canning park to pick up saga seeds. i got myself a bottle and gonna make it look like a 'potted flower'. sticking a wire into the seeds and making a 'fake rose' from red coloured wools which can be found in the shop "spotlight". there is a shop located at Plaza Singapura. and add a lil note to the flower which will be sticked to act as the 'leaf' before putting the 'flower' into the pot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>if you want, you can photoshop the nicest picture you have of you and your girl. and make it into a magazine. go to photo shops and get them to print it for you. at most it should cost you around $10-$20. could perhaps have pages like horoscope blah blah. or hey! create a short video of you and your gf! that is if you've enough photos to make a photo video.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>hopefully this helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i also think jojo's first post meant no harm. she is just <strong>commenting</strong> that you are asking the wrong group of people in her question, and not in any way answering your suggestions of gift ideas. but you just start attacking her saying she didnt read.<br><br>the way you insult her is sickening..a gal who never get any gifts from guys before must be an ugly-looking, slutty, trashy, cheap gal?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>and i noticed you edited your first post... is it the last sentence that you have edited? you changed part of your question when you realise jojo is somehow correct in her first post but refuse to admit she is right? that is also damn sneaky of you too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>fyi, not everyone posts here for the sake of post count.</div>

All girls like to be pampered, whether they are girl next door, or women in powersuits. The thing is, as guys, we must be adaptable. I for one, can be downright serious when it comes to planning for our future, career, or any important events. Yet i can be at times cheeky and childish, exuding a certain boyish charm which never fail to captivates my gf's heart. She has seen in in my most formal office attire, due to the requirements of my job, and likewise seen me in my bermudes and shirt on a beach outing. Confidence comes from within, not through gestures of love, but rather the manner in which the guy carry themselves all the time. I've done things that are so original and spontaneous because it is typical of me, to surprise her all the time, to remember our important dates, and it turns out good cos it represents me, creative and cheeky. Likewise, the guys who are getting ideas from others. Nothing wrong with that. However, it has to be typical you, otherwise you will only come across as trying to hard to be something that isn't really you, and bear in mind, the real you is who she fell in love with in the first place..<br><br></div>
