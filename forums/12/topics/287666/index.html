            <div class='col-md body'>Believe it or not, I also lost all my friends at 25. But I chose it. When I was struggling with a crisis that time, it seems friends are never there. I really open my eyes as to who my friends really are. Then I decided to lose contact with them all...overnight.<br><br>Like you said, it was difficult. But then I made new friends along the way, and picked up new hobbies. Life began the 2nd time round, and this time it was better than the 1st! Yeah!</div>
