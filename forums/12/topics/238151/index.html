            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Im sorry to say this on CNY. It seems to me, she is waiting for someone more eligible than you to sweep her off her feet. If you need to try very hard to get her to become your girlfriend, it's definitely not going to work. From the way you described, seems that you really worked your socks off, planning your dates, trying to make it perfect.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that if a guy better looking than you, or more qualified than you comes along, she very well might end up with that guy and you will just become her good friend.<br><br>Now she's like a celebrity and you are her fan, have you ever seen a celebrity get together with her fan??? If she said, no, just let it go. Just like someone said earlier, go improve yourself in other areas. Now it's probably not the place and time for the two of you to work out. You must get rid of that kind of mentality that she is the love of your life, or your soul mate, without her you will be incomplete. Many girls out there can be the right girl for you, many girls can also make you happy.<br><br>It is sad but true, many girls look at guys based on their potentials, or what they already have. Things like wealth, looks, profession, social status. If the girl you are after is the sort you would classify as glamourous, classy, she probably has those sort of friends who are like that. And when they go out on their ladies lunches in their cute, expensive, fashionable outfits. They want to be talking about how successful their bfs are. If you can't even become a positive conversation topic for her, how are you going to become her boyfriend???<br><br>There are not many girls out there who look at guys for what they are inside, I really think such girls are the real treasures. If you ever come across one, seize the day.</div>
