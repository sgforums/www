              <p>No. my sister went for a tuition class in a HDB unit in tampines and she says that the teacher who is a male teacher keeps looking at her and smile cheekly. my sister is slim and is quite pretty so she was complaining that she felt very uneasy when she sees this teacher and my mother pulled her out of class immediately.</p>
              <p>Apparently, he asked my sister if he can take photos of her!! reason cause he finds her cute and he himself is a part time photographer.</p>

              <p>lol. I am only asking for opinion and views. I am not saying all tutors are the same. Everyone judge everyone. U can say I am shallow. not gonna rebuke that.By the way it is illegal to have tuition in HDB but they are still doing it. and alot of ppl are doing it only that its not on big scale unless u wan govt to chase after you.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Girls out there just be careful when you go for tuition especially when you are alone in the class and not with a group of other students.</p>
              <p>Need to warn you guys that this particular centre that this tutor is running is now going through a hell lot of problems, apparently they owe some parents money (heard from my mum), and decided not to give tuition anymore after that. So no matter whether is it students or parents just be careful.</p>

              <p>True but this is not the case, they just took the money and ran off. They dont wan to do any extra classes for anyone who they owe lessons to. afterall all tuition centres collect money first then teach ma.

              <p>They even went to the HDB unit to knock on their door to ask for explaination but nobody answer the door, called the person in charge who is a guy win his late 30s and his assistant in her 30s-40s, and was either being ignored or they hang up the call on the other parents who they owe money to.</p>

              <p>Heard from my mum, they did call police but the police said they cant do anything to catch him back for cheating, but can charge him through lawyers.And the hdb ppl also went down to check on them as they got a lot of complains. Aunties talk and i was around to hear.</p>
              <p>I set up this thread is to warn ppl of tutors like that, especially HDB ones when its alrdy illegal at the first place.</p>
