Felt that I've slowly or unawaringly let my soul slipped away.... The true me? In fact it was not only once that this has happen to me... I realised that sometimes when you're unaware and least expected it, it just happens....<br><br>Couple of reasons I can find... Stress... Lost of control... Too short of time... Felt like short of breath...?<br><br>Sometimes things get a little fast-paced... And so TIGHT on your schedule that you've got hardly any time to do any thinking of your own.... This causes an UPSET in the balance of your Life.... Humans are thinking creatures... Very often when you're pushed to the extent of only worrying of what I should do immediately next before I get 'hit', that's when you lose it... Because you're NOT a MACHINE... Designed only to REACT with 'REFLEX'.... Of soul you live to feel.... To think... And to truly breathe and feel <span style="font-style: italic;">alive...</span><br><br>To overcome this, you can try a couple of the methods I'm recommending here....<br><br>1. Control and prioritised your Life.<br><br>You may have too many things and attachments on hand that you're beginning to feel that you're losing control over them. As you try to grab them all you can only watch helplessly as they slipped away.... List out things that are of utmost importance in your Life... The reason(s) why you're holding on to them... And when you understand that you really don't have the time and energy for everything, learn to let some of the less important (meaningful?) ones go.... You're making the choices here... Lose some then to lose all (including yourself...)....<br><br>2. <span style="font-style: italic;">Feel Life...</span><br><br>Don't just get stuck with work and "I have to do this", "I have to do that".... The fact is Life is a never ending process till the day you die... Take up some relaxation techniques like Yogo and Mediation.... Such techniques often emphasize on breathing which would essentially makes you feel more <span style="font-style: italic;">aware</span> that you're <span style="font-style: italic;">alive</span> and how great a thing that alone is.... Before you start to get on with your journey again, know how wonderful a thing it is to be alive and understand that without such a <span style="font-style: italic;">meaningful feeling</span>, Life (As a whole) is almost redundant....<br><br>3. <span style="font-style: italic;">Be</span> yourself again....<br><br>Just because you say that you're no longer who you used to be doesn't mean that you can't be who you once was again...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Relive your Life and do the things that you used to do.... The things that you liked to do but no longer have time to do nowadays.... I remember my buddy once told me "Everybody is given the same amount of time... If people can make it such that there's enough for them, it's not a miracle for you to do so too...?" Time is in YOUR HAND.... It's just up to you to distribute it....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Good luck, and hope you would learn to appreciate your Life as it is.... As ultimately, you would be the MAIN person to decide if it's gonna be a <span style="font-style: italic;">meaning one....?</span></div>
