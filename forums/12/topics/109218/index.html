They're like suns, compared to the stars we see everyday.<br><br>We revolve around them for the little while that we're able to see them, and then particularly because of the fact that we'll never see them again, our heart aches a bit for them.<br><br>I don't think this is infatuation. But rather, you've just met a Sun. I know you'll keep this memory of it in your mind for some time to come, but don't worry too much about it. Other people will come along... and you should count yourself lucky that you have had this pleasant, though short encounter...</div>
