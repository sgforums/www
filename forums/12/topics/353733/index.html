              <p>Not the type of person to stay in agony, but its still a problem I am finding hard to solve ..</p>
              <p>Haven't had any experience in a relationship tho i m supposed to be 21 this year.. so i can't tell the signs or anything..</p>
              <p>I have this best friend of mine whom
              i have known since JC.. abt 4 years ago, and we have remained best
              friends til now, or at least i regard her as one.. its like there's
              this really comfortable feeling just to be around her.. but in those 2
              years there was only friendship, sharing secrets, having those nice
              heart-to-heart conversations.. though after she found a bf i stayed
              away from her most of the time, occasionally meeting her in the sch
              library and stuff.. it was a little bit hard to adapt, but in the end i
              did and i thought maybe it was nice to have such a nice close friend of
              the opposite sex..</p>
              <p>well to this day, after graduation and passing through NS we
              remained quite close friends even tho there was minimal contact.. and
              at the time i was in NS for a while I had a crush on another classmate,
              and she helped me cross that hurdle at that time when i was rejected,
              even helping me to pass her bdae present to her..</p>
              <p>now
              in the year when everyone is turning 21 and having their birthday
              parties, it was only at her birthday party that i felt rather
              emotional, not the emo kind of emotional, but like feelings of
              happiness and stuff.. it was quite good..</p>
              <p>she broke up with her
              bf , whom i knew as a distant friend quite some time ago.. but i am
              unsure about her current status anyway... in our recent conversations the
              familiar confortable feeling is back, and its like.. a really blissful
              feeling...</p>
              <p>So, to be more clear about the problem is... i am not sure if it is really love. or even infatuation. but this feeling felt v different from when i had that crush on another friend, at that time it was mixed feelings of happiness, bitterness, and fear of rejection.. now my feelings are like, totally bliss and nothing else? its like plunging myself into a dream world where things go slower, just by talking to her...</p>
              <p>then again, i havent seen her for v long actually for these past 2 years, even tho the dream-like feeling is the same.. sometimes i wonder, can there be feelings of family or brotherly-sisterly love in these situations..? I mean, I don't think everything has to jump into lust then into love or something like those typical '1-hit KO' 'love at first sight' relationships .... am i right?</p>
              <p>still confused..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i'd say. you might still have feelings for her. but that might not be love. that's too strong a term to use for now. i suggest u can try talking to her more often now that you've realized a slight interest for her. and see where it goes. sometimes defining the exact feelings at too early a stage, it actually spoils the feeling of courtship and dating. most importantly, find out if she is still single and still has the heart the same like few years ago. enjoy yr time w her :)</p></div>

              <p><br>Anyway why do you need to distance yourself from her after she got a boyfriend?</p>
              <p>Seems like a common pattern that guys always tend to do end up doing some weird weird behaviour in an attempt to behave maturely.</p>

              <p>Hello TD88,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Parn has a point there. Why must you be silent about your love for her when she feels that maybe you should make that first move to confirm her curiosity about your feelings for her....had she already got a crush before on you before you found out that you too had this special feelings for her....just wondering maybe both of you were not really willing to express each other feelings when both of you should had made that known without thinking whether it was ok for any of you to express that feeling first without being embarrassed I guess.</p>

              <p>i dont know about girls. but usually guys, i think, fall in love easily and can get out of 1 as well. i think for u, u might have feelings for the girl and subconsciously, u were afraid that she treats u oni as a good friend and not ready to accept u for anything.</p>
              <p>all i can say is that just do watever u want. and dont regret. who knows shes thinking the same thing. just tell her how u feel.</p>

              <p>Q.C. Pak:</p>
              <p>Love is giving and not taking, unconditionally.</p>
              <p>From a person who has love and then lost it, I agree with that the most. Love is when you no longer think about yourself.</p>
              <p>Love makes you loose ego. That's why people who know, will never confuse it with lust, crush, or physical attraction.</p>
