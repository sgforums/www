              <p>My life is sort of deteriorating since 2005 (when I finished my O levels)...I went to JC, but I did badly for A levels, had H2Maths D, H2Chem C, H2Phy C, GP D, H1Geo D. During my time in NS I tried re-taking again, but in the last month before the exam I had a case of vertigo and ever since then I was going crazy trying to study by myself. Perhaps it was because I did not have anybody studying with me so I had nobody to turn to for questions... In the end my results were about the same and not any better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I ord'd last december and since then I've been teaching a bit of piano, but my applications to ntu were all expectedly unsuccessful. I tried applying to NAFA diploma in music and LaSalle BA in classical music, because after a lot of considering I decided I want to pursue a career in music (I have ABRSM grade 8 piano and A1 Music O level), however both were unsuccessful and currently I'm trying to apply a second time into Lasalle. Other than music I don't mind engineering if I can get into a course.</p>
              <p>However now I'm currently stuck doing nothing much since most other applications are over for this year's intake. Does anyone know any good overseas courses in music that I can ever hope to get into? Or should I attempt A levels again this year with some guidance? (I'd be 2-3 years later than university students my batch already though...) I need some direction in life, currently every day is passing pretty aimlessly...</p>

                                      don't mind engineering if I can get into a course."<br>Honestly, I don't think it should be a course you should be considering if your grades are not up to the standard plus you don't really have much interest in it in the first place. With that grades, it would be hard to get into a course in NUS, NTU or SMU.</p>
              <p>I would not really recommend taking A's for a third time, because you're
               pretty out of touch with the syllabus already, and it would just be 
              very difficult to catch up again. I have a couple of friends who retook 
              A's and didn't do any better than the first time they took it. Unless 
              you are a really determined person, taking it private is quite taxing.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should identify what is it that you really want to do in future and you can either apply to get a</p>

              <p>Will, trust me. Although they say by 2015 all teachers must have a degree, they are still taking in dip students now. There are also students with straight "D"s who get in for the degree program, so getting in is not a problem if you can perform for the interview.</p>
              <p>The real nightmare begins when you study there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Fren,</p>
              <p>U need to seek life elsewhere (perhaps Thailand or Philippines). Singapore life is too challenging. Your results don't look too bad but it is the life here made by PAP that made us all to be "better, cheaper and faster". As one forumer said, you need a degree to teach primary school. Why is poly a backward step? It is education and you want a refreshing start. You;'re not doing anything illegal. Come on, think about it.</p>
              <p>I don't think a career as a music teacher is viable unless you want to do it part time. You could go for more lucrative courses such as sound engineer. I have seen these people coordinating the lightings and sound boards during concerts, studio recordings and plays.</p>
              <p>You are still young, go around and ask. If you know anybody who is a music teacher, ask them about the career and courses to take. Once you reach 30, it is too late.</p>

              <p>Will, trust me. Although they say by 2015 all teachers must have
              a degree, they are still taking in dip students now. There are also
              students with straight "D"s who get in for the degree program, so
              getting in is not a problem if you can perform for the
              interview.</p>

              <p>That was what I mean by TS selling his soul to MOE. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>He will still need to go for the dip or degree program, cannot run. These programs, along with the PGDE (only for degree holders), are for those who want to be teachers. Since he want to try for a degree course and teach music at the same time, why not sell his soul to MOE? <img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I think A levels and poly education is out of the question for you. You don't like to study, so go back also no use. Although you fail, at least you have learnt one thing- traditional studies is not for you. If you think that you can at least survive traditional music studies in schools like laselle or nafa, then go for it lor. It depends on what you really want to become; what you mean by "career in music"? You mean like become a music teacher, a musician, a popstar?</p>
              <p>If you just want to be music teacher, very easy. Everyday play piano, get more students via word of mouth. Or better, you sign up with a music teaching school to teach music- safer that way. If you got money and time to spare, and want to diversify, i suggest you go to My Drum School. It's a school to learn drums (duh). After learning past a certain level, you can ask the headmaster (James) whether or not he needs a teacher/trainer. He probably is still employing people, so can get a job there. I heard starting salary is like $25 bucks per hour, and it's very good and enjoyable business. I study there before, for only 1.5 years, he ask if I want to study to be teacher. Too bad I got A levels and NS, otherwise I will get job there le. James is very nice wan also, so sure got chance wan. Music teacher, whether piano or drums, can earn lots of money for little effort wan.</p>
              <p>If you want to be more professional, or a musician, then no choice, must go laselles and NAFA, or overseas if u rich lah. If you want to be popstar, then i dunno. Most popstar also got poor education, but they got talent, and good people skills. If u think u have that then go for it lor, though i still think music teacher will suit u.</p>

              <p>Go for what you like in life, if you look around, some successful peoples do not hve high education, but they are happy in their life, cos they choose what they believe and like. And when you do thing that you like and enjoy, you get motivated and do well.</p>
