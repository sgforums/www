What makes you think you are so special in this world that you are the only female that dates overage man with children? You said you 'genuinely' love him but I seriously doubt so. If you really 'genuinely' in love with this overage with a child guy than what has his number has to do with your decision or desire to be with him. Let's try an analyze a little further in your unfounded doubts about this relationship.<br><br>Age - Are you afraid he is unable to perform sexually and also because you are 'afraid' he might have low sperm count that may hindered your plan on having kids of your own in future should you marry him? Unfounded doubts. There are viagra that a man a better sex partner. Ok, big deal if he has low sperm count. You can always opt for artificial insemination if you are a healthy young female with no health complication.<br><br>Then you state your concern of him having a child. Ok, despite you admitting you having a good relationship with his daughter yet it prompts you to ask a unnecessary question about any other females in your situation dating a man with a child - Look around you and open your eyes. There ARE tons of single woman having a relationship with divorce men and it's not only happening in the angmohs society. Any kind of race will have such situation.So there again another unfounded worry or concern on your part.<br><br>You also mention circumstances are tough but did not care to elaborate? What circumstances? Afraid of society gossips because of age differences? Come on girl, if you really love this guy as you claim do you care how society look at you? Furthermore if you marry him you might follow him back to OZ and the angmohs wouldn't give a hoot who you knocked up with.<br><br>Oh, maybe you are 'worried' or 'afraid' your family or friends won't accept him because of the so-called differences you mention? If your family have no issue of accepting him as your future mate why would you bother what other people say. Ultimately it's you going to live out your life with him, not them. And even if your parents disagree, will that really bother you that much? And you are already a mature thinking adult assuming you are really mature.<br><br>So what or where is the obstacle or barrier you feel you are facing? Almost none.<br><br>The barrier or obstacle is ACTUALLY YOU YOURSELF. YOU ARE NOT REALLY THAT HAPPY OR IN ON THIS RELATIONSHIP DESPITE YOUR ADAMANT CLAIM THAT YOU GENUINELY LOVE. The age and the child issue is just a subconscious denial on your part. I would seriously suggest you take a step back and reflect on yourself. Be very very honest with yourself and ask the question. Do you really really love this overage guy with a child that really much or was it of some fear in you that you are already 26 and still find no real suitable match? So it's time to grab somebody, ANYBODY in case you felt you might miss the boat and eventually got left on the shelf if you don't make a move now.<br><br>Don't cheat yourself especially the guy into a relationship you are really trying to find fault with. It hurts both party especially the guy when he had already gone through one lousy patch in his life.<br><br></div>
