            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>I am a 26 year old woman, dating a man 17 years older than myself, who has a 10 year old daughter who lives in Australia with her Mum.<br><br>Our relationship is complicated, and I can't even begin to explain.<br><br>My problem is that, because of our huge age difference, coupled with the fact that he already has a child, I am not sure if he wants the same things as I do.<br><br>I want 3 - 4 kids, and when I asked if he would like more children, his reply is "I don't mind'. We are in very different stages of our lives. I am young and full of hope for my future, whereas he has pretty much achieved what he desired (Career, kid), hence, he doesn't seem to enthusiastic about OUR future.<br><br>I feel resentful, and when I talk to my partner about this, he always says that I have nothing to worry about.<br><br>I stepped into this relationship understanding that there will be baggage, and I have put my own feelings aside and braved them all. I've met his ex-partner, faced her friends, gone for family gatherings in Australia and moved into his home. I've done all this despite my own anxieties.<br><br>I'm resentful of the fact that my life is and will continue to revolve around him and his past.  That this relationship (I quote him) is "so easy" whereas I feel like I am battling everything on my own.<br><br>I am at breaking point.<br></div>

Give some time, meet more people, and u can find a more suitable life partner. Less complicated, and more happiness.<br><br>Life already has too much problem on its own, but at least on the matter of marriage, we are supposed to have our choice and steer our future. I will not want to add my life's problems and burdens with marrying this man. If I were you. It is just tiring, and life is too short.<br><br>Since you are 26, you are still young, you have alot of time, give yourself a pause, a break, and self-reflect. You dont need to settle with him right now. Dont rush and force yourself into something you might regret later.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's true that you had put in a lot of effort , meeting the other family, etc.<br><br>But to his credit, he did play his part in integrating you into his life and ex-family.  He did not shut you out or kept you as an insignificant girlfriend.  Instead he opened his life to you, gave you the respect and recognition you deserve.<br><br>Unless you feel that he has done nothing of the above?<br><br>Maybe what you feel now is the frustration of how much extra must be done for this relationship as compared to one with a single guy.<br><br>IMO tell him honestly how you feel.  More importantly, identify the things he can do that will make you feel loved and appreciated, and tell him to do those methods accordingly.  I don't think he has done nothing for you.  But perhaps he needs to show more appreciation and in ways that you can recognise and treasure.</div>
