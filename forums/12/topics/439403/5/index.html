              <p>Whatever you say, really. Perhaps some charity work will do you

                              Nobody wants you to sugarcoat your words. In fact, your rage is
                              unnecessary. Just ask anyone else. Someone perhaps could TRULY be

                              brink of something. And you probably might just tip them over the

              <p>2nd group are the fakers . These people act only .. get attention.. get sympathy. Really they no guts de. Take advantage of people kindness.. very annoying . Today don't die.. they will try another day to die... never ending de lah. These kind of people make it very difficult for other genuine cases to get real help.. very selfish lor.</p>
              <p>I think your mother number 1.. you number 2.</p>
              <p>Then there are 3 kinds of spectators lah.</p>

              <p>One that refuses to acknowledge his internal issues and automatically assumes he's better than majority of the population. Not incredibly surprising but this self-assurance had to come from somewhere. Good that you've seen suicides. But I bet you never performed an autopsy. </p>
              <p>A typical habit of most causes/sufferers of suicide victims, is they either convince themselves that that person was never really worth caring about since they don't care about their own life, to get over it. Because they refuse to appear pathetic. They act tough, and carry on with their own lives perpetually pissed off/disturbed.</p>
              <p>Perhaps a slight humility will do you good. There truly are ugly sides to this world. Issues are plenty. Don't masturbate 24/7. Go out and do something for society. Internet is pointless. </p>
