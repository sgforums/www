              agree. TS should also install cameras to see exactly WHAT is happening. once domestic abuse starts, i dun think psychiatric help will work. gotta report mum to police.

              <p>Would u? If ur mum tell ur maid to "use her fucking filipino intelligence" or "shut the fuck up", shout every morning?</p>
              <p>Eh. Personality is one thing. But if someone is a BIG asshole, how are they gonna learn it's wrong? Just because I wanna report my mom doesn't mean i don't love her. </p>
              <p>So u saying I should keep quiet, allow her to continue because according to jojobeach, I don't bite the hand that feeds me. But then again, maybe my maid is an ungrateful bastard also right. Because my mom is so kind to hire her, so even if my mom fucks her up, it's ok.</p>
              <p>There's only 3 of us in the house. To live together harmoniously, there must be some kind of respect between everyone. It's like society. If I see some guy hit his girlfriend in public, u think i stand there and watch ? It's WRONG. If it takes my mother getting barred from hiring maids or going to jail or whatever, frankly, SO BE IT. It's very wrong, and everyone learns lessons in life the easy way or the hard way. It's either that or as everyone else says, we kenna period blood in our food. </p>

              <p>Oh yes. Super lazy. In fact all I do at home all day is watch tv, and live off my poor mother who has every reason to be a complete asshole to everyone else. And the least I should do is coax her everyday because poor thing, she has problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fuck you, jojo. You base EVERYTHING on assumptions and completely illogical conclusions based on summaries people write. You don't even know fuckshit about ANYONE else, because hey, I read almost everything you posted and I realized you're exactly like how you just described my mom. You are bitter as fuck, and people don't need that here. </p>
              <p>You should go reflect and consider why many turn to this forum. You've been using this as your fucking channel to oust your own bullshit.</p>
              <p>My mother is god damn successful, and still complains life is horrible to her. There are other people suffering out there, and for a person who has amassed so much money in her life, there is no satisfaction. Her weapon of choice to assert her powertrips is insults. Now I'm sure people like YOU would enjoy being insulted 24-7, but self-respecting individuals don't. </p>
              <p>We've tried the nice way, the hard way, every single possible way to persuade her. But if one person is blind, the rest of the world cannot force open his eyes. </p>
              <p>You think you know alot about life, jojo? I would've applauded you if you were correct in your summary about me being a lazy fuck. In fact I probably wish I was. But I'm sorry. No. Just because I want to report this issue, does not mean I don't love my mother. I love her very much, but I cannot allow something so immoral to continue. In the end, what if she ends up losing all her friends, because it's happening already. Her family? Because that's happening as well. And perhaps preferably BEFORE my maid decides to murder her in her sleep or something. How the FUCK would I know. </p>
              <p>So get a grip. Stop being impatient and dramatising shit. Just stfu, read and make constructive comments. In fact. wth. I'll just probably ignore you. </p>

              <p>You should go reflect and consider why many turn to this forum.
                                                          You've been using this as your fucking channel to oust your own

                                                          24-7, but self-respecting individuals don't. </p>
              <p>We've tried the nice way, the hard way, every single possible
                                                          way to persuade her. But if one person is blind, the rest of the

                                                          In fact I probably wish I was. But I'm sorry. No. Just because I

                                                          happening as well. And perhaps preferably BEFORE my maid decides to
                                                          murder her in her sleep or something. How the FUCK would I
                                                          know. </p>
              <p>So get a grip. Stop being impatient and dramatising shit. Just
                                                          stfu, read and make constructive comments. In fact. wth. I'll just
                                                          probably ignore you. </p>

              <p>Time to get off your high horse Princess.</p>
              <p>Have you tried TALKING to your mother about this ? If she don't want to listen to you.. then it's time to pack your bag and leave.. with only herself in the household.. she don't need a full time maid.</p>
              <p>Your mom is not poor.. she is VERY RICH. That's why you refused to leave that house.</p>
              <p>You want to bitch and moan about how IMMORAL your mother is.</p>
              <p>You cannot get along with your mother.. yet you still want to enjoy her MONEY and the convenience of what HER money can buy.</p>
              <p>You hide your ugliness under the guise of fillial piety? Frankly who are you kidding ?.. SHE's the one taking care of you.. not the other way round. After she dies.. it will be HER money that needs to take care of you until you die.</p>
              <p>Like I said.. go ahead and tape your mom's atrocities..report her to the authorities.  I'd love to see how you sink with that. These forumers here who nudged you along.. they'd be the one laughing at you.</p>
              <p>Just because you are too stupid to realise what a fool you are... does not mean your mom is stupid as well. I bet she is many times more smarter than you. Too bad.. even the most powerful/smartest have their weakness.. and YOu are her achilles heel.</p>
              <p>After that stupid deed of yours.. you will have NO maid.. NO place to stay.. NO more financial support from your mother.  She may likely Will all inheritance to some distant relative you don't even know exist.. Best yet... Will all her money/assets to some Charity like the NKF just to spite the shit out of you.</p>
              <p>And again.. when all you have to do is learn how to operate your washing machine so you can wash your own panties.... use a broom/vacuum cleaner.. and start the microwave oven so you don't starve at home.</p>
              <p>Yet.. you want to continue this DRAMA of yours to screw your mother, it's simply amazing.</p>
              <p>But wait.. this is not just about how she treats your maid is it ? 
                                  It's about how much you hated your mom and truly wants to see her suffer
                                   because she treated you like dirt. </p>
              <p>The maid issue is just one way you can have your revenge and get away like a cowardly little shit head that you are.</p>
              <p>Gota love it...</p>
              <p>Like I said... Good luck with your foolish way. Hope your mother do get 
                                                          some "education" out of all these. </p>
              <p>After she lost her job because of what you did.. both of you can go hug/kill each other under a tent at Changi beach for the rest of your life.</p>
              <p>Do you have a <strong>rich</strong> boyfriend yet ? I hope you do. Poor husbands cannot afford the kind of spoilt brat lifestyle you are so used to, Princess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Indeed this is Aunt Agony.. I post so YOU don't need to get screwed over by your own stupid action.</p>
              <p> Powertrips insults ? LOL.. that only affects people who have inferior complex  Especially painful coming from someone you have no choice but <strong>depend</strong> on.</p>
              <p>If you are confident of your own ability/independence.. powertrip insults are like farts. They stink .. but that's about it. So quit being such a leech.. your mom would have nothing on you.</p>
