              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Time to get off your high horse Princess.</p>
              <p>Your mom is not poor.. she is VERY RICH. That's why you refused
                  to leave that house.</p>
              <p>You want to bitch and moan about how IMMORAL your mother is.</p>
              <p>You cannot get along with your mother.. yet you still want to
                  enjoy her MONEY and the convenience of what HER money can buy.</p>
              <p>You hide your ugliness under the guise of fillial piety?
                  Frankly.. she's the one taking care of you.. not the other way
                  round. After she dies.. it will be HER money that needs to take
                  care of you until you die.</p>
              <p>Like I said.. go ahead and tape your mom's atrocities..report
                  her to the authorities.  I'd love to see how you sink with
                  that. These forumers here who nudged you along.. they'd be the one
                  laughing at you.</p>
              <p>Just because you are too stupid to realise what a fool you
                  are... does not mean your mom is stupid as well. I bet she is many
                  times more smarter than you.</p>
              <p>After that stupid deed of yours.. you will have NO maid.. NO
                  place to stay.. NO more financial support from your mother. 
                  She may likely Will all inheritance to some distant relative you
                  don't even know exist.. Best yet... Will all her money/assets to
                  some Charity like the NKF just to spite the shit out of you.</p>
              <p>And again.. when all you have to do is learn how to operate your
                  washing machine so you can wash your own panties.... use a
                  broom/vacuum cleaner.. and start the microwave oven so you don't
                  starve at home.</p>
              <p>Yet.. you want to continue this DRAMA of yours to screw your
                  mother, it's simply amazing.</p>
              <p>Like I said... Good luck with your foolish way. Hope your mother
                  do get some "education" out of all these. </p>
              <p>After she lost her job.. both of you can go hug each other under
                  a tent at Changi beach for the rest of your life.</p>
              <p>Do you have a <strong>rich</strong> boyfriend yet ? I hope you
                  do. Poor husbands cannot afford the kind of spoilt brat lifestyle
                  you are so used to, Princess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Lol. You're absolutely right. What a revelation. So I'm the psycho. I should really go reflect on my own life and while that happens, ignore what's going on at home. </p>
              <p>Don't fake intelligence. You appeared bright before you spoke. People also speak the way they live their lives. Hence, I deduce you must either have had an extremely deprived childhood, or your parents just never really put you back in the cage you belonged to. </p>
              <p>People don't come here for sympathy, but for solutions. Mommy never hugged you enough? </p>
              <p>If you are so incredibly fore-sighted, then pray tell. What do you expect me to do? My FATHER brought me up well. Naturally, I admit when I was young, I was so incredibly spoilt because I got everything I wanted. All that changed when he died. In fact, many things did. Not only did I swallow every tear to appear strong for her, but there are many things and sacrifices I had made. My yearn was for a simple life. hers was not. We have clashed there and many other aspects. Both our acceptances and faults have been objectively looked at. Key word is OBJECTIVE.</p>
              <p>Perhaps YOU seem to think that everyone who posts here is either too spoilt/pathetic/dramatic. But it is also YOU that fails to understand the human threshold. It's YOUR high horse you should fall from. One day, if you continue posting rubbish when other people are honestly seeking help, someday Aunt Agony forums will just be another bullshit place for arseholes to vent their crap on other people. It'll be your haven by then.</p>
              <p>Because right now, I'm already beginning to feel as long as people post here, they're going to encounter a free-loading, bitter piece of crap of a human being called jojobeach. </p>
              <p>Ever take law? There's always two things needed. Mind and body. And you will NEVER know if someone is truly upset. And there you go putting all your bullshit on that someone till they jump off a block because of what you said. I hope you sleep well at night. </p>
              <p>Speech over.</p>

              <p>Amid your rants, I see your point. But it does not change what I see in you, and rather than being a keyboard warrior, I suggest you get a real job. If you want to start a war, or somehow you're aching for one, there's one happening in the Middle East. Perhaps you should consider migration.</p>

              <p>Well, what do you believe? Because people like you have firm beliefs and are probably relentless in pursuing them. Like your other posts.There are some idiots, perhaps, in the next generation. The people who apparently can't eat as much shit as you do and complain more. Unfortunately after talking to you, there are idiots also in the previous one. </p>
              <p>You perhaps MAY be doing others a favour showing them their blind spots, but you haven't been shown your own, have you. You think you're doing the rest of the world a favour because you sit behind your keyboard and bomb sgforums? Do CHARITY. Go out, use your hands and HELP someone. Seriously. I don't know what is the source of this bitter rage in you. You sound like a strong-headed pissy piece of shit. In fact, it's also a vicious cycle for you. In the auntagony forums, especially. You start pissing people off, and their replies are unpleasant. One after the other, you deal with it till it becomes either amusement or fun to you. </p>
              <p>You probably wonder why the world is so full of stupid people, why can't more people be like you.</p>

              <p>Well, what do you believe? Because people like you have firm
              beliefs and are probably relentless in pursuing them. Like your
              other posts.There are some idiots, perhaps, in the next generation.
              The people who apparently can't eat as much shit as you do and
              complain more. Unfortunately after talking to you, there are idiots
              also in the previous one. </p>
              <p>You perhaps MAY be doing others a favour showing them their

              think you're doing the rest of the world a favour because you sit
              behind your keyboard and bomb sgforums? Do CHARITY. Go out, use
              your hands and HELP someone. Seriously. I don't know what is the
              source of this bitter rage in you. You sound like a strong-headed
              pissy piece of shit. In fact, it's also a vicious cycle for you. In
              the auntagony forums, especially. You start pissing people off, and

              <p>Whatever you say, really. Perhaps some charity work will do you some good. </p>
              <p>Don't be disappointed that half the world doesn't meet your expectations. That is how life is.</p>
              <p>And instead of attacking people, perhaps assist them in solving the problem next time. Such self-assurance can only come from pure cockiness on your end. </p>
              <p>Enjoy it while it lasts. And by the way? While you're at it. Nobody wants you to sugarcoat your words. In fact, your rage is unnecessary. Just ask anyone else. Someone perhaps could TRULY be in dire need, perhaps they've phrased their post wrong, or at the brink of something. And you probably might just tip them over the edge.</p>
