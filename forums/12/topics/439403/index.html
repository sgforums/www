              <p>Hi guys, here's the situation. Every morning my maid Jo would get scolded by my mother for one reason or another. Sometimes my mother would mutter insults under her breath, sometimes it's full on shouting. So far, the scoldings have been about stupid things like vegetables or the way the food is cooked.</p>
              <p>We don't use salt or sugar at home to cook, or minimal. The worst was when one day she used slightly "too much seasoning and salt" (actually tasted quite good to me, I don't complain anyway), my mother freaked. She said "your parents both got cancer you will cook this kind of thing for them? Poison your parents!" Then she just continued to go on and on and on for the next half hour about Jo's parents. They do have cancer that's why she's here. It's fucking horrible.</p>
              <p>The other big situation was mom saying her nieces and nephews (my cousins) saw Jo with her boyfriend and tried to call out to her. They were gossiping amongst themselves wondering if who they saw was male or female. Like typical aunties who gossip about everything. Firstly, my mother's family is full of shit. Secondly, I don't even know if it's true because she likes to create stupid scenarios like this to force people to confess to things they truly never did. As long as she believes something she'll just make you confess. Jo was desperately trying to tell her her boyfriend was in the Philippines, and had no reason to lie.</p>
              <p>My maid can only answer yes or no. She had to fight for her off-day, otherwise she'd have none. The previous one had no off day for 7 months and didn't last a year. In fact we've switched 4 or 5 maids in the past 6 months. And mom would only tell the maid to pack up and fuck off on the day they're meant to. I've intervened many times already, and it fucks with my sleep. Then I'm accused of conspiring with the maid. Wtf.</p>
              <p>The worst was when she deducts her already minimal salary, like 5 bucks each time she forgets to do something or cooks something wrong. It's fucking ridiculous. Mom says something about her being the "paymaster", or whatever. Yea she's a boss somewhere in a big company. So she probably thinks everybody is her god damn slave because she has money. Basically la. </p>
              <p>I need to put a stop to this. But I've read somewhere about the Penal Code and she hasn't quite hit her yet. This has to stop. I don't know what else to do. I know it all sounds quite mild but it's accumulated over the months she's been here. I cannot bring myself to be close to anyone of my maids. Even the one who worked quite some time for us before couldn't tahan and up and left. I'm really going nuts. And when my mom's full of shit family comes over, they just treat Jo like dirt. Because of what my mother says so they act upon the pre-conceived notion that Jo's dumb or whatever my mother makes her out to be. </p>
              <p>I don't know how to proceed from here. I desperately need intervention at home.</p>

              <p>There is a lot of problem with Singapore Aunties, I do not understand why they treat their own maid like slave, something is wrong with sg aunties, I treat my maids very well, very week sunday off, work until after dinner can go sleep and morning start at 8, just like working, sat, half day, cos we eat out. Both of them with us for 7 years already. I heard alot of stories about their own countries sisters who are suffering here as maid, and mostly under some nasty sg aunties.</p>
              <p>I think all these aunties need to go counselling before getting a maid, make it a pre requisite, if not..omg, can even cut people pay like nobody business. As for TS, you can also secretly compensate back to the maid, and maybe some extra for her suffering, hopefully, she can finish her contract and go home in one piece</p>

              Ts,
              Your mother ought to be locked up for good - what she really is has surfaced - her neuroisis. I am so disgusted as to the manner in which in another human being can be abused. 
              I dont know how old u are but to just watch these ongoings and wishing that it would go awy is not going to happen.
              U need to act and put an end to the misery that visits this domestic helper via of a sick adult!
              Some have offered invaluable suggestions - dont wait anymore. 
              
              PS - Of course, all that has been posted by you - hopefully it as ti transpired  n not exaggerated. If it is - then know this - u are in the same predicament as your mother is!

              <p>I don't know about TS's mum but I missed my mum. We have issues since I was young. I am the middle child and always lack of care, love and concern. I seek attention by behaving badly, mischievously and I never knew it until I read about it years later after I became an adult. It's the common traits for middle child as they are sandwiched by 2 other siblings.</p>
              <p>My mum and I were loggerheads. We fight always, I ran away from home many times. She hit me and I hit her back, she scold me and I scold her back, I even cursed her many times. I am such a F U brat in the past. </p>
              <p>Now that I am older only to realise family members are the most important people in our lives. They are the only one we can trust and they are the only one we can truly be ourselves without fear of unacceptance, especially our mothers because they gave birth to us after many months of suffering and that's why our birthdays are also know as the æ¯�äº²å�—éš¾æ—¥.</p>
              <p>Treasure your loved ones before it's too late and this sentence is too true but many fail to understand.</p>
              <p>I agree we have to be realistic and therefore we shouldn't expect too much from a domestic helper. </p>
              <p>Give them a schedule or a timetable to follow and many chores are not done daily I am sure there is a way to cope with a small family of 4.</p>
              <p>I know we side tracked but I just want to share my thoughts and feelings. I don't live in Singapore anymore and my family is a few thousand miles away from me, half the time I cry myself to sleep because I missed them and I really want to be with them but it does not permits me due to my current and probably future commitments. =(</p>

              are sandwiched by 2 other siblings.</p>
              <p>My mum and I were loggerheads. We fight always, I ran away from
              home many times. She hit me and I hit her back, she scold me and I
              scold her back, I even cursed her many times. I am such a F U brat
              in the past. </p>
              <p>Now that I am older only to realise family members are the most
              important people in our lives. They are the only one we can trust
              and they are the only one we can truly be ourselves without fear of
              unacceptance, especially our mothers because they gave birth to us
              after many months of suffering and that's why our birthdays are
              also know as the æ¯�äº²å�—éš¾æ—¥.</p>
              <p>Treasure your loved ones before it's too late and this sentence
              is too true but many fail to understand.</p>
              <p>I agree we have to be realistic and therefore we shouldn't
              expect too much from a domestic helper. </p>
              <p>Give them a schedule or a timetable to follow and many chores
              are not done daily I am sure there is a way to cope with a small
              family of 4.</p>
              <p>I know we side tracked but I just want to share my thoughts and
              feelings. I don't live in Singapore anymore and my family is a few
              thousand miles away from me, half the time I cry myself to sleep
              because I missed them and I really want to be with them but it does
              not permits me due to my current and probably future commitments.

              <p>Some times...a family get along better when they don't live together.</p>
              <p>Mothers are human beings.. they do have their personal prejudices and preferences.</p>
              <p>Some are more self-ish than others..  some are more giving and nurturing.</p>
              <p>You are an adult now. Time to blaze your own trail in life.</p>
              <p>"Your children are not your children. 
              <br> <br>They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. 
              <br> <br>They come through you but not from you, 
              <br> <br>And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you. 
              <br> <br>You may give them your love but not your thoughts. 
              <br> <br>For they have their own thoughts. 
              <br> <br>You may house their bodies but not their souls, 
              <br> <br>For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. 
              <br> <br>You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. 
              <br> <br>For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. 
              <br> <br>You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth. 
              <br> <br>The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far. 
              <br> <br>Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness; 
              <br> <br>For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable."</p>
              <p>- Khalil Gibran</p>
