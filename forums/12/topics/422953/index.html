              <p><br>You are right, i did some old uncles and aunties at my outside coffee shop during our empty talk break with eggs, coffee and BBQ roti, they said, as we grow older, there isn't much time left in this world, so if you still remain unselfish and do not take care of yourself, then you got nothing left when you get older. This is a typical mentality of human nature, as when the house get smaller, people start to chomp for rooms.</p>

              <p>do wrong will find people for blame</p>
              <p>when people grow older their experience in work / life  level up and thus they become more self aware.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you will realise that $$$ rules everything and $$$ can only be obtained through hardwork / pain /time -spend... so they look like they become more selfish, but the facts is the younger are more naive, more blur thus when they suffered something they remembered and when they are older, they got lots of shit of life and become more self aware thus look like selfish.</p>

              <p>let me put it the other way, people actually got so much knowledge that end up they do not know what is what, and most oldies do mind their words because we look at old peoples as our mentor, so they cannot anyhow said something that is out of date or not true, on the other hand, some oldies do know it inside their heart, but do not know how to express it out, and even if they do express it out, they may express it wrongly and thereby sent a wrong signal to the young, so end up, they are more conservatives about what they said and take responsible on what they said more than young people like me who just blar blar like no tomorrow. But in the eyes of those youngs who do not understand oldies, they label them as selfish, which is quite unfair.</p>
              <p>Also, playful youngster like us, in the eyes of most oldies, are not worth talking to...</p>

              <p>things had changed. new generation do no look upon mentor. what ever you just said is already the past. move on. the sad thing is the old generation cannot keep up the pace and was left out. in short. the old generation lack of knowledge to mingle with the new generation. so who is unfair?</p>
