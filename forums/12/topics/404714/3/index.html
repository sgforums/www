              <p>@93'guy, Me know :) Thanks again. And Damn this 5 minute
              interval of posting limit crap.</p>
              <p>@toyota-corolla, I wont tell her to lie, lol. And she's mostly
              with her friends all the time, and i dont have the guts to confess
              infront of her friends. Especially when you know at least two of
              them likes you and the fear of rejection being witnessed by a
              crowd, altogether with the embarassing atmosphere that will
              pressure her.</p>
              <p>Been contacting for two months, i went to her house a few times
              to help her with some delivery of stuff haha. And yea, go get some
              gals :D</p>

              <p>I agree. There's this girl I woo recently, took me 6 months, before we came to the conclusion we remain as friends.</p>
              <p>She's the lady, I always wanted to be with, but you ought to respect one desicion when if one rejected you. Least she gave me a chance to woo her. We both were very appericatitive of each other action and commitement.</p>
              <p>We hit off very well too. And it only took me like 10 months, before I announce my confession, despite we know each other for 5 years, we reconnected recently.</p>

              <p>if a girl thinks that just becos u lose interest in her and she does likewise, then move on...very simple lol.</p>
              <p>If she really likes u and then finds u losing interest in her, she will be even more interested in you. Thats provided shes interested in u la haha. I dunno abt girls these days but many of them during the 90s (my gen) tend to be quiet if they like a guy. Those pretty ones especially. Why? Because its a matter of face to them and they have guys chasing them all the time.</p>

              <p>Look if she is not interest in you Now...there is nothing you can do....don't go beating your hearts out..........but after all both of you are still in the same school for another year or 2.  Plenty of time to see her and look at other flowers at the same time. If this one don't fall.  Don't waste tears over it.</p>
              <p>Anyway you can meet in school library in the name of Study Lah....Create a "Study Buddy" ......</p>
