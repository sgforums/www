              <p>If you really wanna tell her via face to face, perhaps may I suggest that you meet her up in school, one to one? Is quite easy to ask, but at your age I dunno, cos at my age now (19), I'll just straight away date the lady out, and tell her. If else fails, email will be the next best shit for me, if still fails, SMS. You never know when you get to meet your kind of eyecandy again. Is either you take it slow and tell her, or don't tell and remain as friends for as long as you guys live. Confess, at least it ease your burden of being so damn stressout, and you get a damn straight answer. Hide it, remain regretful for as long as you live, but remain as friends, but you'll never know what's her answer.</p>
              <p>I hope this helps, although it doesn't make sense somewhere. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Again, thank you guys for all the suggestions and advices!</p>
              <p>By the way, if she oftenly text's me with words of encouragement, eg. I'm suppose to go for tution like now, then she text's "Jia you! Must study horr, dont keep text! :)" Is that a hint? Or do all girls say that to friends?</p>

              we're human. We have feelings, i guess and i swear i wont let any
              BGR affect my studies. I know what comes first.</p>
              <p>Again, thank you guys for all the suggestions and advices!</p>
              <p>By the way, if she oftenly text's me with words of
              encouragement, eg. I'm suppose to go for tution like now, then she
              text's "Jia you! Must study horr, dont keep text! :)" Is that a
              hint? Or do all girls say that to friends?</p>

              <p>Well, alternatively, you can confess to her in a friendship way, like you can confess attraction to her. Either way, I doubt she will be that dumb, not to be friends after rejecting you. Never happened to me before whenever I confess, is either is yes, or see how it goes, or no. Even if its no, we'll become good/close friends afterwards. Girls are soft inside, they won't suka suka don't wanna be friends with you. At most ignore you for a few weeks make your life miserable temporary? Happened to me twice only, but subsequently, we talked subsequently and brush it off. As for the others, those had rejected me, we just remain close friends, once in awhile, we will talk about the confession and have a good laugh at it.</p>
              <p>Golden rule bro, regardless you are wooing, confessing or anything, never pressure a lady. They don't like the feeling of being pressured.</p>

              <p>Okay, seriously, you don't have to date her to a movie just to confess attraction. You can well, say, ask her what's her program after school, then before she leaves school, try to squeeze your 'confession plan' into her program. If you lagi daring, confess infront of her friends. WHOOOOOO! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> (I'm serious and if you have a very thick face like mine <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">).</p>

              <p>forget it la, if she's under control of her parents. I can tell u at age 15, it's very difficult. She incurs the wrath of her parents and that will make her unhappy.</p>
              <p>And perhaps u read too much into the texts. In my opinion, many girls find texting a big chore. Girls like to look into the eyes of guys they like, engage in coversation rather than texting all day long.</p>
              <p>My 2 cents worth.</p>

              <p>@93'guy, Me know :) Thanks again. And Damn this 5 minute interval of posting limit crap.</p>
              <p>@toyota-corolla, I wont tell her to lie, lol. And she's mostly with her friends all the time, and i dont have the guts to confess infront of her friends. Especially when you know at least two of them likes you and the fear of rejection being witnessed by a crowd, altogether with the embarassing atmosphere that will pressure her.</p>
              <p>Been contacting for two months, i went to her house a few times to help her with some delivery of stuff haha. And yea, go get some gals :D</p>
              <p>@Rock^Star, she does talk to me when we meet and we do maintain a healthy eye contact, just that we barely get a chance to meet, and usually she's with her clique and i'm with mine.</p>
