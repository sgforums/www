            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mr Seeker (I've deliberately left out the word in front),<br><br>You're probably thinking too much &amp; reading too much into what she's saying, etc?  She's probably taking her time to decide between the 2 of you, &amp; frankly, I'm Not gonna judge whether that's wrong or Not, unless there's deliberate manipulation on her part.  Frankly, this is called playing the field, &amp; it's pretty common...  However, I don't really get the "Not sincere enough" remark, perhaps she's trying to spur you on to make you give her even more attention.  Personally, I don't practise such tactics, as it only spurs the guy on to super-human efforts, but when he can't maintain that effort, it'll only lead to disappointment later.<br><br>My own experience is that my guy friends who're suckered into this kinda thing, eventually find that they can't stomach the loss of the girl (i.e. she decides on another guy).  Their main lament?  "But I've invested so much time, effort, etc in her" plus what's implicit, "I really NEED to have her, or my money back" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I think by now you should get the gist of what I'm trying to tell you, very gently.  If you choose to heed it, good on you.  If you choose Not to, please know that I won't waste time on people who won't help themselves.  I've had people PM me, ignore my advice, then come crying back to me, hoping for me to say something encouraging.  Most of the time, I can't do anything more than that.<br><br>If you choose to persist in your efforts to pursue her, I would seriously advise you to still mentally prepare yourself for the fact that at the end of the day, you might Not even be her choice.  At least mentally &amp; emotionally prepare yourself.  If she chooses you, then good on you.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by boobs_seeker:</div><div class="quote_body">heres my story. i told tis gal frm my company i like her 2weeks ago. at 1st she say she dun like mi  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> but lata say 2b frenz 1st. but lately she suddenly told mi terz tis guy tackling her like crazy siah almost send her hm everyday <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> wat she is going 2 prove 2 mi? when at work she c mi like pai say pai say like tis dun dare 2 tok 2 mi. dan i ask her y she say she oso dun noe &amp; say nid time 4 us both &amp; oso say i not sincere enough. hmmmm does tis mean she got feel 4 mi, wat she wan mi  2 siah i realli duno <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  sumtime i feel sad like juz fuck it lah 4get bout her lah.....<br><br>plz sum1 tel mi wat u tink i should do?<br>or sum1 wif same exp can share ur info wif mi?<br>ty beri much^^<br></div></blockquote></div>

More ACTIONS.<br>2. OPEN UP. SPEAK UP. She probably prefers an extrovert than an introvert like you.<br>3. She might or might not be interested in you. But CHANCES are, she don't really that fancy you even she might be interested.. UNLESS.. What she's saying about the guy is a BIG HINT for you to BUCK UP and is suppose to be a MOTIVATOR for you...
