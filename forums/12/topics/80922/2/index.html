            <div class='col-md body'>BaByBoy...what you have done for her is already more than what a normal friend should be doing. I am positive that she knows that you like her long ago...judging from the things that you have done for her.<br><br>There seems to be something missing in your relationship with her. Hmm...do you make her laugh? Is she comfortable when being with you? Is she happy when she is with you? Somehow I feel from your posting that she wasn't happy most of the time when out with you. But she did have some happy moments with you when you were dating her.<br><br>Think she didn't felt that you were actually loving her from your soul. Hmm...how should I put it? Love is not materialistic...it is actually a communication between 2 souls. So it has to be mutual...if your love to her is all about what you have done for her physically, then perhaps that is why she don't feel loved by you. In fact, maybe she feel that she owned you a lot of favours. And so she felt obliged to be with you? Say if she really did agree to be your gf, what is she going to love you for? For all the things that you have done for her and her family? For the money that you have spent on her? For the time you have spent with her instead of your friends? I think she was probably also as confused as you in a certain state previously.<br><br>Well...I think right now you should care for her soul. Not using any props(gifts...doing a favour for her...etc), use your soul and try to connect with her soul. That is love. Couples always say that they click with each other...but that is actually the connection between their soul. You can have many friends, but you don't click with all of them. Same goes for girls...you can go after and like a lot of girls, but you cannot say you love all of them.<br><br>Don't worry...she knows that you like and is interested in her long ago. But she probably needs to know what is it that you are really after. Girls will also feel insecure if you like them but you don't show them clearly what it is that you are really after. Worse still, if they think that you are trying to buy them by making them feel indebted to you with your generous efforts to please her and her family.<br><br>I think that should be what you are missing out in your relationship with her. As least that is what I figured.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha...BaByBoy, me too. Not in a good mood right now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But I guess helping you is also helping myself, I can feel much better after that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hmm...for your questions...I can only tell you what I think is right for your situation. The reason is because I do not know her well enough to make the most accurate assumptions. But I think I shouldn't be too far off the truth. If you think what I said is accurate, chances are it is. You know her more than anyone else, so you should know the truth if I'm right or not?<br><br>Like I have mentioned before...she should already knew long ago that you like her. By the way, if she is willing to come out just with you alone...you do stand a high chance with her. Most Girls will never go out alone with guys that they don't like...especially if they suspects that you are going after them. Some do though...especially if they are really really really bored or you ask them too many times already and they feel bad saying no to you all the time.<br><br>There is no right or wrong in going after a girl. And there is nothing you should have done or shouldn't done. You did what you thought was most appropriate for your situation at that time. I suggest you give her a call soon. You so long never see her already, don't tell me you got nothing to talk with her? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Listen to me...whatever happens in the past...let go and don't think about it anymore. There is nothing you can do about it and I do not want you to go and think about the past and make yourself feel like s.h.i.t everyday.<br><br>Don't talk about unhappy things or events, don't even start an unhappy topic with her...unless she is the one who brings it up first, then you can go ahead and talk about it with her.<br><br>Enjoy...hmm....see, I knew I will feel a bit better after this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I'll tell u how i dealt with it, and maybe u would like to do the same.<br><br>After i knew she got attached, i too was living the life of a "Zombie", I fell into a state of depression. Then one day, I decided enuff was enuff. I can't go on like this any longer... what i did was ask her straight: "Will I stand a chance if you ever become single again?" She said: "She won't have the courage to go into another relationship if this one fails." And there, i got the answer i've always been looking for. After i got my answer, i felt so much better.<br><br>It isn't the best answer, but at least i was given an answer so that i can move on without any regrets. I wouldn't love a girl who can never love me back.<br><br>So here i am, living the 2nd lease of life. I dun love her anymore, but we still remain good frends. i've been too selfish during the period that i loved her...Its Time to give others a chance to love me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>And maybe it's time you get your answer from her, babyboy. </div></blockquote>I did asked her abt how she feels..<br>she said that we MAY haf a chance to be together..<br>i really dunno wat`s up in her mind..<br>she nv directly rejected me b4..<br>the reasons that she gimme was juz to pull back time..<br>becoz of this pullin back.. it make my very headache..<br>she wans it or not??<br>it seems like a wan.. and seems like a don wan.. i don really haf a clear view of her opinions..<br>she juz say `got chance nxt time`<br></div>

I also nv receive a "DIRECT" answer like 'NO WAY'. But i can roughly "assume" the meaning behind those words. So sometimes you have to decipher the meaning of the words she said...<br><br>But if u are really keen to get the answer once and for all, go direct to her and <strong>DEMAND</strong> a straight answer. Ask her to give u a "Yes or No" Answer. Maybe give her one day to think about it, cos if u rush her, she might panick... so ask slowly, softly and sincerely... All the best to u BabyBoy!</div>

An Aries bites directly, while a scorpio stings when it knows it can strike criticially. A scorpio lover would do well to avoid being possessive, jealous and clingy.<br><br>Hurt a Scorpio in love and he/she will remember it for life - probably the kind that would even out the pain to the other party. (Bf: Wah my gf can hold hands with guys somemore... Ok maybe I would try this with my female counterparts as well)<br><br>Because a Scorpio's love is intense - they could snuff out possible breathing space. Scorpio's direction in love is fixed - they are usually loyal to their love ones, more so, comparing to other signs. But because of that, this fixed nature make them very difficult to move on once love is gone.
