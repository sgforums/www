It's very simple why, you're reminding yourself to avoid her. Learn to relax after she rejected you and just go out with her as a friend. Once you can tell yourself you don't need to avoid her even though she rejected you. You can easily walk out of your own shadow.<br><br>Learn to focus on another thing instead of focusing on telling yourself that you need to get over. You won't. The truth is, the stronger you perceive that you're determined to move, the more you get rooted by the same thoughts. Instead, taking it extremely easy might be hard to follow but after a long term, she'll be as good as transparent to you.<br><br>That's why I told you to try to ask her again and instead of avoiding her, stay around. Either she'll accept you eventually, or you'll start to forget about her.<br><br>Don't force yourself to forget, because the more you do, the less you achieve it.</div>

The reason is we keep telling ourselves there is no one comes close to her... Am i right? We've virtually given up hope of finding another girl... therefore i suggest we both forget about finding that other girl and instead keep our options open to girls who found us... (Not I haolian hor... just tat I bo pian.)<br><br>And one more thing, dun ever try to avoid contact... I try b4, i tried to avoid contact with her for 1 week... and that was one of the worst 1 week i've ever had in my life, the feeling is unimaginable...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  So these day i just tok and go out with her as a frend...
