Only she knows herself wat she wants...<br><br>Regarding vicious cycle, people will just say its u urself whose not trying to move on... But i can fully understand how you are feeling when u said about those happy memories of her coming back to haunt u... I often have those too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  I know its tough to just move on... becos after all these times, I still can't move on too.<br><br>U mentioned that u have nv considered another girl, I know why and have been doing the same all these years. The reason is we keep telling ourselves there is no one comes close to her... Am i right? We've virtually given up hope of finding another girl... therefore i suggest we both forget about finding that other girl and instead keep our options open to girls who found us... (Not I haolian hor... just tat I bo pian.)<br><br>And one more thing, dun ever try to avoid contact... I try b4, i tried to avoid contact with her for 1 week... and that was one of the worst 1 week i've ever had in my life, the feeling is unimaginable...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  So these day i just tok and go out with her as a frend... I know that i won't forget her one lah, so no point putting so much effort trying to forget.<br><br>BabyBoy, sorry i can't provide a solution for ur problem. But i'm just trying to let u know that u have someone with the same agony as u, and i believe there are thousands more out there...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Wow...
