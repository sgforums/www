            <div class='col-md body'>I'm think when there's 90 clicks on this thread and yet not a single reply for the past days is likely because the reading of 6 pages before they can give their views is a big turn off. Doubt anyone will do that. As for myself, I read at the first page of it, and stopped. Come'on manz, I mean if there's some comments needed, I would think that some summarizing of what was discuss will be a good idea for all of us here. It will be less of a torture for us, than having to read 120 replies to the thread.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read the 6 pages in the other forum and now in Aunt Agony. So my initial reaction is going to be much worse than the first, therefore I didn't post any comments here.<br><br>To simplify it, get over it man. You chose to back out on her in the first place and she was never yours.<br><br>To adjust your mentality right now, you must think that you do not need her in the first place. Then...you won't feel so concern and bad about her birthday and whatever event of hers. She like to SMS you right? SMS her back whenever she SMS you lor...if you feel like it.<br><br>Your problem right now is you really need to regain your confidence asap. Erase whatever thoughts in your mind right now that could ruin your confidence. Get a hold of yourself and your life first...so that you got ample time and a clear mind to see the entire picture clearer. Then you can decide what you want to do next.<br><br>Good Luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Let me tell you something about this vicious cycle that you never knew consciously:<br><br>Your history repeats torturously because your way of handling this issue never change since day one. You are a guy who knows how to pave your route, but have no knowledge on how to build further than what you had done.<br><br>Have anyone ever tell you that your psychological love behavior always instigate you to run away whenever you failed in your attempt to get her? You subconsciously CHOSE to leave whenever she rejected you and ironically, being a very good friend of her, avoiding shouldn't have take place at all because if you have respected space and freedom, you both should have reached to a stage where you are emotionally ease with yourself. Declaration of love wouldn't have affected this friendship at all - <strong>its you who decide to instill tension in the bonds.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In summary, you repeated your own cycle with your own choice.<br><br>CloUdiSm remix III state: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you always love the way you always do, you always get what you always get</span>.<br><br>***<br><br>You have already chosen to leave - then leave without the intention of coming back. You can't be hanging in the air and hope for a miracle to happen - you will only hurt yourself. If she is not interested, in BGR sense, why live within your own emotional picture? Have you ever ask and know how she feel and her preception with regards to you? I mean you are rejected twice - there has to be better and more concrete reasons than studying. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Her emotional structure hasn't been constructed yet - IMO, her mindset on love may not be positively formed OR she is spolit for choices. Since you have successfully avoided and reduce much contacts, you should learn to walk your own path for now (away from her shadows). Of course if you want to get her, you can employ art of seduction to win the war for you. (IMO, you are on good grounds - but don't ask me how to do it. I can't explain on words here and even through explaination, it is highly unlikely you will do exact)<br><br>How the future is like, with/without her, doesn't matter - at least you had two good attempts. Many others didn't have such opportunity at all. At least she came into your life and taught you something.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie...s.h.i.t...you make me feel bad for you. I try my best for you okie?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hmm...you sounds like you really like her alot, even until now. I can understand this feelings...it simply makes you difficult to sleep during the night and take up all your thoughts during the day.<br><br>For me, I feel that if I really like the person, I will go after her. Regardless even when people says that she has high expectations of guys and I'm probably not on her list...which is...she probably ignores me and I'm a nobody to her.<br><br>The reason for doing such pathetic attempt? Hmm...well, have to be of course the fact that I like her so much that I want to try to fight for her love. I don't like to give up and declare that I'm a loser even before I try to go after her. But that's just me okie? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I would suggest to you to give her a call soon...don't wait for too long, you got no excuse not to call her anyway. Do not dwell on the past anymore. Don't mention the past...her past...your past...unless she is the one who mentioned it first. It means she wants to talk about the past...and you go ahead and talk about the past with her. Otherwise, talk about the things happening to you recently and your future events. Also ask her about her recent events and make sure she feel comfortable talking with you. Be nice to her again and care for her as true to your heart.<br><br>Sometimes going after a girl doesn't means she has to spend hours talking with you on the phone. Sometimes it just takes a short call out of the sudden to show some concern about her...show her that you still remember her and she is still a part of your thought. Make sure your actions let her know that you have  include her into your life and don't try to overtake her life.<br><br>The next step after this will have to be solely depend on you already. One thing though, never look back on the things that you have already done for her...never stop and calculate your chances of success because there is no fixed rule/formula for success. Never self-sabotage yourself by thinking that she maybe don't like you or treat you as a friend/brother...because you will never know what she is thinking, feelings, fear, worries, hope and expectations. Instead, treat every chance every moment with her as an opportunity for you to create wonderful memories for her and enjoy the time spent together with her.<br><br>Don't worry if at the end of the road, you still end up losing her. But when you looked back at the time you had with her, you will realised that the love you feel in your heart and the pain you are feeling right now is no longer yours...she will also feel the same sadness and loved as you...things like this are mutual.<br><br>Of course I will not ask you to go and fight a losing battle lah...but sure got win and lose mah...just want you to be prepare for the lose part only lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hmm...the winning part...well...it depends on the feelings shared by you and her lor. No need to actually wait and prepare a really romantic scenario to confess your love for her lah. You will know when you are really to let her know you like/love her. Trust me lah, you will know when the time comes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, wish you all the best in winning her love. And treasure her  feelings dearly when you succeed okie?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BaByBoy...love is about giving and more giving. You just go ahead and do what you want to win her love. No need for you to worry about whether she will appreciate it or not. She don't reply your SMS, then don't reply lor. It is just a SMS...stupid little text-based function that we have in our mobile phones.<br><br>You have lost your courage because you think and tried to analyse too much into her thoughts already. Girls are girls....they simply don't think similar to guys. There is no way you can know what she is thinking unless you go and ask her yourself. But then, even so...she also will not tell you lah. So...don't care whatever she is thinking, just go and do what you heart tells you to. You like her, you go after her. There is nothing wrong with it as long as you don't go and rip off her clothes and do those immoral stuffs.<br><br>Never...never self-sabotage yourself in whatever things you are doing. I think if you can just stop self-sabotaging yourself, you can do better in winning her love as you can be more confident about yourself and the things you are doing.<br><br>Okie...worst scenario ever...what could happened? She ask you to go and die and says she hate you for disturbing her and all those c.r.a.p right? Why you cannot go and ask her to f.u.c.k spiders? You also don't owned her any thing. She is afterall make up of flesh and blood and the two of you got history together. So do you really think she will say all those s.h.i.t to you? Pull yourself together man!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>If you can just back out so easily just because she never reply your SMS, all I can say is that you don't love her enough to be able to win her love. Go and fight for her love if you really love her. Losers whine all the time, Winners goes home and f.u.c.k the prom-queen.<br><br>I know that if I were you, the most painful thing for me would be not being able to win her love...and definitely not because she ignored my SMS!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
