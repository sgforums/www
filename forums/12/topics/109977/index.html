            <div class='col-md body'>not sure whether there is something wrong with me or that my colleagues are really horrible people..  Let us put it this way. I have 7 colleagues:<br><br>A - Boss.. doesnt care about anything but u better not screw up ur work or else..<br>B -  My assistant boss.. who strangely suck up to D (see below)<br>C - another assistant boss but not mine so dun have to care..<br>D - a key executive.. who is undertaking a major project. She loves to suck up to A, B and C.<br>E - an executive whose face whole day black black.. esp when stress. beginning to learn from E and F in the toe sucking skills..<br>F - an executive who shouted across cubicles all the time to get her messages across. A bit arrogant and really loves to suck up to A's boss.<br>G - my buddy who agreed to the above..<br>H - me, a quiet fellow.. who needs time to warm up and open up to others.. so far after joining for almost 2 years, did not talk to them much except to G, I and J.<br><br>Now, kindly help to analyse this..  Am I a black sheep cos they dun really talk to me? Have been rather quiet at times during meetings cos info was not well dissemminated (which G agrees) and do not wish to make silly contributions.<br><br>I and J, another 2 buddies of mine had transferred to another dept cos they requested to.. maybe due to this sick place?<br><br>Maybe this place should be named SUCK UP Corp.?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Company Politics happen all the time. While i can't say there's nothing wrong about it, its very common and can be found almost everywhere.<br><br>No, from what i see, you're not a black sheep. Its just that you're not worth talking to. Since everyone is sucking up to someone, why would they waste their time talking to you, when they can continue to suck up?<br><br>I hope I and J gets to a place with less politics, generally politically involved departments are less motivated to work hard, as they're constantly looking behind their backs and all.<br><br>Its nothing wrong with you, just a victim of circumstances.</div>
