              <p>I am turning 33 this year and my contract expire at Jul. Currently, I am working as a graded staff at one of the stat board for 2 years plus.Since last year, my superior had not been pleased with me and keep on picking on me. Due to the poor appraisal he gave me for last year, I was not given any performance bonus and growth bonus for Mar , nevertheless to say pay increment.I had made a loss of additional 1.6 month pay.</p>
              <p>He told me that I am free to leave anytime before my contract expires as he feel I does not like the job.</p>
              <p>True, I may not fancy the job and him but I always get me job done.</p>
              <p>I may not do a lot but at least the core job.</p>
              <p>In fact I want to resign asap but I am only a dip holder .</p>
              <p>And I only drawing $2570 per month, is it too low for my age and qualification?</p>
              <p>I have wasted 7 yrs of my life in SAF and this is the longest term job I have took.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gurus out there, pl advise.</p>

              <p>The monthly salary you are drawing now is ok especially there are many others drawing less than you. Also you need to remember that there are also many people jobless and struggling to look for jobs.</p>
              <p>Count yourself lucky that you have a job, though not a permanent job.</p>
              <p>But being a contract staff has its very disadvantages over perm staff.I have a colleague, a contract staff for almost 8 yrs+ drawing $3k+.</p>
              <p>The manager never gave him increment (only twice) and even aws too.</p>
              <p>Annual leave only 16 days per year.</p>
              <p>Same as you, the manager dont like my colleague too.</p>
              <p>Since you are 33 and I presume you are still single, I think with 2 yrs of exp in govt sectore, why not look somewhere else or internal transfer to become perm staff?</p>
              <p>Seriously, your 7 yrs on army is wasted. Sorry to pour cold water on you. Pple sign on army is to work till retirement.</p>

              <p>Your superior sounds like a sucky person. People like tat normally got a lot of dirty skeletons in their cupboard. Dig it out n shit it out to public. Next time u go around n tell all ur frens not to work for tis sucky employer - warn them about tis place.</p>
              <p>A gud supervisor would usually display more leadership n be more approachable n not do tis kind of politics. Ur superior displays unsound character n the need to bully subordinates (tat he dun like), he probably got some huge problem at home such as gross infertility to release his anger on u.</p>
              <p>Yes$2,570 is blady low. I know people ur age earning four times as much of wat u r earning.</p>
