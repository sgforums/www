              <p>hey i didnt read the whole thread...</p>
              <p>but just telling u my story...</p>
              <p>i have got this dam dam close female friend... very pretty and i once liked her... not now tho...</p>
              <p>then one day, me, her and her bf and her bf de friend which is one of my close friend too, go out together... (that time i dun like her), then this girl and me is like totally no acting or covering of feelings these all... then we like play with each other more and more, until i realise her bf face dulan...</p>
              <p>then i took a deeper thought, if playing with her is forbidden since the bf is here, and since the bf wan her attention so much, i might as well not go out together with them...</p>
              <p>and so that is when i wont go out with any female friend when their bf is there, or sometimes when she and her bf is dam close...</p>
              <p>if not right, they break up, it will be a sad ending and so not worth it, worst is that u will feel guilty...</p>
              <p>however, that friend of urs should try to maintain the friendship... maybe u both talk it out?</p>
              <p>yea... it is really dam hard to find a close friend which u dun really love, as in BGR type...</p>
              <p>treasure the friendship, sometimes u just have to fork out more effort to maintain the friendship, life is never fair...</p>

              <p>Why not take the past into account? Because people changed and what was right in the past may not be right in the present.</p>
              <p>If he is nice to you, you can be nicer to him. But if he is unkind to you, then you can be more unkind to him or ignore him.</p>
