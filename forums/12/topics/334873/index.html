              wat do u mean? that sounds like a threat  that you want to snatch him though. i just feel that u need to stand in his position n try to think abt the matter. if you want to go out with him, go out in a grp then. less conflict and prevent misunderstanding with his gf

              dun say it so soon. dun be so sure of yourself though. i think u have to stand in her gf's position to think though. there is this girl craving for her bf's attention. u think she would feel gd abt it? u want to go out with him? you want to hang out with him? go in a group then

              <p>So you do have the intention to break them up?</p>
              <p>Anyway, it is really up to him. I also told my husband that I don't want him to meet up with other girls one-to-one without me being there. His gf might have a different thinking from you...if you don't mind your bf next time meeting one-to-one wif other girls doesn't mean that she doesn't mind. And if your friend wants to listen to what his gf says, there is nothing much you can do but to leave him alone and don't make things difficult for him if you still value the friendship.</p>
              <p>I am sure you have other friends you can count on to listen to you when you are having problems, rite? Why must die die stick to him? Gfs will usually get a priority one la.</p>

              <p>good friends don’t force their pals into a difficult position. <br><br>right now your buddy’s hands are tied because indirectly, you’re asking him to choose between his girl and you.</p>
              <p>we're all human beings, é‡�è‰²è½»å�‹ is our nature.</p>
              <p>if you’re a real pal, then don’t make it worse.</p>
              <p>unless it’s a life/death situation, please don’t expect him to drop her at your whim.</p>
              <p>my buddy and I abide by these rules, maybe you guys can try:<br> - for serious r/s we will set up a meeting and introduce the new man or
              woman in our lives out of respect. only once. no point for everyone to
              hang out regularly, because based on experience, gfs and bfs will
              definitely feel threatened for some stupid reasons.</p>
              <p>- priority always given to family and partners 24/7. only Sundays are ‘all pals no
              partners’ allowed coffee sessions.<br> <br>btw have you tried to befriend his girl? if you can convince her you pose no threat to her relationship, then life will be easier. <br><br>imho, it’s very natural for his gf to behave this way. it’s her territorial instinct though I think you know already.</p>
              <p>on the other hand if you’re interested in your friend, want him for yourself and this is your way of competing for his attention, then I think the verdict is out.</p>
              <p>for him it's better her than you. <br><em><br>*pats*</em></p>

              <p>Maybe his gf found out that he was interested in you even though he was already attached to her...let me ask you, if the situation is reversed and you are the gf, and your bf kept going out with a girl whom you know he is interested in, wouldn't you have shown a similar reaction?</p>
              <p>Women are like cats sometimes...we are pretty territorial when it comes to our significant others. You will prolly understand next time when you are attached.</p>
              <p>So now since you said group outing is out, the best thing to do is not force him into a corner le...friends should be understanding..find new friends and who knows you will find someone else who can make you happier than him...</p>

              <p>The problem comes from his gf, which is natural.</p>
              <p>He does not have the strength, courage, ability, to keep his gf assured. Not his fault because it is not easy, and it largely depends on his gf's maturity and confidence.</p>
              <p>His gf is afraid of losing him, and sees you as a threat, therefore jealousy arises.  Don't expect her to believe that there is nothing going on btw you and him. She don't believe means she don't, and theres nothing anyone can do anything about it.</p>
              <p>So leave him, ....... alone. You will cause the two of them to quarrel.</p>
              <p>Don't write him off, just leave him alone.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, he is just someone that you used to know. Singapore is a small place, just move on, and one day you will surely bump into him.</p>
