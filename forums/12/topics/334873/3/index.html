              <p>I would have reacted the same way as TS best friend's gf if I were in her shoes. I wish I can be more trusting and understanding... but some things just can't happen so the best solution for TS is to learn and let go.  Even though it is possible to have 100% trust... yet still have that disturbing feeling that nags on in my heart.</p>

              <p>make friends. im sure u can find one. in my point of view, u are like asking them to break their relationship. it seems like u are a lil despo. just leave him alone for one day. and see if anything happens. ofc he wans to be ur friend. but u are putting him in a spot and hes afraid to face you. he shouldnt be. so dont make him feel that way if u wan to remain as friends with him.</p>

              <p>You just think about your own wishes, never thought about how he and his gf felt. Doesn't mean that you dun mind then his gf also doesn't mind.</p>

              <p>&gt; ever since he left me i have been staying at home or going home right after school..</p>
              <p>u have become too dependent on him liao. what do u mean "left u"... u were nv together right?</p>
              <p>i have been in the shoes of the "gf" before.. believe me, it sucks to have a bf who hangs out all the time alone with another girl.</p>
              <p>it's time to be honest wif urself... do u really treat him like a platonic friend? if yes, for ur own sake and his, u'd want to leave him alone and not add on to the probs between him and his gf.</p>
              <p>i'm sure u're a mature person... so it's gd tt u 've chosen to cut off contact wif him for the time being. unfortunately, some guys just like it tt there are girls fighting for their attention. it's a major ego boost for them. how sure are u tt he was serious when he said he was interested in u?</p>
              <p>if there are no other pple u wanna hang out wif, just spend some time doing things by urself... it can help u learn more abt urself...</p>
              <p>&gt; he is the only person whom i can really be myself without having to act...</p>
              <p>why do u feel tt there is nobody else whom u can be comfortable wif except him? and why put on an act in front of others? don't u find it tiring? maybe u can let down ur guard more... u'll find tt there are many others who will accept u as u are, and who are just as worthy of ur friendship as him...</p>
