              <p>Seriously stop thinking about just yourself...friendship is a two way street, if he already doesnt treat you like one, just get over it and find a new one. You might not be able to find another one fast, but persevere and I believe you will be able to one day...</p>
              <p>No matter how many times you state you have no feelings towards him, it didnt change the fact that he was once interested in you even when he was already attached to the gf...If I were the girlfriend, I would feel very hurt and threatened. And I would prolly do the same thing to him as well and prevent him from meeting you. So if his gf wants to be that way and he wants to follow, there is nothing much you can do...</p>
              <p>It is about his priority...he happens to place his gf as the higher priority as compared to you...</p>

              <p>I agree.</p>
              <p>but sometimes caring for someone also means putting the person's needs before your own. Being patient and not being demanding for that person's presence simply because you are used to it, you need it. Giving someone space and not spending time with someone doesn't mean the friendship is over.</p>
              <p>Not having things the way you want it to be doesn't mean the end of the world. People who feel this way very strongly either have their way too often, or tends to feel the world revolves around them.</p>
              <p>And because it doesn't, we learn to deal with disappointment. and move on - knowing it is not easy but do it anyway cos.. life goes on.</p>
              <p>and if you care for your family, it also means learning to handle disappointment, grief and sorrow - so that you don't worry them.</p>

              <p>You can keep your buddies.. but it also depends on what kind of buddies.</p>
              <p>Buddies are there for a reason.. but if this buddy becomes clingy and rely on you too much... then it's a liability.</p>
              <p>I have buddies of opposite gender.. but they are just .. my buddies.. they don't expect much from me...</p>
              <p>If I want to jio them for beer.. they come.. but when it's time to go home.. they go home.</p>
              <p>Buddies don't come crying on your shoulder or demand you keep them company when your gf/bf is waiting for you at home.</p>

              <p>It's too bad nothing florished between your "buddy" and you when you had the chance.</p>
              <p>You are perhaps resentful that the other girl gets what you want.</p>
              <p>Instead of him in your arms.. he is happily enjoying himself in another woman's loving embrace.</p>
              <p>Yes , we know.. it's a bitter pill to swalloww... but girl.. get over it.</p>
              <p>So stop using this excuse of him being a buddy therefore you should get to keep him too.</p>
              <p>Sure you can try to pry him away from that woman with all the harrassement.. but will you be truly happy once you get your hands on him ?</p>
              <p>They say misery loves company.</p>
              <p>Just because you can't have him.. you are trying to make sure no one else can either.</p>
              <p>Learn to let go.. else you will constantly be bitter and resentful.</p>
              <p>what is yours .. is destined.. the harder you fight for it.. the lesser your happiness ...</p>
              <p>As a woman.. I say girl.. go get your own man. He belongs to someone .. learn to deal with that.</p>
              <p>If you want to insist you are just "buddies".. then learn to respect his personal space.. and give them your blessings.</p>
