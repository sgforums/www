It is because relationship problem between your parents is between them, and only them. As their son, there is little you could do. (Love is between two, regardless of how many people are 'involved' in it)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are confuse about two girls - let me tell you, your good 'sister' is probably transitory love affair that appear in your life for now. You discovered your liking for her, no doubt, however is it the same for her? Do you risk this friendship and your own relationship over something that could be temporary and not what it seemed to be in the future?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your dad's decision to migrate - I feel that it is still negotiatable. Express your utmost relunctancy to leave singapore and he could allow you to stay. Be polite and rational in your tone (beggars can't be choosers) and speak to your dad like a friend (the divorce would probably affect him as well, regardless of whether he is the willing or non-willing party - you are important to him, therefore he wouldn't harm you in anyway.)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Split between two girls? More often than not, when the grey area is cleared, things will be clearer. Do not attempt reckless decision right now. when in doubt, do nothing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Looking at your plight, probably your dad's focus would be on his mistress and not you - therefore I think it is still negotiable when you express your desire to remain here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Able to confine doesn't equate to love, it simply mean you are comfortable with her. Seriously speaking, even if you do chase her, what future can you possibly foresee? And on what chances will she accept you as well?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This is all your preception, thoughts and feelings accoutable for all these thingy - none from her.<br><br>In the end, it all boils down to your motive. I feel its ok to reveal your feeling just to get the choke off your heart, that is provided you just want to let her know and not expecting or doing anything about it. However, like all decision, there is always a risk involved. If you fear the risk, forget about telling.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Do not intertwine infatuation for love.<br><br>Cheers</div>
