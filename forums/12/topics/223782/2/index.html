But you dont hate her love. You still love her. Can you let your memories go just like that?<br><br>Sometimes, love is just not enough for a relationship to be better. Forgiveness is. Maybe one day, with your patience, your efforts will pay off. She will ask u back... and thats where your suffering will soon be lifted. And after tat, the decision lies in you...<br><br>for now, you really cannot do anitin... except if u wish... try to talk things out with her again... but never ever overdo it..  as in never call every min of the day asking her back tat sorts...<br><br>have patience...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
