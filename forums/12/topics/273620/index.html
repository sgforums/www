I should know because I am one too.<br><br>There's nothing wrong in wanting to do well in work, but just remember there's nothing wrong in making minor mistakes for time to time in work.<br><br>Also, as for ur friends, do take note that probably ur friends are the type that are straight-forward, and in the process may say things that may sound harsh or critical. But remember, if they are willing to be critical of u, it shows that they are geniune people who love u, that's why they are telling u what has went wrong.<br><br>Maybe during the weekends, u can go play some sports, or go to the gym for a workout. U seemed a little stressed out, and playing sports would be good for u. Remember, life is short, too short in fact to be critical of oneself when making minor mistakes, and second-guessing if ur friends are too harsh on u.</div>

Well the thing is I know I am an angry person, and when my friends piss me off I feel as if I need to see them suffer and get a taste of their own medicine before I feel alright again. I know I can control however. In the heat of the moment I will always do what's right and not go into a rage and hurt others, never been in a fight before in my life infact. So yeah, I find myself always taking it in, hence letting them "win". The way I see it, it's like yeah I know I am better than them in being sensitive to others' feelings, but end of the day I am the one going home to feel like shit when they are like hahaha look at me I am so cool.<br><br>As for being being hard on myself, yeah I am doing a little soul searching to find out why I tend to be like that most of the time. Me going auto-pilot with crazy thoughts is true, gotta do some damage control there.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The better man will always hold it in. Suck it in and remain calm. Learn to allow yourself to brush those remarks off you. Because some people just like to joke and put others down. If he truly is putting u down knowing it hurts your feelings then by letting it brush off you  , you have already won as a better person. Man i got some friends who joke so bad tease and put u down so bad makes me look bad in front of the girls. Is how you respond to it that matters. People around will know who is the better man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> No point letting the rage and frustration take over your body. Happened to a few times. In the end nobody wins. Even if the other person is lying bleeding on the ground , ur fists and face still hurt. You endanger the people around you , you create a bad reputation to those around you and your ruin a perfectly good day or night.<br><br>Nothing wrong being perfect. Its because u want everything in order and to be perfect that will allow you to be stressed over trivial things. Its natural , but instead of letting the stress and frustration affect you , do something else to forget the worries. Have a timetable and schedule to do things so even at the mood , u still have to prepare yourself to entertain ur schedule and that will also build up ur character in the working world where u are not affected by moods while working or doing other things.<br><br>Hope my advice helps.</div>
