            <div class='col-md body'>I am 29 this year. Been with this guy (R) for a year. I am very depressed and sad. can someone help me out here.<br><br>In mid august 06, i broke up with (T) 4 year older whom i was dating for 3 years because we didnt progress and think we just drift off. In jan 07 I met R thro a sport club and started dating him.<br><br>R is same age as me and a very emotional guy. He believed that even if a relationship had broken up, he can still care for his ex. he came from a broken family, mother dont really care abt him and siblings are selfish too.<br><br>FIRST 6 MONTHS<br>When we first started first 6 mths, it was a total struggle for me. i felt i was on an roller coaster,sometimes happy sometimes very sad. very often i want to break up and run away. A few incidents: a) his ex was someone who work late. one of the nights i was staying with R at his place, his ex ask if she can stay in the house for 1 nite cos of travelling late. R let her in even though we are in the same house, same bedroom!<br><br>2nd incident: her 2nd ex came back from HK. she was invited to R's brother's kids birthday party. R was supposed to go pick her up because she stay very near - ok for me. R was driving a mini then. only can go thro front seat to back seat. for some reason not sure it is for convenience sake, i was sat behind! and the girl was sat infront!<br><br>it was a roller coaster ride. i wanna break up wth him but yet stick with him becuase i love him and even my parents dun like him,  i stick with him. maybe the fact i sticking with him to show my parents  he is the one.<br><br>during the course of the relationship, he is constantly broke. i pay for his studies and pay for his car. i felt a lot of burden on my shoulder but i do it because i love him.<br><br>2nd 6 months<br>he change for the better. he focus and treat me better. BUT this time i feel different. i feel all he is nice and such - i deserve it. what he is doing it is to compensate me. and everytime i am struggling when i am with him. because i feel i deserve someone better!<br><br>out rship start to break down. arguement over money and his emtional moods, his temper. i feel stress cos paying for everything and come home have to withstand his temper. i left his place and move home. now cool offing.<br><br>now he want an ultimatum. To break off or get back together start afresh.<br><br>he need 2 year down the road to make money. this time, i will still pay for him everything. even then 2 years may not appear....i am not sure what i am waiting for to....<br><br>marriage? his temperament and emotional sting for his ex?<br><br>i  know i still love him. to break this off is like cutting  my heart. yet, to get back to him, it is a struggle for me financially and emotionally.<br><br>and will marriage be the final sting for us both?<br><br>all of my friends are against this r.ship. 9 out of 10 say i should break it up and i deserve someone better. only 1 say to stick with him..that's me.<br><br>please give me your comments!<br><br></div>

I dun think he is the right one. still leting his ex to stay at his house seems like a ridiculous idea to me. everything like a play thing to him, if I were you I will felt humiliated. his ex and you in the same room, extreme awdwardness unless u all were friends. if not its a crazy situation.<br><br>the more u drag the more chances you have missed to get a better one.<br><br>My relationship just ended also, I think love is not everything, we have many other things to do and fulfil for ourselves. you should start caring for yourself more.</div>

Take some time off and get some perspective about him as a person. Are you buying his affection? How long will you be able to sustain these habits? What are the qualities you desire in a partner? Do you see foresee a fulfilling relationship? Are your possibilities as a couple shrouded in misery and difficulties or laughter and devotion?<br><br>From the bottom of your gut, is he going to stick around when you decide not to finance his studies / car? From the bottom of your gut, is Mr R prepared to make the same sacrifices for you?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lhuiling:</div><div class="quote_body">during the course of the relationship, he is constantly broke. i pay for his studies and pay for his car. i felt a lot of burden on my shoulder but i do it because i love him.<br><br>now he want an ultimatum. To break off or get back together start afresh.<br><br>he need 2 year down the road to make money. this time, i will still pay for him everything. even then 2 years may not appear....i am not sure what i am waiting for to....</div></blockquote>Did he initiate financial help from you? Why would he give you an ultimatum?<br><br>If it's coming straight from the horse's mouth that he needs 2 years to make money and you should provide for him during this period of time, your only hope of escaping unscathed is simply disappear. Based on your post, anyone will be hard pressed to refrain from saying Mr R is making use of you. On top of that, the ultimatum sounds like emotional blackmail for his own benefit.<br><br>Sounds like you've been taken for a sucker.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lhuiling:</div><div class="quote_body">I am 29 this year. Been with this guy (R) for a year. I am very depressed and sad. can someone help me out here.<br><br>In mid august 06, i broke up with (T) 4 year older whom i was dating for 3 years because we didnt progress and think we just drift off. In jan 07 I met R thro a sport club and started dating him.<br><br>R is same age as me and a very emotional guy. He believed that even if a relationship had broken up, he can still care for his ex. he came from a broken family, mother dont really care abt him and siblings are selfish too.<br><br>FIRST 6 MONTHS<br>When we first started first 6 mths, it was a total struggle for me. i felt i was on an roller coaster,sometimes happy sometimes very sad. very often i want to break up and run away. A few incidents: a) his ex was someone who work late. one of the nights i was staying with R at his place, his ex ask if she can stay in the house for 1 nite cos of travelling late. R let her in even though we are in the same house, same bedroom!<br><br>2nd incident: her 2nd ex came back from HK. she was invited to R's brother's kids birthday party. R was supposed to go pick her up because she stay very near - ok for me. R was driving a mini then. only can go thro front seat to back seat. for some reason not sure it is for convenience sake, i was sat behind! and the girl was sat infront!<br><br>it was a roller coaster ride. i wanna break up wth him but yet stick with him becuase i love him and even my parents dun like him,  i stick with him. maybe the fact i sticking with him to show my parents  he is the one.<br><br>during the course of the relationship, he is constantly broke. i pay for his studies and pay for his car. i felt a lot of burden on my shoulder but i do it because i love him.<br><br>2nd 6 months<br>he change for the better. he focus and treat me better. BUT this time i feel different. i feel all he is nice and such - i deserve it. what he is doing it is to compensate me. and everytime i am struggling when i am with him. because i feel i deserve someone better!<br><br>out rship start to break down. arguement over money and his emtional moods, his temper. i feel stress cos paying for everything and come home have to withstand his temper. i left his place and move home. now cool offing.<br><br>now he want an ultimatum. To break off or get back together start afresh.<br><br>he need 2 year down the road to make money. this time, i will still pay for him everything. even then 2 years may not appear....i am not sure what i am waiting for to....<br><br>marriage? his temperament and emotional sting for his ex?<br><br>i  know i still love him. to break this off is like cutting  my heart. yet, to get back to him, it is a struggle for me financially and emotionally.<br><br>and will marriage be the final sting for us both?<br><br>all of my friends are against this r.ship. 9 out of 10 say i should break it up and i deserve someone better. only 1 say to stick with him..that's me.<br><br>please give me your comments!<br><br></div></blockquote>I did not even finish reading your whole post. I read until the first 6th month of your roller-coaster relationship oni.<br><br>Three words for you : <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">BREAK IT OFF!!!</span></span> and fast!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>What I can't stand is YOU are the girlfriend now, so why must you sit behind the mini? Your bf either don't respect you or taking you for granted. This has nothing to do with being <span style="font-style: italic;">xiao qi</span>. This is about rights. Territorial rights!<br><br>Drop him! Drop him! Besides your parents also don't like him. No love lost here. Just because you're already 29 don't sell yourself short. If this is how you are being treated like second class citizen during this courtship I can't imagine what will be life like for you after marriage!<br><br>So, again DROP HIM! Don't look back! Find another that is more worthy!</div>

I can understand how you feel.<br><br>Seems all relationships similar, honeymoon period is the first few month are the sweetest.<br><br>Its like a drug that make you fall blindly in love. When the true colour is out, its so hard to accept the change. Keep wanting to go back to the happy times.<br><br>Of course there are alot of good people out there for you. just have to open eyes bigger to judge clearly.<br><br>Next time when you meet the next one, I guess better not devote 100% into it during the first few month.</div>
