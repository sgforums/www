It differs from session to session.<br><br>Let me explain a little:<br><br>Causal sex is also known as Maintenance Sex - used by a couple to ease their sexual urge. Usually anywhere less than 20 minutes and has low emotional value. Also known as quickie, quick fark, etc.<br><br>Good sex is usually a stage where sex is decent. This level has decent emotional value and everything else. From beginning of foreplay to end of session is reasonably taken care and noted of. Usually half an hour and more.<br><br>Great sex is a level higher than Good sex. All the enjoyment and everything else stays, but the environment and everything else make sex a much better experience. Say both parties travelled overseas, during Valentine's day, etc.<br><br>What else to keep relationship together? Sex cannot use to hold relationship together - <strong>Any relationship depended on sex will fail </strong>- without fundamental basis emotional connection with each other and love - sex has little power.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I tends to see it in a different perspective. I don't believe in have sex in a relationship. Don't get me wrong. Not that I am deprive or what lor. But I believe more in 'Making Love' rather than having sex. There is a different coz having sex is just purely physical and making love is the sexual action caused by love. Do you enjoy making love with him? If you don't but think that he purely wants sex from you then maybe your love for him has subsided and that's probably why you are doubting and thinking that he only wants sex. I am not taking side but trying to analyse from various perspective lor. Goold luck anyway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Making love is a perfectionist's perception of having sex. After a quarrel, will you still have sex? Yes, you will. Was that consider 'making love' or 'having purely sex'? I suppose it is purely sex, my dear, the truth hurts. To have a strong relationship that sees through physical appearance, communication is required.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Otherwise it is a superficial relationship that needs appearance to sustain. Once ages, relationship fades. Vampiress, do you always have communication breaks down wif your b/f, that's why you have the feeling of insecurity? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

One fine day, out of the blue, the girl says she doesn't wan to be treated like a comfort woman.<br><br>Hey if u wan a reln without sex then keep it clean from the start. Dun wait until 4 yrs down the road then u decide to slap him with an ultimatum that u dun wan any more bonking sessions with him.<br><br>Now it's more than just the reason for sex that is in question. It reflects how the couple makes decisions, or rather imposes themselves on the other. The way I see it, there was not enuff trust in each other b4 the lovemaking started and that explained the issues that surfaced now. Taking away sex abruptly will not make things any better for either of them. It's obvious, they need to talk things out and share their feelings with the other and work out a mutually agreeable solution. And not be overly assertive but instead take little steps to change for the better.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First, lets alay the myth of too much sex in a relationship is bad... I find sex will bring two people closer to each other. I believe the both of you must enjoy the love making session. I think this is a real plus point goes to show that your guy still loves doing it with you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>What are you getting at?<br><br>Vampire, do you want to settle down and wondering whether he is just in it for the banging? He could be yes... but you have to talk to him about it.<br><br>The best is to take a breather, some time off, if he really has true feelings for you, he will come back begging and hopefully start a timeline of when to get married...<br><br>However, since your notion that the both of you are young, take it easy... concentrate on your careers or studies and if it works out, it works but if it does'nt, the more worrying you do does'nt help!<br><br>Which brings us to full circle... what do you want?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Usually anywhere less than 20 minutes and has low emotional value. Also known as quickie, quick fark, etc.<br><br>Good sex is usually a stage where sex is decent. This level has decent emotional value and everything else. From beginning of foreplay to end of session is reasonably taken care and noted of. Usually half an hour and more.<br><br>Great sex is a level higher than Good sex. All the enjoyment and everything else stays, but the environment and everything else make sex a much better experience. Say both parties travelled overseas, during Valentine's day, etc.<br><br>What else to keep relationship together?
