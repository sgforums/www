            <div class='col-md body'>Talking from a girl's perspective, a lot of times, deep down inside, u do know if the guy truly loves u for who u r or if he is only with u for what u give him. Only u know it urself cos u r in the situation. It's juz whether u want to face up to reality and let him go, if he juz wants u for sex. But if u feel that he truly loves u, don't doubt him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dunno why gals all think like tat...<br><br>I used to have an ex and we got along well, both enjoyed sex wif each other and everything was fine. One day she suddenly told me she wans a 'normal' relationship.. Honestly, a 'normal' relationship to me includes sex. I do love her and never thought of her as a sex object or anything.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Am I 'abnormal', or is she rite? I guess it all depends on individual perspective.. but if ur bf is anything like me, he'll only be confused, fustrated, and eventually strain the relationship... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
