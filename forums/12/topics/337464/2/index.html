              <p>Do they have similar goals for the future? Simply being together is not going to create a happy life. It takes sweat, tears and a lot of persistence.</p>
              <p>If he's serious about himself and her, then there's no harm in giving it one last chance. Best to wait and see, reassess the situation 3 months later. If nothing changes, then she'll be sure of what to do.</p>
              <p>Love is a 2 way traffic, if they cannot motivate each other to improve, if they have differing ideas about their lifestyle, then they're mostly likely headed for a stormy future.</p>
              <p>I believe the rich suitor is irrelevant. There is no point in waiting for a man to give her what she wants, be it money or emotional fulfilment. As long as she continues to measure potential in this manner, disappointment, in one way or another is most certain many years down the road. If she leaves her current bf for the rich guy, she'd be wondering about the what ifs and could have beens. And vice versa.</p>
              <p>We humans are too volatile and complicated to have all our needs met by one single person anyway.</p>

              <p><br>We shifted from having bread for dinner, watching movies on weekdays, rent movies on weekends to watch - jus to save money, to the now almost shopping sprees on every weekends, changing cars every few months, eating at restaurants, holiday trips etc.</p>

              <p>He's pretty simple-minded, helps whenever he can, whoever needs help, just ask, he'll be there.</p>
              <p>I nagged for five years, at his financial planning, at his work etc, came up with plans for him - to tackle work issues for better profits, better management of finance etc, paid his bills, paid for his overseas holiday trip with his friends etc etc.<br><br>That's the irony in humans - he finally 'woke up' after 5 years, finally had savings, finally understand the meaning of financial planning, finally made improvements in his work etc.</p>
              <p><br>We shifted from having bread for dinner, watching movies on weekdays, rent movies on weekends to watch - jus to save money, to the now almost shopping sprees on every weekends, changing cars every few months, eating at restaurants, holiday trips etc.</p>
              <p><br>Sounds good?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I left him a year after his change; the things he bought went to my friends (new ones), spoilt and used (rubbish chute).</p>
              <p><br>Mayb if given me a choice again, I wouldn't have helped him to do the financial planning, wouldn't have helped him to figure things out on his work, wouldn't have nag at him, wouldn't have done all the things i have~~~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all in all cos --&gt; he has changed from one who will be there for u in dire of needs, to one who will be there to pay for ur hosp bills on the day u discharge, that's the only day he'll show up despite how many days u are in hosp~~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>whether its from rags to riches or riches to rags, what's important is the person himself doesn't change~~</p>

              <p>Of course, I'm sure your friend is a person one who is true to her feelings and is trying being realistic and think of her future, and not being in any way materialistic.</p>

              <p>I understand what TS was trying to say. I'm pretty much this kinda situation as well. Like my bf, i know he's not rich, but what i want is effort and sincerely from him to make life better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He cant be like this forever, forever treating friends, forever trying to protrait a 'rich' image. What if someday when we have started a family, is the children going to suffer with him just cause daddy need his 'face'?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My dad is someone like this, keep changing cars, treating friends, signing on credit cards and chalked up a huge debts but in the end, who's suffering? we, children and my mum are the one, we even have our furniture seized by the bank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what do you think? be with him or let him be like this forever just cause she knows in the very first place he's not rich, and she shouldn have second thoughts.  </p>

              <p>When he's rich - U were hospitalised, he never turned up, jus a routine sms, how are u today. He turned up only at the day of ur discharge, to pay the hospital bills, although u can pay for it urself.</p>

              <p><br>my ex BF also..when I know him..his family was going through some financial crisis with the dad's cancer relapse..moreover he just started working..shortly after that..his dad passed away &amp; he was so poor that he ask me for help to pay for the funeral expenses 1st as he don't have cash on hand..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>though both of us were pretty tight with our cash flow..but..we were really happy..he's that prince charming who pampers me with love &amp; care..caring &amp; sensitive..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but all these changes after he becomes rich..(he strike a mini fortune from debbling with stocks &amp; shares..) though he still treats me as good as before..but his personality changed from a humble guy to a haughty &amp; arrogant one..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there was once when we were Q-ing up to settle our bill..the man in front of us was holding on to a credit card &amp; when my ex saw that..he actually passed a very rude comment loudly : "aiyo..so old liao still cannot afford a Platinum card..i am only in my 20s &amp; yet i am holding on to one..."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was like wth? Is it necessary for u to pass those comments?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are alot more incidents whereby he loves to flaunt off his wealth..Numerous quarrels arises because I can't stand his "hao lian" ways..Things turned so badly that it comes to a point whereby I really can't take it &amp; opt to break off..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rich is one thing..But to "hao lian" until the point whereby u r so detestable is...haiish...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>money is really the root of all problems..</p>
