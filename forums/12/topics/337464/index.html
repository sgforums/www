              <p>My friend is attached with this guy who is around 7-8 yrs older than her. She got moved by his care &amp; concern for her as this guy treats her rather nice..Shower her with attention..even care about her family..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He can drive her all the way back to Msia for her to visit her grandparents..help to fix any plumbling probs for her..do simple household fix etc..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT, this guy isn't rich..He's so financially unstable that he even have problems with his monthly instalments. Sometimes he can just ask for $$ from my friend directly. Although he is around 30s..but he don't have much savings at all &amp; yet he wanted to marry my friend. What my friend's concern is that..He don't even have the $$ to pay for renovation, furniture, wedding expenses etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What my friend proposed was to open a savings account so that bot can save up tgt..but this guy always proposed to utilized the $$ for trips, pay off his credit card bills etc. I mean, what's the use of savings then? It defeats the purpose &amp; intention of my friend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although he isn't that rich, but, he's a generous guy whom always offers to give out treats to others. Qutoed by my friend "in the end..we are the ones who suffered whenever he acts generous"</p>

              <p>Though my friend have feelings for him..but, she's in a dilemna of deciding whether she should stick on to this guy or not</p>

              <p>If she chose to stick on = hard life in future, financially unstable, endless bickerings over $$ issues e.g. utilities bills</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>My friend is attached with this guy who is around 7-8 yrs older than her. She got moved by his care &amp; concern for her as this guy treats her rather nice..Shower her with attention..even care about her family..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He can drive her all the way back to Msia for her to visit her grandparents..help to fix any plumbling probs for her..do simple household fix etc..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT, this guy isn't rich..He's so financially unstable that he even have problems with his monthly instalments. Sometimes he can just ask for $$ from my friend directly. Although he is around 30s..but he don't have much savings at all &amp; yet he wanted to marry my friend. What my friend's concern is that..He don't even have the $$ to pay for renovation, furniture, wedding expenses etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What my friend proposed was to open a savings account so that bot can save up tgt..but this guy always proposed to utilized the $$ for trips, pay off his credit card bills etc. I mean, what's the use of savings then? It defeats the purpose &amp; intention of my friend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although he isn't that rich, but, he's a generous guy whom always offers to give out treats to others. Qutoed by my friend "in the end..we are the ones who suffered whenever he acts generous"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though my friend have feelings for him..but, she's in a dilemna of deciding whether she should stick on to this guy or not</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If she chose to stick on = hard life in future, financially unstable, endless bickerings over $$ issues e.g. utilities bills</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or should she move on? There's another guy who is financially stable chasing after her right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If u were my friend, what decision will u make?</p>

              <p>my uncle used to have a wife who married him while he was still rich. he doted on her a lot and bought her many things.</p>

              <p>to me, she's someone who could only share riches with my uncle, but not sufferings together.</p>
              <p>my uncle may be at fault for not being able to manage his finance more wisely, when he was still rich. but as a wife, shouldn't she help him save more for the family? and when my uncle became poor, she conveniently put all the blame on him for their poverty.</p>

              <p>Do they have similar goals for the future? Simply being together is not going to create a happy life. It takes sweat, tears and a lot of persistence.</p>
              <p>If he's serious about himself and her, then there's no harm in giving it one last chance. Best to wait and see, reassess the situation 3 months later. If nothing changes, then she'll be sure of what to do.</p>
              <p>Love is a 2 way traffic, if they cannot motivate each other to improve, if they have differing ideas about their lifestyle, then they're mostly likely headed for a stormy future.</p>
              <p>I believe the rich suitor is irrelevant. There is no point in waiting for a man to give her what she wants, be it money or emotional fulfilment. As long as she continues to measure potential in this manner, disappointment, in one way or another is most certain many years down the road. If she leaves her current bf for the rich guy, she'd be wondering about the what ifs and could have beens. And vice versa.</p>
              <p>We humans are too volatile and complicated to have all our needs met by one single person anyway.</p>

              TS is asking on behalf on her good friend I suppose...And is unable to fathom the fact that her friend's bf is not dollar-smart while there is someone who is 'financially stable' after her skirt. 
                      
              And asked for forumer's vote on what should be her choice or what will be our choice if we are TS's friend?
                      
              TS: Your choice is already clear from the words you put across, so why still ask for other's opinion??? You are supposed to be her friend and you cannot even offer a good advice and had to broadcast your friend's plight to the whole of sgforumers for vote. 
                      
              As you are 3rd party relating your friend's plight, I cannot help but feel you are biased in your account of the story.
