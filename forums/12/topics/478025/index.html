              <p>Everyone will go through this phrase someday.</p>
              <p>So the problem for you is (i presume):</p>
              <p>1) no longer popular? or;</p>
              <p>2) you miss your old life where you have many different people around you? or;</p>
              <p>3) cant seem to find friends?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your problem is (3), shouldn't be much of a problem unless ur bf is anti-social.</p>
              <p>Find people with common interest. Meet some of your friends with your bf, you 2 no need to be alone 101% of the time. Rather of closing your life with only you and your bf, why not include more people into your life of you and ur bf?</p>

If they don't want then you know you aint the real problem. And since you got a boyfriend, of course guys wouldn't come and give you gifts or confess their feelings.

              <p>Hi guys</p>
              <p>I feel alone in this world now. Sometimes having suicidal
              thoughts, because nobody would miss me either. Right? </p>
              <p>There's no friend that i click to now. i feel alone. lonely.
              sad.</p>
              <p>I started losing friends after i got together with my current
              boyfriend. Our honeymoon period lasted over a year. We missed each
              other, and always spend time everyday. My friends and i drifted
              apart. We quarreled that i was spending a lot time with him and not
              them. But i was happy with him. He was all i needed. </p>
              <p>This year, i started at a new school. I made friends. But i am
              not close with them. More like people you meet in school and that's
              it. I was devastated. Why can't i make friends anymore? </p>
              <p>I used to be popular. I knew almost everybody in school, from
              juniors to seniors. I could walk through school and talk to
              anybody. 3-4 guys used to confess to me every week. Valentine's, my
              Birthday, New Years, Xmas, i always got a boxful of gifts. But
              everything changed after i got together with him. He's guilty about
              this but i don't blame him. Is the problem with me or others? Am i
              bad at socialising after being with only 1 person for over a year?
              Or are my "friends" just acquaintances? I miss my old life. Going
              out everyday, with different people. I wasn't as happy as i feel
              with my boyfriend, but i didn't felt as lonely. </p>
