Though of course I do not encourage all craps &amp; insensitivity in AA. But understand that different people see things differently.. And hence might just approach a problem differently.. Some might be light-hearted in an attempt to cheer the other party up... While there could be more serious others.. Sometimes it's hard to say who's giving the 'right' advices and who's not... As much as there are some comments in AA which I deem unfit, I often do not wish to interfere too much into things as these are just people's thoughts... Reflect BOTH on the 'positive' and 'negative' of advices and you'll get a more balanced 'understanding' of it...<br><br>And this is just how the world works.. People uttering everything in the reality world.. Forum being part of the reality world is probably at least partly confined to that... One interesting thing I've learnt in my life is that there are many things happening around us now at the very same time which we probably won't be able to do much for... Remember... You're not 'superman'... At least not at this point of your life...</div></blockquote>I agree with you totally.<br><br>I with one perspective cannot grasp the whole sphere.<br>However, when i am unable to understand a one liner statement. I seek explaination which might bring enlighten and in turn benefit the rest.<br><br>The world is colorful when there are different kinds of people. We hate them, we love them. We need them! to make this world a more interesting place to live in.<br><br>I remember i am not superman. I have count my cost on those post in AA, none was regretted.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Roxy_Gurl,<br><br>You are not the only one who has this encounter. I have been through wat you are going through now.<br><br>I have known a guy and we both liked each other. When I thought all was going well until when it seemed to reach the stage to go steady, he wanted out stating that he was not ready for a relationship. I was really upset coz we dun even have the chance to give the relationship a chance. I was thinking to myself, "Am I the one with the problem?" 1 year later, he got engaged to another girl. But, 6 months later, he broke off the engagement. So, I guess, its him, not me who has the problem. I guess, it's not that he is not ready for the commitment. Its just that "he's just not into you"!<br><br>Cheers.</div>
