            <div class='col-md body'>MC,<br><br>No offence, but please don't become as inflexible as The Bear.  True, in this instance, Pete has been insensitive to a genuine heartbreak problem, &amp; the poster is obviously in distress.<br><br>However, No reason to persecute.  Sometimes, a person means well by trying to joke, which The Bear can't seem to understand in my post in another thread.  Their intention may be to lighten up the atmosphere.  Sometimes it works (when the problem isn't that serious, &amp; that person just wants to rant, like in the other thread), sometimes, it backfires (such as now).  Heck, I've been real moody, but brightened up after someone jokes with me &amp; makes me see the funny side to a problem.<br><br>Pete's replies, as I've mentioned, are definitely insensitive, &amp; shouldn't be condoned, but it's Not like those bar clones whose intentions are downright questionable.

Though of course I do not encourage all craps &amp; insensitivity in AA. But understand that different people see things differently.. And hence might just approach a problem differently.. Some might be light-hearted in an attempt to cheer the other party up... While there could be more serious others.. Sometimes it's hard to say who's giving the 'right' advices and who's not... As much as there are some comments in AA which I deem unfit, I often do not wish to interfere too much into things as these are just people's thoughts... Reflect BOTH on the 'positive' and 'negative' of advices and you'll get a more balanced 'understanding' of it...<br><br>And this is just how the world works.. People uttering everything in the reality world.. Forum being part of the reality world is probably at least partly confined to that... One interesting thing I've learnt in my life is that there are many things happening around us now at the very same time which we probably won't be able to do much for... Remember... You're not 'superman'... At least not at this point of your life...</div>
