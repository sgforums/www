Did you find out all these before you actually confessed to her?<br><br>Since you have already done what you did, don't worry about the outcome. Continue keeping in touch with her but DO NOT BROACH ON THE TOPIC on starting a relationship. Keep everything as for normal and wait for her to bring up the topic with you.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

This girl has rejected you though she does not say it in your face. Her heart and mind do.<br><br>However, if you really want to pursue her, just go on. Be just a little bit more perseverance but do not annoy her. Just let her know that whether she like you or not, your feelings for her don't change and you don't need her to repay you with anything. Soon one day she would discover more of what you are and this may mean a second chance.<br><br></div>
