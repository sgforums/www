            <div class='col-md body'>I'm in first three month course for JC now, and the decision to do Physics or Chemistry after PAE is giving me a real headache. Here's a little background about my academic areas.<br><br>In secondary school, I took combined science and <strong>NO</strong> A math. For my CS-Physics, it's kinda easy for me to score A1 and for CS-Chem, I can score a range of A1-B3. It's combined science though =/. A1 for my E math is a mere formality. I'm in a sports CCA, kinda excelling in it, thus I was given a chance to DSA into this certain JC.<br><br>Now I'm in this JC doing my PAE. My current subject combi is: H1 Econs, H2 Physics, Math and Computing. However, I'm starting to struggle a little bit in my H2 Math. I'm also given the advise not to take Physics because I do not have any A math foundation. Also, Physics is normally the subject that most people struggle and flunk badly at. Right now, I classify math as my burden now. H2 Physics is still currently okay, but things are getting more difficult and complex. I might not be able to handle Physics, resulting in another heavy burden, and in my promos, worst case, flunk both my Math and Physics (*TOUCHWOOD*) and ended up being retained.<br><br>Thus I've actually thought of dropping Physics and taking Chem after the PAE. For Chem, I believe I still can be able to make it. But two points that deter me from taking chem is: (1) I'm more into Physics than Chem, probably because I'm better in Physics than Chem during Secondary School, (2) Without Physics, I will have alot lesser choice courses to choose from in the Uni.<br><br>Furthermore, because I DSA-ed into this JC, I have to stay committed to the sports CCA, which training are really very packed, 3 times per week, each day till 10+pm. I won't have enough time to handle my studies.<br><br>So can I hear some recommendation on you guys whether I should continue taking Physics or drop Physics and take Chem?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you have no A maths, why do you choose computing? Computing sounds rather "maths" and "physics" to me... (My friends in NUS Computing have to take a lot of maths modules.) Taking chem and computing without physics is a rather odd combi... (The only link between chem and computing I can think about is the 3-D molecular programmes and all those molecular simulations...)<br><br>Of course, at the end of the day, you have to ask yourself whether you're really interested in the subject, and also what you really want to do in the future. The teachers may also play a big role. When I was in JC, I dropped econs in the 2nd week of JC1, but I loved chemistry so much that I took chemistry S-paper... This was because my econs tutor sucked and my chem tutor was fantastic. When a teacher is good, you'll have the interest and passion, and eventually you'll have the motivation to study and you'll get good grades.<br><br>Maybe you can crash the chemistry lectures and ask your friends for copies of the chem lecture notes and tutorials. Find out more about chemistry now and don't wait until the PAE and then decide. After trying for a few weeks, if you don't like chemistry, then stick to Physics. If you like chemistry and wanna switch, then at least you have some foundation and you don't need to spend so much time catching up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
