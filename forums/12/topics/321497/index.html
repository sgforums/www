              <p>I have enough! Enough of those nitwits, good-for-nothing, arrogant S*O*Bitches that our government import in droves...</p>

              <p>Why do we have so many of them in Singapore??</p>
              <p><br>Yesterday, I was turning into an alley when this dickhead started waving angrily at me.. apparently, he was walking his toddler and he thinks I'm turning too wide that I might hit his child. I was in my lane and that bonehead should have stayed on the pavement!</p>
              <p>Today, this dimwit was driving against the traffic and he f***king unbelievably wanted me to backup so he can move forward.</p>
              <p><br>Why?Why? Everyday I come across so call FTs who isn't worth a quarter of what they're paid; taking up jobs that Singaporean should have no problem doing (infact, many of these idiots depend on Singaporean subordinates to given them advice!)</p>

              <p>True, you can't judge a whole race based on personal experiences.  It's inevitable that negative encounters will stand out much more than neutral ones.  The culture of the westerners focuses more on "expressing their opinions" and "free speech" relative to ours.  Thus, in my experience studying here in Australia, people luuuurve voicing their opinions.  Australians that I've talked to also have a large tendency to exaggerate so their "thoughts and opinions" turn into "facts" so they appear to be know-it-alls. </p>
              <p>Furthermore, women want someone who's "different".  And the ang mohs who come here for a job are the more confident one's of their country.  Just think about it, they're leaving their country for success elsewhere, logical to think that they're the most confident of their lot.  And women love that.</p>
              <p>As for "SG dud with Angmoh chick =  Is that white biaetch of sound mind?", lol when my mum still drove to pick my dad up from work, he'd tell all his co-workers that his "white chauffeur" is driving him home buahahahahahaha.</p>

              <p>Yup...I know in the US, at least, pedestrians have the right of way in lanes and roads in residential areas; cars stop for pedestrians to cross the roads in these areas.  But in Singapore, drivers seemed to think they have the right of way over pedestrians everywhere, even in parking lots/basements.  In fact, even someone on a bicycle in Singapore, thinks he has the right of way over pedestrians; seen a lot of this in Tampines area where I live where cyclists are allowed to roam free on pavements and even void decks.</p>
