              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>I am a 26 yo Chinese male. I have never had a girlfriend in my life and have been feeling very down as of late because of this fact. Even more so is the mindset that hinders me from making any sort of meaningful contact with the opposite sex. Whenever I feel attracted to someone I feel that it is manipulative of me to talk and get to know that person just so that I can eventually have sex with her. I have never seem to get over this and I wonder if anyone can help me with my problem.</p>

              <p>Your don't have a close relationship with your mother, and you have no sisters, yes ?</p>
              <p> Perhaps if you stop looking at females as just a sex object, you may actually be able to start having a non-sexually motivated connection with a female being.</p>

              Ts,
              The truth of the matter to ur predicament is this - u are not lonely as u imply, rather ur mind is lust-ridden and the wanting to be in a relationship or know a ... are excuses and merely excuses to play out what is latent in u.
              Considering ur age (assume it is true) it is a phase all go thru. However, to not acknowledge or to deny that aspect of .... in oneself is unhealthy and unwise.
              It is disrespectful of oneself and how can it be possible to respect another. Sex is not love, and lust is not love. Sex of the body is healthy, sex of the mind is neurosis.

              a meaningful relationship is not just about sex alone...
              
              you have very wrong attitude towards relationship.
              
              if sex is what you are looking for, you can just buy sex without commiting to a relationship...
