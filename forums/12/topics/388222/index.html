              <p>Okay guys here goes nothing…there is a girl that i’ve been
              seeing for the last month or so. Nothing concrete, but i
              <span>THINK</span> we feel the same about each other.
              She’s a part-time model so she’s always going on shoots here and
              there. And if the rumours about some local photographers are to be
              believed, of course i get a little worried. And then one fine day,
              the inevitable happened. I would like to say that the following is
              a little worst-case scenario i <span>IMAGINED</span> up.
              Play along with me, alright? Just want some input.</p>
              <p>She responded to a forum message by this well known local
              photographer who has judged many photography competitions and has
              exhibited his own work extensively. He owns his own company and
              conducts classes as well. Did a check up on him online and found
              this to be true. He was looking for models for a night shoot, so
              she responded. So they met in the middle of the night and went to
              different locations for a shoot. While he was sending her home, he
              started sharing his sob story about how girls shouldn’t fall for
              him, as he was in some kinda relationship hell. Upon prodding, he
              revealed some stuff that i probably shouldn’t say here, as i
              respect his privacy. SO the thing is, it seems our hotshot
              photographer started to cry. Out of kindness, this girl gives him a
              hug and comforts him. He responds by trying to kiss her. She
              avoided it and tried to change the topic. He desists and drops her
              off home.</p>
              <p>2nd time they met was during a group outing to supper. Cutting
              the long story short, after eating, the photographer makes some
              excuse and asks my friend to leave with him. This was around late
              night, 2AM-ish. She asks him where they were going, so he says he
              wants to bring her to his office to select the photos from the
              previous shoot. Dumbly, she follows him. So needless to say, once
              they get into the office, he starts his emo shit routine again, and
              tries to undress her. She says no, it’s wrong, and refuses to let
              him get his way. So he stops, selects the photos and the leave the
              office, going their own ways.</p>
              <p>The 3rd time he asked her out, she agreed, ‘to prove that she
              can have a normal friendship with him and nothing physical will
              happen.’ Okay, fine, give it to her. So they meet, and when she
              asks where they’re going, he says he needs to go back to the office
              to get some stuff. Okay, so when they arrive, she doesn’t go in,
              choosing to wait outside. Awhile later he calls her, saying he
              wants to show her some photos and ask for her suggestions. (knn, a
              pro photographer asking a model on photography tips. wtf) So once
              inside, he says need to wait awhile, computer damn laggy. So while
              waiting, he starts his shit again, trying and trying and trying.
              She refuses of course. So then, he starts his killer story.</p>
              <p>Seems he broke off with a very nice lady, to get together with a
              single mother…everything was fine until soon after marriage, when
              he claims that she is just using him for his earning abilities to
              provide for her children, loveless marriage, got how tragic, say
              how tragic, and when my friend asked him why can’t he leave her, i
              forgot what crap excuse he gave and all that. So he broke down
              crying horribly, like a miserable piece of shit excuse for a man,
              and hugged her. So my friend, being nice, hugged back. I think she
              got taken in by all his crap (who knows if it’s real), and when he
              tried again, she didn’t stop him. Needless to say, it progressed
              further into sex. So halfway through, it seems the alarm bells in
              her head started to sound abit too late, so she asked him to stop.
              But it seems the fella was so into it, he carried on and on. After
              everything, she actually said she could like him, but sex was out
              of the question in the future. Bloody effin’ marvelous.</p>
              <p>So thing is, she kept the subsequent two meetings from me. But
              eventually she spilt it out because she said she couldn’t stand the
              guilt. Moreover, after this incident, a friend of hers, who did not
              know what happened, casually mentioned about this photographer to
              her. It seems it’s not the first time he has done this kinda thing
              and used this method to get his way. After that day, she has been
              staying home all day feeling depressed and upset. And all the
              while, this photographer has been asking her out, but she says she
              rejected him. She asked for forgiveness, and i did. But i still
              can’t get over the lying part.</p>
              <p>So yeah. End of story. Just putting it out to you guys to see if
              any good advice on what i should do here on out, IF this story
              actually happened. Thanks people.</p>

              <p>This is a really weird story.</p>
              <p>If it happens, I highly doubt you will remember any advice given here, and you will likely bash up the girl first rather than the guy.</p>

              <p>Maybe she know's that she wants it, but she's being held back by
              her conscience out of concern for you, TS.</p>
              <p>By rejecting him multiple times and finally giving in might be a
              way to alleviate the guilt felt by her, by thinking "it wasn't my
