Does it mean the rate at which blood flows through your body? How do you measure that? What is "normal"? What is "fast" and what is "slow"?<br><br>Does it mean that some parts of you body is bad/dead because not enough blood flows there? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think your problem is stress.  Just learn to relax and try not to push yourself too much.  Remember you can only do so much.  Try to delegate some of your housework.... let your kids and hubby help out since you're working too...<br><br>If you are so concerned about your health then you should start looking after yourself by eating healthy and do more exercise.  You don't need to be an athlete to do exercise.  Try to allocate 30min - an hour a day to do some exercise like going for a walk, working on some of the equipment installed at the base of the HDB block (if there's any where you live). Use the stairs instead of the lift is quite good.  Again, you don't have to push yourself too hard, just start off slowly - one step at a time.<br><br>When you first started exercising, it can be difficult but if you learn to endure, it will get easier after sometime.  And you will feel better too.<br><br>Drink lots of water instead of coffee or tea.  Have lots of vegetables, fruits, fibre and less meat in your diet.  If it helps, take some multi-vitamins too.<br><br>Take care!</div>
