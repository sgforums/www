You will just set him up against bigger debts because these people with money in hand will never ever ever want pay the debt. They will just gamble it away. Its the gambler's fallacy that they believed that the next hand, they will win. My FIL is a gambler who never wins. So far, I know that whatever money we gave to my FIL over CYN, he lost it all and he had to work extra to pay off his debts.
