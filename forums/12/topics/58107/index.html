Therefore from here, it is likely that it could be one sided. Furthermore, race, religion &amp; language is quite an issue, although it can be avoided - what matters most is whether this relationship will extend into a LDR (Long Distance Relationship). If yes, then my stand is not advisable. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I think the main problem doesn't lie with all these - its more about expressing yourself. You fear rejection greatly don't you? However, haven't this secret torment you deep inside long enough? Don't you want to release the tension and hack care about the consequences? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Expressing doesn't need to have an ending - It's an act of no expectation.<br><br>Don't make the decision about whether to stay/leave/etc until you have a clearer picture about the definition of the relationship between the both of you. From there, probably you will know what to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Its quite different since expressing alone does not need any reply. You just tell her you have some good feelings about her. Think about what do you really want here ... ...<br>3 - Yes, it is difficult to stay in sg unless you got a gold mine back at home. But its not IMPOSSIBLE. Look around, you sure can find your bread. It is possible to stay here (but difficult. .... )<br><br>Advise is, drop hints about you liking her and see her response ... ... If it seems like you have a chance, stay here, endure and look for a good chance... If she give ya things like "mission impossible", you really gotta think hard if its worth to stay ... ...
