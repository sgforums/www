            <div class='col-md body'>Hi LOLS,<br><br>I used to have severe acne too, that's why your thread attacted me.<br><br>But it's clear now, and I have some <strong>best practices</strong> I'd like to share with you:<br><br>1) Avoid the oily and heaty foods like prata, char quay teow, banana fritters, fast food, fries etc...<br><br>Although the doctors say it doesn't make a difference, I swear to you it does. If you ask a TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) doctor, he'll tell you such foods produce pathogenic heat which increases sebaceous secretion and worsens acne.<br><br>I have a friend who never believed what I told him and continued to eat all the fried and oily stuff.... today, 8 years later, he still has bad acne. And he's way out of puberty too.<br><br>2) Intake cooling, greaseless, healthy foods like salads, veggies, fruits, tomato, cucumber, celery... make it a habit to blend your own fruit juice and drink that as a complete meal.<br><br>This means you'll have to find a healthier alternative for a lot of the things you eat. A bit hard to find, but not impossible. There are always healthier choices available.<br><br>3) Use a good face wash. And don't scrimp on using it.  My friend bought this expensive $60 face wash and squeezes less than a dime each time.... NOT EFFECTIVE. Just get a $10 one and use it in copious amounts.<br><br>4) Use acne medication, those you can get from a skin specialist.<br><br>5) Don't squeeze. You can soak a small towel in hot water and place it on the pimple to draw the sebum to gather into a head. It'll take maybe two days of application every 3 hours. Once it's in a head (yellow dot of puss) then it's safer to squeeze, but I recommend you just let it burst by itself when you wash it.<br><br>6) Use a facial mask to draw out the sebum at night. I've had good success with this brand called BLACKMORE's. Available at most pharmaceutical outlets.<br><br>7) Drink genuine herbal cooling tea. The kind you buy from a chinese herbalist. Maybe Eu Yan Sang. This really helps to relieve pathogenic heat. OR, you can just blend 5 tomatoes and 3 sticks of celery and drink that.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Lance<br><br></div>

But for 2), I dont think it's applicatable for me because seriously, I dont take much vegetables. =p<br><br>For 3), I'm still trying to find some facial foam which is quite effective. And I dont use facial mask. Must I use it? Cause it's rather costly I believe.<br><br>For 6), yup.. I do it. In fact my mom makes me drink one cup everyday.</div>

This method works for me and my face feels really clean after that.<br><br>I used to have really bad acne and went to NSC, but the antibiotics the dermatologist prescribed caused me to constantly feel nauseous so I stopped taking it. Plus, the results weren't that good either.<br><br>I've heard that some birth control pills do help in controlling acne problems due to hormonal imbalances, have yet to try it though. You can just go to a GP for consultation. Shouldn't be that expensive (:<br><br>As for your low self-esteem, I know how it feels 'cos I've always envied my friends that have smooth clear complexions.

If you ask a TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) doctor, he'll tell you such foods produce pathogenic heat which increases sebaceous secretion and worsens acne.<br><br>I have a friend who never believed what I told him and continued to eat all the fried and oily stuff.... today, 8 years later, he still has bad acne.
