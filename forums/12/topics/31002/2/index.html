Currently, his gf went overseas for holidays and will be back next weekÂ… Two days ago, he asked me out for a movie outing. I agreed cos I thought we were just friends and I really missed him.<br><br>In the cinema, he held my hands for a while during the early part of the show. I tried to pull off my hands initiallyÂ… but in the end I let him held my hands. We went for a drink after the show.<br><br>He offered to send me back home. All seems normal until the part when he kissed me in the lift. I was quite surprised by his action. After cooling down, he apologized to me. I guess he felt that what he did was wrong as he is already attached. He asked me whether he can still know other girls if heÂ’s attachedÂ…. I told him that he should ask his gf this question as I dun think I am in a position to answer the question. He also asked me how to remain faithful but I really dun know how to advise him on that matter. I guess his heart is still not very stable.<br><br>I felt really lost after that incident. Although he expressed to me before that he likes me when I asked him about his opinion of myself.... However, deep in my heart, my sixth sense keeps telling me that if he can kiss me behind his gfÂ’s back, he can do that to other gals tooÂ… so I kept asking myself why am I still so silly to continue liking him. I guess I should stop initiating SMS messages and minimize my contact with him, but I felt so difficult cos I really like him a lot. I am now trying to get over him but I really dun know how toÂ… I think I need time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>On the other hand, I am having problems with my job hunt as well. After graduating for several mths, I am still unable to find a suitable job. ThatÂ’s making me feel a little bit worried. I find that most jobs which I am interested in require related experience and relevant qualifications. I find that I am at a disadvantage as I am lacking experience in those areas and my degree is quite general.<br><br>Okie, gota end nowÂ… thanks for lending me your listening ear.. If possible, hope u could offer me some advice on the above matters.. I just hope that I can stop thinking about that guy and find a suitable job soon.... I apologise for my poor English.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br></div></blockquote>SIMPLE piece of ADVICE.... DON'T go for that guy... By SIMPLE SURFACE analysis, he don't sounds real enough... But of course, there're always chances for OTHERWISE.... Which.... You MOST probably ain't READY for.... IMAGINE if you really goes into a RELATIONSHIP with him, you'll have to CLASH with his gf... Maybe people around both of you... Risk the UNKNOWN fact of how true is his feelings for you... &lt;- How well do you know him...? COMPLEXITY is BOUND to roll in.... DON'T FORGET, you still haven't get yourself a PROPER job...? SAVE your energy for better ultilisation...?<br><br>YOUR JOB.... If I've not remember wrongly you've posted this before.... IN ADDITION, you've posted MANY more others... Economy is not exactly that great now.... SETTLE for something which you might not really long for but can make a living for you for now.... Being a FRESH GRAD you are, try to look out for relatively NEW POST which would rather long-term cultivation of  personnel... They usually prefer FRESH GRADs... In this case, don't look for something which you virtually can't stand.... Something BALANCED so that Life would be easier on you at a later stage of your career....<br><br></div>
