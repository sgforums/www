They're probably attractive and has many suitors. With many choices, i guess they'll be more choosy, and in turn be more careless about the feelings of other people around them.

            <div class='col-md body'>yea, yea I know I am not supposed to be posting here hehe...finals are not over yet, I will have two of my first papers this Monday in fact...but have been studying for 4 hours straight, damn sian so decided to visit this forum...quite surprised to see I have gotten so many replies for this 'second guy' issue...<br><br>Well, just as an update on what has happened between me and my ex-prince, I saw him again the other day but I purposely walked in the opposite direction. I know he must have thought I have been acting strange these few days but he didn't even bother to confront me...shows how much he actually cares. Hah. I am not going to care about such person anymore. I think I have been making progress in my process of forgetting him, I am not feeling so sad anymore. I am feeling like I am more ready to move on now...of course I still will feel sad now and then but I am feeling better now...<br><br>But yea, about B. I seldom see him anymore nowadays. I dunno if he is really busy or is avoiding me. Just when I thought of giving him a chance *sigh* I am not trying to use him by saying this. I just want to give someone who really cherish me a chance. Maybe it is too fast, I dun really know. Or maybe I have hurt him too much that now he is 'withdrawing' from me. Why does everything always have to be too late for me? Am I fated to spend a life full of loneliness? Everytime I want to start to like someone, I will find out that the person no longer likes me...<br><br>alrite, i m going back to my book. thanks for all the replies. And btw, it is not just gals hurting guys. Guys do that to girls too. So dun generalize and only say girls hurt guys all the time because all my 21 years, I think I have been hurt by so countless tactless guys...maybe it is my fault for falling for the wrong person again and again but just to let people know that guys too can be cruel at times to a girl's heart.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

However, i believe Misogynist is right in that most of the time, it's the guys on the receiving end of rejections. Simply because regardless of gender equality, in our society, guys are still the ones with the onus to woo gals, not the opposite. As Misogynist said, cases where the reverse happens are few. And guys are humans too, with emotions. Ladies reading this, how tactful were u when u have to reject guys? U ever wondered how they felt?<br><br>Icyprincess, most of the guys whom u said hurt u before are probably the popular jocks right? (with either looks, charisma or $$) The type who can afford to be choosy. As i mentioned before, when a person becomes more popular especially with the opposite sex, some of it will unwittingly go into his or her head and will probably be more careless of the feelings of others around them.<br><br>As for B, it's good that u're thinking of giving him a chance. It is probably not too late; if a guy really likes u, it will never be easy to let go. U said he could be avoiding u. Have u given him some negative signal before, which may indicate to him to back off? If yes and u're really sincere about giving him a chance, give him a call after your exams. Maybe tell him about your experience with A to explain why u were behaving the way u did then. And show some of the differences from other gals that Misogynist mentioned. Take the initiative and asked him if he likes u. Then tell him how u really feel about him now but that u're willing to give it a shot (not to become a couple immediately but to get to know each other better). U may not like him now but i've always believed that feelings can be cultivated if given the chance. If u want, add a disclaimer first to tell him not to expect too much if everything does not work out. This disclaimer will help him reduce some heartache if things really do not go smoothly later on.<br><br>So there, my take on your situation. A win-win solution for both u and B. If he is a good person, cherish him and don't let him slip out of your life or u'll be back looking for guys just like A. Take care.</div>

Which is impossible because right now I am having my finals. Anyway, I was talking to her halfway and then my phone went dead and I discovered that I have finished my phonecard. Then I just panicked..because today is Sunday over here and I can't get phonecard online, have to go out and buy. I was on my way to go to the shop when I met B, I think I was feeling pretty upset at that time I just told him everything that had happened. Then he said he would follow me to go to the shop to buy the card, I said no need since it is quite near and it is daytime, nothing will happen to me and then he said he was worried about me. Haha I must have looked really panicky at that time. Anyway I went with him lor then on our way back, he din want to take the bus, said wanted to walk back home with me. So we walked home lor, talked a lot, I think I am really giving him a chance la hehe since he seems to be a really nice guy. Haih.

I'm happy that he is being given the chance that i myself will not get. U said u feel paiseh about asking him whether he likes u? No need to be, cos from what u described, it's almost confirmed that he does. Even if u asked him and he said he does not like u, u can just make light of it if both of u are already quite close. If u popped the question to him now, u will avoid the trap of growing to like him only to face rejection later if he really does not like u. Besides, u're in America now right?

I do not want to hurt anyone in this. I have moved into my new apt and he moved in to the hse beside mine. That day he helped me to move my stuff, I hate it when I am so dependent on him, at first I declined his help but in the end I let him helped because I am so weak, I just can't do anything by myself *sigh*. After we moved in, we went for lunch, yea I know I know, I am not supposed to be going out with him but in the end I ended up talking to him just like last time and I realized how much I miss those time. Suddenlt we were joking and laughing again and I almost wanted to tell him right then I love him, but again I held my tongue. I told him of my problems and he consoled me, even holding me at one point...I can't believe I am letting myself going through this again....The next 3 months might give me happiness but then I will have to be away from him again after that....I wish I can forget him soon...<br><br>i.c.y</div>
