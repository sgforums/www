            <div class='col-md body'>My prince broke my heart again...I think there is no point in me asking him anymore whether he likes me or not...he was talking to me online just now and the other girl signed in halfway and you know what he did?

I was puzzled why he did that until an hour later I saw his sign in name has been changed to,"My dearest friend (fill in the girl's name here) it is so nice to talk to you again." I just broke down at that moment. I really cried in front of my comp. It is like the moment she came on, he will forget all about me. All about what I have done for him. I am hanging on for someone who doesn't love me at all. I am doing things for a person who doesn't appreciate it. I guess it is time to move on. Thanks guys for all the support. I guess I should make myself hate him now. I am going to sever all ties with him. Means avoiding him for the rest of my life. Yes, I am damn angry right now.</div>

He has been asking me out to lunch, dinner, supper, movies, you name it, he has asked me to it...<br><br>Of course if Ilike him back it wun be a problem. But you all know I like another guy. And I try to make myself like B. I have gone out with him as a friend and I find him to be a really nice guy...but sumhow I just can't 'feel' for him the same way I do for the other guy *sigh*<br><br>So I dunno le...sometimes I go out with him just to make sure the guy I like jealous (he really did once, when I came back late with B and then he asked me a lot of questions)..but I feel bad cos dats like using B. I know it is not fair but I feel sorry if I reject him all the time too. Sometimes even when I dun wan to go out with him I will just say yes because he keeps asking me to.<br><br>Haih. Really dunno wat to do. Any opinion??</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Seriously speaking, everyone make use of everyone in matters of love, especially when they are not the main cast in the person's heart.<br><br>You can make clear to him that you and him is impossible? No chemistry, no feelings. Going out with him doesn't mean anything - it doesn't mean that you have to fork out certain percentage of your heart to him just because you went out on private dates. It's for companionship and company - he has to know about this point? And at anytime when you are not comfortable, no time or anything - don't hestitate to reject him and make known to him that it doesn't mean anything.<br><br>Friends will be friends - draw the line clear in the beginning to prevent ambigious claims later on.<br><br>P.S: Side cast (people you have no feelings for) shouldn't cause any problem at all. Don't implicate situations with side cast - it creates unneccessary problems.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When i first came across this thread, i was shocked... because i believed i'm in the same type of situation, except that i'll be B... For a while there, i thought icyprincess may be the girl i like until i saw her profile.<br><br>My situation will be almost exactly similar to B's. I came to like one of my female classmates and we became quite close, smsing, chatting online at night or on the phone every day. I then decided to get along with chasing her. I started asking her out solo, instead of with a whole group of friends. The response then was favourable, or so i thought. I knew she had a breakup fairly recently in December though. I bought her a present when i went on holiday. I made a point of remembering little details about her, such as her favourite drinks, food, her behaviour. It seemed to surprised her when she came to knew i was observing her but i thought then that she was pleased. I was quite obvious about my feelings through, even though i never said that i like her out loud. Our exams was at the end of last month and i've already decided a while back to ask her out after the exams and told her about my feelings face to face (i've always believed that it's better to say these words face to face rather than through the phone). I've even asked around for romantic spots to do this.<br><br>Unfortunately, as we neared the exams, how she behaved towards me seemed to have changed. When i asked her out a few times, she always said she was busy. I thought that it could be the exams bothering her, though at the back of my mind, i wondered whether it could have been her relationship problems came back to bother her. But i still decided to go ahead with my original idea, since i did not like to beat around the bush (plus she had once long ago made an off-hand remark that guys should expressed their feelings if they like someone).<br><br>So after the exams, i asked her out the very next day. She again said she was not free. And so on for the next day. Then, i met her online on msn. Her words were very... stiff, not like all the previous times when we chat. Then she made a remark. "Do u believe in out of sight, out of mind?"<br><br>I knew something was bothering her. I asked her whether i can meet up with her. Her reply broke my heart. "No, i do not want to meet u". I tried to chat a bit of other things with her but my heart wasn't into it, and i finally made an excuse and disconnected from the chat.<br><br>That was then. From then until today, she did not smsed or called me, nor did she came online. It was a far cry from before, when hardly a day went by without contact. I did not attempted to make any form of contact myself, hoping everyday that she would call, that her words "out of sight, out of mind" was not meant for me to stop contacting her and put her out of my mind. But nothing so far...<br><br>I'm still feeling upset. It was not because she rejected me, since she has every right to do so and towards the exams, i was already bracing myself in case of a rejection. It was because this happened just when i was about to tell her that made it unbearable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">   Maybe that's why i'm writing out my story here. As i read icyprincess's story, i'm beginning to realise that maybe, i was in B's exact same shoes.<br><br>Icyprincess, i've always believed that girls are very perceptive creatures. If B really likes u, u will know and sense it. He may be in my shoes, trying to find a suitable time to express it. If u decided not to accept him, be nice in the rejection, don't just ignore him like u said u might do. It's better for him to know your true feelings, rather than letting him wonder what had happened to make u suddenly ignore him. If he had been nice to u, he at least deserved that. Take care.</div>
