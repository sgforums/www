            <div class='col-md body'>the thing is...he hasn't actually told me he likes me yet. He only does things that makes me think he likes me. Like he usually dun go out a lot but recently he has been 'attaching' himself to me on any outdoor activities...but bcos he hasn't told me yet...then i can't really reject him...if not he says I think too much, maybe he wants to be friends only after all...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ahh... this kind of stupid situation again!<br>I was trapped in this kind of situation before.<br>I told the person directly how i felt for him. I told him directly that " I like you more than a fren! what about you?" and, i got my answer...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>Guys, at this stage, are like more or less the same situation as gals. Nobody wants to declare their feelings for each other for fear of rejection. Its normal.<br>If you can't bear the fact of telling him face to face,   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  SMS or MSN him.<br>But, you must also keep in mind that after confessing your feelings to him, and that he replies that he likes you too(hopefully), nothing may comes out of the relationship too. As in, he may not be prepared to be in a relationship yet.<br>But, are you, in the first place too?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
