Waste $$ onli!!<br></div></blockquote>Yeah. Stocks aside. I've just idenified that yours is not really a 'study problem'. This course is more for your own future 'investment' / interest / personal upgrading.<br><br>Spending a few thousands dollars on a course within few months for someone who's earning $3000 a month and having to feed 6 people is indeed not a very wise choice. Especially when the course doesn't really provide value for money return, and he has a young daughter who might not be sensible enough to make good economical decision yet always against him..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
