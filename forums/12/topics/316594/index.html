I cant bear to imagine that the past few months everytime she turn on her laptop, she will be reminded of <br><br>her ex-bf and everytime before we even chat on msn, she will type in the password which will remind her of her ex-bf before me. she said she changed the pass <br><br>one week later after the incident. i didnt try myself to see whether she changed it though.<br>and there was this once she went for a camp. she was a station master with another guy. i was in school at that time and decided to find her. we talked a bit and <br><br>told her i wanna see her event but only from afar. well everything was going fine. the camp participants were very enthusiastic. it was when the group left when <br><br>things happened. i was sitting down from a higher level and all was clear view. she knew that too. the group of participants left and the other station master (guy) <br><br>started to playfully splash water at my gf. my gf than laugh and shout2 throwin back some water sending signals to the guy that it is an acceptable behaviour. <br><br>the guy started to playfuly chase my gf with water they both chase each other splashing water happily and laughing. after the pail of water finish. the guy and my <br><br>gf took one pail each. stand close to each other, talk2 than walk side by side out of my view to a toilet to refill water.all this happened with my gf knowing me <br><br>looking down at her. but she did came back and called me to ask where i am and found me with a dissapointed face. i mean is it me being jealous too easily or i <br><br>was right to be jealous? where do i draw the line? sumone help me please.</p></div>

              <p>my advice to you now is to play it cool like you don't give a darn to her. even if you're crying inside, just pretend like you don't care even if other guys **** her.</p>
              <p>the more you pamper and care for a girl, the more she'll want to search for other guys. it's like that.</p>
              <p>pretend to lose interest in her, dramatically reduce the number of times you see her etc. this will make her feel intrigued as to what happened to you and make her come back to you.</p>
              <p>basically, what you do is that you let her know that you're aware that she's having fun with other guys and using her ex-boyfriend's password etc., but keep the tone really cool(not sarcastic!)</p>
              <p>e.g:</p>
              <p>1) whoa! yesterday you went to pool to play with those hunks eh? so which part of your body they touch?</p>
              <p>hell, we can even have orgy together! 5 guys and you!</p>
              <p>(laugh naturally, loudly at this point)</p>
              <p>2) (laugh) he he! the laptop you use your ex-boyfriend's handphone no. ar? all numbers not really safe meh, must add in a bit of alphabets....how about combining his name into the password?</p>
              <p>basically, you get the meaning. just adapt it to your own situation since you know better.</p>
              <p>the core is there.</p>
              <p>you may think this method will let her have more chance with other guys....but think: if she really no reaction even if you ignore her etc., will she make a good wife in future? is this the kinda girl u want to marry and bring home to show your parents?</p>
              <p>given your current situation, you'll only add fuel to the fire if you quarrel with her or show more concern for her.</p>
              <p>remember that nice guys finish last. it's time to play the good jerk.</p>
              <p>the above method above will guarantee that her mind will start thinking "why he don't care about me?" and "how come his reaction like this one? he treat me as toy is it"?</p>
              <p>and what happens next? we see Smooth12 getting the last laugh in the end.</p>

              <p>very long post sia.. anyway, have more confidence in yourself, if she chose to be with you, have trust. if she's meant to go, she'll go..</p>
              <p>it's normal to feel jealous, but if you know her character before getting together with her is such, you've chosen her knowing that. so there's no way you should stop her being herself..</p>

              <p>wah.. so long nv see yun's post liao..</p>
              <p>anyway TS, you are jealous becoz u r insecure, about urself, about how she feels for u..</p>
              <p>communication and understanding between yourself and her is the most important thing to do and to maintain..</p>
              <p>constant communication will let you realise what kind of a girlfriend u are having now.. is she the social type? the inward type? the outgoing fun-loving type? what are her boundaries of normal male and female friends? male and female friends splash water, spend late night out, chat on fone, eat supper, are these things "ok" to her? where does she draw the line? if you know these boundaries, you will find that u will be less jealous..</p>
              <p>in fact, if u know all those boundaries, u will soon see your own boundaries clearly too.. and shud you [choi]break up[/choi], u will be able to find another girl who fits into ur boundaries well..</p>
              <p>its not a disease or a problem to be jealous.. jealousy is not a cause, it is a result of a cause.. and that cause is ur lack of knowledge of urself and ur other half..</p>
              <p>believe me.. once u know more about urself and her, ur jealousy will be gone..</p>
              <p>oh ya.. my passwords and i mean like 90%, is the name of my best female friend of 5 yrs.. and when my gf of 3yrs 1st knew of it, she was like "huh", bin chao chao.. but after that she knew that me and the female fren are really just damn good friends.. so ok lo..</p>

              we merely justify this feeling as a result of some external events that we did
              not how to resolve or interpret emotionally, hence we classify it as jealousy.
              There isn't an absolute line to draw, other than independent self regulation to
              minimize feeling crappy. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The password thing, imho, is completely nonsense.
              CloUdiSm classify it as symbolic jealousy, where people are affected because
              they compose meaning to an act or behavior that by itself has no other
              implication other than its functional meaning. You unconsciously suspect that
              there 'must' be something going on within her, since she is using her ex-bf
              mobile number, but hell, that probably represents none of your speculation. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What happens is that you are likely: </span></p>

              wear a stern face and go through the camp as if the world owes her a great

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Everyone generally suffers various degree of jealousy

              that some people believed that it only manifest through triggering from the
              external environment - but the truth is that it's almost 100% an inside job.
              Jealousy is a self demon - the people around you cannot feel the intensity of your
              emotion, unlike anger or fear, and it is often insidious. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Like some hideous phantasmal forces, it feeds on your
              gnawing inferiority, gaining strength as your self esteem fades from the lack
              of holistic understanding in love. If you want to work on 'jealousy', you got
              to work on your insecurity - by patching the emotional vulnerabilities that
              allow this 'demonic emotions' to exploit your inner self. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The causes of insecurity are myriad and it isn't easy
              to pinpoint the exact root; even more arduous to implement changes. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But I will just leave you with a simple thought to

              but you have every span of control to prevent yourself from pushing love away.
              Ironically, most people understood this only when they understood regret.
              Perhaps enlightenment and regret is but two side of the coin, derived from the
              same product. </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>

              a thing as the prerogative to be jealous; we merely justify this
              feeling as a result of some external events that we did not how to
              resolve or interpret emotionally, hence we classify it as jealousy.
              There isn't an absolute line to draw, other than independent self
              regulation to minimize feeling crappy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The password thing,
              imho, is completely nonsense. CloUdiSm classify it as symbolic
              jealousy, where people are affected because they compose meaning to
              an act or behavior that by itself has no other implication other
              than its functional meaning. You unconsciously suspect that there
              'must' be something going on within her, since she is using her
              ex-bf mobile number, but hell, that probably represents none of
              your speculation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What happens is that you

              person. </span></p>
