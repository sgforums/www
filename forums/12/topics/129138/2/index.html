They are saying that if you want to be subsidized, then you should be prepared to accept sacrifices. In this case, it means you have to put family life on hold. There! Its a pretty open policy!<br><br>And how is it gender discrimination if they pose the same qn to both genders?<br><br>However, i want to emphasize that to say that it is a transparent and open policy is not to say that i agree with the policy.
