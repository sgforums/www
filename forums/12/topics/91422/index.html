Afterall...he chose to love you among the rest of his ex-females. Think of it this way, if he really wants to do some hanky-panky stuff behind your back...there is absolutely nothing you can do about it even if you are feeling insecure and worried about it. If you really like/love him, you will want him to be happy too right? If he chose to be happy with any of the other girls, then I feel that you should let him do what he wants and be happy about it. I believe you would prefer him to be happy than feeling frustrated by your insecurities. If he like/love you, then he will not do anything to betray your feelings for him. If he tries to push his luck and take advantage of your patience for him, then there might just be a day when your patience will runs out and you will realised that you don't love him anymore. If that kind of day ever arrives, then I will tell you that it is time for you to let him go and go and seek your own happiness...cos there is no more reason left in you to stay with him as his gf anymore.<br><br>This is what I always thought whenever I felt insecure...so I hope that it will be useful for you as well. Hmm...whatever it is, always find a way to make yourself happy...cos there is no meaning in living a life if you are unable to seek out a way to your own happiness. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

This force jealousy to poison you indirectly and weakens you ability to hang onto the relationship and makes you wanna give up your relationship because of this.<br><br>If you noticed, the cusp of the problem lies with you, not him. If you are saying that because of his personality, he flirts around - that will be another issue altogether. But because he is just being himself, this characteristic of him has already been there since Day One when you knew him. So this is a classic case of the Seventh Love Law: Love brings up everything, unlike itself - where you are forced to face with unpleasant issues you didn't realise/felt it doesn't matter in the beginning.<br><br><strong>You NEED to grow from your flaws and evolve your mindset</strong>. Please note that IF HE WANTS TO LEAVE, he will leave <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IRREGRARDLESS of whether there is another girl or not</span>. Because you see him as an emotional dependancy and whenever that 'him' seemed to disappear with another woman who you felt that she could have see him as an emotional dependancy as well, you are violently shakened and couldn't find an alternative source to hold on. Why feel this way when in the first place, this personality of his is defintely part of the subconscious factor why you would fall for him.<br><br>No confidence in yourself equates no confidence for the relationship. When you do practice the importance of respecting personal space, understand the theory as well. If not, it's time to have a good private talk with him and let him know, so that both of you can adapt and compromise with one another.<br><br>P.S: Relationship is a bond with another person - so learn to speak and don't keep things inside. Are you a Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bottomline is the way you both handle and see relationships with the opposite sex might be different. don't bottle up such feelings. talk to him. there is nothing wrong with "feeling werid" cos maybe his actions toward those gers are not reassuring enough for you. don't kid yourself into believing that maybe you will wake up one day and be able to accept all these, love is not that powerful lah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Well.. At least in a certain sense..?<br><br>Your respect for his freedom and decision on not to interfere with his private life is mature in its thinking...<br><br>However, you still can talk to him about it.. Be careful to put it in proper words and notes though especially if he's a sensitive guy? Just let him know how you feel... Let him understand that your objective is not for him to change but just to communicate with him...<br><br>For I believe you DO LOVE him... And a love relationship involves much of a RESPECT (for his private life and freedom?) and also SHARING... (just to let him know how you feel...) As long as you don't let your emotions overwhelm and trap him.. You're probably in a rather safe zone... Let him know... Talk to him about it... It'll probably makes you feel better... And if done in a right tone, it should be better for the situation too (whichever direction it might steer towards..)<br><br>COMMUNICATION is IMPORTANT...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

She thinks people think and talk about her<br>&gt;             only about good things and often disappoint to know the fact<br>&gt;             that they are not true and not even  real,   so she will feel<br>&gt;             hurt. She think her path has to be a beautiful one. She   think<br>&gt;             only good things so she prepares and always make arrangement<br>&gt;             for   herself to be in the right path always, quite systematic<br>&gt;             indeed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             If there is no guy in her life, she will be busy with herself.<br>&gt;             This seemingly ordinary woman will push herself to meet her<br>&gt;             goal. Her face mostly will be slim and long, high cheek bone,<br>&gt;             Eye brow slightly curve up, slight tall more than short, thin<br>&gt;             lips and she will have quite a confusing or   mixture of<br>&gt;             character. Sometimes, she will be very careful about guy she<br>&gt;             will mingle with. She thinks as if she has a main CPU in her<br>&gt;             head and she could memorize   everything from her childhood.<br>&gt;             When she faces with problems, she will   handle   them and<br>&gt;             solving them very well, and at the same time showing other<br>&gt;             people   that she has that capability. She can put her mind in<br>&gt;             solving problems in   crisis better than many other Zodiac.<br>&gt;             Once she determine to do thing,   nothing will stop her.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;              Woman in this Zodiac could be totally different from one woman<br>&gt;             to another   woman. You could see her in the party dancing like<br>&gt;             flash dance or dirty   dancing, as well you could also see her<br>&gt;             as an old fashion lady or a geek.   She could be someone flashy<br>&gt;             and wanted by many men, or she could be a  cold   and<br>&gt;             non-social person. She will have her own way to win you over.<br>&gt;             Once  she   choose you, she will need to be proud of you.<br>&gt;             "Love" is not as important to her as "Marriage". Her real goal<br>&gt;             in life is   "Safety" and her position in other people sight<br>&gt;             need to be "Secure". She plans her life, and socially life<br>&gt;             easily and very carefully. She is also very artistic and<br>&gt;             realistic, so if you are a nobody or nothing, no chance<br>&gt;             because she loves ambition and a good life. She need lots of<br>&gt;             love,but do   not   want and do not belief in an occasional or<br>&gt;             unconventional love.      She is a proud in nature type, so if<br>&gt;             you see a woman in this Zodiac come from a poor family, she<br>&gt;             will act like a woman from a noble family by  birth   anyway<br>&gt;             (certainly there are always exception).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             She always look cool even when she is not. She like to make<br>&gt;             people see her as "secure and  confident"   even she is a mixed<br>&gt;             emotion and mixed character type. If she is mad, you   can<br>&gt;             tell right away and she can stay moody for quite a long time.<br>&gt;             You never have all her times, for she likes to work hard and<br>&gt;             also spent   some   spare times working for charity. You will<br>&gt;             see woman in this zodiac a   "Volunteer" for camp, and if she<br>&gt;             is in a high society, she will most  likely   be a president or<br>&gt;             a V.P. of a "Club". She is a romantic and artistic, but   being<br>&gt;             poor and unstable is certainly not in her dreams. Her beautiful<br>&gt;             imaginations need to be realistic, for failure is not in her<br>&gt;             plan.      A Goat always climb high, so either she start from a<br>&gt;             low point or a high   point, she will make sure at the end she<br>&gt;             will have the best spot. She  will   not show her ambition, but<br>&gt;             she will show that she satisfy with herself  now.   Once you<br>&gt;             look back she already moved up again , quietly but sure.  If<br>&gt;             she is your love one, be supportive and understand her. She is<br>&gt;             stubborn, but she will listen. She will act like a gentle<br>&gt;             fragile person,but in  fact   she can stick you down like a<br>&gt;             super glue without you knowing it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;             LIBRA MAN<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             A man who has no balance like his Zodiac symbol. He is not the<br>&gt;             gentle,  cool   , calm and charming guy like what you see. He<br>&gt;             has another dark side of   aggression, stubborn and he likes to<br>&gt;             start an argument the most.  Sometimes   he can be so depress<br>&gt;             and unstable. Up and down like he is trying to  balance<br>&gt;             himself most of the time.      To many people, he is a friendly<br>&gt;             guy and always smile even when he is mad   or   up set. His<br>&gt;             voice always gentle and calm. he always set and comb his hair<br>&gt;             as   if he comes out from a shampoo advertisement. Mostly Libra<br>&gt;             men are good   looking, even the ugly one is charming. When he<br>&gt;             smiles, it is so bright   that   the whole world is smiling<br>&gt;             with him too.      When he is in a balance mood, he is the type<br>&gt;             of person you want to be  with.   In other unbalancing mood, he<br>&gt;             likes to make people argue about something   and   watching it<br>&gt;             with fascination and fun.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             He will wait to be the one who   compromise and clear thing up.<br>&gt;             He likes to be in a conflicting   conversation.      Libra man<br>&gt;             is lazy by nature. After his tired day at work, he likes to sit<br>&gt;             still and just look out of the window or read quietly. He likes<br>&gt;             to be in   his   own world. After recharging his battery, he<br>&gt;             will be very energetic again   and   may even take you out that<br>&gt;             night.      Libra man normally will not do any shocking or<br>&gt;             abnormal things to be   noticed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             He likes to be conformed with his crowd, but if you watch him<br>&gt;             carefully, you will see the different. If he wear a shirt, it<br>&gt;             will have  to   be a zipper front instead of buttons, or a<br>&gt;             special tie bar. There is  always   something in him that he<br>&gt;             will not allow totally conformity to take him   over.      A<br>&gt;             straight forward , no non-sense guy. He is careful and delicate<br>&gt;             in   details. He will spent extra time to doing it right, than<br>&gt;             comes back to   correct them later. He hates people who boost,<br>&gt;             or exaggerate. He does not   like over dressed woman or make<br>&gt;             herself a center of an attention.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             He loves to read. He loves poems and loves art. When he works<br>&gt;             he can work   like crazy, but after work he can turn on<br>&gt;             romantic jazzy music and treat   you   so gently. He loves to<br>&gt;             give people advice and normally give a good  advice.   If you<br>&gt;             fall for him, you will stay like being trapped in a spider web.<br>&gt;             If   you want to break up with him, he will persuade you a<br>&gt;             zillion ways to  stay   and you can not stop him anyway. After<br>&gt;             he persuade you to stay, or after  a   big fight, he will be so<br>&gt;             sweet to you as if he has never hurt your  feeling   before<br>&gt;             ever.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             He will has his own way to win a girl love and affection. Once<br>&gt;             she says   yes,   he will lay back and wonder if he should go<br>&gt;             on or if he should back out.  In   his teen, he changed many<br>&gt;             girl friends because he can not clearly  separate   loving a<br>&gt;             friend and loving a girl friend. He will check and re-cheek if<br>&gt;             his   match is suitable and compatible with him.      Even he<br>&gt;             is a romantic man, he can hardly understand the emotion of the<br>&gt;             one   he loves. He is a generous guy even he sets his life so<br>&gt;             systematically.  He   never knows when he makes you unhappy. He<br>&gt;             never knows how he up set you.  He   will never knows what he<br>&gt;             said wrong. If he is your lover, be prepare for   this.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             A not so pretty girl with no brain is not his type of woman. If<br>&gt;             you are  not   pretty enough, he will not mind talking to you<br>&gt;             but he does not care to  get   to know you. Any girls, pretty<br>&gt;             or ugly can ask for his help, he will be   happy to help. He<br>&gt;             hates to argue by yelling at each other, so you tend to   see<br>&gt;             he argue with his girl friend seriously but try at best to be<br>&gt;             very   quiet.      He likes to have a girl friend by getting to<br>&gt;             know each other like a  friend   first. If you want him, you<br>&gt;             have to like the same thing he does. He  prefers   a pretty and<br>&gt;             gentle woman than a smart and ugly woman. You have to<br>&gt;             understand his mood especially he can has many different moods.<br>&gt;             He is a   private person, so when he needs to be alone better<br>&gt;             let him be.</div>

Well, being jealous is one thing.. Everyone do get jealous.. but is how much you show.. and how much faith and trust you put in him..<br><br>Be more confident in yourself.. and in him.. and in this r/s.. Believe in yourself.. if he's those guys who are easily succumb over.. then this goes to show how much he put his effort in this r/s and wat kind of person he is..<br><br>Don't worry! It's ok.. you jus need the security and dun be inferior! Maybe if you realyl dun like it.. Tell him.. at least let him know that you dun feel good about it.. not that you dun wan to let him go out with them.. you jus feel awkward.. or ask him to bring you along..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
