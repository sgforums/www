            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys,<br><br>I've been together with my current stead for abt 6 mths already. During the second month, i did sth that i knew i shouldnt have done. I really regret it alot now. I went out wif a girl and the gal held hands with me. Its not really as in hold hand. She juz held onto my arm. But i didn't do anything.<br><br>I remember telling my stead that she did hold my hand. And hugged me at the end when i was taking cab. but she insistefd that i didn't tell her. She also say that i lie to her and she doesn't even want to talk to me now.<br><br>Since yesterday night when i send her home, she have been ignoring me until today. All the smses i send her, she only replied 8 or 9 smses. Cuz of my remedial today, i couldn't goto her school and wait for her to finish school. Therefore, after my remedial, i went to her house and waited for her.<br><br>In the beginning, when i told her that i was going to her house, she say dun need. Shes already at home. Then when i reached her house downstairs, she said that she is not at home and ask me to "GO HOME!". After that, i knew that she was at home. Then, i stayed downstairs and she came down with her mom.<br><br>In the end, i had to run. I ran into the lift and went up to 12 storey. Then i told her that i will wait for her. But ask her not to be afraid cuz no one will see me there. She keep on asking me to "GO HOME ! I DUN WANNA SEE YOU !". I say that i will continue waiting for her even if she feels that i'm irritating.<br><br>Then all of a sudden, she smsed me and say that "GO HOME LARX.. i also neber say going to break wif you.. GO LAR !". Then i had no choice but to go home. I dunno whether does she realli mean it or wad. But.. until now.. I call her, she hang up. I sms her she never reply. I msg her in MSN, she also never reply.<br><br>I really do not know what to do and our six month anniversary is coming soon. I really treasure this relationship alot and hope that she will forgive me. Can anyone tell me what to do ?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Mark</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>uh...i'm sorry but... u really dun have to do all that. she's gonna be put of by it and if she does forgive u thru your "actions", its out of pity not out of forgiveness. Yea she's pissed but u dun have to go to that extent. All u need to do is let her know you're sorry sincerely and that you only have eyes for her. Doing those kinda crazy things show you're obsessive, freaky, insane, loony, nuts and would really really scare some people away.<br><br>first of all. why did u let her hold on to you? were u crossin the road? was a herd of bulls running past her? was she going to fall over a ten km cliff? u know what i'm driving at don't you. yea some girls find u irresistable and all but u should know better to gently nudge her away instead of letting her hang on. next. if she's a really good friend, she should know you're attached and just keep her hands to herself. about the hug, i do get hugs from friends(girls) from time to time irregardless of whether either of us are attached. but if your girl is the type that gets jealous at the sight of u smiling at a girl, please... either u tell your gf to grow up or just stop huggin them. i'm sure your gf will be ok with a handshake(which is also a sign of friendship)<br><br>girls get jealous at these sorta things so you should be expecting that kinda reaction from your girlfriend. even if u did tell her all that, the most is she'll take a bit longer to realise she needs to get jealous. but the thing is. if she really likes you, she'll forgive u eventually as long as u show you are genuinely sorry and have truly given your heart to her.<br><br>she'll forgive you in a few days time but in the meanwhile...just show you're sorry..not that you're a loony<br><br></div>

During the second month, i did sth that i knew i shouldnt have done. I really regret it alot now. I went out wif a girl and the gal held hands with me. Its not really as in hold hand. She juz held onto my arm. But i didn't do anything.<br><br>I remember telling my stead that she did hold my hand. And hugged me at the end when i was taking cab. but she insistefd that i didn't tell her. She also say that i lie to her and she doesn't even want to talk to me now.<br><br>Since yesterday night when i send her home, she have been ignoring me until today. All the smses i send her, she only replied 8 or 9 smses. Cuz of my remedial today, i couldn't goto her school and wait for her to finish school. Therefore, after my remedial, i went to her house and waited for her.<br><br>In the beginning, when i told her that i was going to her house, she say dun need. Shes already at home. Then when i reached her house downstairs, she said that she is not at home and ask me to "GO HOME!". After that, i knew that she was at home. Then, i stayed downstairs and she came down with her mom.<br><br>In the end, i had to run. I ran into the lift and went up to 12 storey. Then i told her that i will wait for her. But ask her not to be afraid cuz no one will see me there. She keep on asking me to "GO HOME ! I DUN WANNA SEE YOU !". I say that i will continue waiting for her even if she feels that i'm irritating.<br><br>Then all of a sudden, she smsed me and say that "GO HOME LARX.. i also neber say going to break wif you.. GO LAR !". Then i had no choice but to go home. I dunno whether does she realli mean it or wad. But.. until now.. I call her, she hang up. I sms her she never reply. I msg her in MSN, she also never reply.<br><br>I really do not know what to do and our six month anniversary is coming soon. I really treasure this relationship alot and hope that she will forgive me. Can anyone tell me what to do ?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Mark</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You must be very young.<br><br>Went out with girl, nothing wrong.<br><br>Even if she held your arm - nothing wrong. (Seriously)<br><br>Then she hug you. I still don't see what's the big hoo-haa about it.<br><br>And the craze thing is that you actually told your gf about it - like you held her hands, etc.<br><br>If there is one thing you have to learn from this it would be this: You only tell her if you are feeling gulity about things - if you percieve this scenario by not betraying her emotionally (which is to fall for her) and that all the physical thingy is merely act of good friendship - there's no need to mention anything. <strong>There is a good difference between censoring of information and telling a lie</strong>. Telling a lie means being questioned and you replied with UNTRUTH. Censoring simply means not initiating to convey.<br><br>It can be your best friend, your god-sister, your friends's gf or any other girl in your social network. By mentioning any form of physical thingy you had in words (both written or expressed) to your gf, you are out of your mind. You are not a girl; you will never imagine the power of jealousy that exist in every girl. These amount of energy is enough to destroy themselves and wrack much havoc in your life to call for mercy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>
