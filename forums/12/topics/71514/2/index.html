What i tell you is going to really hurt.<br><br>You really abused her trust from the thing that you did, even if its just holding arms with another gal.  Just put yourself in her shoes.  If she told you one day that she's been going out with this guy and just holding his arm, how would you take it?<br><br>Seriously, if she's not going to give you a 2nd chance, its totally because you don't deserve it at all.  If you can bluff her once, chances is it'll happen again.  102%.<br><br>Trust doesn't take 6 months to build up, it takes eternity.  And it takes only a moment of folly to ruin it all.
