            <div class='col-md body'>From my perspective, I would think that being a couple, communication is really important. Should you really be concerned about this, I would think that both of you need to sit down and discuss over issues. This way, you can relate to each other better and understand thinking and thoughts. No one is a mind guesser u know<br><br>Its not always easy to open up to each other when it comes to discussing issues because there are consequences, but the more both party bottle up, the more unhealthy the relationship is going to be.. who knows.. maybe ur gf has her own unhappiness as well, but she dare not voice it out ?<br><br>Whatever it is, its just an advice and my personal opinions, the decision maker is urself..

In simple, it just meant that the more you do something, the return will be less gradually.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Analogy: When you are thirsty and you drink your first cup of water, you get the most satisfaction. The more you drink, the satisfaction get less.<br><br>What I meant is that the daily sms you are giving is becoming a rountine spell on her, therefore she wouldn't reply you at all, because it probably polite on your part and she accepted it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Busy with your own life is important - you must have life outside your crush. However, on my personal opinon - once per two weeks is far too subtle to have major effect on her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If I were to break it down for you:<br><br>Total hours in 12 days - 336<br>Once meeting in fornight probably would last only average of 4 - 6 hours? Ok, presuming its 5 hours.<br><br>5/336 * 100% = 1.4%<br><br>Thats far too little and considering the long break in between, you could hardly do much and if competition steps in, you would probably lose, in terms of this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>My suggestion is if its within your means, try dating her once (minimum) every week. As for calling, if conversation can go well, its ok to call. (you don't call someone to have dead conversation do you?). And you will benefit greatly if communication is comfortable, easy-going and natural.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: : You must advance steadily. You can't move five steps forward and one step back. You must keep a continous flow towards the girl of your dream. If not, she may lose her interest and turn her attention elsewhere. Not asking you to rush (there is only a fine line difference between hasty and good tactical move) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this seems the situation b4 me and my gf breakup.....<br>dun sms too much. like yunhaier say, the law.<br><br>more preferably, u 2 should meet often. chat over the phone so as to know each other more. if u think u might be disrupting her lifestyle, disturbing her, it seems like the beginning of the end.<br><br>any competition that sets in would have knock u complete off ground. if u truly love her and wanna be with her, spend more time with her. call her to show her that u really miss her.<br><br>i loathe sms now though i still use it. but going abt using it to express my care and concern to a ger i like is complete useless. best is to call, a sweet few seconds of "i miss u" can do more trick then a stupid sms....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is futile to find a perfect combination of sms/call/date.  What works for one girl may not work for the other.  What works now may not work later.  It is a constant effort to keep each other happy.<br><br>What is most disturbing is that she used to respond well to your smses, but now does not.  First thing that comes to mind is that - she's sian liao.<br><br>Honestly, if a girl likes you she will be happy whether you call or sms or watever.  If she finds that you're too buggy or not calling enough, she will complain and expect you to act according to her feedback.  So instead of just worrying, why don't you either -  sound her out and ask if she's happy with your attentions, or change tactics like calling more instead of sms.</div>

NOT with your gf... Even a BGR not properly maintained could be lost, less to mention for a courtship...<br><br>What is 'enough'? Enough for her to stay interested in you? Enough to help her remember of your existence? Or enough for her to become your gf? Very much dependent on your life style and yours, an appropriate 'meet up &amp; contact' schedule could be worked out... ALSO, based on the kinda character she has... You can form your activities ranging from routine to 'special' (non-routine activities)..... An example of such has been proposed to you in Yunhaier's reply.... You can formulate something like that according to the points I've mentioned earlier...<br><br>Another reminder which I would like to add...? I'm not sure of the details... But exactly how is she feeling for you? Do you know? It's nice of you to be able to keep up to the 'faith' and love for her.... Really.... But without proper order of reception from her side, this can easily be a 'blind faith', 'one way relationship' or simply not going nowhere kinda situation.... Just for your actions to be justified... Because it's pretty COMMON  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  for people to start crying out "why she don't love me or appreciate me after ALL that I've done for her?".... Some even cursing the other party.... So know where you'll be landing before you decide to jump ok?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
