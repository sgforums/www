Therefore, I still love you...<br>And love doesn't need a reason.<br></div></blockquote>Be what you wrote a joke or a reality, it is'nt funny.<br><br>If you really love someone, you would be able to say why... just have to think for a few mins and contemplate over what is it that makes you happy when you're with her...<br><br>Here's a tip for you... btw girls love reassurance... they want to feel wanted and loved... so they will always ask such questions to reassure themselves...<br><br>How to test if a guy really loves you.... for guys &amp; girls<br><br>The best way to test his affection and devotion of love towards you is to ask him/her these 3 questions; a guy/girl who has given serious thought about you, the guy/girl of his/her dreams... supposely that is, he/she would be able to answer these them with ease.<br><br>Here goes...<br><br>Question 1) What do you like/ love about me? And why? (Okay this must be with body, mind and spirit along with a heart moving substantiation, this is a time for him to score points by having conviction in his tone of voice, a little of affection would help, but ultimately its the answers he gives and whether you will be satisfied with them)?<br>*hint to guys* watch more korea series! So farny, are some of the answers the playwright comes up with, but damn good! The epiphany in life! So for <span style="color: red;">Joshua1975</span>, please go watch some Korea series and memories the lines when the lead actress ask the guy why you love me...<br><br>Question 2) Tell me how well you know me_ (This is a very open-end question, up to him what he wants to say but should be something that touches your heart and not<br>just blabber)<br>*hint to guys* Remember the special occassions, ie first kiss and first date you went with her is quite impt, places of significance to the both of you... Its really true, pls try to remember <span style="color: orange;">Joshua1975</span><br><br>Question 3) What are your feelings towards me? (Warning! A guy cannot just say I love you for this question! It should be an honest thoughtful emotional saying and<br>feeling)<br>*hint to guys* Well, up to you if you wanna be truthful. Remember honest is always the best policy. But, then again if you want to lie, please practice out loud, look into the mirror and practice! <span style="color: brown;">Joshua1975</span>, you might need to practice... ALOT!<br><br>*hint for girls* If he does not respond to these questions with ease and takes him the whole night trying to answer one question, then he has not given you a deep and serious thought, which most guys dun do, unless they really do love the person then they would have asked themselves these questions when they were with you...<br><br></div>
