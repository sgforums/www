            <div class='col-md body'>Put it to you simply.. he want the cake and he wants to eat it.  ie best of both worlds<br>How do you tell he is sincere in patching back? By breaking off and repenting he's done wrong.<br>He's still calling China ... what does it tell you about his actions and intents. His behaviour indicates he does not want to work out his problems and sorta expect you to accept that he is playing around. Your actions is condoneing him.<br><br>Don't be fooled.<br>Can you bring your kids and move out to relatives and cool down. Think carefully what you want next. Because he betrayed your trust and the marriage. I know its more complicated than that but you have to think for yourself and the kids.  U will be emotionally hurt and abused and you will become so bitter it will be hard even to continue.<br><br>One question: can you live on your own and support your kids?<br><br>I am not experienced in this matters but I know this site where quite a number of them had personnally lived through these cases. Some divorced and are happy, some managed to pull together... But it all depends on situation. Reference these people's help if you need.<br><br><a href="http://groups.msn.com/womenchannel/love.msnw" rel="nofollow">http://groups.msn.com/womenchannel/love.msnw</a><br><br>if you are looking for help and support... I am telling you straight. This forum has limited power to help. We can listen to you vent and lend you some support, ultimately. You need professional help and you need someone to be there for you all the way.<br>And finally: This is going to be a very difficult, very straining and very testing time for you.<br><br>I am sad for you situation.

His phone/sms fantasy won't last him for long.<br><br>Continue to love him as much as you usually does, in fact...love him even more than usual. You will need to work on his guilty conscience to make him change. Be nice to him...very nice, so nice that he will feel guilty to you and so nice that he might love you again. So nice that he will not bear to leave you for another.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Pretend you didn't know about his affair or ignore it for the sake of your children. It's sad but there is no need to show him that you are depressed over his affair.<br><br>It's especially easy to bring him back to you again if you are dead sure that he still loves you deep inside his heart. As long as he is able to feel guilty to you, you have already won the battle. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Plan some outing with him and the children...make some occasional comments about some make-up scenarios of married guys having an affair outside. Do not dwell on those comments, say and forget. Do not make it so obvious that he might suspect that you knew that he was having an affair.<br><br>The only way to maintain a marriage is to prevent cracks. So letting him know that you knew about his affair is definitely a no no. Man provide for after a  marriage but Woman protect and maintain the marriage.<br><br>Good luck and I hope that you will be able to preserve your marriage to your fullest for the sake of your children.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Mild phase:</span><br><br>Tell him if he really loves you and the 2 kids, then go for the family counselling with you. Do not let them drag on the relationship just like that, high chance is that it won't be broken off just like that. Time is a factor AGAINST YOU in this instance.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Control phase:</span><br><br>Cut your contact with that woman and especially the woman's with your husband at the same time. If your husband says give them 'some time', buy a date. After that, he should know to keep his words. If he don't, both of you would know that he just couldn't contain it.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Fierce phase:</span><br><br>As you've mentioned that you've got the upper hand in terms of finance. Cut off his phone line and the mode in which he contacts her. Meaning find out what means and sources he has of contacting the girl and terminate them once and for all. But note that this act might just backfire and get him pissed off. So be careful when doing so. After having done the above, furnish him by filling his time up. Spend more QUALITY TIME as a FAMILY TOGETHER. Go out often together and do things AS A FAMILY.<br><br>PS. Let him understand that things are not going to go right if continued in that direction. It's either bury the past and start afresh or divorce?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Xprobe,<br><br>Thank you for your help. Sorry for my late reply<br><br>From the information I gathered, this girl live in Cheng Du. She is working as a waitress at her brother steamboat shop. Understand from my husband, she get a small share, however, all money are control by her sister-in-law. But I don't believe she any share in the business, as her is not happy because she cannot get the money she wanted from this sister-in-law. She is find chances to start a fashion shop in Cheng Du.<br><br>Also, this girl is divorced and has a 14 years old son. However, the child stay with her husband. Xproble, what are the rule in China if the child don't stay with the mother, does she need to give money every month to he/her?<br><br>This girl also gamble (MJ) very big, he said 1 week at lest 4 times. But will give up this habit after knowing him. I don't believe, as I saw some SMS that she is continuing the habit behind his back.<br><br>I also believe this girl is after his money, and she had find out his background. She knows very well that his money source is from me, therefore, the main reason why she asked him not to divorce so as not to break the road.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey.. i'm not married, but really, from the story and advice, i think you really need to show him who's the boss. do you want this marriage to continue? if yes, u still need to show him that you will not allow this continue - or else he will!!!<br>like someone said, take your children and stay somewhere else. cut him off from everything u've given him. let him suffer, then he'll know what the china woman is good for.</div>

Then, if he wants $ and he wants to give it to the Chee-na, then he give from his own pocket. Why should you even support his behaviour by giving him $.<br><br>if you have shared account, you better check. If you leave your account books around, it time you keep them. If he has his passport around, you also need to keep it. You better safe guard yourself and your funds before the Cheena manage to get her hands through manipulation tactics on your husband and you end up with zero cash, zero savings, zero marriage, 2 kids and no one with you.  Do not for one moment believe your husband is strong, if he was, he would have seen through the ploy.<br></div>
