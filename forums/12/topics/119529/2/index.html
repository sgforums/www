Sorry for my late reply<br><br>From the information I gathered, this girl live in Cheng Du. She is working as a waitress at her brother steamboat shop. Understand from my husband, she get a small share, however, all money are control by her sister-in-law. But I don't believe she any share in the business, as her is not happy because she cannot get the money she wanted from this sister-in-law. She is find chances to start a fashion shop in Cheng Du.<br><br>Also, this girl is divorced and has a 14 years old son. However, the child stay with her husband. Xproble, what are the rule in China if the child don't stay with the mother, does she need to give money every month to he/her?<br><br>This girl also gamble (MJ) very big, he said 1 week at lest 4 times. But will give up this habit after knowing him. I don't believe, as I saw some SMS that she is continuing the habit behind his back.<br><br>I also believe this girl is after his money, and she had find out his background. She knows very well that his money source is from me, therefore, the main reason why she asked him not to divorce so as not to break the road.</div></blockquote>Wah liao, a bit complicated with this one. First of all, if she is Szechuan girl and not working in KTV, then a bit worrisome because Szechuan girls are much less materialistic than others. Plus the fact that she has a 14yr old son makes her least attractive to any local suitors.<br><br>No wonder she keeps on with your husband even knowing his situation and such.<br><br>So, the only point of attack is to threaten to talk to her family or go to her son's school to talk to his teacher to make her back off. These are the pressure points. But, you have to understand that the real problem is with your husband. Maybe tell him what your son has told you about family warmth and all that and ask him if he thinks that woman's son will think so highly of him than his own blood and flesh.<br><br></div>

Please collect all evidence and receipts that can prove his affairs - bank statements, bills and whatever prove. Divorce is not that easy to go through.  In addition, you need to prove your ability to support your kids. Monitor everything carefully and do not just be soft hearted and give in if he "promise" anything. He must mean it and want to come back and have to work hard to win your trust. Do not condone him again! Do not let him off so easily cause he will do it again and again to you if he can get off lightly.<br><br>Please go to banks and if there is shared accountms, change them to accounts that needs both party to sign before he can get the $. Safe guard your $$$, house and whatever you can get. Most men are not going to be kind to ex-wives.<br><br>If you want to file for divorce, please find as much info as possible and don't wait till last minute:<br><br><a href="http://www.familycourtofsingapore.gov.sg/processes/apply_divorce.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.familycourtofsingapore.gov.sg/processes/apply_divorce.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.law.com.sg/family.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.com.sg/family.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/html/awareness/custody&amp;maintenance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/html/awareness/custody&amp;maintenance.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.divorce.com.sg/page2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.divorce.com.sg/page2.html</a><br><br><a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/html/awareness/divorce.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/html/awareness/divorce.htm</a><br><br></div>

Its time for action.<br>Don't short change yourself with a man who cares about himself and his mistress.<br><br>Once you intend to file for divorce. Do not talk to him yourself or he will record them down and state you are unsound of mind or whatever and use it against you. If he want to speak, speak through the lawyers. Unless there is court order, he shall not see your kids. Unless it is supervised meeting, you two shall never meet alone outside. Do not relent cause by doing this, it will save guard you against a lot of slander and whatever crap he and the mistress can imagine up and shoot you down.<br><br>I know it is hard. It will be hard down the road, thus you will need to find support and help. we know you are only human and will definitely be sad and disappointed like your heart is a million pieces. Its hard to put it back together...<br><br><a href="http://www.subcourts.gov.sg/family/processes/gen_info_pamphlets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.subcourts.gov.sg/family/processes/gen_info_pamphlets.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.imh.com.sg/patient_education/depression.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.imh.com.sg/patient_education/depression.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.ncss.org.sg/ncss/social_services/social_service_home.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncss.org.sg/ncss/social_services/social_service_home.asp</a><br><br><a href="http://www.ncss.org.sg/documents/Managing_transistions.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncss.org.sg/documents/Managing_transistions.pdf</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by schui:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Mistyblue,<br><br>Thank you for all your help and information.<br><br>I had told him to get the paper done if you wanted a divorce, as I do not wish to pay a single cent on  the lawyer fees. He will need to come out with the money.<br><br>As for the children, he know he will loss them, as I more financial sound then him, as he is not holding any stable job.<br><br>As for the houses, has found out that our five room flat will make a huge loss if he going to sell it. Had checked all lossess will be 50-50. therefore, there nothing he can get from the sale of the flat as he may need to top up the losses. As for me, I can afford to buy a 3 room flat with the children after paying the losses.<br><br>As the whole, I will be at a win situation if I divorce. However, it going to be very hard for my son to accept it, as he still do not wish for us to go for a divorce. And that is the main reason why, I'm handling on to this marriage. </div></blockquote>Ok here's the deal.<br><br>If , if a better guy comes alone and you husband out of spite did not divorce you.<br>Then you want to continue on.. but you are stuck.. by law its not allowed.<br>Then if you decide to ignore the law... you can be charged and instead he can sue you back.<br><br>Its best to have a clean and clear cut. Make sure he go through whatever divorce proceedings. Don't wait and dally. Having a clean cut also frees you up to clean up the slate once and for all, and its a chance to start anew.<br><br>However, assure your son that both parents love him no less, its just that you two can no longer stay together. And explain with an analogy close to him.<br>EG:<br>He has a friend. They are suppose to work together in this project.<br>But his friend secretly work with another person in their project. But the friend keep taking resources, money, materials from your son for his own project.<br>And the friend keep ignoring your son when you son ask him to come back.<br>You son was working on this project on his own without the friend help and was even willing to forgive the friend's bad behaviour.<br>But the friend also break your son's heart when the friend created a brand new project, and decided to not be friend with your son but instead choose new friend over him.<br><br>Its difficult to adjust to changes but give it time.</div>

Alot of singaporean wives face the competition from China woman.<br><br>again and again, it's always the china woman. I must agree that they have a way to handle man and make the man feel that they really love him and its not for the money.<br><br>well since you've already decided to file for a divorce. Pls File against him fro adultery. u have the prove of him committing adultery. so take the prove and file that against him. with that, you can claim alot more alimony as wel las to claim the flat.<br><br>Do you contribute to buying the flat also? if the case is in favour of you, any lost re the selling of the flat will be covered by ur husband..and any profit made will be shared b.w the 2 of you.<br><br>Woman's charted in singapore protects the women. So in divorce case, as long as u have the prove tt your husband is having adultery, file on adultery....u can claim so much more.......</div>
