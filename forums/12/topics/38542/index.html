            <div class='col-md body'>hmm sticky situation...<br><br>i thought of ur situation for a while an found myself a little stumped.. but i guess the long and short of it is.. tough luck.. just ride it out. there should be a line drawn in between somewhere, one side being too close to her, the other, ignoring her. find that line and try to stick to it. maybe after a while u'll get used to it, and i'm sure u'll find a nice girl elsewhere in no time.<br><br>best wishes to u~!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The weird thingy lies INSIDE YOUR head.
