Krispy i think u haf to make the final decision of whether to gif him another chance.. you've been wif him fo rlike 2 years? so u shld noe his character and behaviour.. dun judge the wors he said but the attitude he use to bring the message across.. if u understand him u can tell whether he really meant it anot.. even if he does, with his personality, will he go back on his words? think thru this.. if u can feel the sincerity in him, gif him another chance since u also cant bear to leave him..if not move on and dun wait for miracles to happen.. cos sadly, they dun.. hope u make a right choice!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Ah no. Just responding to krispy's comment about "majority of the guys are heartless creatures" with a rhetorical question. If a girl knew that guys are heartless, then why does she choose to fall in love with one of those "heartless creatures"?<br><br>A reasonable man would not hate girls simply because they choose to fall in love with "heartless creatures". There are many nice guys who would still love the girls even after they have been played out by the "heartless creatures". In extension to your 1st law, it is precisely because the girls have learned their lesson on evil that they learn to appreciate the good. (The smart ones would learn from others' lessons, the not-so-smart ones would learn from their own.)<br><br>Linking your 2nd and 3rd laws, it is also observed that many girls these days have been leading very protected lives with "Cinderella" images of marriage and love, no thanks to the movies, songs, magazines and other media they've grown up with. Such media always focus on the excitement of courtship, seldom on the drudgery of daily life after marriage.<br><br>Hence, coupled with the fact that most of them have received more education than their parents to earn enough money to support themselves, the girls chose to love men who could only bring to life the excitement of courtship, never realising that exciting boyfriends seldom made good husbands.<br><br>It takes wisdom to love on a "spiritual" level, but not many people do that these days. So Aunt Agony forums like this are always booming with business.</div>
