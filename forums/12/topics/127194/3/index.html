            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Krispy<br><br>I hope what I am going to type will be useful to you.  I totally agree with you and what you do.  He deserve it.  However, it will be very unfair to say that he wont change.  I know a person can change if you choose to.<br><br>But dont mistaken me, I am not asking you to give him a chance by forgiving him.  What I suggest is that you shall go ahead with your life, knowing more guys and have your life back.  And as for him, well he can start as a normal friend and start wooing you all over again.  If he really do love you, let him rebuild this relationship and the trust he had trash in you.<br><br>My advise may not be the best but I will rather give him a chance.  However, I dont believe chance shall come free, he shall be tested again and again until he earn what he deserve.<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by krispy:</div><div class="quote_body">my bf has been "collecting" hp nos. frm gals he noe in pubs... &amp; when i asked him abt it... he lied to me... &amp; make it seem as though its my fault dat i din trust him... the 1st time i found out dat he actually has been lying to me for the past half yr... during dat period i was suffering frm depression.. yet he din care abt mi &amp; had the mood to go out to knw other gals... after dat time, he promised dat he will nv lie to me again.. so we patch things up.. &amp; i tried my best to give him my trust &amp; respect...<br><br>But recently i found out dat he's been lying to me again...when i confronted him.. he still felt dat he din do anything wrong... &amp; still shouted at me.. den he even say, "see? i told u not to look at my message.. now u see liao wanna get angry.." i was really devastated &amp; deeply hurt... i finally ended our 2years plus relationship...<br><br>now.. he sms me sayng he's sorry to hurt me.. &amp; he starting to realise how much he love me after i left him... but he juz wanna cool things down 1st &amp; change totally to commit himself to me...<br><br>i dunno whtr i shld trust him again... he betrayed my trust again &amp; again... i dun wish to be hurt again... yet i still love him...<br><br>Can anyone advise me wat i shld do?</div></blockquote></div>
