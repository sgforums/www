I guess it may be due to the breach of trust in the first place. If you really want to carry on this relationship, you can do tests like asking him to show you his handphone. If he has nothing to hide, he won't have to say things like,"You don't trust me" etc and will hand you his phone straight away.</div>

So he ask the gf back. Maybe he will stay true for a time being, but evetually he will go back to his old self. Thats my guess...</div>

Also you need to decide that why you can't move on is it truely love or because you think you have invested so much in a relationship that you just can't let go. Also you need to examine if it is because you are just too used to him that it is hard to move on.</div>

You changed.<br>He has always liked his girls fresh. You, on the other hand, are no longer fresh.<br>And because you are not fresh anymore, he looks for other fresh girls.<br><br>There is one guy I know of who has a very good girlfriend, but likes his girls fresh as well. He gets tired of girls easily, and is a guy who can never be satisfied with one girl. As a result, he is often found betraying his girlfriend. With different girls.<br><br>Even though she had been betrayed and had left him after knowing about it, the girlfriend had never really left him. They would separate and reconcile, repeat and rinse until no one was ever sure if they were still together or apart. The guy had himself admitted that the girlfriend was the best girl in terms of character, as unlike the other girls he had been with, she had done a lot of things for him, and had even sacrificed a baby (or more) for him. The last time I heard, they were still together.<br><br>Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Love is like that and it does very strange things to many people. You love your jerk boyfriend and that love is clouding your rationality which tells you to give him up. Ok, if you can't look into yourself, look at others instead. Do you wish to be like the girlfriend, hanging on to a hopeless relationship with a perpetually unfaithful boyfriend? Ask yourself honestly if you can possibly foresee any happy ending with him. Don't delude yourself.<br><br>Some people may deserve a second chance, but no one deserves a third.</div>

But how are you coping with your depression now?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I hope it's much better already? If you still have that bothering you... Personally, I would advise against you going back to your bf....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First, I think you need to seek to understand - WHY is he doing this?<br><br>Is he doing this because he is not sincere about loving you?<br>Is he doing this despite loving you?<br><br>If you truly believe he loves you, then what is the reason behind this?<br><br>Personally, I think he sounds like someone who is very low in self esteem and insecure. It is not enough for him to be satisfied that there is already one woman who loves him, and he gets an ego booster out of being able to get other girls' numbers and having the attention of other girls. And his possessiveness shows that he really wants ALL OF YOUR ATTENTION ALL OF THE TIME and if you can't give this amount of attention to him, then he has every reason/excuse to seek this attention elsewhere.<br><br>You realise he can continue behaving this way without being unfaithful to you at all - he just needs his ego booster. Can you accept it?<br><br>Secondly, the question is values and attitude towards a relationship.<br><br>While relationship is all about compromising, I think some things such as values/principles towards a relationship is very hard to compromise. There are people I know with very open relationships, ranging from both parties able to confess having crushes on other parties to all out swingers. These people are able to accept the presence of other people sexually without being jealous.<br><br>But not everyone is like this. You have your own expectations and as long as they are not unreasonable (nope, i don't think expecting your boyfriend not to ask other girls for their phone no. for no other reason than getting to know them better is a good reason. If someone ask him, he can always say no. that's how the story goes) well, you have every right to stand by you.<br><br>Don't let your partner f**k up your own principles and values. Becos one day if he leaves you, they are all you're gonna have to identify what type of person you are.<br><br>I think if you intend to patch up with him, make sure it is on your own terms and not his. A lot of soft hearted parents teach kids the wrong thing when their mouth scold the kids 'no, i don't want you to do this" but their actions tell the kids its okay, mommy won't blame me.<br><br>Train him. Reward him. Punish when it is required. And when all else fails - leave.<br><br></div>
