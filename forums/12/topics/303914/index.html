Which is an answer vey different from my own opinion. All the while,I thought those social outgoing and popular hunk/lady is the most likely to be unfaithful.<br><br>Jojo has a very good explanation. But how do we know he/she has enough?<br>But seems like from personal experience is, those social outgoing and outspoken one has experience many of this flirt and is less likely to be tempt.<br><br>WHile the less social one may not experience one may not encounter many of these flirt or tempt due to his social handicapped with opposite sex. But as they grow in adult and being forced to expose of more outside world, temptation may comes in and they starts to discover the joy of those flirt with hunk/babe.<br><br>Just want to have a piece of advise, observe yr partner more ,especially those young couple. DOn't simply think his/her social handicapped will make him a safe asset as yr life time parnter..</div>
