            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. It seems like your current gf needs a lot of attention. Likewise the only attention she trys to seek from you is to use her life as a gamble. This gamble seems to be quite a big mistake.<br><br>Have you consider if one day she could have cut wrongly and die or someone could have discovered the blood loss too late. Relationship stemming out of these silly acts are far too threatening. I believe you need to have a good talk with her and talk some sense into her. Would she be glad to know if in the other way round you are the one who are always drinking dettol or swallowing sleeping pills with brandy just for her sake?<br><br>It seems that she is feeling very scare to lose you yet in the other stance keep doing silly things to make you stay. 100 over times of breakup is far too exaggerating over a period of 1.5 years. I feel you need to bring her to a psychiatrist not meaning she is crazy.. but the thinking of comtemplating sucide is far too frightening everytime she uses it. Do you think you will ever live without any regrets or reprisals even she jumps down on her own accord just trying to make you stay eventhough it is not your fault?<br><br>If you accept the relationship in the first place, at least you will need to have some responsibility. I do not mean that you are not allow to leave a person eventhough you know that both cannot get together. One party suffers is better than both miseries in their whole life. But this relationship is so exceptional.<br><br>Have you try telling her family and close friends Or one good way could be let her leave you automatically rather than you initiate a breakup.  How to let her leave you ?  You think yourself.<br><br>Goodluck...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, the censored parts look interesting..<br><br>Anyways, as what the previous forumites have said.<br><br>There's no point holding on to this kind of relationship.<br>In the end you will both be very very unhappy,<br>and this unhappiness will continue to drag, until you give it up.<br><br>Why not get rid of the unhappiness now, while its still relatively young?<br>Surely you do not want to suffer for another few years?<br><br>While i know you're worried about her cutting herself..<br>There are only a few things you can do:-<br><br>1) Refer her to a counsellor<br>2) Tell her teacher<br>3) Tell her parents<br>4) (Only do this when you can stand it no more) Slap her on the face and tell her to wake up. &lt;-- Seen this in a tv serial. I think it might just be the answer too.<br><br>Hopefully, she will wake up somehow. If not... sigh, what can you do but wait? In time she'll mature, and see the errors of her ways..</div>
