And the best part is they find it addictive and use it to their so-called advantage in a relationship. I've known people like this before and none of them are dead yet though they cause alot of grief to their partner.<br><br>Just ignore and avoid her at all cause. If you are worried. Inform her mum about what she is doing.</div>
