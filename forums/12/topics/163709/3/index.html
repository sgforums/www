The caller was very loud and was obviously a lady though I could not hear the contents. His side of the conversation was stilted and uncomfortable. so OF course I became suspicious la.<br><br>So after I put down, I just asked casually "who was that? issit xxx ah? we havent met up with him for long liao leh"<br><br>His reply was "ya.. will arrange to meet up soon."<br><br>[silence... whereupon i was thinking how to respond to him]<br><br>Finally I just said "u know, the caller was so loud I could hear HER voice?"<br><br>[silence.. whereupon I think he was thinking how to respond to me]<br><br>Anyway... the conversation went downhill rapidly.<br><br>On the other hand... my hubby is forever "lying" to me - ABOUT working or not working on that day - cos  I get annoyed with him often cannot wake up then keng MC la!<br><br>But he's a horrible liar... and in abt 5 secs I would be asking him archly how come if he leaves for work at 8.30 am.. he can actually go down, buy newspapers, come up, read finish newspapers (enough to tell me excitedly abt the tours section) then go to work haaaaaa?<br><br>Then he will just end up with a sheepish smile and guilty giggle... - shake head - like a little kid kenna caught ponteng schoo la.
