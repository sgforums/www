              <p>My case has been on-going for 18 months and yet it is nstill ot resolved.</p>
              <p>My securities firm sold my shares wrongly 18 months ago and I suffered huge losses. I wrote in to them to appeal to return me the wrongly sold shares, however they rejected my appeal.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, I approached FiDrec for help. FiDrec took more than 6 months to hear my case under their adjudication process. The adjudicator dismissed my case, even though there are sufficient evidence that the company sold my shares wrongly. I was extremely disappointed, but I perservered and wrote in to Mr Prime Minister and MAS for help.</p>
              <p>MAS claimed that they are not able to help, which I simply cannot understand why. If they can't, who can??</p>
              <p>PM's staff provided me alternatives which could not work at all, either the legal institution do not handle disputes regarding stocks or the mediation fees is exhorbitant. He also suggested that I appealed to the CEO of FiDrec, of which FiDrec's answer was that the adjudicator's decision was final, so there was nothing they can do about my case. Subsquently, I wrote back to Mr Prime Minister because I really have no solution and noone else to turn to. However, it has been 3 months since I wrote to him and no reply so far.</p>
              <p>My case has dragged for 18 months and it was a tedious and long appeal process. However, I am not giving up hope. I really hope through this channel, I can get some response for my case. It was handled unjustifically and yet noone is able to help. I cannot believe this is Singapore and the system seems to just close the door on you. I feel so helpless even though I am a pure Singaporean and the Singapore Government has always claimed that they do their best for their citizens, but in my case, I do not get such treatment at all. What I get is no-reply to my emails and behind shut doors, and no solution and punishment to the securities firm for their wrongful deed.</p>

              <p>Your case was official closed when the adjudicator gave his verdict, but your judgement is that the securities firm is guilty of wrongful deed. Who do we believe, your honour?</p>
              <p>Before you go around appealing to everybody, do you have a case?</p>
              <p>What is this selling wrongly? how did it happened? I know it is wrong to sell shares when prices are low, 18 months ago, STI was around 1700. One should be selling instead of buying, but at that time, did you see a solution to the financial crisis in the tunnel? was selling your decision or a mistake of your securities firm. If it is yours, it is your wrong judgement, though hard to swallow. If the securities firm acted without your approval resulted in your loss, it is criminal breach of trust, if you have proof beyond doubt, then you can sue them till cow comes home. </p>
              <p>if you want help, you got to come up with facts and truth. You are in the right place if you want to appeal to the anti government sentiment, you will get a lot of people who pity you and spit on the government, but that won't bring back your money!</p>
              <p>Dont' bother with the government, they are not paid their exorbitant salaries to look after your wrong investment, unless you are one of those ah soh, ah peh who got conned by the banks into buying shares of US companies that collapsed. Anyway, you make money on stock you also don't pay tax.</p>

              <p>I also hope the press can help me. Can anyone advise how I can reach the press?</p>
              <p>I tried writing to the ST Forum, but maybe my English not good enough, don't think they published my article.</p>
              <p>I did give instruction to sell, but the firm sold the wrong set of shares!</p>
              <p>I did try to claim via FiDrec, and during the trial, it appeared that internally their departments did not communicate, which resulted in my shares wrongly sold, yet the adjudicator did not let me win the case. I wrote in again to FiDrec, but they said the adjudicator's decision is final. Come on, my fate was sealed just based on one person's judgement?!</p>
              <p>My shares were worth about $50,000 when I bought them and if the firm did not sell wrongly, the shares are worth $100,000 today. And when they sold wrongly, I suffered $1,000 lost.</p>
              <p>These are all a lot of money, but after my shares are sold, I am left with nothing now so I can't bring the firm to court. I thought I could seek the government's help, even wrote to Prime Minister and MAS, but no help. Really disappointed with the Singapore system and government. I always thought our system is different from other countries' and we are protected but now I know we are not. Very sad and disappointed.</p>
              <p>Lastly, the firm is Phillip Securities.</p>

              <p>Thank you all. I have tried calling Wanbao, they didn't want to write about my case. And I tried writing to Forum too, my article was not published :(</p>
              <p>We all thought it is easy to get our agony heard right? but in reality, it's not the case! We see the Wanbao like to publish articles like youngsters behaving intimately in public carparks but come to serious matters, they do not think it's sensationalised enough. Sigh, seems like this is the end of my case, unjustified and I have to suffer in silence.....so what if election is coming, the government don't care! I am just an individual, so my vote won't matter to them at all :(</p>

              i am sure the adjudicator gave you documents on why the verdict wasnt awarded in your favour.
              
              i suggest you seek legal opinion.  just opinion, not sue anyone.  ask the lawyer if you have a case.  there are many rules in the stock market.  a lot in fine print. brokerage firms arent stupid.  make sure you have a case.  dont go around speaking ill of the brokerage firm and end up with more problems.
              
              asking just for an opinion wont cost you a lot of money and its more sensible and realistic.  if there is no case, move on.
