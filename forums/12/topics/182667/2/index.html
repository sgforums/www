(theres this gal who he still cant get over wif)<br><br>but the confusing part is tat, if he needs a break from relationships, according to him, then y did he treat me better day by day? he claimed he knew abt my feelings since day 1. as in, if he needs a break, y wud he even bother to get this close to me? i hope im not thinking too much but i do haf little frens and he's one of the few tat i can relate too.<br><br>well, i dunno wat made me do it but 2 days after my confession, i told him im giving up. his reaction was just as normal. i think its either an "ok" or "anything", nothing remarkable.  yar so life goes back to normal. we do tok a lot still on msn in a frenly way. btw he's a gal magnet and i dunno y so many gals are telling me hes hot. (cough cough)<br><br>then last friday he smsed "wanna meet tmr? i return u ur thumbdrive. if u wan we can haf dinner together too". after consulting my frens i decided to go. i dunno whats the point of him asking me out lah, though he said its to thank me for helping him wif things.<br><br>so on saturday i turned up. we had dinner at billy bombers. u noe the guy-pull-out-chair-for-gal thing? ya he did tat and he poured drinks for me. but dinner tat time i was either too nervous or out of my mind. i kept screwing things up. i touch fork, fork drop. i touch knife, knife drop. i couldnt even cut wif my knife to tat extent tat he had to cut the food for me. worse still, i embarrassed myself my speaking wif a mouth full of food. then suddenly he stared at me intently, i thot wat, then he passed me a piece of tissue and say "theres food stain on ur mouth"  -_-'''<br><br>ok i noe i gave myself away too much at the dinner. ya then after dinner he suggested watching movie. there wasnt much nice shows and most ticks were selling fast. he's nice enuff to offer to watch final destination 3 wif me though he had watched it once already. in the end i told him not to waste money so we went for a stroll around the neighbourhood.<br><br>we found a pretty peaceful place and sat down. he commented tat the stars were nice. after tat he sang songs and showed me some dance steps. ya basically for the whole nite we sat there enjoying the tranquility of the place and he sang a majority of jay chou songs. suddenly he said he wud like to hear me sing. of course im shy and stuff so i told him i wud sing the next time. then for dunno wat lah, he commented "there may not be a next time coz u noe im going into army..."<br><br>i felt disappointed but of course i dint show it. after tat he gave me the round thing from his keychain. he say wat, he's giving it to me as a ring. maybe he's just trying to be lame, i dunnoe. he did mention tat he can stay until very late but maybe i need to go home le. so around midnite i seriously think tat my mum was boiling wif rage so i said i gotta go. he walked me home. when i reached home i realised im still holding on to the 'ring' of the keychain. i smsed "u forgot to take ur 'ring' back". he says "u keep it, i dun need it anyway"...<br><br>ya tat was wat the story is abt. but the problem is tat, who am i to him? maybe he did treat me like a fren and its normal to go out wif a fren. ya. i really hope im not thinking too much or else i wud haf been wasting so much of my time fretting upon this! btw im indeed a stupid gal. on tat day itself he said "i've got free tickets to ice age2, u wan or not?". instead of replying a yes, i exclaimed "hey where u get the free ticks?!"... ya tat was completely anti-climax. so now i dunno whether its set or he merely mentioned it in a no-big-deal way. i could haf gotten the chance to go out wif him again if i told him i wan the ticks. haiix. so how now?? and he's leaving for army in april. but is he even interested in me?? or shud i ask him abt the ice age thing to get myself a 2nd chance??</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This is a carefully crafted seduction and you make an excellent victim for his spell weaving.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear 200plus,<br><br>I would gather you're under 20, from the way you post? : )<br><br>I think you're reading too much into things.  He's already been honest with you in that there's a girl he can't get over.  Yes, he's taking a break from relationships, &amp; there's No stopping him from getting close to you as a friend.  But there's No obligation for him to like you, nor get into a relationship with you.  Being nice to you may be his nature, or simply because he treats you as a closer friend, that's all?  Why think too much?<br><br>Another way to look at it is that he wants companionship.  People who've still Not let go of a past relationship need support &amp; friendship in order to help them get over the whole episode.  He may then make a decision whether to still pursue the girl he likes, or move on to another.  You may Not be anything else, girl.<br><br>I'm Not trying to discourage you.  What I'm trying to highlight is that, thinking too much about things &amp; looking for details that aren't there may only result in bitter disappointment.  Why don't you just enjoy the friendship without the anxiety?  Perhaps without the pressure, there MAY be a chance for a relationship to blossom.  Be at ease with yourself, &amp; hang out with him as friends.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 200plus:</div><div class="quote_body">hi peeps. this is my first time posting. anyway i was recommended to come here by my fren. dunno will it help or not. but nvm. enuff of the crap. its a long story btw.<br><br>ok theres this guy. i got to noe him around the beginning of this year. i wont say he's good-looking but he is a unique guy. first few weeks past and i dint really pay attention to him. then there was once he wrote me a note to inform me abt something and from then on i was attracted to him. dun ask me y. me myself dunno the reason behind this. then we started to chat often on msn and i felt comfortable tokking to him.<br><br>on valentine's eve he spent around 40+ minutes on msn to persuade me to confess to the person tat i like and i did gave in. after finally plucking up the courage, i told him. he replied "i know". anti-climax isnt it?? he said he isnt rejecting neither is he accepting because he needs time.
