            <div class='col-md body'>hi peeps. this is my first time posting. anyway i was recommended to come here by my fren. dunno will it help or not. but nvm. enuff of the crap. its a long story btw.<br><br>ok theres this guy. i got to noe him around the beginning of this year. i wont say he's good-looking but he is a unique guy. first few weeks past and i dint really pay attention to him. then there was once he wrote me a note to inform me abt something and from then on i was attracted to him. dun ask me y. me myself dunno the reason behind this. then we started to chat often on msn and i felt comfortable tokking to him.<br><br>on valentine's eve he spent around 40+ minutes on msn to persuade me to confess to the person tat i like and i did gave in. after finally plucking up the courage, i told him. he replied "i know". anti-climax isnt it?? he said he isnt rejecting neither is he accepting because he needs time. (theres this gal who he still cant get over wif)<br><br>but the confusing part is tat, if he needs a break from relationships, according to him, then y did he treat me better day by day? he claimed he knew abt my feelings since day 1. as in, if he needs a break, y wud he even bother to get this close to me? i hope im not thinking too much but i do haf little frens and he's one of the few tat i can relate too.<br><br>well, i dunno wat made me do it but 2 days after my confession, i told him im giving up. his reaction was just as normal. i think its either an "ok" or "anything", nothing remarkable.  yar so life goes back to normal. we do tok a lot still on msn in a frenly way. btw he's a gal magnet and i dunno y so many gals are telling me hes hot. (cough cough)<br><br>then last friday he smsed "wanna meet tmr? i return u ur thumbdrive. if u wan we can haf dinner together too". after consulting my frens i decided to go. i dunno whats the point of him asking me out lah, though he said its to thank me for helping him wif things.<br><br>so on saturday i turned up. we had dinner at billy bombers. u noe the guy-pull-out-chair-for-gal thing? ya he did tat and he poured drinks for me. but dinner tat time i was either too nervous or out of my mind. i kept screwing things up. i touch fork, fork drop. i touch knife, knife drop. i couldnt even cut wif my knife to tat extent tat he had to cut the food for me. worse still, i embarrassed myself my speaking wif a mouth full of food. then suddenly he stared at me intently, i thot wat, then he passed me a piece of tissue and say "theres food stain on ur mouth"  -_-'''<br><br>ok i noe i gave myself away too much at the dinner. ya then after dinner he suggested watching movie. there wasnt much nice shows and most ticks were selling fast. he's nice enuff to offer to watch final destination 3 wif me though he had watched it once already. in the end i told him not to waste money so we went for a stroll around the neighbourhood.<br><br>we found a pretty peaceful place and sat down. he commented tat the stars were nice. after tat he sang songs and showed me some dance steps. ya basically for the whole nite we sat there enjoying the tranquility of the place and he sang a majority of jay chou songs. suddenly he said he wud like to hear me sing. of course im shy and stuff so i told him i wud sing the next time. then for dunno wat lah, he commented "there may not be a next time coz u noe im going into army..."<br><br>i felt disappointed but of course i dint show it. after tat he gave me the round thing from his keychain. he say wat, he's giving it to me as a ring. maybe he's just trying to be lame, i dunnoe. he did mention tat he can stay until very late but maybe i need to go home le. so around midnite i seriously think tat my mum was boiling wif rage so i said i gotta go. he walked me home. when i reached home i realised im still holding on to the 'ring' of the keychain. i smsed "u forgot to take ur 'ring' back". he says "u keep it, i dun need it anyway"...<br><br>ya tat was wat the story is abt. but the problem is tat, who am i to him? maybe he did treat me like a fren and its normal to go out wif a fren. ya. i really hope im not thinking too much or else i wud haf been wasting so much of my time fretting upon this! btw im indeed a stupid gal. on tat day itself he said "i've got free tickets to ice age2, u wan or not?". instead of replying a yes, i exclaimed "hey where u get the free ticks?!"... ya tat was completely anti-climax. so now i dunno whether its set or he merely mentioned it in a no-big-deal way. i could haf gotten the chance to go out wif him again if i told him i wan the ticks. haiix. so how now?? and he's leaving for army in april. but is he even interested in me?? or shud i ask him abt the ice age thing to get myself a 2nd chance??</div>

(theres this gal who he still cant get over wif)<br><br>but the confusing part is tat, if he needs a break from relationships, according to him, then y did he treat me better day by day? he claimed he knew abt my feelings since day 1. as in, if he needs a break, y wud he even bother to get this close to me? i hope im not thinking too much but i do haf little frens and he's one of the few tat i can relate too.<br><br>well, i dunno wat made me do it but 2 days after my confession, i told him im giving up. his reaction was just as normal. i think its either an "ok" or "anything", nothing remarkable.  yar so life goes back to normal. we do tok a lot still on msn in a frenly way. btw he's a gal magnet and i dunno y so many gals are telling me hes hot. (cough cough)<br><br>then last friday he smsed "wanna meet tmr? i return u ur thumbdrive. if u wan we can haf dinner together too". after consulting my frens i decided to go. i dunno whats the point of him asking me out lah, though he said its to thank me for helping him wif things.<br><br>so on saturday i turned up. we had dinner at billy bombers. u noe the guy-pull-out-chair-for-gal thing? ya he did tat and he poured drinks for me. but dinner tat time i was either too nervous or out of my mind. i kept screwing things up. i touch fork, fork drop. i touch knife, knife drop. i couldnt even cut wif my knife to tat extent tat he had to cut the food for me. worse still, i embarrassed myself my speaking wif a mouth full of food. then suddenly he stared at me intently, i thot wat, then he passed me a piece of tissue and say "theres food stain on ur mouth"  -_-'''<br><br>ok i noe i gave myself away too much at the dinner. ya then after dinner he suggested watching movie. there wasnt much nice shows and most ticks were selling fast. he's nice enuff to offer to watch final destination 3 wif me though he had watched it once already. in the end i told him not to waste money so we went for a stroll around the neighbourhood.<br><br>we found a pretty peaceful place and sat down. he commented tat the stars were nice. after tat he sang songs and showed me some dance steps. ya basically for the whole nite we sat there enjoying the tranquility of the place and he sang a majority of jay chou songs. suddenly he said he wud like to hear me sing. of course im shy and stuff so i told him i wud sing the next time. then for dunno wat lah, he commented "there may not be a next time coz u noe im going into army..."<br><br>i felt disappointed but of course i dint show it. after tat he gave me the round thing from his keychain. he say wat, he's giving it to me as a ring. maybe he's just trying to be lame, i dunnoe. he did mention tat he can stay until very late but maybe i need to go home le. so around midnite i seriously think tat my mum was boiling wif rage so i said i gotta go. he walked me home. when i reached home i realised im still holding on to the 'ring' of the keychain. i smsed "u forgot to take ur 'ring' back". he says "u keep it, i dun need it anyway"...<br><br>ya tat was wat the story is abt. but the problem is tat, who am i to him? maybe he did treat me like a fren and its normal to go out wif a fren. ya. i really hope im not thinking too much or else i wud haf been wasting so much of my time fretting upon this! btw im indeed a stupid gal. on tat day itself he said "i've got free tickets to ice age2, u wan or not?". instead of replying a yes, i exclaimed "hey where u get the free ticks?!"... ya tat was completely anti-climax. so now i dunno whether its set or he merely mentioned it in a no-big-deal way. i could haf gotten the chance to go out wif him again if i told him i wan the ticks. haiix. so how now?? and he's leaving for army in april. but is he even interested in me?? or shud i ask him abt the ice age thing to get myself a 2nd chance??</div></blockquote>humm thanks for coming to AA<br><br>I have seen your problem and I must say you are head over heeds in love with him. There is nothing we could say to keep you of him.<br><br>Sadly to say he is bored and he is playing with your feelings<br>Trust me I have seen playboys style of playing and he is definely playing with you.<br><br>O well since you cannot take your eyes off him then there is no point asking you to stop seeing him or hack care about him right?<br>So might as well enjoy it while it last ba.<br><br>To you everything he gives you is a treasure be it a coin or a paper.<br>I myself have been through the feeling so i know how it feels.<br>No worries once he have found a new or better target he will go.<br><br>He is not interested in you. He just playing around. If he is serious he should care more of your feelings and why can't he just take care of you properly.<br>I know this is hard to take it but this is real life not games. People have feelings and will get hurt.</div>
