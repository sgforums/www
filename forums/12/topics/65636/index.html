            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder... does love btwn male &amp; female really take priority in our lives at a certain time? I do see many posting here lamenting how they got ditched by their stead &amp; such... (no offence here...) But... wat abt other "loves"? Love btwn family? Btwn frens? Btwn things u do?<br><br>Yesterdae I was playing an online game when my buddy wanna tok to me abt smth. He said I was behaving as though I was emotionless. He said I was unappreciative when it comes to give &amp; take. Dat I seemed to not show any signs of appreciating for wat ppl done for me.<br><br>I admit I do seem unappreciative, but deep inside I DO appreciate wat ppl done, juz dat I dun show it. Call it a man's pride or watever. I cld not respond to their kindness. The reason y he tell me of this flaw I have is bcoz he can tell me straight in da face &amp; I m WILLING to listen. Unlike da remaining of my gang where it needs a more tactical approach.<br><br>He oso told me abt da prob my gang is currently facing. U see, da reason Me, my buddy &amp; da gang have been together is due to da sole reason of "gaming". Imagine when "gaming" is removed. Is there anymore to tok abt? Anything else to remain together for? Bar me &amp; my buddy, da rest cant find another common purpose so dat we can remain together.<br><br>1 of my fren in da gang is too engrossed in "gaming" &amp; coz of dat, he is somewat starting to make every1 of us "du lan". Whether he noe or not is 1 thing, but when hes not in da game &amp; da rest start "toking" is another. My buddy fear dis frenship is coming to an end. A frenship dat was built for more than 4 yrs (me) &amp; 8+ yrs (my buddy) is going to end?<br><br>Maybe my buddy is over suspicious. Maybe he got it wrong? But I m sure both me &amp; my buddy dun wan DAT to happen. So many YEARS of time, pain, work &amp; effort to build dis relationship btwn all of us. Da bond is smth dat is so special, dat neither any1 of us is willing leave or break it. I believe dat shld it happen (TOUCHWOOD!), it hurts HELL more than normal bgr... &amp; I dun have to mention family... Parents took da years = yr age, time, pain, effort, $$$ &amp; much, MUCH more......<br><br>&amp; yet I have so many frens of mine complaining to me abt break ups, loneliness, probs in r/s, crushes, blah blah (NO. I m NOT shooting on dis particular part of bgr) &amp; yet they seldom tell me more on frenship? more on family? Maybe they do not noe... or they TINK everything is ok... But... I dunno... I juz felt they shld show more concern to their family &amp; frens...<br><br>I do not noe wat else to sae... I oso dunno how da hell I tot of trying to post it here too... But I do noe: despite wat I ASSUMED to be alright btwn family &amp; frens, I seemed to have overlooked so many things dat I tot to be "normal"... I seemed to have taken things for granted &amp; those who hoped I appreciate wat they done r hurt in da process... without me realising it...<br><br>Dis prob, I intend to settle while I can... hoping to tink in their shoes &amp; learning to appreciate &amp; letting them noe I DO appreciate wat they did for me...<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I juz wanna tell u all here dat some1 out there might be doing alot of things for u, yet u do not noe it... &amp; may have hurt dat person alot. Take dis chance to tink thru...</span><br><br>I also want to take this opportunity to tell ALL in here (forumites 1st, especially those I met), that I appreciate what u all have done for me:<br><br><strong>Thank you</strong> IamAngeline for being such a wonderful person, willing to crap with me so many times, listening to me &amp; many many more.<br><br><strong>Thank you</strong> AngelDark, Defrosted, En', Lilogal for the time we are together, crapping about so many things, fun time &amp; such.<br><br><strong>Thank you</strong> Dev, Yun, Bear &amp; many others for the long essays &amp; knowledge I learnt from all of you.<br><br><strong>Thank you</strong> Cherish Love, thhong, DS, Xian89, Sillyme, MoonIce, rest of "LASH" ppl for the nice birthday outing (I really enjoyed it) &amp; for many other things.<br><br><strong>Thank you</strong> Narz jie, www, antoh, HOFs gang, Sians gang for that KTV outing &amp; crapping, &amp; other things too.<br><br><strong>Thank you</strong> Lynette80, Wendy81, FireIce, AudleneLee, Honeybunz, Delusioned, Millenium, Sgboy2004, X-men, &amp; many other interesting people for chatting with me &amp; more.<br><br><strong>Thank you</strong> everyone else for making this forums great as it is.<br><br><strong>Thank you</strong> Jason for creating this great forum for all to share (you made this forum, right?)<br><br>Even though these are just mere wordings that are typed out &amp; sent digitally, it is not easy for me to muster out the guts to tell you all here.

            <div class='col-md body'>does love btwn male &amp; female really take priority in our lives at a certain time?<br><br><strong>Most of the times yes! and we have to admit that! Sometimes we just didn;t realise it. It's natural you would want to spend more times wif ya loved one, not mentioning that we dun love our friends, but human are born selfish you see, so when u r in love, definitely you wanna spend more time in loving and be loved if you loved the way you are accepting love.</strong><br><br>Yesterdae I was playing an online game when my buddy wanna tok to me abt smth.

Bar me &amp; my buddy, da rest cant find another common purpose so dat we can remain together.<br><br><strong>Perhaps I dun fall under your buddy category, and more I'm not a man. I personally do not think like wat your buddy has mentioned.. Anyway, to me, you dun belong to those who know how to exactly express your feelings on the external side, so in other way, to get to know you (in terms of tots n emotions), it's not as simple to anyone could have done it. Real frenship need mutual trust and understanding, and simply that applies in any other r/s we are having whether it's in family or love. And sorry I have to say that you fren is making a big issue out of nowhere from ur unappreciative character. Gaming is nothing wrong, everyone had their common topic and somehow the topic between u and ur gang is gaming, well I think it's perfectly fine with that. I dun see the point at y do you have to think that wat if gaming is removed from u n ur gang? Precisely, we dun make frens just becos we have common topics, but becos we enjoy the company and we feel comfortable with one another. That's so simple. Dun think too much!</strong><br><br>1 of my fren in da gang is too engrossed in "gaming" &amp; coz of dat, he is somewat starting to make every1 of us "du lan". Whether he noe or not is 1 thing, but when hes not in da game &amp; da rest start "toking" is another. My buddy fear dis frenship is coming to an end. A frenship dat was built for more than 4 yrs (me) &amp; 8+ yrs (my buddy) is going to end?<br><br><strong>As I said, mutual trust and understanding is impt! Nothing wrong with the gaming part.. Sit down and cool down.</strong><br><br><strong>Thank you</strong> IamAngeline for being such a wonderful person, willing to crap with me so many times, listening to me &amp; many many more.<br><br><strong>And thanks! Me to be the first in the list hahaha~~~ Buck up!!! A new year is coming!!! Happy new yr to ya okie. Everything will be fine. this is perhaps one of the most unusual moments that I am the one who is giving you all my tots! haha </strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You friendship is first discover through gaming and yes you are right, without it, it will affect the friendship - not as in how strong is was previously, but because the common interest is lost.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In love theory: 'What started on the bed will die by the bed.'<br><br>That's the reason why ONS-progressed-relationship never worked.
