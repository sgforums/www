(As least she still remembered there's some junk emails left in her inbox.)<br>Or is it normal for her to ask you to help her to clear out her junk emails? (Why can't she do it herself?)<br><br>It is still technically possible for her to be smart enough to entrap you with this tiny trap. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>It all depends on what type of a person she is. For example, do you think that if she wants to break up with you...she would have the courage to tell you about it? Or Do you think she would rather let you initiate the breaking-up? And is she the kind who is easily worried over what others might think about her...most of the time? All these questions will be best left for you to answer them and find out by yourself.<br><br>Sometimes a girl don't just stick with a guy because of love, they stick with the guy cos they're just stuck on him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck and I certainly hope that things won't turn out the way I've said, but to be immune to this and happens to be the best way out...is to ignore what you've seen and doubts and believe what she tells you. As a guy, you'll need to trust her to the very end of your faith. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
