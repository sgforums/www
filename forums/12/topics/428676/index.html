              <p>hi guys. i recently applied for a role in the singapore police force and was rejected at the fourth round of interviews. obviously i was devastated.
                  
                  i prepared really hard for the interview. i went to their roadshows, i researched on their Annual, i read up on books, i thought of commonly asked questions and their answers, i followed current affairs news closely, especially related to SPF, i thought of situational questions, i rehearsed my interview many times, even video recording myself to see how i could improve, among many others. through this period, SPF was all i thought of. i worked part time jobs, so that i had the flexibility to go for their interviews, and also it did not give me the burden of having to quit before starting work etc.
                  
                  unfortunately i was rejected.</p>
              <p>this is my point. i cannot help but feel i was being picked on throughout the interview. i was interviewed by &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;X, and it seemed like he did not like me at all. he was picking on me and scoffing at my answers. he gave me the impression that he did not believe my real intentions of joining the spf.
                  
                  i do believe i showed my passion in joining the force during the interview, and i did well for it.</p>
              <p>you guys may say that i am being sour grapes here. whatever the reason, this has left a bad taste with my experience with them. i felt they are letting go of someone who is really passionate about the job. it is disappointing. i feel they are letting go of someone who is really passionate, just because maybe he does not like your face. what happened to the spf's core values of CLIFairness? is this how the protectors of the people do things?</p>
              <p>should i give up on my dream job? if i reapply, i feel my chances are not high with people like them around. if i do not reapply, it just proves to them that they were right in rejecting me. i leave you to draw your own conclusions, good or bad, i shall read them openly...</p>

              Hi... If u ask me of cos i say i fared well haha... I put my heart and soul into this and i prepared very much... I dare say i have a good idea of what they were looking out for. I cannot help but feel &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;X was cynical about my intentions, and scoffing at my answers. U cld say he was testing me, but i kept in mind what they were looking out for and believe i did well... I believe they have passed lesser ppl, pardon if i'm arrogant.. I just feel i did well enough, apparently not...

              <p>You're right that in an interview, a major factor is also whether you can connect with the interviewer or not. Perhaps you didn't connect with that superintendent. You didn't make him like you I guess.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, not for me to judge. One closed door means another opened. Good luck, some things hurt so much that they become a blessing in disguise.</p>

              <p> i cannot help but feel i was being picked on throughout the interview. i was interviewed by &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;X, and it seemed like he did not like me at all. he was picking on me and scoffing at my answers. he gave me the impression that he did not believe my real intentions of joining the spf. i do believe i showed my passion in joining the force during the interview, and i did well for it.</p>

              <p>i just went for an interview weeks ago, albeit not spf but some art school.. that muthabitch did not even look at my portfolio and when i was talking she did not even want to listen to me, she just cuts me halfway and said that "i can read better than u" "i know what u are going to say".. i gave myself a afterthought and i believe i did good for it too, but thinking so much also no point now. you are just giving yourself assurance, i guess its natural for our mind to heal ourselves mentally..</p>
              <p>well i guess in this world some things just happen this way.. probably u could try again next year and hope it is not this interviewer again, or go try other outlets.</p>
