            <div class='col-md body'>hi ifish,<br><br>I think from your posts, you portray the following. Please correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>You want to get into a relationship with the girl you're mentioning. but you are afraid of 2 things. Firstly is to be rejected again if you pop the question. Secondly you are afraid that she is only using you as a spare tyre and you are just a petrol kiosk and not the destination.<br><br>What I think is that since you want to be with her, you should just pop the question. Yes or no doesn't matter anymore. At least you tried so you will not have regrets later on. Even if it's no, you can still remain as friends. Just that you can start to get over and persue another girl who is more suitable for you. But bear in mind that no relationship is not rocky. However, being rocky doesn't mean that the relationship should capsize if the girl is stable in her faithfulness. But based on what you posted, I think that this girl is not stable in terms of fidelity.<br><br>The choice is yours to make. To remain in the guessing game or to get a definate answer to decide to proceed or move on is totally up to you.<br><br>I wish you all the best in making the right decisions.</div>
