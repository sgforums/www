            <div class='col-md body'>there's this gal which i  like for quite some time. told her about it. she nvr rejected me deep deep. after telling her about my feelings, she told me that we should just remain as friends.<br><br>after that incident, we did remain as friends. we got closer to the point of us smsing everyday, giving her wake up calls, meet in the middle of sg just to go out, (i live in the west. she live in the east) talking on the phone for long hours in the wee morning, etc<br><br>all this just make me wait. waiting for her to accept me..<br><br>there's a particular bad point..<br><br>she talks alot about her ex.. everytime he talk about him, i'll just pretend to listen even though it hurts deep down inside. I tried telling to her that I dont want to hear about it. but all attempt failed.<br><br>secondly, some of her actions can be quite hurtful. 1 min u can be chatting lame stuff and the another min she can be keepin all quiet saying she dont feel like chattin. makin me guilty as if i have done smth wrong. or she can be super close with me alone but infront of friends, she would treat me like a complete stranger<br><br>for the past 1 week, i've been keeping quite. keeping my distance from her.<br><br>She did ask me wad happen. I just said that "I've got my reasons and somethings are best left unsaid."<br><br>2 days ago, i sort of send a wrong sms to her.<br>the next day, she msn me saying that," Think you enjoying wad u having with your friend. i shall not you disturb any further"<br><br>after probing further,<br><br>she said that since im enjoying so much time with my friends, go have fun. and ignore her all I want.<br><br>I sort of cant control anymore and say<br><br>for your own info, my friends got nth to do with me distaning away from you. Get the facts right first<br><br>and of course, she went offline and nvr talk to her ever since yesterday.<br><br>i know i was abit rough to her but i just cant control myself. I've lost my patience.<br><br>so should i apologize?<br><br>the reason i distaning away from you is because i want a time off. To clear my mind. Because of your attitude against me. not because of my friends. they're the one who kept my mind occupied.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ifish..<br><br>i think she likes the idea of you devoting ur time to her. but that doesnt mean she likes u or willing to be with u ..<br><br>some girls jus fancy the idea that there is someone there for them to talk to, go out with when they are bored.<br><br>talkin to u abt her ex is a way for her to relive her memories. its the truth, it makes her happy to think abt what she has had before, and also hopin u give some advice or even, maybe make u feel jealous.. this makes her happy. not exactly happy, but the kind of attention that she is seeking.<br><br>\when she ask u to enjoy urself wiht your frens, its reverse psychology.<br>she wants u to devote ur time to her!<br><br>unless u reali like her like crazy, and tinks she is the one for you,, den wait.<br><br>if not.. i advise u to THink carefully...<br><br>dun end up with regrets..<br><br>cheers!</div>
