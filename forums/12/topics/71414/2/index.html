If you were my friend in reality, I would have literally nag you to hell.<br><br>Once you have decided to leave, never look back. Because if part of your mind knows that you will return if she were to come back - you ain't ready. Don't make decision half-heartedly, you wanna do something, do it right. Don't keep making the same mistake over and over again - gosh, life is too short to be learning the same lesson over and over again.

That's a fatal illusion that keeps you going for years. And you will keep going because you have fallen right under her art of seduction and that you never able to pierce through.<br><br>Like all common man, your mistakes are the following few: (Somehow if others were to read this, it seemed that I had posted this before. Yes, I am damn naggy and I will continue to repeat myself):<br><br>You worshipped her like a goddess. You regarded her as an entity out of reach and so, you crave for her attention like a zealous devotee. You save money to get her presents and offer them to her even if you stave/work like hell. And so you thought that gifts can demonstrate your affection? Oh please, if she a sucker for gifts - imagine how many possible 'devotee' she could have and what makes you think your gifts are more valuable than the rest? (Gifts can be measure in value) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In the first place, if you thought that gift could win her heart, you are on par with men who thought that money could buy love.<br><br>And the best part - after spending so much time and effort, you never had the strength to tell her that you like/love her in her face. Do you know why? Let me explain using the Joho theory: <strong>In crush, we see our target as an entity higher than ourselves. In love, we see them the same as we see ourselves.</strong> The reason why you never able to do that is because she is like an idol and you are the fan. The image she has PROJECTED and marketed into you is mind-shocking awesome and even being near to her physically, you would literally faint. Look at the screaming female fans of F4 and such. These actually people cry after a handshake with them.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> To you, she is forever an idol, while to her, you are merely a fan.<br><br>So how does an idol keep their fans excited and keep worshipping them?

Don't then. Keep suffering until you have entirely paid off your karmic debts you have on her. It won't take forever; it will stop the minute wisdom enters into you or love cosmic lesson ends. Have seen couples struggling with one another in unfulfilling relationship, yet unable to leave the shore of their suffering? They will suffer until their payment finished before their bonds with one another severe. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your suffering will continue whether you decide to love or not because love expectations has blinded you, making you see nothing of the reason why you should leave.<br><br>I can tell (for example): This girl to leave her relationship with her bf and even site the most logical reason to do so. But she won't leave. WHY? Simple! <strong>Because she sees reason to stay</strong>. And my views don't stand a chance.<br><br><strong>Do you see, personally, reason to leave her</strong>? Obvious not. You don't understand why you have to stop all these and leave and therefore my job isn't to make you feel otherwise. WHY? Like above my view don't stand a chance because you don't see why you have to go.<br><br>For the fourth time, I emphasise again: <strong>What will it take for you to wake up?</strong> If you were to break up my sentence, the most important part of this phrase is 'What will it take...' which means: what factors or circumstances must happen before you would see the reason yourself that you will never get her and start moving on with your life, the option you should have already took years ago? You may defend yourself that may be 0.00000001% that you may get her and my challenge is: prove me wrong.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You are already drained beyond imagination and tried all your means for the past six years and you still can't get her. What does it says?<br><br>P.S: Its easier to move on than to remain stagnant. Its astonishing to realise that you rather make use of so much energy to worship her, suffer and get nothing, then to make much less use of energy to attempt to move on completely. <strong>Before you can walk a mile, you have to begin your first step</strong>.<br><br>Cheers</div>
