That's a fatal illusion that keeps you going for years. And you will keep going because you have fallen right under her art of seduction and that you never able to pierce through.<br><br>Like all common man, your mistakes are the following few: (Somehow if others were to read this, it seemed that I had posted this before. Yes, I am damn naggy and I will continue to repeat myself):<br><br>You worshipped her like a goddess. You regarded her as an entity out of reach and so, you crave for her attention like a zealous devotee. You save money to get her presents and offer them to her even if you stave/work like hell. And so you thought that gifts can demonstrate your affection? Oh please, if she a sucker for gifts - imagine how many possible 'devotee' she could have and what makes you think your gifts are more valuable than the rest? (Gifts can be measure in value) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In the first place, if you thought that gift could win her heart, you are on par with men who thought that money could buy love.<br><br>And the best part - after spending so much time and effort, you never had the strength to tell her that you like/love her in her face. Do you know why? Let me explain using the Joho theory: <strong>In crush, we see our target as an entity higher than ourselves. In love, we see them the same as we see ourselves.</strong> The reason why you never able to do that is because she is like an idol and you are the fan. The image she has PROJECTED and marketed into you is mind-shocking awesome and even being near to her physically, you would literally faint. Look at the screaming female fans of F4 and such. These actually people cry after a handshake with them.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> To you, she is forever an idol, while to her, you are merely a fan.<br><br>So how does an idol keep their fans excited and keep worshipping them? Simple: Make them think they have chance to get close, let them be updated about her life and send occasional positive message to make you think she cares/remember/etc you... but....<br><br>You will never be able to get her.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Under art of seduction, eventually, you would lose her. You can never keep up with what you could give because its purely one sided. If she has appreciated that side of you, she would have already LONG accepted you. You are like a blender in her life - in some occasion, it would be useful, but you don't really need it even if you don't own one.<br><br>Pisces? No wonder charm so strong. What she meant is that she knew that she wouldn't last with either one of you (thus inability to bring happiness) and would hurt either one of you indirectly. Anyway, seriously if you are asking me how much chance do you have to get her, I can tell you its near zero. Even if luck were to be on your side and you are with her - you will not last anywhere more than 6 months, unless other methods are employed, image altered, etc.<br><br>Like what I had said: What does it take to make you wake up? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The story goes like this. (My own anyhow storiesÂ….donÂ’t flame me arh!)<br><br>She was a young 'beautiful' wild horse.<br>Mysterious, attractive which almost everyone who looks at her will want to possess her. None succeded.<br><br>This wild horse have travelled many villages, came across villiage Chiefs, Stables Owners, Rich Mayors, and handsome hunters, but none had the chance to truly own her.<br>Some owned her only for weeks....some for months, but eventually she got her way out and travelled in the lonesome journey.<br><br>While crossing a river with huge strong current...she lost her footing and was swept together with the waters.<br>Cold, Icy, Wet and after a long long while....opened her eyes.<br>She couldn't move abit of her muscles...<br>The waters had carried her to the meanderings for rivers, rocks, and undercurrents of twigs.<br>There were cuts all over, fresh cuts.<br><br>'You're awake! All right don't move, I hope you do get what i mean...'<br><br>Ewan found her on one of the river bank close to his home.<br>He quickly got help from his friends and used a trolley to push the once beautiful wild horse home.<br>'Doctor, please save this little horse. Do anything to save it.'<br>Doctor: It'd be too costly to save this horse....she's too ruined. Let's put her to sleep shall we?'<br>'Oh NO!!! You can do that!<br>I'll do anything to get her save.<br>How much will it take?! I'll work for it i promise!'<br><br>Doctor: 'I don't have that much time for this....i'll just give you some prescriptions for cleansing and healing of wounds'<br>'Some things are not meant to be....Young man......'<br><br>Pauper Ewan worked very hard to get those medicine which doctor had prescribed, when he couldn't support himself properly...having to miss two meals a day is considered lucky for him.<br><br>Day after day....Ewan began to realise that all his life. He had never done something fufilling, something which he have to bear so much responsibility in his life.<br>He promised to himself that he would put his whole heart to get the horse back to how she was.<br><br>Weeks goes by...the beautiful horse have recovered from all cuts and the sheen reflected from her mane to tail hair.<br>However, she has not recovered from her injuries on her limbs.<br><br>Ewan saw her beauty like the rest of man and loved her.<br>He built a mini stable and provided care for this horse.<br><br>He would rather allow himself to miss his meals for days to buy wood blocks and hay for her.<br>Ewan spoke to her daily and she understood Ewan's effort. She seemed appreciative and welcomed his advances to be good friends.<br><br>Months past by.....unknowingly, Ewan had her with him for twelve months.<br>The beautiful horse healed very well and started galloping....further and further....but always back to the stable where she had stayed to recuperate.<br>The stable which Ewan had worked hard and built....<br>Slowly, it went on for three years. He named her Belle which meant beauty.<br>Ewan remain a pauper and Belle is getting better and growing.<br>Day by day....Ewan found Belle is becoming more and more precious....more precious then his own life.<br><br>Belle was away one day....and never came back.<br>Ewan was anxious and searched in the forest....fearing that the same encounter would happen again, or worse...some hunters would harm her.<br>I'm going to lose her, Ewan thought.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>The sun began to show up early in the cold morning. Ewan went home defeated.<br>Too tired to pry open his eyes...he slept.<br>But was awoken by some noises....it came nearer and nearer to his little hut.<br>Ewan prayed hard that it's Belle coming home. His eyes filled with tears which couldn't hold back any longer....he trembled with anticipation and rushed out to the open.<br>Indeed Belle came back.<br><br>From that day on. Ewan started to track Belle's travelling routes and the spots she stops and rest. So that he could be confident if Belle goes missing again.<br>Unfortunately....he never understood the horse he took care of.<br><br>Belle galloped away one day and Ewan searched for her every single day.<br>Depressed and tearing while he fantically ran in the forest looking for her. Day till night....night till day... it went on.<br>Ewan felt like a madman, everyone staying by the river banks were afraid to speak to him. No one understood why the concern over a lost horse, it wasn't his in the first place.<br>The search still went on...<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Ewan was tired. Sat by a pond somewhere deep in the jungle.<br>The scenery was serene and chripping of birds soothed his mind.<br>He closed his eyes for a moment....<br><br>An old man appeared behind him and asked 'Looking for something?'<br>'.....' No answer..........<br>Old man sighed 'Young Lad, She has not found what she truly wants, that's why nobody could ever capture her heart.<br>when you thought she is complete and loved her....she is not and this journey have to be her own.'<br>'You cannot walk this route for her.'<br>He continued 'This journey is necessary for her good, for her growth and for her destiny.'<br>'You have done your role well and will be rewarded in time to come. You have learned precious lesson yourself.'<br>'Till she has found what she needs, then will she choose her master. It might take years.....'<br>'Ask not for her to come back, hope not.<br>Ask for her to be save and healthy......'<br><br>'Some things are meant to beÂ…. some are not.'<br><br></div>

It was so damn bloody obvious to everyone that she is making use of him in terms of $$$ and companionship .. then one time , my friend had to go overseas for a while for 2 weeks , and every FUCKING single day , i see her with the other friend , either at our frequent joint or going to his house .. man I think about it now blood still boil ! Anyway , she went to pick him up at the airport 2 weeks later and the BITCH had the gall to say that for the past 2 weeks she behave herself .. Aaargh .. that very night , I went to the pub and gave her a HUGE piece of mind .. she muz have though all his friends are passive and timid .. Mmm one thing that till now I still dun understand .. how come she dumb enuff to act intimately with the other friend in front of us  ? .. but I digress ..<br><br>Anyway , the bottomline is this , i dunno if u r as " seow " as my friend .. I hope u r not cos everyday is like an emotional rollercoaster for him .. but the thing is he has managed to move on . The day he declared his intention , I told him to delete her number from his Hp .. it's like going thru cold turkey for him ..  he was so addicted to her .. but our group of friends take turn to console him and keep him company .. and juz like drug rehab , the first step is the most difficult but things can only get better .. u will need a lot of emotion support ..<br><br>Forget about the idea of being her bf for 1 week u also happy ... simply not worth it .. drop her faster than a bucket of horseshit  and remove her from your life .. u still have your own life to live .. imagine how many missed opportunties in the 6 years tat u were in love with her ..  As for my friend , yes he is still single and going after another girl now .. dunno if he will succeed but I DAMN sure that he IS happier than last time ..<br><br>Take care ..<br><br>PS :  dun blame me if certain part u dun understand or ceratin word missing , now it's 4 am in the morning sure gonggong one ..</div>
