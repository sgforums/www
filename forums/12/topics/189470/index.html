Your ex is your PAST. If you can't let go of your EX., why even think about this girl in the 1st place..? So LET'S GET YOUR MIND CLEAR 1ST... YOU WANNA THINK ABOUT YOUR EX OR ABOUT THIS GIRL?

Think of me working happily with my colleagues... Does that mean I would need to have anything to do with every single one of them...? As you were saying this girl is mature... I think your thoughts have to be more practical and realistic too...?  Not to throw a wet blanket on you... But do you have other more obvious hints or evidences in which points to the fact that she might be interested in you other than the fact that both are you are 'happily working together'...?<br><br>Last thing. Even if she leaves the workplace, you can also request to stay in contact..? You don't have to be desperate but take the initiative pls....? If she has the slightest interest in you, often a girl won't reject your offer for that too soon or directly... And yes, there're sometimes but exceptions to this... Some who are too shy or too defensive and fast in their response... Even a playing 'hard to get' girl shouldn't be that stupid as to totally cut off your chance if she's interested herself...<br><br>For the sake of those too shy/ too defensive/ fast to respond type of girls... You might like to try the '2 pins method'... Meaning you try to ask somewhere soon to keep in contact and for meet ups... If they reject you too soon in a moment of hurry though they might really be interested in you, give them an 'oops period'.... Ask her again when the date of her leaving is drawing really quite near (but must SURE you get your timing right.. Don't face a scenerio where she takes leave and left the office earlier than ya expected)..... If there should be any regrets at all for her, now should be a good time for her to turn around... And pls remember to make it easy for her to 'step down'... Some girls mind their image and 'face'.... If she reject you again, you should very well give up by then...
