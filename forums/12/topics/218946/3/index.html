            <div class='col-md body'>Being headstrong is fine, SpecOps, but you need to keep your wits about you or you could do yourself a lot of damage.  The hotter things get, the cooler you need to be because it's the only way to work through sticky situations.  Stay rational and make your points logically - you'll need to do that if you're going to get your point across and successfully negotiate your way into a favourable solution.  Also remember that anything you say in the heat of the moment is going to come back and bite you in the ass.  I suspect that what you've said has already been used against you by the girls - don't give them any more ammunition.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just had a 1-to-1 session with the tutor. He was shocked that I'm accepting him into the group. I'm not going to fight fire with fire now, going to do it with a huge flood of water. The tutor was telling me how upset the group is and is shocked by by coolness and the emphasis that the rock-bottom line is that results and grades is what matters and that is an bona fide fact which we can't run away from. Thus, my reservations about him is based on that alone. He was telling me that he's going to send that guy for counselling sessions with the in-house counsellor.So yeah, I think I've met my objective, but still most imptly..if he doesn't perform, he gets the sack.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SpecOps87:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm currently in my 2nd year of Poly. As we all know, Poly life is project after project and there are leeches abound. 1 a chinese guy Mr. Personality whom I worked with in both semesters of my 1st year in poly,he's proven to be a total leech. The sort whom will not come for project meetings, not do his share of the project work and even has the guts to say this," Project grades everyone get the same, what for I put in so much effort?"He spends the time studying for the tests and exams at home while we slog in school and burn late into not the night, but morning arriving in school damn shag because we only had like 1/2hrs of sleep.<br><br>The other guy, Mr.Religious, is persistently absent from project meetings because he has to go to mosque (we excuse that) and that he has to work to make ends meet at home. Though I understand that Muslim males have to go to the mosque for prayers every Friday, he goes everyday,is there such a law/rule?I mean balls man, in poly, there are many people like that and I don't see them being unable to cope with schoolwork. To set the record straight, I'm also working for my allowance, bills,books etc. So I don't see why he is shagged and I'm not. I always make it a priority to finish the projects as I'm the group leader and its my responsibility to make sure everything is in perfect order as I'm responsible for 4 the results of 4 other souls. Also, we ran a business selling beachwear as a project assignment, is there such an Islamic law/rule which says that guys cannot touch bikinis? As he refuses to help with the packing ,stock take of the bikinis, but yet...he bought a bikini for his girlfriend during the sourcing period. So any Muslim friends here,please answer the above.<br><br>Having booted the two of them out,the remaining groupmembers consists of 3 girls. The 2 leeches were pretty confident in the 1st week that other groups will accept them, but none were willing to take them in. So they had to beg the tutors for help. Upon learning this, the 3 girls were full of sympathy and we ended up quarrelling over the 2 leeches which I feel is totally not worth spoiling the good working relationship we have. They were saying that the 2 of them know their mistakes and are willing to repent, but that I'm not giving them a chance to. But the thing is, they have proven time and again that they are persistent leeches and when they got kicked out, the sob story will flow. I'm trying to do the right thing as a group leader to keep the 2 of them out, so that we can go further and acheive more rather then be hindered by the 2 leeches. But they are insisting that I take them in and give them a chance to repent, thing is, they already had 3 semesters to repent, so why have they not done so. And if others are not willing to accept them, doesn't that show that I'm not biases nor prejudiced towards them but being objective and professional about work?<br><br>Sighz...I really need people to talk to...doing whats Right and whats Accepted is really tearing me apart.</div></blockquote>if i were you, i would have just told the truth, get them have a record of not doing their specified role of work<br><br>reason - simple : they never learn. a leopard will never change its' spots.<br><br>by showing sympathy to others, means that you are being kind to be a prey yourself to a leopard (purposely being kind let others make use of you for what?)<br><br>in work, these things can't be avoided, but since it's in sch, what can be avoided, just avoided, get a smooth path is better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok,this is the latest update of the situation, Mr. Religious wants to head the Advertising Project, but, I've disagreed.Why? Because just last week, there was a submission for another subject of which he is the Asst. Project Manager and both him and another teammate who was the Project Manager failed terribly. Why did they fail? Because they did a "half-pregnant" job...by that I meant they just cut and paste every single thing that we sent to them for consolidation and they just put it together, without taking the little effort to go through the project just to check the language, it ended up looking like a work done up to resemble Frankenstein! The language is horrible, the formatting ain't there and it's basically not work which you would expect from a Yr.2 Polytechnic student.<br><br>They tried to shrug off the responsibility at the last minute by sending the report to me at 0930hrs when the submission was at 1000hrs, expecting me to edit and submit. Of course I didn't, even though I was in school at that time, I lied that I was just leaving home. Because its impossible for me to do anything, given the lateness of which they sent me the report, there's nothing I could have done. So in the end,a fellow teammate just submitted the "Frankenstein" report and I expect the whole lot of us to get a C at best. So far, Mr. Personality has been pretty okay, doing his work, and so on, so to be fair, I've got no complains against him. Mr. Religious now wants to head the Advertising project, given his previous fark-up, would anyone in a right frame of mind consent to it? I told him that no way would I allow him to be the leader, but he retorted by saying that the group was unanimous with him being the Advertising lead from the start which is bulls*it when I went to find the others. I was damn pissed because he goes around bossing us to do work, but ends up going out with his girlfriend while we slogged our butts off. Which is totally unacceptable ain't it? Thing is, nobody in the group is willing to take responsibility of their results and everyone just wanna be neutral to the situation which is impossible to be in the case. How do you progress if everyone is so passive about it?<br><br>This really irks me, but frankly, I'm against him being a leader because a leader sets the direction and pace at which the team heads. How can you lead if you've got no direction for yourself? And the most damning thing is, I really fought hard to improve my grades, I wanna use my Diploma as a ticket to a Uni, and like Gedanken said, I'm not here to make friends and play happy family, I'm here to do my best and learn whatever I can.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I encountered such a problem before ...I went straight and complained . I did the work of 5 people for 2 semesters in poly , which was good training for university. I was treated like an outcast because those 4 were  popular kids. I didn't give a damn, just went straight to my tutor who gave them a fail mark straight away .<br><br>I ended up working with the other outcasts and we all did very well after that .<br><br>Now when anyone hinders my project at work - I let them dig their own grave and then push them into their own grave with the blessing of my superiors.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nth is really right actually.<br>IMO actions and humans are only split into three sections.<br><br>1.People that do things that are socially accepted<br>2.People that do things that are benefitial to them.<br>3.Idiots that dunnoe what they are doing and what to do.<br><br>But what benefitial and what is not you got to sort it out urself la.<br><br>The two girls are just being emo. And emo is not a good sign if you wanna be successful in this world. So just dont care about them. The leeches are just trying to make use of the girl's typical emo attitude to get into the group. So no matter what stand ur point dont let them in. As for ur malay friend. He is just another typical example of slacking malay that gives dumb religion excuse.<br><br>This is what i hate about project work.<br><br>Together<br>Everyone<br>Achieves<br>More<br><br>PUI ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now, if I remember correctly, the conclusion that was reached when you last discussed the situation with your tutor was that is Mr Religious doesn't perform, he's out on his arse.<br><br>Well, how did we get from him fighting to stay in the team to him becoming leader?<br><br>Fits mistake I see is that you've spoken to him and the rest of the group separately.  Why allow a "he said, she said" situation to arise?  If he wants to claim that the whole group is behind him, make it a vote with everyone present.<br><br>Second, your tutor already knows your reservations about this loser.  Why not bring up the Frankenstein project with him and get some follow-up?  After all, Religious' continued membership in the group is contingent upon his keeping up the work, which he's obviously not doing.  If I recall correctly, we discussed keeping him to timelines, and your boy has failed in this respect if he's going to be handing in his part of the project a lousy half hour before H-hour.<br><br>Bottom line is that you've been reasonable and given him more than a chance to get his sh*t sorted out, and now this guy has not only failed again, he wants to bring everybody down with him.</div>
