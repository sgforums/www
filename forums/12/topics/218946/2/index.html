They should also see your situation too.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Step back and look at the parameters of the situation, and the course of action is pretty straightforward.<br><br>First, the title of the thread already shows that you have closed off options.  Why should it be what's right <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> what's accepted?  Are the two mutually exclusive?  I would suggest that an adjustment of both would result in a meeting point in which it can be both right and accepted.<br><br>Let's look at your bottom line.  You want the marks.  Simple as that.  Who you get the marks with and how it gets done are independent considerations, so treat them independently when you're working out your plan.<br><br>Next, the strongest point you have on your side is that you are basing your conclusions on what these two guys have DONE, while the girls are basing their approach on what they have SAID.  Obviously the stronger evidence is in your favour, so squeeze the girls on that one.  You already have proof that these two slackers are dead weight - if they want to bring the guys back in the team, they have to CONVINCE you that things will work out this time.  There's no need to get emotional when discussing this point with them.  Be cool, calm and logical, and use every bit of your experience with these guys to rebut whatever the girls say, and place the emphasis on ACTIONS, not words.<br><br>Ideally, by now you should have the girls in a corner.  Point out that you've given them every opportunity to make their case, but there's nothing that they've done that guarantees protection of the bottom line - the marks.  Make sure you bring it back to the marks because you need to keep this business-like.<br><br>At this point, you have two options.  Either shut the whole discussion down or give the girls a way out.  The former option is ill-advised, since it could well result in damage to the group's morale.  What about a way out for them, then?<br><br>Reiterate the point that this is business, not personal.  At the end of the day each of you will take marks away from this, and that's the only thing that counts here.<br><br>In light of that, the first issue to be addressed is where the team is at currently, and what needs to be done.  Remind the girls that what the two slackers do is much more important than what they say, so if they want back in, they're going to have to perform some actions that demonstrate their intentions.  Set aside a few tasks that they will need to do to earn probationary status in the team.  For example, if the bikinis haven't already been packed, give them a clearly set time to finish the job.  If they don't do it, they can't convince you that they're a good bet and that's the end of the issue.  The objective of this is to shift the responsibility of the outcome from yourself (in making the decision) to them (in proving their good intent).  If they fail, the blame falls squarely on them.<br><br>If they do pass and get back in the team, you're going to have to lay it out for them.  They've obviously got work practice problems that you will have to talk to them about, and you're going to have to put measures in to address these problems.  Also, if they do complete the task, get back in and screw it up again, at the very least you'll have cut your losses by getting soem work out of them.<br><br>From the sounds of it, your team isn't doing much project management.  From what you've described, it sounds like tasks are assigned to each team member on a lassiez faire basis, and no strict timelines are being defined.  You need to build it into your team processes that everybody knows exactly what they're supposed to be doing and by exactly when, and these assignments have to be done in the presence pof the whole team so that it doesn't become an individual argument.  Make it clear to these guys that if they fail to meet their deadlines, they're out because their failure will be at everybody's expense.<br><br>In summary, get the bums to earn their place back in the team by SHOWING that they're serious instead of just saying it, and institute measures to keep them under control.  If they fail, it give you clear grounds to chuck them out again without further need for debate.<br><br>The girls seem to be thinking with God-knows-what, so you're going to have to be the one to set things on the right path.  Make sure that everything you do is logical and ties in to the bottom line and that they know it - it's business, not personal.  Besides, if you cannot make a clear connection between your actions and the bottom line, you're wasting your time and energy.  On the basis of past history, the two guys are on very thin ice, and if they want back in they're going to have to agree on the stipulated conditions WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE JOB GETS DONE AND THAT THE WHOLE TEAM ACHIEVES THE BOTTOM LINE.  I also suggest that if the girls want the guys back in the team so badly, they have to put their money where their mouth is and act as guarantors to ensure that the guys meet their commitments - they're the ones who want the bums back, so it's their job, not yours.<br></div>

Just make sure that you've got everything covered before you do anything else, or you won't have an airtight case.<br><br>Assuming that you've done everything up to this point, it's time to escalate.<br><br>Prepare your case before you bring your lecturer in on this:<br><br>1) You're going to need a record of exactly how these two guys have dropped the ball, and it has to show a clear history of their unwillingness to pull their weight.<br><br>2) You'll also need a step-by-step account of all of your negotiations with the girls to this point, showing that you have taken every reasonable course of action, but thbey're the ones being stubborn, and that what they're proposing is unworkiable in light of the history with the two guys.<br><br>3) Third, you're going to have to start talking to the other groups.  If they're aware of the situation as you have described it, they could be open to you joining their team.

And frankly, there are many other such leeches in the other classes, I do not wish to make myself seem as a refugee centre and end up making it seem obligated to accept those that have been outcasted. I just hope that they just allow the lecturers/tutors to let us draw lots on whose group they get put into. Franky, I do not do things which I do not have confidence in and this is an example of me not having the slightest example. You know human psychology, when people are desperate, they will sell their mothers if they can meet their objectives. I'm unwilling to have someone promise the world and end up having me played as a fool. With me its always trust until they have been proven to be not trustworthy and we all know how difficult it is to earn somebody's trust. The girls keep comparing my latitude of forgiveness to my ex girlfriend and how much tolerance I have as compared to the two of them.But thing is...thats a persona issue,and this is business. With my girlfriend, the only ones affected is the two of us, but with this two, its the entire group of 4/5 other people.

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay first of all.<br><br>The bo chup leech:<br><br>Avoid these people at all costs.<br>I was studying in an arts institute in Singapore and this overseas indian girl wiggles her way into my cohort without so much as even a portfolio.<br>I'm not normally the kind of person who'd <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> make friends with someone because of their race/religion/whatever, unless I really just can't stand their personalities or whatever.<br>We were put into groups. And my troubles began. She started liking some loser guy in school and on the pretext of doing our assignment (one of which was supposed to be a life-sized oil painting of our chosen visual concept), would drag me to the guy's house here he lived in an dingy apartment with 4 other guys and slept on the same bed.<br>I'd sit in the opposite room while she flung herself around these guys; I was drawing up the drafts, organising the research material, etc, etc. Basically, everything.<br>She'd drop by every now and then, take a pencil lazily and doodle on a piece of paper. She doesn't have any art background whatsoever, and every 2 seconds she'd start lamenting - "OHHHH, MY BRAIN IS NOT WORKING" in her thick accent which really started to drive me mad when she said it for the kabazillionth time in the 5 minutes she sat with me.<br>Then she'd make up some sad excuse ("Oh, [Name] is calling me, oh, I wanna see what [Name] is doing!")<br>Where she'd go into his room and later I found out they were making out on the cheap 2nd hand mattresses in that room with those 4 guys sitting inside pretending to be asleep. WTF?!<br>I got so pissed I told her I can't work like this if she's not doing her end of the bargain - to contribute ideas at the very least if she's so damn useless.<br><br>In the end, I got all the work done, from drafts, to research material, to the final work. YES, I painted a friggin life-sized oil painting in half the time a single person was supposed to be given, because we were supposed to work in two's.<br>I didn't write her name down. I told the teacher this is my work. By then I had a reputation in school, thanks to this girl, who skipped classes to go to the guy's house and I followed sometimes in hopes she will contribute - as being a 'bad influence to <strong>her</strong>.<br>Later, I found out she had been b|tching to the teacher behind my back that <strong>I</strong> was holding the project back.<br>That was the last straw. I stopped answering her calls. I stopped talking to her. She really lost a gold mine and she knew it. She kept pestering me and stalking me.<br>But I got so pissed I just told her to "Get out of my life."<br><br><strong>Morale of the story: </strong>DON'T GIVE IN TO SUCH PEOPLE. CUT THEM OFF BEFORE THEY RUIN YOU.<br>If not, give them a stern warning that their names will not be submitted and your teachers be informed of their lack of contribution.<br><br>The Religious fellow:<br><br>Look. Everyone has a religion. Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Satanists, Wiccans, Voodoo people...WHOEVER!!<br>Them using their religion is AN EXCUSE to shirk their responsibilities. Tell me. Is this Muslim guy you're talking about, going to tell his boss, "Eh, boss, I need to pray my 5 prayers so cannot attend your morning meeting, afternoon meeting and friday meetings."<br>People have their religious obligations yet I'm pretty sure the MAJORITY OF THEM around the world get their work done in spite of these obligations. Him using religious obligations as an excuse makes him pathetically sly because he knows that most people will bow down to his incompetence due to their fear of offending his sensibilities.<br>Sure, he needs to work. Okay. But I'm sure apart from school he doesn't work 12 hours EVERYDAY right?<br><br>Such people just misuse anything they can to do less.<br>Either. GET RID OF SUCH PEOPLE if you're too soft hearted to handle them or know you might be pressurized by them.<br><br>Or set down STRICT GROUND RULES.<br>Work? Okay. Give your work schedule..We set a couple of project meetings after your work to be fair to others who do the project when you're absent and working.  If too much work, cut back working hours in at least 2 -3 days to accomodate project stuff.<br>Prayers? Only friday right? Ok, after friday prayers we meet outside the MRT station nearest to your mosque and go somewhere to do our work.<br>If he want to pray the 5 daily prayers he can still do that while you guys are doing the project and get back to work because daily prayers don't take more than 5 min! (Good to read up about religions! LOL. Hard for others to fool u. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>LEECHES ARE ONLY ABLE TO SHIRK WHEN THEY KNOW THEY CAN PRESSURIZE YOU INTO SUBMISSION BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE 'POLITE'.<br>Politeness doesn't work.

            <div class='col-md body'>*sigh*  SpecOps, I cannot overemphasise this: it's BUSINESS, not personal.<br><br>You're taking things personally now, and that's the easiest way to do yourself in - you now run the risk of fighting to win battles that will eventually lose the war for you, and if you're focussing on these personal issues, you're taking energy away from your bottom line.  I strongly recommend you stop it, and stop it now.<br><br>When you meet with your tutors tomorrow, use a simple check to keep yourself on the right track.  Whatever you say, make sure that it relates directly to your bottom line before you say it.  If you can't easily link it to your bottom line, i.e. your marks, IT'S NOT WORTH SAYING.  Don't go off-track, because if you do, even the tutors who know that these polesmokers have no right to be in your group will feel the need to distance themselves from your stance.<br><br>I'll say it again: it's BUSINESS, not personal.  Remember that.</div>

This is one of those situations.  Find a group that's got its sh*t together and go with them - you get the marks and that's all that counts.</div>
