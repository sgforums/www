            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I'm currently in my 2nd year of Poly. As we all know, Poly life is project after project and there are leeches abound. 1 a chinese guy Mr. Personality whom I worked with in both semesters of my 1st year in poly,he's proven to be a total leech. The sort whom will not come for project meetings, not do his share of the project work and even has the guts to say this," Project grades everyone get the same, what for I put in so much effort?"He spends the time studying for the tests and exams at home while we slog in school and burn late into not the night, but morning arriving in school damn shag because we only had like 1/2hrs of sleep.<br><br>The other guy, Mr.Religious, is persistently absent from project meetings because he has to go to mosque (we excuse that) and that he has to work to make ends meet at home. Though I understand that Muslim males have to go to the mosque for prayers every Friday, he goes everyday,is there such a law/rule?I mean balls man, in poly, there are many people like that and I don't see them being unable to cope with schoolwork. To set the record straight, I'm also working for my allowance, bills,books etc. So I don't see why he is shagged and I'm not. I always make it a priority to finish the projects as I'm the group leader and its my responsibility to make sure everything is in perfect order as I'm responsible for 4 the results of 4 other souls. Also, we ran a business selling beachwear as a project assignment, is there such an Islamic law/rule which says that guys cannot touch bikinis? As he refuses to help with the packing ,stock take of the bikinis, but yet...he bought a bikini for his girlfriend during the sourcing period. So any Muslim friends here,please answer the above.<br><br>Having booted the two of them out,the remaining groupmembers consists of 3 girls. The 2 leeches were pretty confident in the 1st week that other groups will accept them, but none were willing to take them in. So they had to beg the tutors for help. Upon learning this, the 3 girls were full of sympathy and we ended up quarrelling over the 2 leeches which I feel is totally not worth spoiling the good working relationship we have. They were saying that the 2 of them know their mistakes and are willing to repent, but that I'm not giving them a chance to. But the thing is, they have proven time and again that they are persistent leeches and when they got kicked out, the sob story will flow. I'm trying to do the right thing as a group leader to keep the 2 of them out, so that we can go further and acheive more rather then be hindered by the 2 leeches. But they are insisting that I take them in and give them a chance to repent, thing is, they already had 3 semesters to repent, so why have they not done so. And if others are not willing to accept them, doesn't that show that I'm not biases nor prejudiced towards them but being objective and professional about work?<br><br>Sighz...I really need people to talk to...doing whats Right and whats Accepted is really tearing me apart.</div>

And they can't be kicked out so easily, because the system doesn't allow it. Once the project starts, you can't kick anybody out,even if they are persistent screw-ups.And I agree projects is an experience,but nonetheless...you still have to haul your share of the weight right? Its not fair to the others whom haul their weight but they just enjoy the fruits of our labour and add to the weight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed. Its more of experience. You lay the rules, get them to sign some contract or smth. Lay it in black and white. If you still worried, get a lecturer or tutor to witness the contract signing.<br><br>Black and white... to protect yourself and your other team members who make contributions to the projects.<br><br>Monitor their contributions and work commitments to the projects.
