It very hard for poly student to change to the course they like. Especially changing to another poly. One of my friend gone through such experience when he change course last year.<br><br>He got 13 points for L1R4 O level. And no poly is willing to accept him because they said he already given a chance when he first enter poly. The system work this way, if u are under JAE u are quite safe. But poly half way change course are considered DAE liao. Even my friend got 13 point, he couldnt even get a engineering course in RP. Cos those JAE (those just finished 'O' or quit 'A' half way) are priority. But fortunate for him, he got his course only the day before school term start.<br><br>Btw he went to the extend of meeting MP, writing to Edu minister and his sec principal to seek for help.<br><br>So TS better dun change course. Good luck then!</div></blockquote>I am following your friend's foot step.<br><br>So in the end, where he ended up?</div>

You can call me Darkness/Darkie/Duckie. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Same like most people, my mediocre O level result couldn't land me into the Polytechnic which I like. I wanted to do Biomedical Science at Ngee Ann or Singapore Polytechnic, but my result are just too average. I could only blame myself.<br><br>Back then I am only able to choose a handful of courses, which one of them, is Biomedical Science course from RP. I accepted the offer. Since Problem-Based Learning is new to me at that time, I decided to give it a try. Who knows someday I might like PBL style.<br><br>After attending lessons at RP for 8 weeks, I feel that PBL is definitely not my cup of tea. The learning in RP is not as efficient as the other four polytechnic.
