Look at it this way, if they know how to do business why did they end up teaching? Its like the fortune teller who can predict tomorrows winning 4d number but not betting himself......</div>

I regretted not putting BIT as one of my choice though I may not be even given entry.<br><br>I've just finished my first semester.<br><br>I do intend to talk to my careperson about it. It's not that I can't cope with it. It's just that my interest does not lie in IT.<br><br>I wanna go to University. Because only then, I will be able to pursue what I really want. Which is business. But I don't want to study private. I wanna go into either NUS, SMU or NTU. At least the cert is recognised.<br><br>But my first semester's GPA already destroyed the chances. I got 3.19<br><br>Now getting into Uni isa big competition. I would probably need a 3.8 to be able to even compete with other applicants. Sigh..<br><br>I wish to transfer to a course which is more business-oriented. But time is running out for me.<br></div></blockquote>Ok<br><br>First of all , IT is a skill - alot of businesses are using technology to operate. No point in studying business without a skill like IT, accountancy , economics, banking and finance. There is always bound to be something you don't like in every course but at the end of the day , it might be very useful.<br><br>Second of all, a diploma you don't like is never the end of the route. It will be useful later . Think in terms of the wider picture , in fact ...think out of the box. I took up nursing because my parents won't pay for anything else. I used nursing to get to where I want. I did my master in another subject while surviving on nursing. Nursing is still a useful skill for me even though it was never my intention to stay in Nursing. I am dealing with some aspects of health informatics and biostatistics now -  and nursing came in useful.<br><br>Third of all, local universities are not the only universities you can go to. You can try out for overseas ones or distance learning later. It is what you make out of yourself.<br><br>Good Luck and All the best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup, not worth changing course liao. It very hard for poly student to change to the course they like. Especially changing to another poly. One of my friend gone through such experience when he change course last year.<br><br>He got 13 points for L1R4 O level. And no poly is willing to accept him because they said he already given a chance when he first enter poly. The system work this way, if u are under JAE u are quite safe. But poly half way change course are considered DAE liao. Even my friend got 13 point, he couldnt even get a engineering course in RP. Cos those JAE (those just finished 'O' or quit 'A' half way) are priority. But fortunate for him, he got his course only the day before school term start.<br><br>Btw he went to the extend of meeting MP, writing to Edu minister and his sec principal to seek for help.<br><br>So TS better dun change course. Good luck then!</div>
