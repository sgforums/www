              <p><br>i agree. and i not just saying it hypothetically. honeymoon period is when couples build upon that spark and turn it into a flame. important because when shit happens (and it will), and they look back, they'll see why they fell in love in the first place and hopefully tide things through.</p>
              <p>if you don't have any strings of attachment ... and just "feeling" ... u're just horny. don't worry - it's normal. every morning i wake up horny, whether or not i got any last night.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the advise! Had a really sincere talk with her and it kinda worked, though she still wants an answer from me for "why I like her".</p>

              <p>I guess this is also because of her family members who are always pressurizing her. They don't really agree to starting a relationship that "young". Met them a few times yet they ain't that strict either.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, she will be leaving Singapore next year to further her studies while I'll be in NS. This probably adds on to her insecurity. I'm very afraid of the worst scenario too when it happens.</p>
