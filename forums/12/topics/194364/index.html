How about your CCA records and work experience? Because from what I know BAT selects only the best of the best.. so its very likely you have 1 or 2 of the above. Thats why I was really impressed if you made it into BAT<br><br>As for being a management trainee, did the company promise you that there will definitely be guranteed employment after you have completed the training phase? From what I heard and know of... there will elimination.. say given a scenario of 10 trainees only 2 or 3 will make it and become high flying management personnel.. the rest don't even get a chance for relocation within the same company... based on what I know</div>
