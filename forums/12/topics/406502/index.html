              So far throughout my working experience, no one have ever talked to me rudely before. But even if it does happen one day, I will try to brush it off, as I always avoid direct conflict =) 
              
              But to my friends, I always react back with sarcasm. So . . . =X

              <p>That would entirely depend on you. Of course there is a limit to how much nonsense you can take. Some co-workers in the office are out there to denegrade you, and you must stand up and defend yourself. You must put a limit and only tolerate up to a certain level, if some other department doesn't cooperate with you and speak to you in a ridiculous way, even though the person knows he is wrong, he doesn't admit it, but continue to be rude to you, you have to put up a stand. And if your boss doesn't support you, you have to stand up for yourself.</p>
              <p>That day, a certain fella from another department didn't give me his full cooperation, he has been procastinating and putting off my work for several months, so I decided I had enough, I emailed to him and cc to the big boss. Yesterday, my big boss wasn't happy with me for using his name, but I did what I thought was right. I told myself, I want some personal job satisfaction, damn it ! I have every right to get that thing from him. Sometimes in life you need thick skin, if you need to get something done, no matter how people are angry with you or play politics at you, you have to put up a fight but fight smart and not get yourself in trouble.</p>
              <p>Another day, somebody was rude at me, when I came over and try to get my work done, but when a certain lady came to him, he became very nice and sweet to her. But I didn't care, I said to myself, I want job satisfaction and I am not going to be intimidated by his double standard attitude, so I continued to pester him until I get my job done. I didn't do my job to get approval from my boss, I do it to fulfill my own satisfaction of my job.</p>
              <p>Another day when I had to ask my superior for something i didn't know how to do, he told me off that I should figure all this myself, and I shouldn't be spoon fed. I didn't care what he said because it was illogical to expect me to do this, I already told him during the interview that I needed training to do this kind of work, so he agreed. So, I didn't buy his political mumbo jumbo garbage logic, instead I continued to pester him to let me know where I can access and use the data or else I am wasting time here. I didn't sign up for this rubbish, if I can figure this myself, I mind as well open up a rival company and compete with my current company. But since I am an employee, I expect some decent level of training, briefing and standard of workmanship, only then, independence and creativity on my work talents can be developed. Important thing is to have your own work philosophy and don't let others brain wash you.</p>
              <p>You may not be able to react but you can show them your disagreement by showing your lobby for the your working style.</p>

              <p>Reacting and standing up for yourself = saving millions with your revolutionary style</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But please do not Rebel Without A Cause, because James Dean tried it and he's dead. CSJ tried it and he was in deep trouble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Learn from STARWARS, use the force. If you feel strongly that you have some percentage of surviving it, then you must go ahead and fire your proton torpedoes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you allowed people to insult and humiliate you, then you're just born to be cheap and low. Even if you end up becoming the CEO of the CEOs in the future, people who know you will remember and savour the times when they insulted and humiliated you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is that the kind of future you are aiming for by enduring? If yes, then you can only blame yourself for being worthless and useless. And next time you can only watch your wife, girlfriend, and daughters get raped in front of your eyes because it's the same helplessness that you have chosen to ENDURE for life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>See if you can endure this post or not first. And don't push the blame upon others just because you got a cheap and wimpy character. Blame yourself for deciding to  make your own stupid choice of self-preservation. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
