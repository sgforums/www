              <p>As a landlord myself, I find your story somewhat hoakey.</p>
              <p>There's a break lease clause in lease agreements.</p>
              <p>I think you are just too cheap to cough up the penalty for a break lease. And is using this "disorderly neighbour" as an excuse.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think the people who is really the trouble maker is your family.</p>
              <p>I doubt you are the first tenant for the apartment owner. If the previous tenants does not have any problem before, then it's probably your family causing a din. And it is understanable that your neighbour is mad at you.</p>

              <p>Dragg,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I first seeked lawyers' advice -I wasn't seeking advice to sue them - I was seeking how to break the lease- he told me all about the Joo Chiat saga and that basically we cannot technically break our lease. We could only appeal to the good nature of the landlord. Which didn't work. 3 lawyers told me that same thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Durian_bananas,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can assure you that my hubby didn't attack them. But we have been so worn down by their harassment that we were advised (by the magistrate's office) that if we are unwilling to offer an apology - the process would be prolonged. My hubby was very clear to the magistrate that he is apologizing because he wanted to move on with his life, and leave this awful incident behind. He specifically apologized for going downstairs BUT never apologized for assauting the neighbour nor admitted to it. When the complainants asked for $10K compensation, my husband plainly said no.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not on the forum to recite what happened on that day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am talking about the justice in this matter. Obviously the complainants are a little nuts, but the police, management, magistrate are condoning their behavior, by tolerating it!</p>

              <p>Then if you are so adamant, appeal against the decision. Don't pay the fine lah, hire the lawyers to fight the case. Accusing your husband of fisting them when it didn't happen (according to you) is tantamount to defamation. The ball's in your court. To think you want to get it over leaves a lot of gaps in your story.</p>
              <p>And why do you want to do such a thing, dropping golf balls when you know your neighbour doesn't like such things? You know their hot buttons, so don't go looking for trouble by provoking them. I do not think any rational or irrational people would go to such lengths to taunt you and your husband unless you must have done something to provoke them. If you know they don't like the noise made by you - whether its stamping your feet or dropping golf balls, then don't do it.</p>

              <p>The condo's council hire the management team to do their job for them.</p>
              <p>The management team's job primarily is to maintain the common areas and administer the strata titles.  They have their hands full, taking care of defects, cleanliness, security and the smooth running of the condo, and also taking care of the accounts and money of the condo. To keep cost down, the team is kept at the minimal.</p>
              <p>Disputes between neighbours are personal matters between them, the management would be wise not to get involved in the feud. Anyway the management team has no clout, and are looked upon as slaves by the residents. The most helpful thing they can do is to provide the warring parties the address of an arbitrator.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Yesterday was the mediation session, and during the hearing in front of the magistrate, my husband wanted to offer a quick apology and head off and leave this unpleasant incident behind. However, both husband and wife were constantly shouting and threw ridiculous accusations at my husband - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">demanding that they wanted $10K compensation, and that we never made noise again.</span> They claimed that we had parties every night until 5am, to which my husband calmly denied. The magistrate had to remind the couple a few times not to interrupt and to not speak to my husband directly. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At the end, he asked my husband whether he was willing to offer an apology. My husband was willing to apologize nonetheless because he wanted this whole incident to be forgotten.</span> The magistrate also told my husband that he was liable for the maximum jail time of 1 year and/or $3000 fine. I was waiting for my husband in the car and when he finally joined me, he was shaken. I went into the surbodinate court reception and clarified what happened. The lady at the reception was very kind and went to the magistrate and clarified before returning to me and now said that they have turned and wanted my particulars for mediation. My question is - just because we are not the complianants does not mean we are not the victims. The magistrate only asked my husband to apologize and whether my husband was willing to compensate them $10K. He did not ask the husband who had kicked my husband - a fact presented to the magistrate beforehand whether HE wanted to apologize.  Both husband and wife claimed that they were traumatized - by their yelling and threatening - does the magistrate not recognize that traumatized people do not act this way??? Does the magistrate not recognise that this couple are the nuisance??? We do not want any apology and just want to live out our lease in peace. When I say in ..........</p>

              <p>1. You believe you never did wrong... so don't apologize... to do that = guilty be it partial or not. It is after all a court.</p>

              <p>I quote from your second paragraph: "<em>At the beginning, neighbour wife send the security over to our home on a daily basis - <strong>up to 5 times a day</strong>. And I mean EVERY SINGLE DAY. During this tme, we got very upset to the point that we gave our name cards to the security office, because we wanted to call us directly instead of sending security to our home while we were at work. She would constantly come to our home and insulted our guests (children) as they came over or were leaving our home. She constantly spied at our place.</em>" <br><br>Why did she, in the beginning, send the security over to your house 5 times a day? I find these statements puzzling. Can you say why? You have not told us the reason. </p>
              <p>In your third paragraph, you said "<em>Wife will complain about children playing quietly 200 m from her doorstep in mid afternoon, demanding that people do not talk at the lift landing, which is at least 75m from her door in daytime. She has complained against us making noise when there was no one home, and by unbearable noise, means accidentally dropping a remote control - when my baby was learning to crawl and hit his head on the floor - and by my now toddler running across the hall."</em></p>
              <p>My understanding from your statements here and there and putting together the overall picture is that your neighbour complained about you and your family because of noise. Am I correct about that? </p>
              <p>Here, I am not placing a judgement of who is right or wrong. Just trying to understand your situation better.</p>
