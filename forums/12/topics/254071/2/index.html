            <div class='col-md body'>hey TS, here is my 2 cents worth.<br><br>I HAD a girlfriend who was ten years older than me. (I won't reveal my age) At the time we were dating, she was earning at least four times more than me.<br><br>We met while attending a 'talk' and she was really nice and caring. In fact, she drives me around and pays for our dinner. And as you know, as time goes I felt more of the subordinate party. And since our relationship was more physical that anything else, it didn't really lead anywhere.<br><br>To be honest I feel that older women who is willing to go out with younger guys are either those who are 'motherly' or those who wish to re explore the 'physical' side of a relationship.<br><br>Age is not a factor, just a facade. Its a whole different experience getting an older woman.</div>
