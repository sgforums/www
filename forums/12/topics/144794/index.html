He hasn't changed abit, he's merely being himself, isn't it?<br><br>I always ask this favourite question whenever people dated known flirts (first began on my tudi) - considering the whole list of ex-es, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what makes you think you would be the one who will change him/her?</strong></span> Everyone before you tried and failed (or couldn't be bothered), so what are the chances?<br><br>These people may change eventually, but if you want to be the ONE who initiate the movement, you have to satisfy certain criteria and alot of emotional endurance. To the common folk, such criteria would probably be deem as 'luck', but it is actually more than that and that would include heavily on the topic of AOS. IMHO, there are only two reasons why nothing works:<br><br>I) You are part of the statistic. You behave and mimic the same psychological and emotional feel of all his past gf. You are not any different and in fact, just like them. You can't change him because your predecessor failed as well.<br><br>II) Astrologically speaking, you wouldn't be the one who change him. Someone had to provide him with the hard lesson and that person may not be you.<br><br>CloUdiSm warned of such relationship, especially when you are viewing and handling it in a form of a serious, committed relationship (of course, it doesn't matter if you are also a player in this game of love). The default law states: <strong>'Avoid first as it's better to be the second</strong>.' The person who changed the player isn't always the person he/she will end up with - very likely, it's the second candidate.<br><br>P.S: If he wants to remain hostile to you, what kind of love do you foresee? Remember, it's not you - it's him. Love cannot assimilate into the unwilling and if he doesn't want the relationship AND treat it like he doesn't want, then forget it. The power of love can create wonders, but it only reserve for hearts who desire to see its magic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

We don't know the person, so we could give you all sorts of answers and still not even come close.<br><br>Noticed something from some of your old threads?<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=132954" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=132954</a><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=131525" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=131525</a><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=74041" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=74041</a><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=71027" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=71027</a><br><br>Your troubles seem to be recurring, don't they? You asked for advice, but the advice given in the old threads weren't very effective, were they? You could change boyfriends, but somehow you are still stuck with similar types of boys who give you similar heartaches over and over. A bit strange, don't you think? Maybe the problem doesn't lie with the boys?<br><br>Anyway, you're still young and there'd be lots of opportunities for you to meet guys -- hopefully better ones -- when you grow older. Perhaps you should just let your heart take a break and put your mind to your school books. Don't want to sound like your mother, but at least you could help yourself solve problems like:<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=141779" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=141779</a><br><br>Taking the time and energy spent on your relationships and investing them on your studies would probably yield better returns, don't you think?<br><br>Love won't feed you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
