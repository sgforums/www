Is this your 1st relationship..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Perhaps not..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>1st thing I've got to let you understand... People at the age of 16 (especially us guys...) have a tendency to be quite focused with the things we wish to do and often pretty occupied with our own developing minds... (and should be very much so for your bf who's a flirt?) It probably sees a curious characteristic and is very unlikely to die off at such a young age... Moreover to add of the way you've described him to be...? Nope... Even more unlikely...<br><br>2nd thing to add... I'm not trying to belittle you because of your age... I believe that people of all ages have the rights to be loved and express their love for others... And 16 can be an age where maturity has developed or is starting to develop... However, it seems from what we've read that you might not have reached that level to soberly maintain your relationship in the right direction yet...? At around your age, you should probably FEEL SO MUCH MORE of LOVE than to know how to effectively run and maintain it (not that adults can certainly do a better job anyway...??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> " )... And your bf doesn't seems to be of that maurity in handling it too...? No offence, but provided that his heart is into maintaining it in the 1st place...? And about HOW MUCH LOVE you're feeling.... Brings us to the NEXT point...<br><br>3rd thing. About YOU. Memories in life are bound to be there. Good ones, bad ones... Break up in a relationship should probably not be easy.. Especially you're put in and felt SO MUCH LOVE in it.... The 'LOVE' that you're feeling now from the way you've described now might not really be coming from him... Well.. AT least not directly...? It's from MEMORIES... Of you and him together... That DESIRE to be LOVED again.. The WAY IT USED TO BE... I can see your urge sense in looking forward to it... But sadly to tell you, I don't seems to feel much from his point... Of the way you've described the situation...<br><br>Last thing... Of the OVERALL SCENERIO.. There could be possible chances that...<br><br>1. He's having some problem(s) or sort in his life now.<br>2. He's growing tired of the relationship and just waiting for it to die off.<br>3. He's irritated by you and somehow perhaps your acts..?<br><br>But.. Don't overreact to ANY of the above... Cause they're just SPECTACULATIONS....<br><br>Ask yourself what you want?<br><br>Tell yourself if you're getting it...?<br><br>Don't say how difficult this and that is IF you do this and that...<br><br>But how difficult it could be if you insist on things when it's not even right in the 1st place...?<br><br>Good luck....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ditch that guy!!!!<br><br>One more thing , I think restricting each other from communicating with the same sex is rather redudant. You can't escape the fact that you interact with the opposite sex almost everyday in school. If you were still with him say 8 years down the road and when you enter the real working world. Suppose one day your boss tells you to collaborate with a few of your colleagues to be part of an organising committee for an upcoming company event and so happens a few of your colleagues are guys. Are you gonna tell your boss , "My boyfriend does not allow me to interact with anyone from the opposite sex." I don't think your boss would entertain such a reply right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I also feel that in relationships involving couples belonging to the same school don't usually work out well (I presume your in sec sch?). Reason being you always see your other half everyday in school unless of course he's absent. There will always be a tendecy to ask your other half , "eh where you wanna go today after school?" or "lets have lunch at the canteen together." There is little or no privacy given to your other half. Although you can say , "I give my bf privacy when he's in school" but I can assure you that the tendency of wanting to be with each other everyday in school is far greater than you can expect. If you're not careful , you might even lose your good buddies because you're always hanging out with your other half thus neglecting your friends. Suppose if you break up with your other half , who's gonna be there for you? Considering the fact that you have already lost your friends. Probably the only person who might wanna help you get through this rough period time would be just another admirer who just wants to get a shot at you upon hearing of your break up. Obviously I'm just stating scenarios here which is possible though.<br><br>By the way , I'm only a year older than you which makes us share similar mentalities towards life...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>No worries , no need to feel paiseh or anything , I'm sure a lot of us are still learning along the way including me!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
