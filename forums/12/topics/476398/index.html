              <p>Hello SGForums!! I'm Okei and I'm new here , hope to gain more knowledge and meet new friends here~</p>
              <p>First of all, sorry if the post is abit long to read,but...<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>So , the O'Level is finally over! Yay! Promnite is very nice,all my classmates had fun,but I don't know if I will be able to smile and laugh with them like this again when I see my O level results next year.</p>
              <p>Admit it , most of the students(including me) have a rough idea or estimation of how well you do for the paper after the exam. No matter how positive I think , my points will be around 26-28.</p>
              <p>I've successfully passed the DPA(Direct Poly Admission) for my desired course which is Game Design but the minimum requirement is 26 and I'm scared I can't get it.(Most probably can't already, I screwed my Chemistry and Amath =w= ) </p>
              <p>So if I get 27 and above , I'll go to Higher Nitec in ITE instead. I'll choose Game Design &amp; Development in ITE too so I can go to Poly after that to further my education.</p>
              <p>I'm basically okay with ITE,I will take it as learning extra knowledge for two years^^</p>
              <p>But I'm afraid my classmates , friends &amp; family members will look down on me because of that and I feel demoralised.</p>
              <p>Most of my classmates aims to go JC and they are like : " HAHAHA you're not kidding me aren't you? ITE means It's The End and you will have a hard time in future, and you will be older than your other classmates."</p>
              <p>And when I ask my relatives for opinions , they do not support ITE too because they think its bad, so most people I know thinks ITE is bad. Why is that so?:/</p>
              <p>I think they offer quite good education but school name just ruined by people whom do not want to study. What do you guys think?:3</p>

              <p>My uncle, who graduated from Nanyang University of the past(before LKY shut it down and turned it into something else), told me that last time people looked down on Nanyang U graduates, and the Chinese educated, and thought those who graduated from UK were the best...It is only after they entered society, what they did, how successful they were in their own field, how they were able to speak better business english, how happy they are in their own family lives, .....nobody need to know where they graduated from, but when they knew he was from nantah...huhhh...nantah graduate can be so successful...honor to your school or institute or university, and your parents.</p>
              <p>scholar from a very prestigious JC, using money from the ministry of education, studied in UK, ended got caught for downloading child pornography....hmmmm...you from ITE should be better than that, if not, don't blame people for looking down on you.</p>

              I agree that the image of ITE students is still not very positive at the moment, and it is caused by the students themselves from the way they conduct themselves.  of course there are good students also, but the image is spoilt by the bad eggs.
              
              But I believe the skills taught there is relevant for today's market.
              
              The image of day time students and night time students for ITE is very different.  Night time students are those working full day and studying part-time.  And therefore the image of the latter is much better.
              
              I have 2 suggestions for you.  If they have night time course, work full time and study part-time at night.  In this way, you can support your own education.
              
              Alternatively, you can sign up for private schools which conduct the course that you want though it may be a bit more expensive.
              
              No matter what, don't give up on your study aspiration due to the issue of image or impression or opinion of others.

              They are not look down you. They are just afraid you cannot get enough money.
              So, you can work hard, and find a business to be a millionaire, then you can look down them.
