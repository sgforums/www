              <p>In my opinion, everyone in this world are equal and people really have no rights to judge other people just because they are more educated. Some people are just not academically inclined but perform better in practical works. Really canot judge people, it's not a right thing to do. </p>
              <p>By the way, you've mentioned you are trying to enter the game development course isn't it? You don't have to go to JC for that ... they don't teach you foundation in making games at all . JC are for people who wants to be professional figures like teachers, doctors, lawyers, aiya ... those require high education post. For media careers, ITE is a good foundation if you can't get into poly. Just try again after you graduate from ITE. Nothing to lose except your youth. Sacrifises must be made to obtain success. </p>

My uncle is a ite student, he finished his NS reservice but still can't find any full time job for himself. He said that most of the people there are not good company, and can easily lead astray. Plus he know that his certificate won't lead him any further. I didn't score well for my O level result. I got a choice of a really bad course in poly (probably the worst) or a really good choice in ite (idk good anot, but i that was my first choice for ite) but i still choose to retain, with another 4 of my friends. Maybe i would dsa or dpa. Although i wasted a year, but at least i can learn something i really like, and get a good certificate. </p></div>

So I do think that in terms of thinking those in JC and polys might doubt your capability but those who realizes that certs dont define a person totally would come to see your values and those are the ones whom you should really care about. In the meantime just make do with those who put you down. Learn to boost your own esteem!</p></div>

Like for example, when all the JCs student are still on their way to Uni learning all the "theory", you're already on your way to having skills learnt. They however only have the facts and theory all these and not doing any hands-on things. If i was a boss, i would definitely employ ite grads. Which boss would want to reteach grads on how to do this etc. That's my opinion, so yeah. </p></div>

              <p>If you have the means to step out and run your own business, it does not matter if you attend ite, jc, poly or even uni. The most important thing is to have a useful skill, and the funds to be independent.</p>
              <p>For the rest who are seeking employment, ITE offers the worst deal.</p>
              <p>1. The pay for nitec is very low, and working conditions are poor. Prospect of career advancement is limited too.</p>
              <p>2. Sure, you can invest two years, do well in nitec and get into poly. But the diploma pay isn't really that high either.</p>
              <p>Assuming you are a guy, you have to serve 2 years of ns before attending your 3 years of poly. You will be 4 years older than your poly classmates, who are fresh out from secondary school. The problems you face will be very different from those faced by 17-year old teenagers.</p>
              <p>3. If you ever make it to uni, where the pay and job prospect are more decent, you can expect to graduate around the age of 30.</p>
              <p>Your friends would have worked for several years by then, went through several rounds of pay-raises and promotions, saved up enough money to buy their own house, while you are just starting out in the workforce, with a big sum of student loans to repay. </p>
