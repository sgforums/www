My wife, who is also working, wants me to take care of our 3-years old son, Elvin, while I am at home so that we can save on child-care. Her argument is that children in day-care are going to be less attached to their parents. Is that true? I donÂ’t agree with her on this arrangement and we have many arguments because of this. First, how does she expect me to work if I were to keep an eye on Elvin? More importantly, I think a child at this stage should be taken care by his mother. It is the mother whom he forms attachment with! I donÂ’t think a father can do the job adequately! While we are on the issue of raising kids, I am also concerned with Elvin who usually throws a tantrum after brief separation from this mother.

            <div class='col-md body'>hey, don't be a MCP. society is equal now. i'm in my late twenties and most of my peers came from a "fatherless" generation. y? b'cos fathers of our gen. r the sole-bread winner. therefore, there's a lack in action by the fathers.<br><br>while the norm is for mothers to look after kids, it is equally important for the fathers to play their part. kids growing up where only mothers are involved in parenting tend to have one-sided view of things(till they're matured enough to think for themselves). furthermore, a father's role tend to be more major when it comes to the child being a son cos your son may end up being like you. like father like son.<br><br>think about it, you'll only have these few years to parent your kid. it is utmost crucial in his upbringing. all the right society values, culture and manners often start at home. if as a parent you don't want to teach your child then whose responsibility is it going to be? primary responsibility falls on both parents. share the burdens with your wife. in singapore where couples often have to work to support the family, it is only wise to help out even when it comes to raising up a child.<br><br>be a good father, husband and a parent. what you sow now will definitely reap in due time...a son that brings glory to the family and the nation...not to mention family bliss.<br><br>God bless. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
