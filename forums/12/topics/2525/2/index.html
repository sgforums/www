Guys carry X-Y chromosomes, Gals carry X-X chromosomes. So whether or not a lady is pregnant with a boy or gal, depends on the sperm of the father. If a Y-carrier sperm fertilise the egg, a boy will be conceived. (the gal is always X bearing.)

The blood type, consist of genotype and phenotype. (a bit chim, sorry)<br>The phenotype is wat u expressed, meaning ur blood group. If the father and mother both are A+, but both also carry genotype O genes, it is still possible for them to have children with O blood type. And as usual, we inherit 1 set of blood typing genes from both our parents.<br><br>Back to the topic.<br>Well, although is mother's side cousin, meaning is ur mom's sibling's daughter? Depends on the conservativeness of ur family. My mom will consider this as incest because this is first degree cousin. But last time pple still allow them to get married.

The genes run in the father's side of the family. DNA strands, particularly the X-Y chromosones, are inherited from the father. That's why you normally inherit the bloodtype from your father. There are various combinations of X-Y chromosones as far as I can remember. X-X, X-Y, Y-X and Y-Y. The genetic diseases are also unlikely to be inherited from the mother's family side.<br><br>However, due to the fact that some families still have conservative ideas about marriage, such an act is considered incest. But from what I know, this cousin(Biao Mei/Di) marriage thing is already practised as far back as in the Ming Dynasty.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Do correct me if I am wrong. All these are quoted from memory.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>Larry,<br><br>Afraid u remembered wrongly.<br>The DNA strand is a double helix. 2 strands coiled together. 1 from the father, 1 from the mother.<br><br>The XY chromosomes are sex chromosomes and definitely has got nothing to do with blood type. Guys carry X-Y chromosomes, Gals carry X-X chromosomes. So whether or not a lady is pregnant with a boy or gal, depends on the sperm of the father. If a Y-carrier sperm fertilise the egg, a boy will be conceived. (the gal is always X bearing.) Last time pple dunno this, so keep blaming the gals to be the one who have "bu zheng qi" stomach.<br><br>The children does not follow the blood type of the father. The blood type, consist of genotype and phenotype. (a bit chim, sorry)<br>The phenotype is wat u expressed, meaning ur blood group. If the father and mother both are A+, but both also carry genotype O genes, it is still possible for them to have children with O blood type. And as usual, we inherit 1 set of blood typing genes from both our parents.<br><br>Back to the topic.<br>Well, although is mother's side cousin, meaning is ur mom's sibling's daughter? Depends on the conservativeness of ur family. My mom will consider this as incest because this is first degree cousin. But last time pple still allow them to get married. But, as previously mentioned, it constitutes to higher chances of genetic disorder and diseases if there are any.<br><br>Sorry, I am so lor sor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
