The biao mei and biao ge thing is becoz in the past they have a very large family... Maybe ur mother's cousin's son or daughter, it's still called biao ge and biao mei. But being ur mother's cousin's daughter, it wun be called incest liaoz. coz no blood relations mahz..

            <div class='col-md body'>Can I ask, are you both serious in the 1st place about yourself and being together? if not, then .... why?  playing with fire of all thing..<br>Anyway, just shared this with you about my old neighbour if you are serious about getting together.  You may need a check up to confrim whether there will be any problem with having children in future.<br><br>About my neighbour, I used to grow up and play with this friend of mine, but I guess it was accidental over the years, this friend of mine started dating his own cousin (from the mother's side).  Needless to say, there were parental objection especially from hte girl's side as my friend's mum is okay with it so ling as the future generation isn't affected.  I do not really know the rest of the detail, except that I think they did the check up and are married with children now (saw them few years ago with their 2 children.  I wonder how and whether do you call that incest, where love had blossomed as a normal relationship between to persons, happen to shared the same surname and are known to be cousins.<br><br>On the other hand, imagine that another couple who got married and yet share the same surname with no relationship tie to it, what do you think.  We were so called related in the past as so called came from the same village of town where everyone shared a common surname.  but as generations gone by, our roots and relation has kind of mutated and the genes factor too all seems too remote unless it is from a direct descendent... anyone can clarify on this .. read somethoing about this very long ago in ST.  Besides, I also understand in the olden days, some of these people from higher places, in order to especade from the wrath of their enemies/emperor, they shifted to some remote places and change their surname too, like wise, some were given a certain surname as a previllege ... therefore, everyone after that follow the surname.. so it does not means we are not related, am I right to say so?  however, best thing, still best o opt for check up to confirm.<br><br>I am maintain a neutral position on this matters as I don't really know the term INCEST exist only until last year when I ame across it.  I thought it would be perfectly normal, just anohter BGR stuff.  Whatever, hope you can sort out this problem</div>
