            <div class='col-md body'>Hey people I'm here to share my love story, I really hope this would be of help to guys facing the same problem as me.<br><br>On 23rd april 04 I met the girl of my dreams, she was perfect, pretty ,kind and very understanding. Went out often spend countless hours at the beach. Did things most couples would have done, shopping etc. She helped me greatly in my studies and in my life. That time I was rather naughty getting into trouble in the law etc. I was in hostel then, she waited for me gave me endless support and love. She didn't mind me, she really did love me for who I was. I must admit  I was not good enough for her, in terms of looks or capablilites. As a BF i was not a good one. I didn't try to understand her friends etc. We'll we held on, I didn't do things most guys would do for their GF like help them carry their bags etc however she didn't complain but held on with me. She always gave in until the very end. Althought she did 2 time me once in june of 04 I forgave her and she was really sorry, I guess this was when our relationship was aheading down the doom's road. She started treating me nice maybe too nice until I was taking her for granted which I truly regret now. She gave up her dreams of going to a JC for me and even gave up her friends for me. I on the other hand did not give up anything I guess, I didn't even treat her with the love she deserved. Only on the 7 of sept this year when we broke up that I knew how bad I was. Tried hard too hard maybe to get her back. Begged and plead tried everything i really did. Now left alone as a part of me is really missing, everything that once seemed important now seems unimportant. Before the break up I did lost faith in us, maybe we were together for too long and even thought of going with someone else. I am really a jerk and a fool for thinking that way and now its too late. I learned something through this experience that loving someone truly means giving in totally and not taking someone for granted. Life will never be the same for me. WelL I'm in the same class as her and shes seeing someone else i guess. I'm happy for her and do not blame her for treating me this way now.<br>Guys listen up when you think your pride and ego is most important remember one thing without her you would really be nothing and giving in althought it may be hard is the best solution otherwise when other guys come into the picture and treat her like a princess, you would truly lose out to them even if u try very very hard. I truly hope no one would ever go through this experience like me its truly hell on earth when someone who loved you so much wouldn't give u a chance after she has laid down so much wonderful memories for u. Guys out there be good bfs and never let you girl down for you will truly regret it, give in when giving in seems impossible and say a simple sorry althought its hard as sorry is a magical word that brings miracles. I really hope my experience will help all those couples who are having trouble now. Take care god bless everyone</div>

Take care god bless everyone</div></blockquote>My ex put me on a pedestal but I din treasure her &amp; took her for granted instead. When I lost her I was totally devastated... I recalled that many years ago, I was very touched by a scene in Stephen Chow's "Journey to the West" where he said some very touching lines prior to becoming the Monkey God. I then reprimanded myself for having taken my ex for granted despite being touched by those lines years ago.. I then scoured the Net for the transcipt and eventually found it. I then told myself if I ever find a new love I'll treasure her so so much:-<br><br><img src="http://img180.imageshack.us/my.php?image=chineseodyssey3zy.jpg"><br><br>Maybe a lot of ppl in this forum have never watched this show but I'm sure ppl born in the 70s and before can relate to this....<br><br>So, in summary, never ever take someone for granted else when it's water under the bridge then it's really fu4 shui3 nan2 shou1....<br><br>U may wanna print the above out &amp; paste it somewhere or print it to a pdf file, for when the One appears later on in ur life, these lines gently remind u not to make the same mistake again...<br><br>All the best in life... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>edit: I am not sure if the image i uploaded will show.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Kelviz,<br><br>Your story is sad, but a common 1.  There're guys who only realise &amp; take their gfs seriously WHEN the relationship has ended.  During that period of time, they took it for granted that they'd always be forgiven, &amp; the gfs would forgive them time &amp; again outta love to the point where they couldn't take it anymore.<br><br>Then again, the split may Not have been that you were horrid, but due to your personalities Not being compatible, &amp; both of you wanting different things in life.  I've experienced this before, some of my exes were actually ok people, but what we wanted in life was different.<br><br>Nevertheless, as the pain must still be very raw, take the time to grieve.  Just be wary of falling into the pattern of wallowing in self pity.  Be strong &amp; move on after awhile.  Take it as a lesson so that in future, you'll be a better partner to someone.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kelviz:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey people I'm here to share my love story, I really hope this would be of help to guys facing the same problem as me.<br><br>On 23rd april 04 I met the girl of my dreams, she was perfect, pretty ,kind and very understanding. Went out often spend countless hours at the beach. Did things most couples would have done, shopping etc. She helped me greatly in my studies and in my life. That time I was rather naughty getting into trouble in the law etc. I was in hostel then, she waited for me gave me endless support and love. She didn't mind me, she really did love me for who I was. I must admit  I was not good enough for her, in terms of looks or capablilites. As a BF i was not a good one. I didn't try to understand her friends etc. We'll we held on, I didn't do things most guys would do for their GF like help them carry their bags etc however she didn't complain but held on with me. She always gave in until the very end. Althought she did 2 time me once in june of 04 I forgave her and she was really sorry, I guess this was when our relationship was aheading down the doom's road. She started treating me nice maybe too nice until I was taking her for granted which I truly regret now. She gave up her dreams of going to a JC for me and even gave up her friends for me. I on the other hand did not give up anything I guess, I didn't even treat her with the love she deserved. Only on the 7 of sept this year when we broke up that I knew how bad I was. Tried hard too hard maybe to get her back. Begged and plead tried everything i really did. Now left alone as a part of me is really missing, everything that once seemed important now seems unimportant. Before the break up I did lost faith in us, maybe we were together for too long and even thought of going with someone else. I am really a jerk and a fool for thinking that way and now its too late. I learned something through this experience that loving someone truly means giving in totally and not taking someone for granted. Life will never be the same for me. WelL I'm in the same class as her and shes seeing someone else i guess. I'm happy for her and do not blame her for treating me this way now.<br>Guys listen up when you think your pride and ego is most important remember one thing without her you would really be nothing and giving in althought it may be hard is the best solution otherwise when other guys come into the picture and treat her like a princess, you would truly lose out to them even if u try very very hard. I truly hope no one would ever go through this experience like me its truly hell on earth when someone who loved you so much wouldn't give u a chance after she has laid down so much wonderful memories for u. Guys out there be good bfs and never let you girl down for you will truly regret it, give in when giving in seems impossible and say a simple sorry althought its hard as sorry is a magical word that brings miracles. I really hope my experience will help all those couples who are having trouble now. Take care god bless everyone</div></blockquote></div>

You must understand, not all guys will have even though they want, i admit i'm one of the many. All the time, i always commit, give in, love the girl first but in return i get is rejection. Well, if the chance comes again to u, cherish it well dude.</div>
