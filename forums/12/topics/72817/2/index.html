Maybe you feel that it's not a time for 'therapy' or even a need for it? I'm not suggesting otherwise...<br><br>I like it when you mentioned that you're open to suggestions.. That's the key thing I'm gonna recommend to you... Don't have to change your mindset or reflect over yourself if you don't want to for now... RATHER take more time off to talk with people... Open yourself up and expand your thinking... Voice out whatever you have to say and cross your mind... Let them do the conversation... Contribute... End of the day you decide for yourself what you wanna do and maybe even what went 'wrong' which makes you feel that way...<br><br>PS. You might be surprised? The problem might not even lies with you? Or maybe there won't even be a problem to begin with?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
