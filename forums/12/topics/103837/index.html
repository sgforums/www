Are you sure you want to be in a relationship at your age?(Which i'm guessing 14-15).<br><br>In another post i have stated that i have almost lost 2 close female friends because i told them i like them. I misinterpreted their signs, even though i was really close to them.<br><br>Now ask yourself this, are you sure she likes you?<br><br>If <span style="color: blue;">yes</span>, then good for you, ask her out to be your gf.<br><br>If <span style="color: red;">no</span>, you're not certain, then bring her out for a few more dates and then prepare roses, surprise her together with the question.<br><br>Another matter is your friend. If your friend likes her too, yea it can get a bit messy, but if he's really a good friend, or one worth keeping, he will not ignore you because of this, (unless of course, he really likes her more than you.)<br><br>Its all a matter of choice. But the most important thing is to ascertain her feelings. Don't misinterpret!<br><br>Good luck man4nth.</div>

I thought only kids use that term.<br><br>I seriously suggest that you DON'T pop the question. Many guys make the mistake of popping the question too early, and end up regretting. Guys like me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Like I've mentioned before, girls only want to be good friends with <span style="color: red;">SOME</span> guys. But you might be thinking, "good friends will eventually become lovers, right?" Wrong. That only happens in TV dramas. To girls, good friends are good friends. There's no 'sparks', or attraction at all.<br><br>To put it in simple terms, oranges(boyfriend-type) attract girls. Apples(good friend-type) do not. Why? Simply because they're different.<br><br>In most cases(90%), the guy thinks that he is an orange, but in fact he is an APPLE.<br><br>I'm not going to teach you how to become an apple, because it's too complicated for you right now. So stick to the old advice....Let her know you better first! When she gets to know your personality and character better, she'll be able to make a decision on whether you'll make a good boyfriend. That will increase your chances, but the decision is still hers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Hmm so your friend told you that he likes her too. What are you planning to do? Give up on the girl and let your friend woo her instead? You'll be a great fool if you do that.</div>

I know that cos she told me the guy been saying things like'do you have BF, what type of guys you like, etc' to her. I am not sure why she telling all this but the information is definately affecting me. Sometime the urge to confess my feelings to her is so bad that I feel like bursting but I still can't do it. We only know each other for less than a year but we are already quite close. She like a soulmate to me so I scared to lose for if I confess. Sigh!</div>
