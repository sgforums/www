I know that cos she told me the guy been saying things like'do you have BF, what type of guys you like, etc' to her. I am not sure why she telling all this but the information is definately affecting me. Sometime the urge to confess my feelings to her is so bad that I feel like bursting but I still can't do it. We only know each other for less than a year but we are already quite close. She like a soulmate to me so I scared to lose for if I confess.

            <div class='col-md body'>Think you should leave it to the girl to make the choice. I know its abit cheesy, but you should follow what you think is right and be strong enough to face the worst. Not to say that all the advice in the forum is bad or anything, but we don't know your situation as well as you do, the only ones with the complete picture is you and the girl, not us... So take all the advice with a pinch of salt.<br>As for whether to tell her the blantant truth or proceed with caution, I suggest you take into consideration what kind of person she is before making the "correct" choice...</div>

I know that cos she told me the guy been saying things like'do you have BF, what type of guys you like, etc' to her. I am not sure why she telling all this but the information is definately affecting me. Sometime the urge to confess my feelings to her is so bad that I feel like bursting but I still can't do it. We only know each other for less than a year but we are already quite close. She like a soulmate to me so I scared to lose for if I confess.

I can't really understand and conclude the meaning of your words except for the 'For now just relax dude' part.

Remember to smile more, appreciate her small actions more, think before you act, play safe, listen more, laugh more, think more positive, more eye contact, and be yourself. All this is for a first date? you may ask, well, research shows that the first impression of a person is a great impact. And a person forms a first impression of a person within 5 minutes. Since now she is viewing you as a potential candidate as her LIFE partner, she would review her first impression, show her that you are responsible, sociable, communicable, perhaps more, and most importantly, lovable =) Cherish her presence, OH yeahz. Trust, must ALWAYS be there in any relationship. And lastly, enjoy the date =)</div>
