There are very few who make it far with just a business diploma or degree.<br><br>My friend has a business degree and it is bringing her nowhere.  My aunt used to employ Business degree holders to be ice cream servers. In the business industry , Finance/Accountancy/IT gives you skills against those who just have a general business degree.<br><br>I am not sure what type of IT course it is but get certified in the big enterprise type of programs like SAP/3, Oracle etc and programming  . If possible , learn SAS/Stata - those are statistical software . Those give you a head start in front of others because big corporations run on those.<br><br>My advice just do your IT diploma - if you do well enough - go for IT/business degree. It will stand you in good stead to have a skill and a degree in place. Then do an MBA if you have the capacity to do so. Or else I would not worry about some business degree.<br><br>Another option which I do not recommend is do your O level again . I don't think it is a good idea. External degrees are not recommended either.<br><br>In addition , for GOOD overseas universities, it is hard to get into their commerce/business courses through their foundation college. If you don't do well in the foundation course , you would have  to do it in some second tier/third tier university which renders you worse off if you return to Singapore and for the price you pay , it isn't worth the investment.<br><br>I don't know your situation but I was forced to take up a diploma I didn't like because my parents threaten to cut me off financially although I could qualify for biotech which I wanted badly . In the end , I just started building on what I have and what I can do after graduation - I studied hard for a diploma I didn't even fancy then I did a degree based on my diploma's discipline .  What I found out , with one degree , especially when you do extremely well, it open doors for you to get to where you want.  I can tell you it took me long but the feeling is all worthwhile when you finally hit the mark after going around a brickwall.<br><br>Besides , my skills in the diploma allows me to be employed elsewhere or back into my old jobs if anything happens or maybe if I hate my boss ( which I don't haha) . It doesn't mean just because I hit the mark , I will give up what skills I know because those are transferable.<br><br>Moral of the story from an older person :<br>in life , always have 2 exit routes open . When one closes , you run out the other and open 2 more doors.<br>Never mind if you don't like it , bide your time and plan carefully.<br>Make use of what you have even if you hate it.</div>

(changing course in yr 2 isn't possible any more, moreover, the reason why i choose course is for the 3rd yr of school, just that now, i can stand studying in yr 2 sem 1)</div>

There are very few who make it far with just a business diploma or degree.<br><br>My friend has a business degree and it is bringing her nowhere.  My aunt used to employ Business degree holders to be ice cream servers. In the business industry , <span style="color: orange;">Finance/Accountancy/IT gives you skills against those who just have a general business degree. </span><br><br>I am not sure what type of IT course it is but get certified in the big enterprise type of programs like <span style="color: pink;">SAP/3, Oracle etc and programming  . If possible , learn SAS/Stata - those are statistical software . Those give you a head start in front of others because big corporations run on those. </span><br><br>My advice just do your IT diploma - if you do well enough - go for IT/business degree. It will stand you in good stead to have a skill and a degree in place. Then do an MBA if you have the capacity to do so. Or else I would not worry about some business degree.<br><br>Another option which I do not recommend is do your O level again . I don't think it is a good idea. External degrees are not recommended either.<br><br>In addition , for GOOD overseas universities, it is hard to get into their commerce/business courses through their foundation college. If you don't do well in the foundation course , you would have  to do it in some second tier/third tier university which renders you worse off if you return to Singapore and for the price you pay , it isn't worth the investment.<br><br>I don't know your situation but I was forced to take up a diploma I didn't like because my parents threaten to cut me off financially although I could qualify for biotech which I wanted badly . In the end , I just started building on what I have and what I can do after graduation - I studied hard for a diploma I didn't even fancy then I did a degree based on my diploma's discipline .  What I found out , with one degree , especially when you do extremely well, it open doors for you to get to where you want.  I can tell you it took me long but the feeling is all worthwhile when you finally hit the mark after going around a brickwall.<br><br>Besides , my skills in the diploma allows me to be employed elsewhere or back into my old jobs if anything happens or maybe if I hate my boss ( which I don't haha) . It doesn't mean just because I hit the mark , I will give up what skills I know because those are transferable.<br><br>Moral of the story from an older person :<br>in life , always have 2 exit routes open . When one closes , you run out the other and open 2 more doors.<br>Never mind if you don't like it , bide your time and plan carefully.<br>Make use of what you have even if you hate it. </div></blockquote>thanks for the advice, at least i have a much clearer idea now why even uni grads with biz degree have to resort to driving taxi (no offence), i try to get at least a dip and shift my degree to double degree in new south wales when i finish my army =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Ah. I see you're thinking like an entrepreneur. KNOW where your passion and drive is in and go after it but always remember to weigh your options and size up any risks and ask yourself whether the risks are worth taking.<br><br>If I were you, I could drop out of IT. But before I do that, I would ask myself whether it's something I really hate and can't excel it or instead, I could see it as an opportunity to learn and acquire a skill to make the most out of it what's before me since I'm already 2/3 through. If this step can be easily cleared, what would be the subsequent steps to clear? IT, followed by army-cum-further-study, etc. Weigh out the different combinations.<br><br>Nothing (IT)  is completely useless in this world when you plan to enter business. In fact, IT is critical in most businesses today so some knowledge will help you later on.
