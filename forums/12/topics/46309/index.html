Like showing their partner with so much concern and love when what their partner actually need is some breathing space. How bout those who do observe their would be partners and then find some incompatibilities or different mindset of life, future etc. Would you have taken the step when you noe that the relationship is heading towards gloom? Not that its impossible to carry it on but maybe v difficult.<br><br>Example would be guy wants career 1st while gal wanna settle down fast. Guy know what the gal wants but still gave the relationship a shot. In the end, quarrel and find that not compatible and stuff. Broke up and guy pour out sorrow that gal doesn't want to wait for him etc to his friends... so whose fault is it? The guy's? Or issit the gal who couldn't change or accomodate him? After all, love is almighty and is most important so why couldn't the gal wait for him? Is this what that's been happening to many people here?<br><br>Sorry if I'm OT...</div>
