            <div class='col-md body'>is undergoing depression.<br>This will be a long story, for those who love to read books, go ahead and slowly scroll down, for those who are impatient,just quickly scroll down and read the summary.<br>It all began with the girl, lets call her G and the boy, B going seperate paths as they both headed for different polytechnics. Well they were from the same secondary school and were having a good relationship. They would constantly look out for each other though it was inevitable the usual quarellings would occur.<br><br>However, when poly started, G had her new bunch of good friends and the same thing applied to B. However u can call B an obnoxious bastard and too demanding of his gf. One day he was feeling sick and he called up his gf who was then preparing for her oral ICA(in course assesement) which is to take place the following day.<br><br>"Hello G ... I'm feeling sick today" B said<br>" O ..sick ah ..what can i do for you" G responded calmly<br>"Shouldn't u show some concern for me ? I'm feeling sick and here you are ignoring my problems" B fired back at her in an aggressive manner.<br><br>the couple then had a heated arguement. Neither party refused to back down . G asked for a breakup and gave B a day to think over it. B wasn't ready to give up on this relationship as this was his first, so he asked for one more chance, so that G can re-evaluate her opinion on B once more.And they were re-united albeit it would only serve as a detriment to G<br><br>One week passed and all was well. It was the school holidays then and I was organizing a BBQ, so being the thoughtful guy i am , i asked B and G along. However B declined as he said he was going shopping with his friends.( first clue that they were going to break , i already had this feeling before any of my friends did. why would a bf not want to spend time with his gf ?) so G attended the event with her girlfriends.<br><br>The following week went ahead with the re-opening of school. Some of my friends were to accompany G to the same polytechnic they studied in so they met up at the MRT. However G was unusually timid and withdrawn during the train journey. She made neither eye contact nor spoke with her friends, a direct contrast to her usual self. While walking to school, G lagged behind the rest of her friends and broked out in tears. Her close friends told me she had been crying since morning and barely had any sleep. The reason?<br><br><strong>B</strong> broked up with her. and the day before B confessed to G that he had feelings for a girl in his polytechnic. And B had the audacity to state that they can continue with their relationship as per normal for the next week before they officially "end" their relationship . I was like wtf when i heard this from my close friend .<br><br>Several hours before the final breakup..<br><br>"G, i like this bag and would do anything to get my hands on it" B said enthusiastically on the phone.<br>"How much does it cost " asked G<br>"More than 80 dollars, right now i'm undergoing some difficulties, can u purchase it for me as part of my advanced birthday present?" B asked cheekily.<br>"What!? 80 dollars? it's like using up almost all of my current piggy bank savings pay for your stupid bag ! how am i suppose to pay for my meals? " G shot back<br>"Look G, u are working right now and u arent even treating me to meals " call yourself nice ?<br><br>G, feeling terrible  for not treating B well decided to go ahead and purchase the bag and to "suffer" for the next week. It was only a few hours later on the bus ride home that B turned into a manipulating, greedy and arrogant guy.<br><br>"G..i have to confess to you that i have a crush on another girl " B said<br>".....is she from the same poly as u?" G responded<br>"yes, and I want to have a break now , both the girl and me have feelings for each other. Though we can continue our relationship for the next week " B said , feeling unemotional for G.<br>"wh..what? I'm sorry?why ?"G asked, tears starting to well up.<br>"Because u have been treating me badly since we met !thats why" said B<br><br>To summarise the whole story, B had manipulated G in such a manner that A)He cheated G of her feelings. B) Worse was that he had the balls to ask her to purchase something before he broke up . C) He asked for one more chance but to back stab her later on D) G had access to B's MSN account and chat log, she already knew that B was already interested in a girl in the same polytechnic from the way he chatted with the girl .<br><br>Man.... although i knew that B and G would eventually break up( because of the time constraints from meeting each other and distractions from the opposite gender ), I didnt expected B, a friend of mine to be such a douche bag and cheat G ( one of my good friends) of her feelings.<br><br>so my question to you guys is, how to cope with such a blow ? i dont like to see my friends undergoing depression as they would grow more white hair<br>*sigh* how i wish karma exists in this world</div>
