The reason why u're feeling so much pain right now is because u have alot of memories together and you are used to life with her. The only way to forget her is to give up ALL hope that you will ever be together again. Trust me, u will be fine one day cos' TIME WILL HEAL ALL WOUNDS.<br><br>and by then, when u look back .. u'd realise how foolish u were for wanting to attempt suicide over someone who doesn't even care 2 hoots about u.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and oh yes. Throw away all memories u have of her. By choosing to contact her further u r just showing her how weak you are, and it will just affirm her decision to leave u..<br><br>Sorry for being so frank. I've been in exactly the same position u are in now a couple of times so i know exactly how u feel. But i'm fine now.. and u will be too !!!<br><br>CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE IS FOR WEAKLINGS !!<br><br>if u wan to kill urself, pls think of not yourself, but the pple around u that will be affected by your rash decision...<br><br>cheers.</div>
