              <p>Personally, I believe your parents are obligated to help you no matter what age you are. Financially if they can afford it, and they are already giving you something, already very good. But asking for more, scratch that, EXPECTING more is crossing the line.</p>
              <p>I don't get a single cent from my parents, I get it from my sister and she has her own family to take care of, anything else I freelance for extra lui lor. Lucky enough to have a roof over my head. But I am happy.</p>
              <p>You already getting quite a bit, you have personal bills to pay, sure. Ever thought of planning your way through it with what you have? Instead of expecting your mom to provide so you can settle one shot?</p>

              <p>You really left me speechless. If you are not holding on to a job, I don't see why should you be getting a credit card to tide your expenditure. And also, when I was in poly, my total allowance was $200 a month, I was holding a temp job, and also had 2 CCAs. End of month, just from my allowance alone, I still can save 20bucks or so? </p>

              <p>Even if your mum gives you $500 a month, that makes it $300.... (After 
              taking away bills and poly cpf, which amounts to $200.)<br> <br>And I presume you actually drive to school?? That takes away transportation ... which is about $100 more.<br> <br>$300 for 4 weeks is $75 a week... which is reasonable... when most uni grads are taking only $50 - $100 a week from their parents... yours is in the middle range.... If you mum gives you $1000... its actually $800 a month, akin to $200 a week... thats hell lot.. <br><br>And anyway, if I am your mum, I wun care about ortho.... its not a must that she must provide you with your ortho treatment.... you want to have it.. you must save up for it. Its like going for facial treatment and then demanding your mum to pay for it. <br><br>Hope you can understand, but a uni grad would only earn 2.5k at most when they graduate.... ur mum is actually helping you adjust to your life in future... <br></p>

              <p>I suggest you do what I and some other have already told you, the 3 things you need to do right now, instead of wasting your time here.</p>
              <p>And also if you want, read through your own replies and comments. Because it's really starting to sound like you're just whining, complaining and not willing to do anything about anything.</p>

              <p>Based on your example. Why are you still using your credit card? It is your own fault, that you choose to keep it, use it, and incur a lot of bills which you cannot afford to pay. And now more so because you quit your job.</p>

              <p>Why do you need so much as a student? Most of your time will be spent in school chionging your work. And it's not like canteen food cost $5 every meal for breakfast lunch dinner.</p>

That takes away transportation ... which is about $100 more.<br><br>$300 for 4 weeks is $75 a week... which is reasonable... when most uni grads are taking only $50 - $100 a week from their parents... yours is in the middle range.... If you mum gives you $1000... its actually $800 a month, akin to $200 a week... thats hell lot..<br><br>And anyway, if I am your mum, I wun care about ortho.... its not a must that she must provide you with your ortho treatment.... you want to have it.. you must save up for it. Its like going for facial treatment and then demanding your mum to pay for it.<br><br>Hope you can understand, but a uni grad would only earn 2.5k at most when they graduate.... ur mum is actually helping you adjust to your life in future...</p>

              <p>May I summarize for you what you have said and the things implied. Please don't take offence as this is my honest view.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Story goes:<br>Sec school ==&gt; Retain, likely because play and didn't do well. Can only blame yourself.<br><br>Then you went poly. Didn't do well enough to enter local U. So you entered SIM, hence expenses higher than those who went local U. So it's because of you too.<br><br>Went SIM, you started to work part time to fund yourself. But your expenses are somewhat high every month, and thus you have very little savings (almost nil I suppose). You splurge your hard earned cash without any savings for emergency or situations like now.</p>
              <p>The problem comes when you decide you want to stop working.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Problems:</p>
              <p>1) You continue to spend as much as before, yet you do not have any income nor did you reduce your expenditures much, nor do you have any savings. This is poor money management habit right on the onset.</p>
              <p>2) Because you need to continue spending, you splurge on Credit Cards. You have to ask your mum for cash because you don't have enough to spend.</p>
              <p>3) It's your final sem, and you should be in school working hard to ace the final exam. Yet you want to continue to go out jalan, even though without much cash.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
