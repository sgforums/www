              <p>As I have mentioned. What do you want us to do? What solution are you looking to find?</p>
              <p>I don't know anything about you, all I can say is you need to watch and plan your expenses. Things can cut, cut. Things don't need, don't go and gey kiang keep.</p>
              <p>Another thing is, you want to enjoy your last semester, but choose to drop your job and still expect money to come to you like that, through your mother. Ever thought of a simple part time job over the weekend? Or weeknights?</p>
              <p>Issues with your mom, we cannot say anything about. We dunno whether you're the underachieving middle child, or the filial youngest sibling. She's prolly not giving you promptly because she thinks you have savings from your job, she thinks you're independent. Ever thought of sitting down, and talking to your mom?</p>
              <p>3 solutions already.</p>

              <p>Male/25/Undergrad</p>
              <p>for the past 2.5 years of studies i've been doing full time work
              and studying on a part-time basis. Thus i nv took any money since
              roughly 5 yrs ago (ns plus 2.5) from my mum except for the tuition
              fees. But since i approaching my last semester i really think of
              enjoying my sch life(cca etc etc). so i quit my job. Then no more
              income and not much saving as i was working as a temp so the pay
              also just enough to survive.</p>
              <p>now monthly i need take about 1k(due to high overheads, poly
              giro payment, ortho) from my mum. Then usually she only give
              me the money after i asked her. (she wont automatically monthly
              xfer). When she xfer the money she only put half($500). Then i take
              the money pay credit card bills. Before the 1st week is over
              the $500 all gone. Then i have to go to her again.</p>
              <p>Its not as though we are from a poor family, we live in landed
              property with 4 cars at home. But we are not very wealthy also. I
              dont know how to make her understand. She's been doing this xxxx up
              thing since poly. Everytime she give half then say if i finish tell
              her. WTF ~ . All my sibings did their college overseas, only for me
              i doing it local. I still remember how my mom would promptly
              send them money. And when they ask for more, she will still xfer
              over.</p>
              </div>

              <p>I wonder if the 1k belongs to school fees for uni as well???? <br><br>1k is quite little if its overseas degree... where the monthly school fees can cost about $900 a month.. which means TS is actually living on a $100 per month allowance.. <br>And if his mum is giving him $500 it means he is surviving on negative $400 allowance per month without spending a single cent on anything<br><br>If its $1000 excluding degree tuition fees... and only poly payment... which is about $300 a month... I would say $700 a month is  reasonable.... <br><br>And i wonder what ortho means... church donations????

              <p>Hinting and actually asking or reminding is two different things.</p>
              <p>Do you contribute to the household? Or did you use to? House bills etc, not personal bills.</p>
              <p>Have you ever also wondered if your mom may have problems with cash maybe? You don't mention a dad, so I'm guessing she's the one keeping the house in shape?</p>
              <p>I understand that you may feel like you're being alienated for studying locally compared to your siblings. Have you ever thought what the consequences would be if you had NO money overseas as compared to having close to no money locally?</p>
              <p>Which is why I say, go talk to your mom. Don't expect her to do shit for you. Be the good son and talk to her.</p>

              <p>Maybe you should also look at your expenses breakdown and see where you can cut. $1k a month is a lot. Even working full time now, my monthly expenses boils down to about $700 a month only.</p>
