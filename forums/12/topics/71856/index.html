            <div class='col-md body'>I somewhat agree with Brown.<br><br>No matter how power, how eloquent your language, how wonderful and accurate the sentence phrased, how heavenly the use of vocab and finally how much of quotes you would use.<br>Nothing could match the sincerity and honesty from your heart.<br><br>I guess you must been very half hearted thru this time, i think you're prepared for the worst, in fact, starting to pack your emotional bag.....that's why the effort that you wish to make out of a letter is also half hearted. Very saddening indeed...       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>May i ask? Where are all those things/words/thoughts in your heart which you wanted to pour(Yes literally meaing it) out, express to her?<br>If you would just search the truth from depths of your heart and write or do anything!, if you truly love her like what you've claimed. You shall realise that you can write endlessly....never tiring.<br><br>Of cos! you can be someone doesn't really know how to express yourself. Come on my friend...if this is the last straw and you're not going to do something about it........my sincere advise to you is to admit that you have to go this time. Retreat.<br><br>My signature below is a quote which taught me something after a unfortunate relationship.<br>You'll have one too....from your heart.<br><br>Hope you'll write a good one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Start from the past and begin from there. All the emotions, feelings, your vulnerable secret, your weakness, your flaws, your tears, you hurts, your everything - you pictured them into words and go through as if you are telling her a story about you, from your point of preception, someting that she never realise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Then seek to understand this story, again, from her side of the view also. She may then be very emotionally and say things she never would in normal days.<br><br>II) Then, talk about future of your relationship. If there is no past, there will be no present. If present is screwed, future will be screwed. There must be a mutual agreement and saying about what you people see about your relationship. Relationship is like business - they don't fail until you call it quit or when you see zero future, zero market for your business. But there is a small gleam of hope - capture that.<br><br>Keep communication flowing. This is not a trashing, chat nor a threatening session - this is about you and her - <strong>your inner self speaks</strong>.<br><br>Good luck? You need them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers</div>
