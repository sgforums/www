We end this session here. Come again next week.<br><br>Me: *smile*<br><br>That's the last time I step into the office. </div></blockquote>It's not likely that your doc can get much from you that session. He / she I think did quite an appropriate thing.<br><br>1st, you haven't sort out your thoughts. Either you didn't even know what is happening at all or you didn't know how to express yourself.<br><br>2nd, he / she hardly know you. There is no trust. No communication. The doc might be lucky if you're someone who likes to voice out to strangers or is in the mood for that. But what ya said didn't suggest that. It would be more appropriate to approach you subsequently as you get to know each other better, or when you're in a better or different mood.<br><br>Your questioning of "How long you know me?" to the doctor also suggest that a barrier is fenced up by you between the 2 of you.<br><br>Your questionings of "Have you been to hell?" and "Can you feel what I feel?" suggest you don't trust the doctor.<br><br>Such treatments require the doctor to make diagnosis from communications and 'suggestions'. Without that, it can be quite many wasted trips. If you truly seek help, you'll have to be patient. Just like your doctor has to be patient with you. Just like on a long course medication, you don't expect the doctor to work miracle overnight...</div>
