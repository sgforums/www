You are taking things too hard. Why torture yourself?<br><br>One question.. Do you trust your boyfriend?<br><br>If yes, stop all these non-sensical jealousy. It will in turn kill your relationship with him if you don't stop this shit right now!!<br><br>If no, then I suggest you do him a favour and break up. Don't torture him further by your distrustful attitude. I wouldn't like a gf who doesn't trust me too. I'll do the same thing. Leave her.<br><br>Give yourself a break. RELAX man.. take it easy horsy!<br><br>S.H.I.N.</div>

Read though what the forumites have wrote for you again...<br><br>2. Have faith in your bf....<br><br>3. The biggest reason for him to leave you is probably not because he wanna be with the girl (otherwise he could have done so already?), but more because his gf is giving him unreasonable hard times and he just need to breathe...

            <div class='col-md body'>hey tissue,<br><br>hold no expectations~!! u can choose to be more straight forward and tell ur bf directly how u feel but dont expect much to come out of it...  the more expectations u have, the more anger and disappointment u'll feel.... if u love him, u should have more faith in him... try ur best and do ur part as a good gf... should u fail, remember that u've tried... seize every moment of the day and it's better to remain cool... it all depends on oneself, if ur bf doesnt make any effort to keep a distance from this ger, u cant do anything also right?? it all depends on him mah...<br><br>all the best ya~~!!</div>
