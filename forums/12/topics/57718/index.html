How would he feel when he don't see you carrying the bag he bought for you?<br>Would it be altogether a better solution if you would have in the first place let him know that you can get the money and buy it on your own? or you can join him and get the bag you like while he pay for it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i know this damn well..i always tell them i rather buy it on my own. in fact my ma didnt buy 1 for me because i told her i wanna buy it on my own. get this straight. i go buy with him, what i want he sure say no. what he wants to buy, i dont like, alot of times we got conflicting tastes.<br><br>I really think it's a win win situation.<br>You just didn't want to because you didn't want to compromise your ideals about why others can do this and that, why are you still stuck in a family which treats you like a little boy.<br>You can make the difference. Your decision and perspective can change alot of things.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i dunno waht to say abt this.<br><br>The prob doesn't totally lies on your dad. No fault in this world only lie on one side.<br><br>My friend, i'm trying to tell you that it's no use claiming to know this and that in the family and yet wanting your own ways. Only spoilt brats do that. If you are one...this is for you.<br>If you're not...read on.<br>It'll just make you resent your parents more.<br>Grow up! Really...my heartfelt advice to you.<br><br>How are you going to show them you've grown to a young man???<br>By your school results? Your abilities? By what?<br>I learnt this.<br>By maturity....if you really want to get over your parents goodwill for you. Grow up...and appreciate their concerns over you.<br>Then gently decline their offer....and tell them about your thoughts.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i always say i rather do it on my own. i have been doing this for years ok?!<br><br>Speak like a adult to adult. Since you said you think you learn more thing then them? You don't have to prove anything. Proving you're somebody will only make you a childish loser, and the end is frustration.  Learn how to decline(gently) and see how you go about doing on your own. That's when your dad realise that he need to respect YOUR decision.<br>It'll take a long long time for your dad to see the point....but it's worth it. Really, i have been thru it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> my sis freq argues with them because they tend to dismiss our ideas and suggestions so easily.<br><br>Your concern is over a bag...and on top of that, over your parents decisions over you which made you really upset.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i have mentioned this before. the bag is not the subject, ok?<br><br>Their concern is YOU. Not about what you do or whatever you want to prove. But you...all that's in their mouth may be things so uncaring and outward. That's because they find it hard to express care and concern...come on...you are sensitive enough to know all this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Maybe because of their background which made them this way?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> sheltering me to the extend i learn abt alot of things outside the family is not the way for concern.<br><br>Learn to work with them towards a better family. That's a true test of being a grown up. Have you really grown up?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Do consider what i have said.<br><br>MC's Quote:<br><span style="color: darkred;">In Life.

Such attempts were almost impossible in their context. And like what MC had mentioned - if you don't like, speak with them - like adult to adult. If not, your parents would forever treat you like a kid.<br><br>If it was me, I would hell of a happy if my dad did something like that. But probably I would reject and rather buy myself - but nevertheless, still I really appreciate that thought. Its something that probably will never happen to me.
