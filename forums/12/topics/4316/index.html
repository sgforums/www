            <div class='col-md body'>after so many break-ups and patch-ups, the final break up has finally came. i do not know whether i should feel relieved or not. i had never felt so deeply for any guy before. and this one whole year had been the happiest time of my life.<br><br>he strayed once, i initiated breaking up with him. he cried, threatened, pleaded... and i gave in. just one month ago, he appeared to have lost interest in this relationship altogether. i had been stronger and we broke up for a week. until he wooed me all over again, and my heart softened.<br><br>but this time round, i discovered that he has strayed again. i regret. i regret having been so soft-hearted to accept him so quickly.<br><br>am i a failure? i love him so much. i did so much for him. why did he do such a thing to me again and again???<br><br>i thot i was strong. i thot i wouldn't think about him anymore. i thot i hated him. i tore all the letters he wrote for me. tore up our picture. deleted our personal ecircle group. every little bit of us. gone.<br><br>but i miss him. i keep on thinking about him. thinking about looking for him. hugging him and crying in his chest. i dunno how long i can take this anymore.<br><br>what should i do??????  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Take some time off and relax ur mind off.<br><br>Probably it would calm both of you down and see whether he would be sincerely wans to patch back or he just goes astray again.

            <div class='col-md body'>Cornetto,<br><br>Saw another post of yrs in another thread from heavyarm. U mention that u dun feel like living. Well 1st allow me to come to this comment of yrs. Don't ever feel like giving up hope in life, cos u never died, or almost died b4, u dunnoe how good it is to stay alive. Theres so much things to look forward in life, of cos, other than the trouble u r facing now. And its definitely not worth giving up a life for a guy, who isn't even yr hubby yet. Also, judging from yr post, well can roughly tell that u r still young, below 20? Pardon me if i am wrong. Pls, still so young and feel this way already? oh dear, then i must say u r still not mature enuff to handle serious relation yet. It's normal to get upset or even angry over a relationship, i mean, it happen to me b4 also   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> , but, die is never a solution, u will only upset more pple ard u. So, pls, get this idea out of yr head soon.<br><br>Okie, again, think this gonna be a long post so pls bear wif it. Frankly speaking from what u say, even if u patch batch with yr ex-bf, i dun think the 2 of u gonna last also, judging from yr history of breaking up with him. I know, and understand that gers are more softhearted, esp to those they love, so its very natural of you to give in to him when he pleads. But guess for once, u should try to stand yr ground. Try to live a life without him for a few mnths and see how life gets on. Its also a good oppotunities for you to observe him now, see how he is when he's without u, will he turn bad? or will he become a much better person. Who knows rite, maybe u will find out a lot more than when u r blind by love during this period. Its just not advisable for u to go back to him now, seriously speaking, or at least thats what i think. U may end up getting upset/hurt a couple of times more than now.<br><br>Its also natural for u to think of him now. I mean, it just happened. Try to indulge yrself into other stuffs, and like i mention in another post (from heavy arm), do something u wish to do for a long time but haven't have the chance to. It may not help much it will definitely make u feel better that tiny whinney bit. I also agreed that its what the 2 of u went through that made a relationship strong, and what you do for him that counts. But MISS, i am sure when you 1st went into the relationship, you know that such things are never fair, NEVER! As long as you feel that its 'zhi de' to do something for him, go ahead, even if it doesn't pay off, at least you wun live in regret, which i am sure u didn't now cos from what u type, can see that you really put in a lot of effort in this relationship. Now that it didn't pay off, the more theres no reason to blame yrself. You tried yr best already, its him who went stray again and again.<br><br>Try to get over this soon, yup it takes time but u just got to try. You suffered enuff mentally already, so try not to torture yrself further. I know, all i say may sound like crap but thats how i feel, and hopefully u can understand my command of english as its always been that bad   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Take Care!<br><br>Regards<br><br>Recommend you a song - 'Meng Fei Chuan - BU ZHI DE'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have come to my senses already. i am sure that i wanna live without him forever. true, we had been thru' too much before. but we are not meant for each other. i had been too insensible when i said that i wanted him back. i can live without him. i'd definitely lead a better life. the beginning is tough, i must say. but i am not going to allow him to ruin my happiness. i must show him and everyone that i can live my life better without him. and heck, i do not need him to be around on my 21st birthday this coming april. thank you to all of you   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by cornetto (edited 27 February 2001).]</div>
