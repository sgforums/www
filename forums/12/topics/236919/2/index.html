It is not unwise to also realise that life is indeed fragile also.<br><br>Be it your frustrations at work or relationships, time is the greatest healer of all wounds both emotional and physical. In the greatest times of stress and troubles, simple actions like getting enough water and sleep can help one rejuvinate the body and mind. Always remember, you can always find a new job if you are unhappy with your current one. You will always be able to find love from another be it someone else or a pet. But to take your life at the fit of the moment would truely be sad, if not for yourself but also those around you. Hence the motivation to live can be as easily expressed in these few words:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Live to see another day, another chance to learn and enrich ourselves.</span><br><br>Just like no child can hate their parents forever, we must understand that we are never really alone and family intruth is the most important asset any person can ever have, be it a family that you belong,create or become a part of.<br><br>I hope in these few words, i can help bring some relief or comforts to those who may need it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The mountain of troubles is huge when looked from the bottom. It is only when we climb to its peak that we are able to see the vastness beyond the mountain and the beauty of the sky and all manners of wonders under it.

Listen carefully for danger signs - they will lament that they are worthless, they are a burden, and may have worked out a action plan for suicide.<br><br>If the person is contemplating suicide as a form of emotional revenge for example, if you go on with the "beauty of life" routine you will remind them of how much suffering their death can bring to their tormentors.<br><br>Instead of saying all that poetic nonsense, when one detects danger signs, he or she should just listen attentively and refer the patient to a psychiatrist as soon as possible.<br></div>
