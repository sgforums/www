No, i did not find god or Nirvana but merely come to my self conclusion that amoung many other factors in life, much of it is simply <strong>actions and consequences</strong>.<br><br>Have i been in depression before? Yes i have. Have i though of ending it all before? since i was Seven years old. Did i need to explain myself? No i didnt.<br>Why am i writing all these? because i believe it to be worthwhile if not to make a difference.<br><br>Life is Precious for many different reasons for many different people as pointed out by many other forumers. There is no win or lose in this disscussion. Either you agree or disagree, your opinion is yours. If you feel you need help and am willing to seek it, start your own thread.<br><br>As i mentioned before, it is pointless to teach if one is unwilling to learn just as pills are useless to the sick who refuse to take them. Take what you want away from these words.

I don't think anybody's really bother enough to be having this debate with you at all....? </span><br><br>Can't bother or don't know how to reply? What are you doing right now?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If YOU THINK you can DO BETTER, let YOUR ACTIONS speaks LOUDER than YOUR WORDS.... Because from what I've seen so far from your contributions in AA, I don't think you're really helping anybody much at all... </span><br><br>Tell that to the people calling mediacorp "mediacorpse ".<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I cannot account for what's the TS's CAPACITY and CAPABILITY to HELP those really IN NEED, but I would believe for now that his intention is CLEAR and GOODWILL enough.. At least in relative to what YOU CAN OFFER... </span><br><br>MY INTENTIONS WERE GOOD I CAN DO ANYTHING LOL<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">And finally... If you REALLY THINK the 'BEST' you can DO is to 'prove' that people DESERVES to DIE...<br><br>1st thing. As those people are already SUICIDAL enough. We do NOT need 'professionals' like yourself to guide them to END their lives... </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">2nd thing. If you TRULY SO MUCH SPEAKS FOR YOURSELF.... You WON'T EVEN be typing at your keyboard right now... YUP. You should have already be SO WELL-CONVINCED that you're DEAD. And BE DEAD by now. The VERY FACT that you're still with us just tells us a VERY SIMPLE FACT... DEATH is never really a WISE move for someone who can THINK ENOUGH... So STOP MISLEADING those who CAN'T REALLY THINK YOURSELF. </span><br><br>I was depressed. I know that crap like this thread doesn't do anything.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">BECAUSE IN MY EYES you're just a FARKING MURDERER. Yet also a COWARD who HIDES BEHIND a PC SCREEN. Talk of BIGs yet do of NOTHING. </span><br><br>And you're a farking illusioned turd unless you can tell me why life is precious.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Just because a man is blind doesn't mean YOU can PUSH him off the ROAD to be KNOCKED by a CAR.<br><br>GO FIGURE. </span><br><br>Well since this is your forum I guess you can go offtopic whenever you want.</div>

As explained by many people, general advise like that is already well known by everyone. They still got depressed. And they want to die. If you give them the same crap they hear everyday (and you even cannot answer a counterquestion which is the center of your "encouragement ") it is just proving them that their track of thinking is correct, because they already factored it in.</div>
