No, i did not find god or Nirvana but merely come to my self conclusion that amoung many other factors in life, much of it is simply [b]actions and consequences</strong>.<br><br>Have i been in depression before? Yes i have. Have i though of ending it all before? since i was Seven years old. Did i need to explain myself? No i didnt.<br>Why am i writing all these? because i believe it to be worthwhile if not to make a difference.<br><br>Life is Precious for many different reasons for many different people as pointed out by many other forumers. There is no win or lose in this disscussion. Either you agree or disagree, your opinion is yours. If you feel you need help and am willing to seek it, start your own thread.<br><br>As i mentioned before, it is pointless to teach if one is unwilling to learn just as pills are useless to the sick who refuse to take them. Take what you want away from these words. I can only hope you can realise the importance of your actions impacting the lives around you and that of your own.<br><br>Best regards and good night, i am sure tomorrow will be a better day for everyone.<br><br>L.i.P[/b]</blockquote>I know that the willingness to learn is the most important thing, but if people are severely depressed and are suicidal would they listen to you? Your audience is not me, it is the suicidal people. The severely depressed kind. I also did not find a god or nirvana. I just got introduced to the workings of the ego.<br>Win or lose was proposed by someone on your side.<br><br>So you cannot give a reason why life is precious, you want people to know what they live for. Simply put you just want people to live through their misery and you don't know why. You just feel that living is good and you force everyone to live.</div>

In fact if you know him well enough, he's really someone who ain't really afraid to offend people. It's just more like his habit of coming and going from time to time...? </span><br><br>Alright, so he is a grass on the wall. It is however a fact that he agrees that simple words like that do not help at all.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">My point is that there's no point to be so critical as to poke the TS with a needle here. It's not as if he's saying this is a SOLUTION for the DEPRESSED...
