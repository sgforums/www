            <div class='col-md body'>To all those who might feel depressed and lonely for whatever reasons and feel like ending their life....<br><br>Please dont.<br><br>Life is a treasure not to be easily discarded. It is not unwise to also realise that life is indeed fragile as well.<br><br>Be it your frustrations at work or relationships, time is the greatest healer of all wounds both emotional and physical. In the greatest times of stress and troubles, simple actions like getting enough water and sleep can help one rejuvinate the body and mind. Always remember, you can always find a new job if you are unhappy with your current one. You will always be able to find love from another be it someone else or a pet. But to take your life at the fit of the moment would truely be sad, if not for yourself but also those around you. Hence the motivation to live can be as easily expressed in these few words:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Live to see another day, another chance to learn and enrich ourselves.</span><br><br>Just like no child can hate their parents forever, we must understand that we are never really alone and family intruth is the most important asset any person can ever have, be it a family that you belong,create or become a part of.<br><br>I hope in these few words, i can help bring some relief or comforts to those who may need it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The mountain of troubles is huge when looked from the bottom. It is only when we climb to its peak that we are able to see the vastness beyond the mountain and the beauty of the sky and all manners of wonders under it. And hence despite the many other mountain of woes that may present it self in your journey, as with each breath and step you take, thus your life is enriched through your experiences.</span><br>___________________________________________________<br><br><strong>Edit: The below links are contributed by other members to offer aid and help to those who may be considering Suicide.</strong><br>___________________________________________________<br><br><strong>How you can help if you know someone who's suicidal? contributed by MÂ©+square</strong><br><a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=170322" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=170322</a><br><br><strong>What can I do to help someone who may be suicidal? contributed by Cystaire </strong>:<br><a href="http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/whattodo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/whattodo.htm </a><br><br><strong>Suicidal Thoughts or Threats contributed by Cystaire</strong><br><a href="http://www.webmd.com/hw/mental_health/hw111106.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/hw/mental_health/hw111106.asp</a><br><br><strong>For professional help.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Eric Cartman:</div><div class="quote_body">Why is life precious? Why do you want to enrich yourself?</div></blockquote>Why is life precious? It can be comparable to as to why water is precious. Even when we know its aplenty around us and is important. Yet we may at times fail to realise or forget that it is limited and should be used wisely. Similarly, most of the time we take our lives and those around us lightly without much thought about it yet we fail to see that like every drop of water that is important to the sea, every human life is precious even if hundreds, if not tens of thousands lives lost everyday around us for one reason or another.<br><br>But of course i dont proclaim any universal truths, but merely saying what we may already know but perhaps forgotten at one point or another in our lives.<br><br>As for using the word "enrich" in this sense, it can actually be replaced with what your sense of purpose of life should be. We as humans use a limited form of communication through words to try to understand each other thoughs but it is subjected to defination and hence misinterpretation as well. Feel free to replace the specific word with something you precieve as more appropriate.<br><br>I hoped i have answered your questions.</div>
