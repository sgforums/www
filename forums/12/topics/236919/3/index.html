Scolding them for failing to "snap out of it" won't work. Reminding them how important or precious life is will only insult their intelligence.<br><br>Of course they know life is important. That is why they want to kill themselves. The psychological and physiological situation of a very depressed person is different from someone who is just a little down.<br><br>A clinically depressed person with suicidal tendencies is a medical emergency. Don't pretend to be a doctor, let the medical professionals handle it.<br><br>Frierson et al. 2002 (Vol. 112 Postgrad Med)<br><br>[b]Table 1. Elements of a suicide risk assessment interview with a depressed patient</strong><br><br>Current suicidal thoughts, intent, and plan<br>History of suicide attempts (eg, lethality of method, circumstances)<br>Family history of suicide<br>History of violence (eg, weapon use, circumstances)<br>Intensity of current depressive symptoms<br>Current treatment regimen and response<br>Recent life stressors (eg, marital separation, job loss)<br>Alcohol and drug use patterns<br>Psychotic symptoms<br>Current living situation (eg, social supports, availability of weapon)<br>[/b]</blockquote>Agree. But there're different levels of 'disturbance' a mind might be having. I can agree that in the cases you've mentioned, all these might not work. But there's also a saying... "Prevention is always better than cure...."<br><br>Personally I don't see how possibly pushing them into a passive mind might help?</div>
