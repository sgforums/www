              <p>How many people in sgforums can go out with your partner or
              friends without spending money? you bring your lunch box along too?
              or you just plainly sit in the void deck and play your guitar?</p>
              <p>no offence but i think you did not put yourself in my shoes and
              would never understand how i feel.</p>

              <p>Seriously speaking, if she act blur made u pay, voice it out man.</p>

              <p>All day long people always say wife is the CFO, this kind of girl is not worth being a CFO.</p>
              <p>Behind a successful man, there is a woman, behind a man of failure, there also is a woman. Just depends which type of woman u have.</p>
              <p>I a society like this, you as a man need to plan and care for your own future. <strong>Love is blind, but don't love blindly.</strong></p>

              <p>Obviously you don't pay for the pub bills and electric bills.
              Obviously you don't pay property taxes. Obviously you don't support
              your parents. You don't know how it feels. So i would appreciate if
              you don't say anything if you don't understand the situation.

              <p>?? why suddenly flame ? Not about poor girls or rich girls. Just that Ts income is not enough to support his gf without her working. Thus she needs to work to lighten the burden. I dont find that anything wrong.</p>
