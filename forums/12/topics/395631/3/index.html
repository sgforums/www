              <p>But true to the part about the entertainment one.. if tight budget then dun go to restaurants to eat and expect to go dutch also. Can propose to a cheaper alternative such as food centre.. and when she asks why degrade liao.. tell her the reason lor.

              <p>I am 22. Yes i did it with sincerity. Some of you think that it takes 2 hands to clap, it might be my fault for not showing her enough love. Nevertheless i can touch my heart and say that i have done my part and i did my best. Maybe i just don't have the cash flow to support her hence I am not the right guy for her. We just broke up, i need some zen and peace now. Hope there won't be another jojo wannabe. If a poor guy can't fall in love then i guess all poor guys will remain single forever.</p>

              <p>Well i guess you are not a scrooge.  Your ability is just not enough to support a girl fully, as in always paying her expenses. If she cant acept that then too bad. Good luck to your next relationship.</p>

              <p>As i said jojo. you don't know my situation at all. All you
                      think was i am a poor guy, i got too much ego and that girl should
                      have dumped me. You should have get your facts right first. She
                      doesn't want to work, <strong>she is the one who wants to
                      chiong</strong>. I am working my ass off and only felt the pressure
                      after a period of 6 months?</p>
              <p>1) Yes i DID bring her out to her favorite places.</p>
              <p>2)Yes i DID buy her gifts to make her happy. </p>
              <p>3) I DID play my part as a boyfriend (for your info i did put
                      down my ego)</p>
              <p>You know what jojo? After i read all your post, instead of
                      constructing some helpful advise. You flamed me. Call me a poor guy
                      nevermind, I admit i don't have the 5 Cs. But at least i do part as
                      a boyfriend. Some people don't even treat their partner well. You
                      are ignorant and you talk like you know everything. I really think
                      you owe me an apology.</p>

              <p>The last person to pressure her to go get a job is not you, they should be her OWN family. Because her parents are the one PAYING for her daily expenses ( NOT YOU).</p>
              <p>For your own sake.. go find a young girl from a<strong> rich family</strong>. Or find someone who is mature enough and had been working for at least 5 years. These are the kind who will have excesses in their purse.</p>
