What you need most are friends whom you can click with. Talk to one who is a close and trusted friend, a good listener and willing to bare with your problems. Confile in him/her.<br><br>Try not to be alone because your mind will wander back to her. Do not visit the places you both use to go to. Do not listen to sentimental, love music, songs. Do not go to romantic movies, places. Do not dig out all those love messages, pictures, gifts she bought you. Anything that reminds you of her should be totally forgotten.<br><br>Do all the above for about 2 years, maybe 3 or 4.

If he left me for a new girl, I'll tell myself "I am not interesting to him anymore. There he goes, trying out new &amp; fresh chicks". The feelings weren't so bad. BUT he left me for his ex-gf! So what does it say? "I so f-ked up meh??" He didn't love me at all and he didn't treat me nice either. I was just a substitute to this bast**d. That was how I feel.<br><br>1 month of relationship but I took 6 months to get over him. So long...probably because he was my first boyfriend. It's harder for girls to let go of emotional baggages of their past relationship. So, if i can let go, why can't you? You are a man leh...<br><br>Now, I have a boyfriend who has better characters than my first. We really cherish each other.<br><br>If we keep looking back at the past, the lives ahead of us become meaningless. If we carry on like this, wallowing ourselves in the mud, we are likely to develop depression. Why can't we love ourselves more by thinking forward? Love and pamper yourself by doing things you like and didn't get a chance to do them while you were in the relationship.<br>Try out new stuff or check out new chicks. If you get to befriend more girls, you will realise that she is not the perfect girl around.<br><br>The world does not revolve around her. Time waits for no men.<br>Don't let opportunities slip away for a guy like you. You will find a better half.<br><br>Cheers! </span></div>

All you need to do is to continue to live ur life to the fullest and by doing so, you will get lot of chance to socialise. Therefore, your chances of meeting more girls will be higher, and chances of making mistakes will be higher as well. But, dun worry, more mistakes = closer to success.<br><br>I hope you can find a life more fulfilling soon. Once you've found a better girl, what is this girl to you manz?
