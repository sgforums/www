Imagine if you have already engaged or even married to her... Then all of sudden... She's leaving u for another guy. Remember guys, even from ten cruel girls that have cheated a guy, there must be one or two that teach him a lot of life lessons and make him smarter than others... Cheers and carry on with ur life man...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Time really do heals a broken heart. Trust me. I've been through it.<br><br>U may still keep her photos if u want, and it will be unavoidable that u will think of her once in a while. Afterall, the both of u had good wonderful memories together before.<br><br>Get involve in activities, get busy with work/studies, etc. I know it is hard to being single again. But do remember that u were single once before the relationship and u had got on fine. So u can make it through this period.<br><br>However do take time to search ur own feelings. Since ur ex had left u for another guy, if there is an instance whereby she comes looking for u to patch up, would u take her back? Or would u take a stand and just be normal frenz? Keep in mind that if she can 'run off' with another guy, she might do it again.<br><br>The answer lies with u afterall. So search ur heart and avoid her for the time being (if she still contacts u). Let ur feelings settle down first because u would be in a very confused state now and u wouldn't want to jump into some silly relationship right now.</div>
