              <p>Well, you are having lunches with him.  And he has no better females to spam his smses to.  Treat it as a compliment.</p>
              <p>Tell him politely that you cannot offer massages, cos it will seem like you are sexually harassing him and HR dept wont be happy.</p>
              <p>Then dont reply his smses.  If its just junk stuff, replying his smses means you are spending money or using up your sms'es quota and you will have to pay more.</p>
              <p>If he question you why you dont reply smses, just reply that there is nothing to reply on. (Hinting there is nothing interesting about him anymore.)  and yawn in his face!</p>
              <p>Then avoid going out lunch with him anymore!  Talk to HR to hopefully request that one of you stay in the office or take alternate lunch hour!  Or you can suggest to stay in and have him buy you your lunch everytime you need to stay in!</p>
              <p>Their common excuses will always be:  Just being friendly, did nothing wrong what.  You are conservative.  Its only joking. I didnt know you will be offended, last time send to you, you never say dont like what. </p>
              <p>Or in some extreme cases, will deny having any intention on you because you are too ugly for him; or he already has a wife/g/f/mistresses and you are trying to throw yourself at him.  He only sms to you so as not to be rude to you....blah blah blah....</p>

              <p>Just tell him in a proper manner saying that you don't like being spammed with messages and that we should respect each other boundaries. If he asks you for lunch, tell him that you already packed lunch/lunch with a bf/husband.</p>
              <p>Maybe he thinks your one of those girls who can easily feel loved just by doing this kind of shitty stuff towards you. He could probably tried to touch your hand so that we can masturbate late at night when he comes home, that's how it gets off.</p>

              <p>then just talk to him on work related stuff, other than that don't communicate with him.  If you still allow casual conversation and do not know how to deal with him if he starts his nuisance then you will get more stress from him.<br> </p>

              <p>this colleague of mine, he sits behind me. so i talk to him most
              of the time when we work. like when i have queries or just some
              random chatting here and there while working. its normal right? and
              i end up talking to him the most due to the proximity of our
              sitting positions.</p>
              <p>all was fine, untill he started messaging me. we talk in the
              office, go for lunch together, that im fine since its like
              interaction in the office and there are other co-workers around.
              but i barely know him and he messages me random stuff like what
              he’s doing and asking me about my day and telling me good night and
              stuff. im fine if im closer to him or knew him longer to feel
              comfortable to talk about such stuff, but i feel such
              outside-office interaction isnt neccessary and i dont want it. i
              dont mind talking to him, but i dont particularly enjoy it.</p>
              <p>he spams me messages, ard 4-5 messages at one go and im quite
              disturbed by it. i feel it isnt neccessary and i dont want to reply
              him at all. but i just do, out of courtesy.</p>
              <p>there was once, or so my gut feeling tells me, he purposely went
              to shake my hand to wish me good luck when i was sent by the
              company for some training. i think he did that just so he can touch
              my hand. what the shit. i feel totally disgusted at that
              thought.</p>
              <p>he asked me to give him a massage twice already and of course i
              rejected! in a polite and joking manner and he said i was
              conservative. i just think its inappropriate dont you think? i
              wouldnt want to touch him for goodness sake. and how inappropriate
              would it seem in the office, huh?!</p>
              <p>i may be thinking too much, or just being paranoid. naybe hes
              just being friendly. if thats the case, i seriously dont mind. but
              i dont see even my closer colleages messaging me like that, whats
              more he’s a guy! i just feel uneasy. i hope im just thinking too
              much. tell me, is that something i should be worried about?</p>
