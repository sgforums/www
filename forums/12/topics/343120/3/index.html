              oh my gosh no!!
              
              i.do.not.remotely.like.him.
              
              anyway, updates. haha. i got transferred out to the service counters, which is just outside the call centre where i used to work. on my last day in the call centre, he mentioned wanting to quit as well, since many of our colleagues who came in together with us have also left. it was a friday, and he said he'll call on sunday to inform them, which is against protocol anyway since we are supposed to give one week's notice before leaving. so i was just wondering if his sudden decision to leave is because of me??? lol. what the shit. 
              
              so far, ive been transferred out for close to a month already and guess what, he's still there. we sometimes still have common lunch time so we do go for lunch together as a big group. cant escape that. so i havent been in contact with him for a few days in a row. he still messages me now and then. weird messages. messages asking about how im doing. and best wishes and all that.
              
              ok, pardon me. but its like he kept asking me about my SAT score since he knew i just took my SATs. even my closer friends dont really ask about them. anyway he just strikes me as a very result and academic orientated person, like he just wants to know how good my english is and then gloat about it or something. like, my SAT scores are none of his business right?! 
              
              then he'll end his messages with cheemology things like. "hope you find life value in this galaxy." wtf. its just weird.
              
              oh i havent gotten to the main point. cos now he's in the call centre, im in the service centre so we dont talk that much anymore. sometimes i dont even see or talk to him at all. sometimes we dont even have common breaks. so i wont message me for no good reason right?! and i have my own life as well. and anyway its he who messages me first and i seldom reply or take very long to reply his messages, he knows that. then one night, he messaged me and asked if i was mad or upset with him,because of something he did, thats why he hasnt heard from me for so long. he even extended an apology. like OMG!!! wtf seriously. like i even bother to be upset with him about anything at all. theres nothing to message him about what. wtf. just because i dont want to sms him/ dont need to msg him/ dont need to talk to him, he thought i was angry with him. OMG. i mean if its my boyfriend who sends such messages, thats fine.but for him to think that way.. i really dont know how i should think.
              
              oh, another thing. when i just got transferred out, he kept asking me if there were vacancies in the service centre because he wanted to come over as well. to try out, so he claims. i want to believe that.
              
              OMG

              <p>this colleague of mine, he sits behind me. so i talk to him most of the time when we work. like when i have queries or just some random chatting here and there while working. its normal right? and i end up talking to him the most due to the proximity of our sitting positions.</p>
              <p>all was fine, untill he started messaging me. we talk in the office, go for lunch together, that im fine since its like interaction in the office and there are other co-workers around. but i barely know him and he messages me random stuff like what he’s doing and asking me about my day and telling me good night and stuff. im fine if im closer to him or knew him longer to feel comfortable to talk about such stuff, but i feel such outside-office interaction isnt neccessary and i dont want it. i dont mind talking to him, but i dont particularly enjoy it.</p>
              <p>he spams me messages, ard 4-5 messages at one go and im quite disturbed by it. i feel it isnt neccessary and i dont want to reply him at all. but i just do, out of courtesy.</p>
              <p>there was once, or so my gut feeling tells me, he purposely went to shake my hand to wish me good luck when i was sent by the company for some training. i think he did that just so he can touch my hand. what the shit. i feel totally disgusted at that thought.</p>
              <p>he asked me to give him a massage twice already and of course i rejected! in a polite and joking manner and he said i was conservative. i just think its inappropriate dont you think? i wouldnt want to touch him for goodness sake. and how inappropriate would it seem in the office, huh?!</p>
              <p>i may be thinking too much, or just being paranoid. naybe hes just being friendly. if thats the case, i seriously dont mind. but i dont see even my closer colleages messaging me like that, whats more he’s a guy! i just feel uneasy. i hope im just thinking too much. tell me, is that something i should be worried about?</p>

              <p><br>There's nothing you should be doing, cos if there's something that you can do, you would've already done it.</p>
              <p>Now you only need to sit back and relax while everyone else start to feed your imaginations and pour all their condolences to you.</p>
              <p>I don't like to entertain this kind of faker tale. If I really want to spin a tale like you, I would've made it alot more spicy and exciting in details and description.</p>
              <p>But I don't do it, save you all the horror and trouble to go toilet to change your underwear out of excitement. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
