              <p>Can but you get blackmark by singtel and starhub lor so next time you can't sign line with them. You have to chose M1 but I think nowadays all the 3 handphone operators all got link with each other so before you sign line with M1, they will check with starhub and singtel that you still own them debts than M1 won't allow you to sign with them too.</p>

              <p>will the people who keep saying it is fake just because they are poor just back off?</p>
              <p>Some families live from hand to mouth and do not have the extra money. I assure you 4k is not a small amount to most singaporeans. And there are plenty who cannot cough up even 1K just like that.</p>
              <p>Anyway, just go talk to singtel. Tell them you're unable to pay up in one shot (if possible show proof) and work out a repayment/ installment plan with them. As mentioned by Hwaimeng, they do accept these arrangements.</p>

There is no way your fren can deny the usage of the phone lines if you choose to pursue it all the way. Tell the telcos honestly that the phonelines are not used by u and you can seek their advices whether reporting to police will help or how they can help by cooperating with police or whoever. They will help, to be honest, spending money on credit companies for a couple of thousands, they rather help you to recover the money.</p></div>

              <p>yea i agree. not all families can afford that much of money at one go.</p>
              <p>i believe the service providers are able to check on the phone records. check on the numbers that TS's friend called. from there they should be able to know who was the one using the lines.</p>
              <p>however i got to agree to some of the forummers here. TS is indeed too gullible. even if they're your relatives, u still got to be careful, unless u have known them for years. however, even friends of many years can still betray you, oevr money.</p>

              <p><br>dont bother smsing or calling him. if he wants to hide from u, do u think he will bother to reply or answer your call? go and find him personally. better with some friends so he'll be intimidated. but of course, do not threaten him. the best is u can get hold of him, call the police straight away. but try not to use force.</p>
              <p>one thing u didnt mention, when u sign the lines, is there any new mobile phones involved? if there are, did your friend keep the phones?</p>

              <p><br>there u have it. this is simply a case of cheating. your so called friend is asking u to sign the new lines for him, then he takes the phones and the notebook and sell it for money. simple case, just call the police. he's no friend of yours if he is out to cheat u.</p>

              <p>I need your guys help really badly :(, here is my problem, i
              open 2 handphone lines (M1 &amp; Starhub) for my friend, he said
              he's gonna pay all that but 2 months later i received a call from a
              credit company saying i got to pay $2,700 for M1 and $1,200 for
              Starhub. My friend is very cooperative in paying the bills and i
              even pass him $200 to pay the bills but he use it on something
              else. I'am only a national serviceman and don't really have that
              much money at all, i need to help pay the
              bills,medications,food,transport. Do you guys have any idea what i
              should do now? Thank You</p>
