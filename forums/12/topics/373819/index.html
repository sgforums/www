              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>i've jus been rejected recently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i find tht the other party really isn't handling this well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>she'll say things like "we can still be frens", "no hard feelings" but her actions r totally different.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I initate a chat on facebook, she immed log off. i was blunt and stupid enough to sms her to ask y she needs to be so extreme and she replied it wasn't her and the insensitive me actually gave her a sacrastic reply <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i apologize for it and she says it's ok and even sounds like her usual self, wishing me gd nite. i tld her tht i'll keep my promise to give each other time/space to cool down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ytd nite, i login msn, purposely appearing offline and i saw her online. with no intend to chat with her, i re-login again appearing available and i saw her immed disappearing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>wat's wrg? must gals be so extreme? i already promise to lay off liao and my actions do tell these few days, no sms, no msn, no emails etc... nothing at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i really wonder what's on their mind aft tht reject someone. pple tell me the gals also dnt feel gd to break someone's heart but i dnt get it cause it's the guy who's feeling sh!tty mah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>wat can i do now? i thot laying off wld b gd enough but doesn't seem the case :(</p>

              <p>Get on with life, have fun and few years down the road, she will see you successful, interesting and dunno what else fantastic, while she gets older, lonelier and whatever that comes with age which women always have to battle with when they get older.</p>
              <p>Or who knows.......donkey years down the road, both of you can sit down and lim kopi and laugh at how youngsters are going thru what you went thru.</p>

              <p>There is nothing there to suggest she will want to always be available for you to talk to.</p>
              <p>And no point about it liao lah.</p>
              <p>Get on with life, have fun and few years down the road, she will see you successful, interesting and dunno what else fantastic, while she gets older, lonelier and whatever that comes with age which women always have to battle with when they get older.</p>
              <p>Or who knows.......donkey years down the road, both of you can sit down and lim kopi and laugh at how youngsters are going thru what you went thru.</p>

              <p>i think not only girls behave that way, guys behave that way too. so guys and girls are the same in some sort of way in terms of how they handle the matter.</p>

              <p>The rejection that u feel now is cos it is not self-love but 'her-love'. In other words, she is (was) the object of your love - now that she has more or less rejected u - where is your love pointing to? Hence the anxiety, the anguish ....</p>

              <p>some girls are strange. When u are treating them nice because u are being a gentleman, they got sensitive and thinks u like them n starts to avoid u.</p>
              <p>If u treat them bad, they will think why u not acting like a gentleman...</p>
              <p>treating a person nice does not neccessary mean u interested in them. she needs to grow up.</p>
              <p>its difficult to remain friends with a girl unless shes attached.</p>
