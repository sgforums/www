              <p>A <strong>bigot</strong> is a person who is obstinately and irrationally, often intolerantly, devoted to his or her own religion, political party, organization, belief, or opinion, especially one who regards or treats those of differing devotion with hatred and intolerance.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> <strong>Bigotry</strong> is the corresponding mindset or action.</p>
              <p>The term <strong>bigot</strong> is often misused to pejoratively label those who merely oppose or disagree with the devotion of another.

              <p>And to TS, in the name of being fair and my personal opinion.</p>
              <p>There is a kind of character/personality complex which I do noticed on certain females.</p>
              <p>I know this female person, lets call her Miss W. (Please do not confuse her to anyone on this forum.  Her surename does indeed start wth a W, same as me unfortunately.  And she really is a Miss because she is a virgin, mid thirties with about a education of a ITE certificate and a IQ &amp; EQ of a Primary 2.)</p>
              <p>(To not to insult any primary 2 persons on this forum.  I can only describe this to illustrate my point:  I was about to cross a sheltered walkway where the kids are playing.  Apparently, they were blocking the way so they can play.  I simply say excuse me and starts to walk, and one kid block my way to tell me that they can't let me cross cos their friends are playing.  I simply replied that this is a public walkway and not limited to kids playing.  There is no signboard saying its limited.</p>
              <p>The kid then say: No no, its for kids.  And if you want to cross, you must win me by spelling a word.</p>
              <p>I was patient,  because I usually am patient with kids.  So I just look at the kid.  He quickly say: Can you spell anaesthesia and proceed to spell out the word in super quick time.</p>
              <p>I just look at him, smile and said, thats nice, and proceed to walk past the kid.)</p>
              <p>Now this Miss W. Have this brother that is a lawyer, who married another lawyer and thus.....the whole family must be very intelligient (In her mind.)</p>
              <p>On several occasion, Miss W been bragging to me how two guys, one is a pilot in training and another is a business is courting after her.  She claims she knows the 2 guys from the facebook.  They see how pretty she was and contacted her to court her.</p>
              <p>Finally, I lost my patience and demanded to see who those two guys are.  She then linked me to their profile.</p>
              <p>And one time, she actually linked me to her msn conversation with one of the guys and I chatted with the fella.</p>
              <p>As it turns out, the businessman fella is near my place and I requested for a kopi session with him.</p>
              <p>When I met him, I gave him a warning not to mess with my friends heart, cos she is really a innocent gal.</p>
              <p>To my surprise, the guy face to face tells me.  No.  He never met her or even asked her out.  This is the first time he was out with a internet female.  And No. He was contacted by her, on the pretext that she was also a food lover.  And a last No.  He was never attempting to court her, either on internet or real life.  And he never initiates conversation with her.</p>
              <p>That event later opened up a can of worms, because I later found out from other people.</p>
              <p>That Miss W, has been going around, telling people that she and I are close friends, and she described me and her outing to something that happens often and its like every week I was out partying with her.   When actually, the only party I attended with her was 1+ years ago.  People were shocked!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>There has been several occasions where Miss W, then either parrot me, or give advises to others, whitewashing her advises, to show that she knows those things.  When it was actually me that told her those things when she asked.</p>
              <p>Now sometime after that, she contacted me for a chat again, and I asked her about how the two guys that was after her, did she accept at least the businessman guy?</p>
              <p>She tells me:  Oh, she dumped them, because someone from her church tells her to be careful of such guys from the internet.  because all those guys only wants her for sex.</p>
              <p>She didnt know that I was in contact with at least that businessman guy.  And later, the guy showed me some conversations and emails archives.</p>
              <p>From what I can read.  Miss W has been trying to seduce the businessman with saucy conversations, along the lines of describing her panties patterns, bra sizes and how much she wears bikinis to swim &amp; suntan. Then there was description about how well she cooked and how much she will treat him to her cooking.  There was some really good hints about how good a g/f, wife &amp; lover she will make.</p>
              <p>And then suddenly, there was a change in the tone of the emails to tell him how much a jerk he is, that he must have evil intentions, and only trying to ask her for sex.  And that she hates these kind of jerks blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>And she blocks him on msn, change her phone number and delete away her facebook a/c.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Miss W, later found out that I am still in contact with that so called businessman suitor.</p>
              <p>And thru certain conversations, she was trying to sound like she was very superior.  Along the line about how her family lives in Condo, and she must marry someone also living in a condo or landed property kind, and that the businessman cannot match up to her family expectations blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>Sigh........</p>
              <p>We later had a argument about how she demands my time, and how she should conduct herself about her looking for a part time job working in bars as those 'clean type hostresses' when she is still working as a legal secretary.</p>
              <p>We broke off contact then.</p>
              <p>I later found out from other friends, that she used the reasons that I gave her, to not work in a bar.  And there was some talk that we broke off contact, because I was trying to make her fall in into the disrespectful situation where she have sex with sex crazed internet users.</p>

              <p>red,</p>
              <p>notice that i dont exactly often contact people to chat even though i have msn, yahoo, skype and blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>i believe that as friends, you dont have to chat on msn to continue a friendship.</p>
              <p>maybe when either one is really free, and there is only this much that need to be discussed. eg. when to meet, what to bring or buy.</p>
              <p>otherwise, conversation can be limited to just understanding each other and no need to talk so much on msn.</p>
              <p>real friends talk to each other on issues that caters to each other.  Not only about one party.</p>
              <p>msn is just a comm tool that can never define friendship.</p>

              <p>Redname, there is a piece of advice I wanna dish out to you. Once you made a confession, don't ever flinch or back down saying you still want to be friends. It shows a lack of belief in yourself and your values.</p>
              <p>In any case, there's no point in debating what she does to you. It's really her business and she doesn't owe you anything. If she's attracted to you, she will come, period. Let her decide.</p>

              <p>it's so contradicting. 1 hand say wanna be frens, the other hand avoid the person like the plague and dnt wanna be in tht person's life.</p>
              <p>frens are suppose to be in each other's life, to be there for each other.</p>
              <p>yes i am feeling sore cause she didn't even give me a chance to talk, she jus gave out all she had in mind and shuts me out, perhaps tht's y i felt injustice. my personality of not being able to stand lame excuses doesn't help in this situation lah, can say it's jus part of me to b sacrastic no whether its her or not</p>
