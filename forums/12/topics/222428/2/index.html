            <div class='col-md body'>Hi threat starter,<br>I am surprise that u hv such a experience already in such a young age!!! U r still studying rite? maybe at the age range fr 16-20?<br><br>My advise to u is to be urself, dun worry abt this abt that, at ur age now shld be enjoying sch life and concentrate on ur study. As for relationship, dun u think it is too early? or maybe u can hv some puppy love.... but dun go to the extend of stressing urself, it dun worth it!<br><br>It is nice to pampered by 5 guys at the same time, just treat every single one normal and equal, just like hw u treat ur girl frens. make clear to them that u only treat them like frens and hope continuing to be frens...... nothing special!<br><br>Abt the back stabbing and all other nonsense, u will find more when u r working in the society, this is the cruel and the facts of life. As long as ur consience is clear, u hv no worries.<br><br>U dun live in other's world, sometime u can't worried of wat people thinks! As long as u think it is rite and do no harm to others, GO N DO IT! Most importantly, BE HAPPY! U hv a long way to go gal, be cheerful. There are only 2 ways to spend ur life, its either BE HAPPY or BE SAD, ur choice!<br><br>Every problem there will be a solution, whenever there is a up slope, there will be a down slope. Every issue depends on hw u look at it, fr which angle. Just like hw u interpret a cup with half water, is it half filled or half empty?<br><br>Hope my words will enlighten u something...... Life is full of happiness and enjoyment, it depends hw and where u go n find them!<br><br>Good Luck n be happy, u hv my blessing!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was wondering sometimes, is it possible that we subconsciously pick a person to fail us just to achieve something else? Something beyond tangibility. Something that corrupts. Something that vindicates our assumptions?<br><br>On a side note, thanks for all your sincere replies and private msgs (i've too many to list, you know who you are =). I greatly appreciate that and I feel relieved to know that I'm not alone. I went to the airport to isolate myself and to reflect and ponder about the past, the people I've met and the days I have wasted, the silly things I did, the fun my friends and I went through and the toughest moment of my life..<br><br>I thought to myself that why should I stay to watch life and hope fade away while possibilities, answers and happy mediums are floating in the air? Why would I let this innate love tramples over me, like a mammoth self-destruction, when I could do nothing to buffer against the rage to helplessness?<br><br>Whatever the purpose of this erratic cycle is - it's not like it makes good or there are many reasons why, we move on. Losing and gaining for better or for worse, letting go and holding on; while memories only serve as much as for reminiscing but desire and want will always be insatiable and the delicate nature of all relationships is only open to selfless, nonmutual negotiation.<br><br>The clutter is cleared. There is nothing in this world that you can't face and that is a fact. I'm back in my own skin, no longer living in a shell and I guess I'm getting a lot more out of life.</div>
