            <div class='col-md body'>Master the following cunnilingus techniques, and she'll be putty in your hands, er, tongueÂ…<br><br>1. The Flick (or Lapping at the Vagina.) A phenomenal technique for getting her warmed up is lapping your tongue across her lips. Try licking the labia and vagina up and down. Feel free to roam. Pretend you're licking your favorite ice cream on a hot summer day.<br><br>2. ABCs. Oral sex is as easy as spelling the alphabet. Try using your tongue to spell the alphabet on her box. This works surprisingly well as your tongue is always moving in different directions.<br><br>3. Use Your Saliva. This technique is pretty neat if you really have a problem with the taste. You can add your own spit and let it drip down to her love tunnel, making your tongue more slippery as you lick, suck, and nibble away.<br><br>4. Labial Hold. While holding the two parts together with your lips, run your tongue between the inner and outer labia one side at a time.<br><br>5. Circling the Clit. The clitoris is the most sensitive part of a woman's body so be very gentle in stimulating it. Find the base of the clit with your tongue, slowly circling the area. Rub both sides of the shaft of the clitoris with your tongue. You can also gently stimulate the head of the clitoris.<br><br>6. Figure 8. Use the tip of your tongue to draw the number 8 around her clit.<br><br>7. Sucking. Be very careful the first time you try sucking on a woman's clit. Remember not to use your teeth. Just be very gentle. If she likes it, repeat it. Lick it first before you give a soft suck. You'll get a reaction right away.<br><br>8. Jamming. With your lips placed on either side of her clit, jam your tongue downward repeatedly hitting the clit. Make sure you don't do it too hard.<br><br>9. Tongue Fucking. Harden your tongue and dip it into her muff. Wriggle it around if you can at the point of maximum penetration. You can vary the thrust and the speed.<br><br>10. Clitoral Blowjob. This is an advanced technique. Begin by sucking slowly on the clitoris, as if you were giving it a tiny blowjob. Slowly build up the level of sucking, and then follow up with a flick from your tongue now and then. When she's near her big O, make a swirling motion around the shaft of her clit. This one is guaranteed.<br><br>11. The Tongue Tube. Roll your tongue into a tube (if you cannot do this, forget about it because it is genetic and you can't learn it) around her clitoris and slide it back and forth. It's advanced tongue fucking. This style works best in a 69 position and will bring your woman to ecstasy.<br><br>12. Stimulating the Perineum. Also known as the "taint," the perineum is the skin between the vagina and the anus. Flicking long tongue strokes on this area can be highly arousing.<br><br>13. The Finger. Yes, the finger! Don't forget the finger. Use one or two digits to stroke the clitoris from base to top in each direction. You'll feel it get harder and harder as you go. You can also use your finger/s inside her bearded clam, but start slowly. Thrust your finger gently and do a "come here" motion to reach her G-spot.</div>

This one is guaranteed.<br><br>11. The Tongue Tube. Roll your tongue into a tube (if you cannot do this, forget about it because it is genetic and you can't learn it) around her clitoris and slide it back and forth. It's advanced tongue fucking. This style works best in a 69 position and will bring your woman to ecstasy.<br><br>12. Stimulating the Perineum. Also known as the "taint," the perineum is the skin between the vagina and the anus. Flicking long tongue strokes on this area can be highly arousing.<br><br>13. The Finger. Yes, the finger! Don't forget the finger. Use one or two digits to stroke the clitoris from base to top in each direction. You'll feel it get harder and harder as you go. You can also use your finger/s inside her bearded clam, but start slowly. Thrust your finger gently and do a "come here" motion to reach her G-spot.</div>
