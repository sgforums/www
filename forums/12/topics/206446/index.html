Things can be fabricated through text being typed out without the worry of repercussion.<br><br>She is still young and is gullible to many things new to her. Slowly she will learn. If you are patient and forgiving, you can slowly guide her and not get upset by her negative reactions towards you in the process.<br><br>Both of you are fairly "young" and its understandable than you two broke up because you two cannot past these hurdles of obstacles together. Let her be. You can now think back on this relationship between you two and learn from it. Find out how you could have handle the case much better and with more maturity.<br><br>If I were you, given my AGE, I would not have dated her in the first place. I would remain friends with her and observe her ongoing internet relationship and how it goes.

BUT at this moment she is a hard nut to crack and you will only get more pain than you wanted. DO something else. Occupy yourself with activities and stuffs. Give yourself time to slowly ease da pain. Time will heal it BUT you need all the help you can get to help you pass through the time of healing. Thats where family and friends comes in.</div>
