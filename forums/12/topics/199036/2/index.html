Why do you think you want to divorce? What is the consequences of it? Who will suffer if you decided to divorce? Who will benefit from this decision? Will you be happy with a divorce? Is there really no other way to resolve this situation?<br><br>If you realised that your expectations for your husband is making you miserable, you should stop having expectations for your husband. Afterall, you chose to marry him didn't you?<br><br>Maybe if you think about the reason of your attraction to him initially, you will be able to realise the reason why you chose to be with him in the first place?<br><br>And that reason is what you need to keep your marriage together or it will all fall apart if you're together with him for the wrong reasons.<br><br>So what is the real reason for being together with him in the first place? Care to share?<br><br>To put it really simply, if you're together with him for the wrong reason initially...then I don't see any need to offer any advice to you cos you should've saw it coming. If you're with him truthfully for the correct reasons, I think you truely deserves our empathy.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

Its not easy for him cos thats his sister n blood is thicker than water... n whichever sides he takes now... it'll reflect badly on him especially if he opposes the family members which he grew up wif...<br><br>Hav a good talk wif ur  husband... let him understd hw u feel... dont hav the talk when u r not in a calm mood... let him feel that u really wan things to turn out for the best interests of everyone involved...<br><br>As u mentioned... they r not local... everyone fm different families r raised n cultured differently... wat seems rude to some ppl may not seem rude to others... try to look at things fm a different perspective... u'll see the difference.<br><br>Dont ever make any rush decisions at the moment of heat, etc... U'll tend to regret later... trust someone who's speaking fm experience thou mine is a v different case fm urs...<br><br>Best wishes to u n ur family <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

I rather you see a family counsellor first even if it means going alone. Your divorce options will always be there. But have you tried other options as well? Have you talked to your doting sister in law?<br><br>Of course to be humiliated by in laws is something which you shouldnt let it go of your mind freely. I would be angry too if i were in your case. Liasing with in laws is not an wise option. Though its still an option.<br><br>Of course, you are a grown woman. Im sure you have decide on the matter already. Here we could just tell you the viable options besides divorce. Because like i said previously, your kids will suffer. If lets say your husband got the custody of both kids, what happens if he sends them to stay with your in laws? You might not be able to meet them often. And thus they will lose touch with you. Already the in laws do not like you. They could bad mouthing you to the kids.<br><br>Assume that you both each got a child as custodian. U mention they are twins. Twins have special bonds with eact other. Do you bear to see them apart? Twins need each other grow up. Play with each other. To identify with each other. If they are separated, they will have an empty childhood.<br><br>Have you thought about everything else? Custody, alimony, your life, family, future, career etc etc etc.... if you have, i urge you to think twice again.<br><br>But alas, i would divorce him if i were you. but its just me. Not you. Maybe you are different. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

We have been together for so long because he held on.  We have travelled together, we have many common in interests, we are compatible in everyway.  We hardly have any conflicts.<br><br>In fact, we were doing fine even after the twins are born.  Our kids are so beautiful and adorable.  Everyone just love' em wherever they go.  We are a very happy family despite problems with in-laws.<br><br>Now he is  temperamental.  When moody, he will pick on me.  Any thing that is not a problem, he thinks its my fault.  He does not laugh or joke with my family like he used to.  He avoided to stay in my mum's place.  He just starting to show he could not accept what I am.   He would criticize me contantly.  My monthly expenditures had never gone beyond the usual mthly amount I spent on.<br><br>He was not like that before the last trip to his home town.<br><br>I can understand if it is stress at work causing this problem, but it isn't.  Our monthly income is comfortable enough and I haven't been spending more.  If he is happy, everything is peaceful.<br><br>For a woman like me, I would feel upset why he chose to pick on me at this stage and this time, especially when I have not done anything wrong.<br><br>I believe someone in his family has a hand in this.<br><br>I just told him recently that he need to respect my family the same way he need me to respect his family.<br><br>Yesterday, he finally stay over in my mums place for the weekend, and asks them to go out for breakfast.<br><br>I don't know who exactly has been talking to him .  But deep in my heart, I have decided that if he thinks I am not the wife he likes to be, lets live apart and make everyone happy.<br><br>I'm a person who will not hang on to something which is not meant to be.<br>He knows I will go if he and his family goes overboard.  Now, he has tone down and tries not to make me cry.<br><br>Well, something definitely has changed.  My trust in him to protect me and our marriage.  Its so much heartache.  Think about the happier times we had.  Now we are trying to be back on track.  But it can never be the same again because I know what ever happens, it will always be my fault.<br><br>He has left for his hometown today (for business) but will be back few days later.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, all the while he denies there is a serious problem with his sister and me.  What sparked our recent cold war is because of his bad attitude towards me and my family, and for denying that his sister is creating problems for me or rather us.<br><br>His sister is the one who wants his attention.  She pulls her face on seeing how her brother dotes his children.  She just could not accept that her brother has a family to take care for now.  And hates the children and the wife for taking him away from her.  She is unhappy when her elder sister treat me as one of their family.  Do you understand?<br><br>Frankly, I was asking for attention for this problem.<br>I ever thought I was over-reacting but that was in the early years.  There is a problem with his sister and now there are problems between me and my husband because he treats me and my family with a bad attitude.<br><br>Do you know how he each time he will come to pick up me and the kids without coming up to my mum's place?  My mum have to bring the kids down to his car.<br><br>Do you know how each time he will leave the table halfway and not eat together with all of us (including my family) during dinner outings?<br><br>I asked him does he have a problem with my family, he said no.  But how can there be no problem?  Denial denial denial.<br><br>As I've said, he is just becoming a different person.  We have arguments almost every week.  And all because he finds fault with me for trivial things, instead of protecting me and our marriage.<br><br>Do you know his mum told us that I will be unfaithful in our marriage and this has caused him not to trust me significantly? Including thinking that our kids are not his fresh and blood?<br><br>Do you know his sister was here in Singapore last year bad mouthed me again, that time he went back with her to their hometown and he purposely ignored my birthday the very day?  I have no hope for my coming birthday this month.<br><br>Do you know he had promised a trip to Paris for 2 years, and finally soon on this year's wedding anniversary.  And he just told me yesterday, there will be some tasks (business) to complete before I can claim this reward of "Paris trip".  I told him I don't need this reward.  I will go to Paris myself.  I will still do his work though.<br><br>Do you know how he wanted to know how much I have in my bank account and I don't even have the slightest interest in his total assets?<br><br>Do you know he recently complains how I run the household and taking care of the children, and it should be done the same way as it is with his family?<br><br>I know I am not a perfect wife.  It seems I am not meeting his family's expectation.<br><br>He is unhappy with me because of his sister or family and I am willing to go.<br>So what are the grounds for divorce for this case?<br>Just wanna know.

And he just told me yesterday, there will be some tasks (business) to complete before I can claim this reward of "Paris trip".  I told him I don't need this reward.  I will go to Paris myself.  I will still do his work though.</strong><br><br>Not meaning to belittle your 'rights' too much... But now is really not quite a good time to throw your temper over things when things are already messy enough in the 1st place... Set your priority right... Settle the more 'itchy' and important problems 1st...<br><br><strong><br>Do you know how he wanted to know how much I have in my bank account and I don't even have the slightest interest in his total assets?</strong><br><br>As above. Not a good time to ask about things which others can use to badmouth you.<br><br><strong><br>He is unhappy with me because of his sister or family and I am willing to go.<br>So what are the grounds for divorce for this case?<br>Just wanna know.  Just in case we can't make our marriage work.</strong><br><br>If you INTEND to FIGHT for this MARRIAGE... Don't always mention about 'divorce'... If you do, you're already losing HALF of the battle AT LEAST....<br><br></blockquote></div>
