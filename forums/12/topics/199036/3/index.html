What sparked our recent cold war is because of his bad attitude towards me and my family, and for denying that his sister is creating problems for me or rather us.<br><br>His sister is the one who wants his attention.  She pulls her face on seeing how her brother dotes his children.  She just could not accept that her brother has a family to take care for now.  And hates the children and the wife for taking him away from her.  She is unhappy when her elder sister treat me as one of their family.  Do you understand?<br><br>Frankly, I was asking for attention for this problem.<br>I ever thought I was over-reacting but that was in the early years.  There is a problem with his sister and now there are problems between me and my husband because he treats me and my family with a bad attitude.<br><br>Do you know how he each time he will come to pick up me and the kids without coming up to my mum's place?  My mum have to bring the kids down to his car.<br><br>Do you know how each time he will leave the table halfway and not eat together with all of us (including my family) during dinner outings?<br><br>I asked him does he have a problem with my family, he said no.  But how can there be no problem?  Denial denial denial.<br><br>As I've said, he is just becoming a different person.  We have arguments almost every week.  And all because he finds fault with me for trivial things, instead of protecting me and our marriage.<br><br>Do you know his mum told us that I will be unfaithful in our marriage and this has caused him not to trust me significantly? Including thinking that our kids are not his fresh and blood?<br><br>Do you know his sister was here in Singapore last year bad mouthed me again, that time he went back with her to their hometown and he purposely ignored my birthday the very day?  I have no hope for my coming birthday this month.<br><br>Do you know he had promised a trip to Paris for 2 years, and finally soon on this year's wedding anniversary.  And he just told me yesterday, there will be some tasks (business) to complete before I can claim this reward of "Paris trip".  I told him I don't need this reward.  I will go to Paris myself.  I will still do his work though.<br><br>Do you know how he wanted to know how much I have in my bank account and I don't even have the slightest interest in his total assets?<br><br>Do you know he recently complains how I run the household and taking care of the children, and it should be done the same way as it is with his family?<br><br>I know I am not a perfect wife.  It seems I am not meeting his family's expectation.<br><br>He is unhappy with me because of his sister or family and I am willing to go.<br>So what are the grounds for divorce for this case?<br>Just wanna know.

It's often like building an extra wall in between... Note that the 'pattern' is a bit like COLD WAR... Just that it's not really to that EXTREME. But for a husband already on 'unfriendly mode'..

Partners in the same business is a nightmare. It would seem that you two are just spending too much time together. Buy a new car even if he disapproves and tell him that you have the right to be happy and buying a new car makes you happy. Tell him that it might be a silly thing to do but it makes you happy. Then ask him to accompany you to check out the new cars in showrooms. If he realises that you are determined to buy whether he approves or not, he will have no choice but to go along.

You get too bochap in a relationship, might just give the other party the impression that you couldn't be bother with him / the relationship or has already given up hope on everything.

Com'on girl, nobody has the freaking rights to call u names.<br><br>go for a divorce fight for the kid's custody, and also make sure u get ur alimony. this way even if u r not financially prepared for life after marriage u still have some income coming in from that useless man.</div>
