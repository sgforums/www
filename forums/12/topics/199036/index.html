Its very sad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Divorce is such a strong word. Are you prepared for it? Are you financially stable to be alone? If not, are you prepared to let go of your kids to your husband since courts will issue custody to a parent who can support the children.<br><br>It is always said, the one who will suffer most will be the kids. Can you bear to see your children grow up without both their parents by their side?<br><br>Have you talk to your husband about it? Seriously, if your husband can't even support you emotionally and morally, he is not a man anymore.<br><br>Its hard to make your in laws accept you. Have you tried anything to ease the tension between you and in laws? Perhaps you should call or visit your in laws often.<br><br>If the problem cannot be tackle, let me ask you. Do you still love your husband? Are you prepared to let him go? There are couples who divorced because they can't get along with the in laws. And its a chore sometimes just to put up a fake front. I salute you for being brave and accept the sarcarsm and critics from your in laws.<br><br>Maybe before you think about divorce, have you tried going for family counselling first? It might do you good. Its a different story if both of you are childless. But now, you already have kids. Do not think of divorce as yet.<br><br>Divorce is an option. But it will never be the solution.</div>

Hence seeing a counsellor may deemed inappropriate for him.<br><br>The problem here lies with your in laws. Clearly its their attitude that is the problem here. Can I ask about your financial background and your in laws? Sometimes in laws whom are rich always try to appear superior in front of their in laws. This could be the case.<br><br>But alas, if you think divorce is the solution, do not do it on your own accord. Talk to your husband about it. If he really truly loves you, he will do all he can to rectify the problem.<br><br>Choose your way out carefully. Think of your kids. But of course, think of yourself too. Do not let your in laws chase you till you reach a point where you can't take it anymore and depression sinks in.<br><br>Think carefully....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet ToLetGoOrNot,<br><br>Sorry to know about what you have been going through. Well Divorce is really not necessary, there are many ways to solve your issue since the cause of is a third party. I do understand all the physical &amp; mental traumas you have been going through but have you ever think carefully over this decision you are making, is it really a must. By doing so you only proved 1 thing, that is not walking out with dignity but you have shown them you are weak minded &amp; your sister-in-law is right about you are never good enough, moving away from this issue does not solve it however will leave a mark in your live &amp; those involved. End of the day its never a win win situation. If you are really not good enough, your husband would not have married you, he did so because he love you too. As this decison does not only affect you but everyone in general especially your 2 precious fruits of love. Are you going to let them grow up in an incomplete family? If you love your husband &amp; them you would not make such a selfish decision. In monetary term, its also definitely a loss. If you would let me, i am sure i can help you solve your issue positively without the need to divorce.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since talking to your husband and he avoids the topic, why not threaten to divorce and force your husband to communicate on this? This threaten should be for real. You will need to force him to talk, either thru hard or soft way. Hard way is quarrel or threaten divorce. Soft way is cry in front of your husband and bring up divorce topic, saying you cannot take it. I believe the soft way might work better also, based on the reaction from your husband before. Once your husband opens up to communicate with you on this, It should be better. Don't give up hope yet. Try all means to communicate, if all else fails then at least you tried! No regrets to divorce then.<br><br>You said the family threw out a daughter-in-law because her husband was unfaithful?..... I have nothing to say, the family ethics is rather wrong. However disclaimer is the daughter-in-law is at fault too for the unfaithfulness, full story needed for actual judgement.<br><br>A failed marriage usually is both parties at fault. Communication is key.</div>
