They have trained counsellers.<br><br>On another note, please stop visiting the brothels. The more you feed your addiction, the worse it will get. And please see a doctor. Go for an HIV test, abstain from sex until you are clear.<br><br>Stay away from bad influences.

Have been working really hard to provide them the best of all. Everything have been going well till 1 fine day i went to prositution.<br><br>I turn out to be addicted and keep thinking about her. I know its [b]IMPOSSIBLE</strong>.<br>But truth is that i am really addicted. Told my friends about it and they just thought i am joking. I really wanted to stop all this nonsene and be my old self.<br><br>But how?<br><br>I need serious advice on this.<br><br>Thanks for your advice.<br>addicted.siao[/b]</blockquote>lol... think u have stated yr situation too serious...<br>If I m not wrong, u only went to prostitution tat once and only...<br>If the assumption above is true, u r not addict...<br><br>For most guys, usually if it is yr first time, it will be the most enjoyable 1 but after which it will slowly die off... tat is human nature lah... But the more u surpress yrself, the more u think tat u addict...<br>I m not here to encourage u to go but here to explan yr situation to u if the above assumption is correct...<br>There are ways to stop it... Probably, u need to find those with experience to talk to... They will share their experience and hopefully it will virtually fill up yr rest of yr urge to go again to tat kind of place...<br>But, pls find people who willing to help u to tell u the experience .... dont find those tat arouse yr interest and need yr accompany to go again... lol &gt;&lt;<br><br></div>
