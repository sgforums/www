Have been working really hard to provide them the best of all. Everything have been going well till 1 fine day i went to prositution.<br><br>I turn out to be addicted and keep thinking about her. I know its [b]IMPOSSIBLE</strong>.<br>But truth is that i am really addicted. Told my friends about it and they just thought i am joking. I really wanted to stop all this nonsene and be my old self.<br><br>But how?<br><br>I need serious advice on this.<br><br>Thanks for your advice.<br>addicted.siao[/b]</blockquote>I want to share a different kind of advice.<br><br>Everyone make mistakes no one is truly good.<br><br>Ask yourself why you are thinking of her ?<br>Only you have the answer not us.<br><br>I believe you when you say you are addicted to it.<br><br>Sex can bring on the good feelings inside of you.<br>It can cover the pain and suffering one feels.<br>Is hard for others to understand but I know.<br>To be a good guy and a good father and to be married for 8 years is very tough. I dare ask how many people have done it?<br><br>To solve your problem you must ask yourself why her?<br>Like a drug, you know is addictive but you still take it?<br>Cos you know you can feel good about it.<br>You ignore the long term effects cos you are willing to risk it all just to feel good.<br><br>You go to her cos you feel good, if you feel bad will you do it?<br>You are your own key to solving your own problems not others.<br>Seat down and think about it.</div>

It's just bring your curiosity out of it and having sex with a prostitute.. I recommend you to go to see a doctor and test if you have any HIV/AIDS..<br><br>Sad to say, most of the guys are letting their feelings/curiosity/wildness took control of them instead of them controlling their feelings/curiosity/wildness.. It's sad to see a guy with a 8 years of marriage to end up in the prostitutions.. I'm sure if your wife knows about this, *boom*, 8 years of marriage is gone..<br><br>Think about it, why follow a guy whom likes to go there instead of being faithful to your own wife?<br><br>Regards,<br>turbo_drift</div>
