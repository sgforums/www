Love is selfish... and easily one partner will get jeolous of her/his ex.... Its all a human nature, just forget about her, carry on with your life...<br><br>I always believe, when u love someone, after when both are broken up, the love will eventually become hate.... hate is the only way to forget each other... </div></blockquote>sad and angry i'm with u... but not about the part where i will make my gf hate her exes...<br><br>firstly, if she finds out that i did that, she'd also hate me! that risk is too high for me to bet, and cmon.. think about it, wat sort of human are u to hate someone, and trying to get someone else to hate the person too.<br><br>another thing about exes, is that they are part of someone's past. i believe the past is an education. who i am today is becos of my past. if a gal falls in love with me right now, she's falling in love with me, a person that is who i am becos of wat i went thru in the past. if my past were different, parts (of course not all) of my personality, views, opinions, principles, would be different and she might not fall for me anymore.<br><br>so (for a guy) your gf's ex shouldn't be a threat or someone u hate. yes i'm sure some of u may come across trying experiences with a gal becos of her ex (eg. she may not want to trust u becos of wat her ex did to her b4). if u are a better man, she will see it, and patience and communication helps. on the other hand, if she allows herself to succumb to the negative implications of past memories, rather than learning from them and be armed with the experience to carve a path for a better tomorrow, then she may not be the type of gal you're looking for. definitely not the type i'm looking for i'll give u that!</div>
