My only advice to you is to take it as a phase of your life.<br>As you are growing up and eventually coming out to work, you may find people like that in your work place too.   It's just a matter of getting used to your environment, making an effort to accept the people and their behaviour, and learn to work with them.   You can't possibly keep changing your job just because you can't get along with the people.  In saying that, it doesn't mean that you have to agree with them and to give in to peer pressure.<br><br>Of course it's so much nicer to have friends in school and at work, unfortunately it doesn't happen all the time.  It's best just focus on the main reason why you are going to school and work for (to study and to practise your skill &amp; hopefully earning a living, respectively).  While you are still at school, take the opportunity to pick up skills in interacting with different people which might help you when you join the workforce.  I am sure you have plenty of opportunity to find true friends somewhere else.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Since your family and friends cant help you/make you happy, try to talk to your teachers. Im sure they will be glad to hear your thoughts, and make you feel better. If not, why not try talking to your school counceller? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you dont feel like going back to your previous school, i suggest you try talking to your parents about wanting to transfer school. Again, if they cant help you, try talking to your teachers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
