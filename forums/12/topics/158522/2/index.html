And my fren's mum waited for 6 years before the whole drama ended.<br>And married only after 7 years of waiting.  But her mum did remind daughter never to take the same path as her, coz the 7years is a great torture with lots of tears, loneliness and miserables.<br><br>There are such cases around.<br>Sometime such relationship happen, not only the man and mistress is in fault only.  The wife is in fault too for not waking up and understand what went wrong in the marriage.  For my fren's mum case is the wife always nag at my fren's dad showing less of care and concern.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>
