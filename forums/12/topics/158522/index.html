(We attract qualities that we exude). Allow me to refer to 1bigmess case on my reply in 041005 <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=155738" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br><br>Allow me to quote one section which I had written:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by yunhaier:<br><strong>...I have seen so many cases, where a person who cannot commit often find himself/herself being in situation where he/she will attract partners that is unavailable themselves. We attract qualities that we exude (This being Fourth Law of Love - CloUdiSm) Because you cannot commit due to your then-marriage when you scandal first begin two years back, you are such a perfect candidate for a relationship with him because he is seeking for people who cannot commit and at the time, you are simply just that. Look at him! He is also involved with another girl, who is unavailable (being attached)... and therefore I am not even surprised when you relate that part of the story....</strong></blockquote><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In similar case, all thoughtful words from you will likely to have no effect on her. There is an emotional NEED... somewhat like when you are hungry, you will simply just eat the expired bread because you are hungry. Hunger is a NEED - until your health suffered and probably get food poisoning or diarrhea, you wouldn't bother. Reason being: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it still tasted fine</strong></span>.<br><br>So what your friend is attached? His boyfriend isn't giving her what she needs emotionally and if that man could fill in the gap, she will probably think - why not? This is an important element why people choose to accept potential misery even knowing that they are playing with fire. They always thought that they have the power to control the flames, end up, realising it became a huge conflagration that got out of hand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Something to share:<br><br>I kinda 'allowed' my best friend to mingle with this married man (with kid), who is her current bf. His marriage was long gone and my best friend's appearance is like the catalysis. At first, it was a flirty play thing, but obviously, I know better and advised against it. But when you realise, warning means nothing to people with deep emotional emptiness... I did what I always do - to let karma teach her.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'... Do what you will... I can only try to catch you when you fall...' </span><br><br>We all must walk the route our destiny has in store for us. This is the path to enlightenment - if people has to go through certain karmic debts, so be it. I am not God, I cannot change what God has for her. I can only offer my views on issues and then my shoulder if things goes wrong and she comes back crying. And if she found what she seek, I will be happy for her. (She is currently very happy in that relationship for she just had a jerk guy in a five years BGR)<br><br>P.S: CloUdiSm Law of Alpha Omega overrides everything single law in CloUdiSm.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Ahkico,<br><br>Your friend has gone through disappointment with her bf, who's hurt her by flirting around.  During her most vulnerable moments, the married man enters the equation, &amp; your friend has latched onto him to give her the emotional support &amp; love that she's missing from her relationship.<br><br>In this instance, it's hard to blame her for acting the way she did.  She probably knows the risks involved in being with a married man; Nobody can be so naive, Not with well-meaning friends telling her the possible consequences.<br><br>The main thing is that you've done your best as a friend to act in her best interests.  She's chosen to continue the liason with her eyes wide open.  Let her face the consequences.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ahkico:</div><div class="quote_body">Pls help!<br><br>No no.. Is certainly not MI!!!
