            <div class='col-md body'>I have been with my company for more than 6 years. I started this job as a Software Developer.

Like hiring new staff, meeting with users, documentation, costing, assign jobs to the developers and etc.<br><br>But my problem is, I never get a single promotion at all after so many years, so my job title is still Software Developer. The total paid raise after so many years is $160 for many years (not every year, the total is $160).<br><br>To be honest, I feel that I don't have any progression opportunities, as well as increment. Though the company is making profits, but this is a family business, so you don't hope for promotion or increment. It's like you will still be Software Developer after working in the company for another 10 more years.<br><br>So, I am thinking of making a change. To seek for progression, like looking for a job of Project Manager position. I found quite a few jobs and everytime the interviewer through question like:<br><br>Why you want to leave you company?<br><br>I feel hard to answer to this kind of question. Because I feel like if you tell them, there is no promotion no increment for my current job, it's sounds quite negative, and I also don't want to talk bad about my company.<br><br>So, anyone has encounter such difficulties too?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello McFedand<br><br>My condition is just like yours, except mine is in terms of months.<br><br>My job is to over see software, develope, enhance or troubleshoot. It's either i have done a damn good job. or there is nothing else I can do.<br><br>All day long I start to handle different stuff, and staff.  Looking at invoices, keeping track of stock and parts, managing vendors and cost etc...<br><br>My passion and interest is in writing software, yet the things I do now are not software related, more like a production engineer... no longer software engineer.<br><br>Instead, before you leave, do you have the paper qualities? If you do, I guess with 6 years of experience, you should be able to land yourself a better job somewhere else.<br><br>Also, did you ever mention to your boss about the pay? Like how the market is doing etc? I had already informed my superiors about this issue, but empty promises are made. Might have to move on later.<br><br>Anyway, best regards in your job hunting</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr.McFedand,<br><br>You're right to avoid any statements that might suggest the slightest negative elements about you. One or two white lies won't do harm. In fact, that's what your prospective employers to hear; tactical speaking skills. I'm saying this because my brother who interviews sales persons told me that's the most important part to look out for.<br><br>My advice: Say only what they want to hear. A quick google will churn up tons of useful tips.</div>

It's not wise from my opnion that you want to leave. Doing management work is what a lot of techies eventually want to end up in not the other way round from management jump back in to do technical. I dunno if you ever PM'ed projects before or not, I can tell you it's very heavy responsibility and not glamorous to be a PM.<br><br>Picture this if you leave and manage to get a job teamleading or PM role for the next few years, would you at 30/40 eventually want to still be spending late nights/weekends poring over code with other developers. Are you sure you still want to do such things by then? Even if you are will you have the energy is a question. Don't you think they will have younger more energetic PM / team leaders whom you will be pitted up against? And your performance will be matched against them? I can tell you it be a losing battle.<br><br>Do 1 thing, next time your company advertise for higher management position relevant to what you now doing, approach your boss or HR and ask to apply, from how vague or direct their replies you will know how much they value your contribution then from there decide again.</div>
