            <div class='col-md body'>Hi sunshine,<br><br>It's nice to hear that there are someone who wishes to know you, we all come to a point when we are attracted to the opposite sex. But it appears that no much information is given, and you aren't really sure whether is he really interested in knowing you better or just remain as a friend.<br><br>I would advise that you think of the whole situation as just normal friend, in order not to give you false hopes or wild assumptions. Remain contact with him, and lead your normal life as well. Stay as friends first, he may just be physically attracted to you or a crush only. I'm not saying that you ain't worth his attention or love, afterall you did attract his attention in the first place.<br><br>If you aren't sure, go out with friends or colleagues and invite him along. Take notice of his response and reaction if you must. It's always this little thingy, "he/she is trying to know me", "he/she keen to get close to me" that we tends to develop the same feeling for that person, esp if you are single at the moment. Take his intention as a compliment and stay in touch as a friend. Get to know him better, and let him know you better too. From there, you will know whether both of you have a chance to take one step further.<br><br>By the way, age shouldn't be a problem. The main reason, though not directly, why we consider age as a factor is because of the mental side, whether the person is matured enough, so on and so forth. If he is sensible, responsible and matured enough, don't let age comes between you and him. I know of a friend's auntie whose husband is 10 years younger than her. But they are happily married and have 2 lovely kids...and they met in their workplace too!<br><br>Just be natural and you will know in time. Cheers</div>
