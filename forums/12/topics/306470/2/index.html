              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>today is the 4th month of me and my gf</p>
              <p>yesterday was probaly the last straw for her.</p>
              <p>the whole situation began like this. we had a saving plan. by
              the end of CNY we had to save to a certain amount. so ytd we went
              shopping and i told my gf that i wanted her to get something she
              really liked. because when you get something you like you'll be
              happy am i right? but it seems like she didn't really get anything
              she wanted. so the last shop we went to was Forever 21. initially i
              said i was hungry and wanted to get some bread to eat but she said
              dun buy save up the money. alright so i thought that just see see
              awhile more than we go off le. than afterwhich we started shopping
              in F21. the aircon seemed to have broken down so it was pretty warm
              inside. and you know after awhile you warm + hungry abit no mood to
              talk. so when we left the shop my gf ask me why i so sian. than i
              said you really want to know ah? than she say ya so..</p>
              <p>i just replied saying because we kept looking at girls stuff
              would appreciate if we could have looked at guys stuff too in the
              meantime. than she was saying but today we're supposed to look at
              girls stuff what! than i just replied saying places like esprit we
              could have looked at guys stuff too since guys and girls stuff were
              in the same outlet itself. than she said than just now i ask u go
              see you ask me go see my girls stuff? than i say no la.. blah blah
              can't really remembered what i said but nothing really offensive.
              the thing is, i was hungry and hot. i wasn't in the right state of
              mind to really talk. so what i blabbered about wasn't really what i
              mean. i know its abit too late to change the fact but gah. plans
              for the rest of the day were ruined. i told her through sms that
              the real reason was tt i'm hungry + tired blah blah. so she told me
              she was angry with me because i was in the wrong and yet i still
              argued back. i'm really disappointed with myself that i made a
              mistake and yet i still don't know what went wrong. so in one of
              the sms i just said i hope that you would voice out anything you're
              unhappy about this way i can understand you and not act as though i
              understood when i didn't. because everything i ask her what's wrong
              she just goes, you should know blah blah. and doesn't want to tell
              me.</p>
              <p>anyway later in the night she msn-ed me. saying don't i feel
              tired that all these are happening? saying that i repeat the
              mistakes again, i mean true i'm tired because everytime i make a
              mistake i don't even know what happened and she doesn't want to
              tell me! than when i make the same mistake again she flares up. i
              mean yea now things are working out when she decides to tell me
              what's wrong. but now things as it seems like she wants to initiate
              a breakup with me. we're on a 'break' currently. guess this 'break'
              is just to let her think things through.</p>
              <p>i really don't know what to do. i treasure the relationship and
              hope things work out. we have a character clash but i just hope
              that she can accept the way i am while me on my part try to change
              for the better <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>

              <p>she surprised me by turning up to go home with me and i'm currently working at jurong btw. we had dinner together and proceeded to do some window shopping.</p>
              <p>really thank you all for your time to read up and offer some advices <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"> guess sometimes there's only a limit as to what the guy can do. whether the woman wanna forgive the guy or give the guy another chance, its another issue.</p>

              At 20 years old I thought you'ld be a bit more mature than this.
              
              Seriously, this is a very small matter. There are much bigger things out there in this world. No point getting upset over such things.

              <p>my gf used to be like that too... before we learn how to communicate. now after 2.5 years, such things like "she is angry but i dont know whats wrong" have gotten much lesser... not totally gone much much lesser.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1 thing that i feel is different in ur r/s compared to mine is that I am more tactful and patient towards my gf and my gf is also more sensible bah(if i say i am hungry, we'll head off right away to eat).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, people takes time to know each other and to slowly accommodate the lifestyle of another. that is how r/s improves. hopefully u guys will last long.</p>

              <br>1) Seriously, i dont see any mistakes you've made?? Apologise for what? You sound like (from your words) you're very afraid of making mistakes in the presence of your gf.......... which is not good </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Cannot even buy a pathetic piece of bread? Both of you dont have to eat? (the most ridiculous part)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Break up? becuz of this</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) A case of miscommunication.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) Good luck</p>

              <p><br>i agree. *cough* this is one of the first few tihngs a girl should learn in relationships - hungry men get irritable and irritating. Feed them non stop. That is why in most happy relationships, people become fatter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another thing that gets men irritable is if u call them when they are sleeping and insist on talking. Doesn't help that lots of men sleep all the time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, the other thing is if u call them when they are watching soccer or playing computer game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So hor.. it is a learning experience for your girlfriend la. she need to learn how to siam guys when they hungry.</p>

              <p>alright anyway just to clear things up. situation as of now is that we're together again.</p>
              <p>i've heard from her side, she heard from mine. it was a clear-cut case of miscommunication. i do agree that this is a minor problem no doubt about it as major problems might arise in the future. (for example i'm gonna get enlisted into NS soon)</p>
              <p>i just feel that both of us wants to put tt extra effort in for each other so that we hope the other party appreciates it. but sometimes during the process of it, we just crossed our limits and breakdown and subsequently leads to a quarrel.</p>
              <p>she doesn't really tell me how appreciative she is of me. so at times i'm just afraid that she might be taking whatever i'm doing for granted. i only know i'm appreciated when we write cards to each other on occasions like christmas la, yada yada. only after this 'major issue' that just took place, she really told me from the bottom of her heart that she really appreciates me treating her nice and all. it really feels good to hear such things at times like this and brings your spirit up again.</p>
              <p>i just hope that this r/s would last. not hoping for smth smooth sailing but so as long as it doesn't end, i'm willing to do what it takes to keep it alive.</p>

              <p>Glad to hear both of you had the incident sorted out. More obstacles are bound to come in the future. But if both of you are willing to work for the relationship, it will somehow come out stronger in the end.</p>
              <p>Many couples have walked the same road before you. Hope you don't lose faith in each other. Good luck!</p>
