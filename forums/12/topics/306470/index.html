              <p>today is the 4th month of me and my gf</p>
              <p>yesterday was probaly the last straw for her.</p>
              <p>the whole situation began like this. we had a saving plan. by the end of CNY we had to save to a certain amount. so ytd we went shopping and i told my gf that i wanted her to get something she really liked. because when you get something you like you'll be happy am i right? but it seems like she didn't really get anything she wanted. so the last shop we went to was Forever 21. initially i said i was hungry and wanted to get some bread to eat but she said dun buy save up the money. alright so i thought that just see see awhile more than we go off le. than afterwhich we started shopping in F21. the aircon seemed to have broken down so it was pretty warm inside. and you know after awhile you warm + hungry abit no mood to talk. so when we left the shop my gf ask me why i so sian. than i said you really want to know ah? than she say ya so..</p>
              <p>i just replied saying because we kept looking at girls stuff would appreciate if we could have looked at guys stuff too in the meantime. than she was saying but today we're supposed to look at girls stuff what! than i just replied saying places like esprit we could have looked at guys stuff too since guys and girls stuff were in the same outlet itself. than she said than just now i ask u go see you ask me go see my girls stuff? than i say no la.. blah blah can't really remembered what i said but nothing really offensive. the thing is, i was hungry and hot. i wasn't in the right state of mind to really talk. so what i blabbered about wasn't really what i mean. i know its abit too late to change the fact but gah. plans for the rest of the day were ruined. i told her through sms that the real reason was tt i'm hungry + tired blah blah. so she told me she was angry with me because i was in the wrong and yet i still argued back. i'm really disappointed with myself that i made a mistake and yet i still don't know what went wrong. so in one of the sms i just said i hope that you would voice out anything you're unhappy about this way i can understand you and not act as though i understood when i didn't. because everything i ask her what's wrong she just goes, you should know blah blah. and doesn't want to tell me.</p>
              <p>anyway later in the night she msn-ed me. saying don't i feel tired that all these are happening? saying that i repeat the mistakes again, i mean true i'm tired because everytime i make a mistake i don't even know what happened and she doesn't want to tell me! than when i make the same mistake again she flares up. i mean yea now things are working out when she decides to tell me what's wrong. but now things as it seems like she wants to initiate a breakup with me. we're on a 'break' currently. guess this 'break' is just to let her think things through.</p>
              <p>i really don't know what to do. i treasure the relationship and hope things work out. we have a character clash but i just hope that she can accept the way i am while me on my part try to change for the better <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>

              <p>o.k.. then i guess age difference for my situation. Anyways just apologise ah. after that , give it 1 to 2 days. Just go easy first.... hi n by , good morning.. good nights kinda message. Then u tell her that u miss her. N no relationship is perfect. N to make u a better man , to be able to treat her better. Tell her to give u a chance and to tell u what u did wrong. She well definately say is pointless... and that so many times.. and u must say u agree , dont pleed ignorance.. like u dont know or what like that. Just accept n submit. N say that u are slowly but steadily changing. She obviously hates excuses. N excuses on same situations makes her even more hate ur excuses.</p>
              <p>Dont sound too pathetic , but let her know you try to be in her shoes lo. And u NEED her. Just dont keep repeating ur mistakes.. they will get tired n really give up. Just do it , after few more days.. should be o.k by then.</p>

              <p>Chris1988,</p>
              <p>It's just a small misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>Don't  leave her alone for too long.</p>
              <p>1 day is fine. Let her cool down a little.</p>
              <p>Apologise and tell her "Sorry I spoiled your day. Next time, I will make sure I eat something first before we go shopping."</p>

              <p>Yeah I agree with badmaro.</p>
              <p>It sounds like a small matter that you all argue about. after a few days cool down can talk thing through and apologize.</p>
