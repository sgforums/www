U &amp; I may agree on but not HIM or HER. Clear? For example, if i insist tt abortion is wrong, it may not be so for another. She/he may feel tt there's nth wrong with abortion &amp; tt makes the argument <strong>VERY</strong> complicated <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Morals r different.<br><br>Therefore, i always make sure wat im arguing abt &amp; with the person share the same Principles? or Level of Communication <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Tt makes my job easier to proceed &amp; finally coming to a conclusion.Phew!!!<br><br>If u do see wat i mean.....<br>I shld say tt U may find him/her avoiding to give reasons to certain issues tt had happened to be running away fr problems, tt greatly depends whether the person feel the same way as U do abt "<span style="font-style: italic;">eveything shld have reasons to them</span>".....if so, the person is indeed <span style="font-style: italic;">avoiding the subject </span>or perhaps, <span style="font-style: italic;">cant be bothered</span> &amp; <span style="font-style: italic;">having no Answer at all</span>. [/b]</blockquote>hihi...no lah im not im fr the star of cancer...like wat my frd said which i totally agree hahaha if pple think tt there is no reason to things...science will not be wat it is today since pple would juz say juz no reason wat...i mean...its really like there must be certain things behind it i think...its juz whether isit discovered and do u SEE it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
