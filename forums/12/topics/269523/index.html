            <div class='col-md body'>to be honest, i don't understand the problem with you teenage, nowadays, things are so simple, and you all have to complicate matters further, your boyfriend is trying to cope with NS life, now his NS buddy are like his best friend, they spend their time together for at least 24/7, now you feel more distant, it is normal, give him some weeks to sort out, don't even call him, find your own activities to do, then let him feel lonely, and then when he feel more lonely, he will call you and want to find you out, and treasure you more<br><br>be more independent, there is much more thing better in life, than a relationship, you don't have to revolve your life within him, and seriously, you can't cope with loneliness, which probably you are feeling right now, how about, start to pick up a hobby, refocus your life on something else, it will make you feel more better<br><br>and seriously, nothing too agony about your thread, expect that both are still immature to handle loneliness.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The bf not wanting to spend time with gf could well be that he has somehow lost confidence in himself. he might be thinking that he is not worthy of his gf.<br><br>It also could be sign of mild depression. people tend to become more withdrawn, and lose interest in the things they used to enjoy.<br><br>Many guys don't like to appear weak in front of their girlfriend. call it ego but it's a trait of many guys. At the same time, he might be dreading army life so much that he can't stop thinking how bad it seems. What's more, he can't share this with his gf cos he's afraid the gf might think he's weak.<br><br>So, 2 possible reasons for him not wanting to go out 1) too worried about booking in again that it saps his energy and he's unable to enjoy his weekends, 2) he's avoiding you cos he's unable to be his true self and doesn't want to appear weak to his gf.<br><br>It'll take time and positive experience for him to recover his confidence and to get used to army life. So the gf should give him support by lending a listening ear when he eventually gets to talking. Just listening will be good. Don't need to offer solutions to problems or give suggestions for this and that. Suspend your judgement, and just listen when he wants to talk. Reassure him that he is still the person he was and that that all he needs to be, and all that you expect from him.<br><br>Understand that he is going through a difficult time and that avoiding you is not deliberate. You have to be very patient with him for now. He'll bounce back if he receives love and support from the people around him. It'll take time but with your help and the support from friends, he'll recover in time.<br><br>Maybe also can check out this link:<br><a href="http://www.fivelovelanguages.com/learn.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fivelovelanguages.com/learn.html</a><br>Find out what 'love language(s)' he responds to so you can focus your energy on them. I would highly recommend reading the book as well. It's useful in all human relationships, not just with our partner.<br><br>my 2 cents.<br><br></div>

He was still cheerful and all. They started to collapse when he entered his new unit. The last I saw him, was last week. He told me about his lousy camp condition and how much he don't like the way he is being treated there. It was just heart breaking to not see him laugh when we meet up coz he always joke. He was just in a bad mood the last time I met him.<br><br>I know he is going to get professional help  (see psychologiost etc) soon. coz he went to see the doc, and they refer him. But, the appointment was fixed like 2-3 weeks after he raised the problem to the doc. I think he wants to really get out of the place he is at now.<br><br>Ever since he started to keep a distance, it makes me feel quite bad coz its as if i'm a irritating girl trying to contact him every weekend. I had already told him that i'll be there for him etc. But it doesn't feel good being pushed away week after week. I don't even know what he is thinking, and I am starting to feel  drained being the one who will try to call and tellling him that he has my support. I know I need to be strong in times like this, but I'm not as strong as I want myself to be. It doesn't help when friends point out that he is not acting normally because they think that when guys book out, they'll want to spend time with their gf and everyone else and not avoid them.<br><br>I have hobbies and interest and for the past few weeks, I've been concentrating on them. But when weekend comes, i'm back to square one. </div></blockquote>Hmm, you didn't mention the psychologist/counsellor earlier. I know how the system works, if its not very serious, they'll just refer and wait a couple of weeks before they see him.<br><br>That's the way they work actually.<br><br>You have expressed your need to be supportive, and he's not reciprocating because he's either too tired, or too morale-less to do so.<br><br>2 options here, carry on telling him you're still behind him, or just back off for a bit until he talks to the psychologist/counsellor.<br><br>Its up to you, take into mind how he was previously and which option he would prefer, but know that the rules are just a bit changed now.<br><br>Who cares what your colleagues say anyway? This is your relationship, and its unique! Actually, not everyone would want to spend time with their gf in the weekends. Some of them are just so tired and disgrunted with their life that they eventually lose the spark, that's why/how some NS relationships just don't work out.<br><br>Good to see you're concentrating on your hobbies, but hmm, maybe this could be a time you call up your old friends, and just chat? Meet each other up, talk, do things you always wanted to do but haven't had the chance to.<br><br>After so much you've done, i believe the ball is in his court now. When he gets the energy to pass it back to yours is another matter, but just give him time ya?<br><br>Best of luck,<br>Aaron</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In My Opinion,<br>NS is a fuc<strong></strong>king depressant. More potent than alcohol or any other drug.<br>An no, i wasnt raped inside or anything  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">. I had the best platoon mates and everything just that the depressing nature of the whole thing overwrited the postitve aspects.<br>Especially BMT, bookout high only lasts that coupla hours. On sundays, when its back to camp, i become fuc<strong></strong>king depressed again.<br>A lot of people feel the same way as me, especially the book in atmosphere. its fuc<strong></strong>king depressing.<br><br>Pardon the use of strong language but i feel its the best way to bring out the seriousness of the condition/feeling.<br><br>Nope, i'm not trying to organise an anti-NS organisation here or something or i'll prolly get raped by the ISD.<br><br>Just that, i'm trying to help u understand this "depression". Its not a matter of being there for him or what, because the root of the problem is the loneliness out there on weekdays and the sudden lost of freedom.<br>Try to talk to him as much as possible, especially during bookout high, while it lasts and remember to call DAILY when he's in camp.<br>thats just a suggestion cause i didnt get through that depression, i just suck thumb until it was over before i was back to normal.</div>

Some of the suggestions you had given, I don't think it will work.<br><br>I can't call him everyday, I am not even sms-ing everyday. Why? coz he told me last week, that he hardly even have his own time, and only spend like 1-2 min to call his mother. I know his mum is probably worried dead.<br><br>I had asked him before if he want me to go to his house, but he don't seem to like the idea, and I don't want to be intimidating by knocking at his house and give him a surprise. Maybe he just want to be alone?<br><br>He told me the morale inside is very low. He don't even want to care about his own safety coz if he gets injured, can get out of training. The hygeine is also bad (and for a girl like me, it really sounds like hell).<br><br>It is very hard to even talk to him on the weekend. I only managed to hear him talk about camp condition last week, after like being pushed away for about 2 to 3 weeks. I felt very lousy when my friend said "he'll go out with anyone but you for the moment". Why do other people see it this way? Is it coz I'm only a hindrance to his life?<br><br>Some others even say stuff like "how long are you going to wait for him? till he finish NS?". They are not helping and only making me stressed and confused. There are even others who say "if you're not happy in a relationship, get out of it. You're shortchanged, and life is unfair for you". But, I don't want to bail out because I made my promises to him and I don't think I can forgive myself if I leave him just because he is having a difficult time. At the way things are going, I feel like I'm the only one trying to make things work, and I'm getting drained slowly like this coz its such a helpless situation for my side.<br><br>Everything happen so sudden, I'm finding it hard to cope. His BMT was fine. When he went to his unit, he just "disappear" from my life. =( </div></blockquote>wow...its been hard on u eh?im not sure if this will work, but i feel u shld tell him how u feel as well...not its like u keep taking in all the loneliness n stuff...even if he is stressed, i believe u do haf ur own problems as well...one can only take so much, understand that NS is always a hard period for a relationship to endure thru, hold on to him, but at the same time, tell him that ur energy is not limitless...there is a limit to everyone's ability...<br><br>since he is visitin a psychologist soon, lets juz hope he wuld b better later on...</div>

He probably needs some time alone by himself and without your presence to focus on his own problems.<br><br>Another reason in doing so is to observe if he is willing to watch and allow this relationship to die away slowly and quietly. If he does, there's bound to be a reason behind it other than a mere depression caused by National Service.<br><br>By right you should be in his thoughts. but as you have mentioned...it isn't happening.<br><br>Is there anything more that you should be revealing to us about?
