Now, he's some depressed person and suddenly so distant to me. It has become a weekend hide and seek game, I would try to call to see if he wants to meet up. For the past few weeks, he has been hiding at home except meeting his guy friends for supper. He don't sms, he don't talk. I don't know how to handle this whole situation. He seems to have a lot of deal with himself. As much as I want to meet him, I don't want to be a nuisance. At the rate things are going, i don't know how long I can last like this. All i have been doing is wait and tell him that he has my support. But everything is going one way now. I feel so stressed but I don't want to tell him that because I don't want to add more problem to his life.<br><br>help.</div></blockquote>What a loser sissy boy...forget about him.

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading TS's posts... I really find that her bf is really having some serious nerve breakdown...<br><br>It is not normal for an attached NS guy not wanting to meet his girlfriend for every chance that he get. No matter how depress or how bad things in camp can get, normally they would still want to go out no matter how bad shaped or tired they are.<br><br>Possible reason would be he is having a serious depression. So bad that he just wanted to be alone. If TS is really serious in this relationship or really concerned about him, she should actually make the effort as in not just contacting him and asking whether they should meet up. Take the initiative to go over and meet him up.<br><br>Although that the result might not be what you or we would think of... but it would still worth the try if TS is really serious in the relationship or even just concern about him. I guess that TS would not want to regret not doing so even if she really don't like him anymore after she found out that he had done something stupid.<br><br>Another possibility that another forumite had posted... kena raped... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Possible... thus explained the drifting apart from friends, family and girlfriend...<br><br>Another possibility that not really exist... Change of sex perference... he realised that he like guys... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>No matter what the possibilities are... I believe that TS should have a heart felt talk with her bf. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey jimi, its easier said then done telling TS to leave the guy.<br><br>Leaving him at this point may be good for him &amp; it might not even be. So sounding an immediate break-up will send him into possible suiside in the worst case senario. Just do the cooling off style would be a better alternative.<br><br>Hey TS, my suggestion is......slowly chill off......just let him be &amp; move on with ur life, keep urself busy &amp; take him off ur mind.<br><br>If he doesn't call, let it be....you have already done all that u can possibly do to tell him ur there but he refuses to open up.<br><br>So take care <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
