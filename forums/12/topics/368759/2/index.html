              <p>As dkcx said, we have no idea what kind of a person you are, so we cannot tell you what your flaws are.</p>
              <p>And to be honest speaking, one rarely sees their own faults, so I highly doubt you are able to see where the problem lies.</p>
              <p>If a few or a group of friends/people stay away from you, it might not be your fault, but when everyone stays away from you, something is seriously wrong here.</p>

              <p>Its hard to see all own's faults but every1 should be able to roughly know what are some of the things they do that people don't like.</p>
              <p>People don't avoid, get angry, distant themselves over just 1 incident that you did unless its something major. Often its some sort of behavior, action etc that people dislike and leads to the way they treat u.</p>

              <p>You may be appealing to some people, but others might not find you appealing due to many reasons. And there is no end to such prejudices when you are 16 or at other age. Unless there is something you wish to change for the better, why put so much thoughts on people who take you lightly? In this world, you aim to better and please yourself, and not so much for others.</p>
              <p>However,there are ways to occupy your mind and time like taking up a hobby that allows social interaction. Hobbies such as sports, language or computer classes? Worth a try, no?</p>
