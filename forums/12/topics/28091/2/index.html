For some, its the physical thing that they want (see people kiss, hug,etc they also want), for others, they want the love and care from other person (someone to depend on, they also want), in any case, they start to ponder whether is it normal to be single now, another major fault from media and stuff - those taiwanese ou xiang ju,etc. Look at this all influence.<br><br>Its pretty alright to seek love like you said above, but as about WORRYING over whether life has become a burden, no colour in life liao, etc without a gf AT 17, thats a big difference. Come on, I understand your feeling if you are already 25 and 99% of all your friends are attached or when you started to reach 30, half of your friends are already married. You will panic, its a normal and natural reaction. But 17? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Being desperate has nothing to do with family problems. Its just one way to escape from the reality of problem families. Logically, if you have family problem, the first you will find is people you can trust, not seeking someone as a gf to love. From the people you trust, you will gain some form of love, attention and dependacy. Yes, not everyone are born into this world having people around them to care, but I believe tian wu jue ren zi lu, somebody is bound to be around. If there is nobody in your case, then I shall start being the first one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>This world is quite shit, but to able to retain original principles of life and love is relatively difficult. Seeing people breaking up, sad news on tv, etc, should serve to build you up, learn from them, rather than letting it break you down. Like fire, both a servant and a master - learn to work with it and even though it could be difficult, but eventually, you will never succumb to the totally destruction of your self-esteem and confidence.<br><br>Cheers</div>
