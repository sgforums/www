First, use the spectacles returning day as an excuse to ask her to have a meal or smth. If you too scared to ask on phone. On that day, ask her when returning if she wanna drink some coffee or something. After that, like all the other forumers said, ask for msn/friendster/skype/email. At the very least, you'll be able to keep in contact with her  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

This is a favourable situation for you, as you have her specs and you can meet her to return it as an excuse. Maybe you can meet her during the early afternoon and suggested going for lunch together. Just find an excuse to have a conversation with her, be it a meal or a drink. It's up to your crapping skills to let you leave an impression on her. Unless you look like Brad pitt (which helps a bit), if not you have to keep her entertained using your humour. The main purpose is to create attraction. Ha. Of course ask her all the info you need about her during the conversation (like when will she be back, her online contacts etc).<br><br>Initiate a move first after the talk. Say you going somewhere or what. That's it for the moment. Ha. A step at a time. Anyway, this is just my advice. I can't promise it will work or what, but this is what i feel you should do at this stage. All girls are different yeah. All the best. No matter what, learn from the experience, be it good or bad. Cheers.</div>

She came towards me and ask me helping her to find her missing spectacle. I agreed but somehow throughout the event I couldn't find it. I then walk over and ask her if she had found, in which she have not.<br><br>Anyway I chatted with her for quite some time and found out she is actually a scholarship student waiting to enter a local JC, and somehow I manage to get her hp number, with the lame reason tat if I found it after the event I will contact her again to return her spect. Immediately after we exchange goodbyes as she left the event I return to my work area, and there was, her spectacle right under my eyes!<br><br>I picked it up and since she have left, I kept it for her. After the event ended, I called her to explain that her spectacle have been found, we agreed to meet each other on thursday since Friday she is going back to Indonesia (Indonesia Chinese). Now the problem, or challenge is how do I get to know more about her, or find myself an excuse so that we can continue to keep contact with each other before she came back to Singapore, people please suggest bah, I'm pretty blur right now!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>Indonesian Chinese ah..Me also like 1 gal that is Indo-Chinese too...<br><br>Anyway, on the day u meet, don't just pass her the spects and then say goodbye. Suggest grabbing a bite. Don't ask her go watch movies because u don't even know her. So suggest eating something will be good.<br><br>After that, ask her where she from lah(which part of Indo), when she come to spore, blah blah blah..Ask her when she coming back to spore, then suggest keeping in touch lor.<br><br>Wait until she comes back from spore, then sms her ask her how's her trip back home. Ask for MSN. After that, u are on your own buddy.<br><br>Gd luck</div>
