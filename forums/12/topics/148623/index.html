            <div class='col-md body'>Last week, I was browsing throught the Profile on the girl I liked and realized she updated a new photo.<br><br>And there was this new Testimonial from this guy. The guy commented on her new hair.<br><br>Weird thing is she only updated her photo on that day and that Testimonial was written last week... Yaya, I view her profile everyday...-_-" And worse of all that guy was from a different school and only knew her throught 1st 3 months.<br><br>This might have suggested they have met outside... I feel very bothered...<br><br>I went to checked up on that guy. Firstly, there's already a girl he liked... but that was from Testimonials a few months again... so he might have changed target. Secondly, he wrote a Testimonial for my her in March too... and on the Testimonial he wrote "Long Time No See" So it suggests they haven't met for  a long time... but March till now is a long time too...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Worse of all... 2 months ago I hear from my friend... well he's well-known for bullsh1ting and he likes scaring the sh1t out of me.... he said she has a BF and is very ugly...<br><br>And indeed that guy looks very ugly...<br><br>I have a sudden rush to call her  out... but her Prelims coming, so is A'Levels...<br><br>I feel scared... now what?</div>
