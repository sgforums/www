Maybe it's becos he's going thru a transition state but this man still has to control his emotions. He needs to have self-control which he doesn't have apparently. He sounds like a wounded animal. This man has a lot of ego blocking him now.<br><br>The better way to show u like him will be through actions. Every time u see him unhappy, just brush away the subject, talk abt something funny(eg make fun of some actor like stephen chow?) and make him a meal or get him a drink or something like that? Like do something special for him? U must be ready to react fast. Just dun accuse and argue back. It gets worse and worse. U need to see a common trend from his own actions.<br><br></div>

Aint this unfair??!?!</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I recalled an old theory written in CloUdiSm ages ago (I think I will put a name to it someday and probably reclassify it under third Law of CloUdiSm) - it's about how people, who thought that they have been through much in Love, refusing to renew lessons and insisting on resuming where they previously left, despite being very unevolved.<br><br>We got to understand that a new relationship is a whole new experience, regardless of how vivid our past was. Loving your ex-girlfriend/wife is certainly different from loving your current one (Synastry explains this through different energies coming from different natal chart) But sometimes (especially so for divorced/separated cases or BGR of many years) because our emotions become so jaded and sombre, that we refuse to restart. We thought that we have invested so much over the years, only to find it a failure at the end of the day, therefore we must resume where we left and reluctant to begin all over again.<br><br>You see, chances are, you don't have to begin 'all over again' - you just need to begin from where your flaws surface and work hard on them. And for some people, that probably means the very beginning because this is how they have handled their relationship all through their life. And when you snowball this phenomenon, you can roughly guess how 'unmarriageable' he is because much unevolved personalities will prevent/hinder them to achieve a fulfilling relationship.<br><br>Man usually won't talk much about their failed relationship to the next woman of their life, especially so if the problems lies with them. Because it is not glorious and is a raw punch to their esteem. Sometimes, he just doesnÂ’t want to be reminded about this hidden self of his and continue to reiterate the behaviour subconsciously. In the end? He faces the same music and consequence all over again. He fails and fails, until he enlightens himself.<br><br>When I was young, probably about four- six years old, I have foul temper (Moon in Aries) and often beat up my older brother. When after I reached Primary school at seven, I self taught emotional control and reason with myself how futile it is to hit someone.<br><br>Then it became a past.<br><br>I overcome the subject of temper at the age of seven. And using myself as a measure scale; is your man willing to humble himself to explore his untouched emotions and learn what life has to teach him? Even if he has to 'return' to as young as seven and learn what I was learning back them?<br><br>If you want this relationship to work, you got to evolve him. And for that to happen, you have to reach inside of him and lift him out. He may or may not allow you to do that, but you could probably try. Be prepare for conflicts because your man will resist against your attempt and chances are, you may perish from trying and give up altogether, like what his ex-wife probably felt when she signed the divorce documents.<br><br>If you don't want to shoulder this burden, you may want to reconsider your decision in the near future.<br><br>P.S:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> If you want love somebody, grow along with him</strong></span> - have him/her walk beside and not behind you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it takes two to clap.<br>for an argument for occur, its takes 2 people.<br>firstly, your boyfriend is in the wrong cus he failed to control his emotions properly.<br>if he is in a bad mood, he can always say,"look, im in a bad mood now. i need to be alone" sort of stuffs.<br>being his understanding girlfriend, you can always leave him alone.<br>also, he has vented his anger onto you for two times (according to your msg) over trival matters.<br>so when he is in a good mood, talk to him.<br>tell him how you feel and how you dont want to be treated like.<br>on the contrary, you should also be more sensitive.<br>if he is frowning or he looks as if he is in a bad mood, then leave him alone and dont disturb.<br>if both parties are understanding and sensitive enough, a relationship will definitely work out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess that he i kinda taking advantage of ur understanding unknowingly.<br><br>The best way would be find him and tell him how u feel. Dun SMS or talk on the phone. Face to face Communication is the best way of communicating. Not only it tells the person how u feel, it also make the person felt how you feel through body language.<br><br>He might in the wrong.. but what if he thinks the same way like u? Do u both understand each other? Do u think that he is always in the wrong? Do u even try to think if u did something that makes him angry?<br><br>This is just my POV.<br><br></div>
