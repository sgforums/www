In fact, one could easily be blinded by how hasty this love goes and not knowing the person well enough to make a decisive judgement (anyway, most relationship ain't built on decisive judgement) on such short span of time.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What you are witnessing, could just be a surface or brief introduction to the real him.</strong></span><br><br>Having a failed marriage doesn't mean he is condemned for life; however, it usually means that this man has some personalities/habits/mindsets which usually exude qualities of being unmarriageable (unless the cause of his failing marriage is entirely on his ex-wife (infidelity), then perhaps it's a different story), like individualism or unevolvement.<br><br>By mere post, chances are, his temper is likely one good reason why his previous marriage failed because if it was most people, it's probably good game already.<br><br>P.S: I think there is more to come. Take some good time to analysis him and decide if he is still worthwhile. NEVER compromise your age, for an inferior partner that you do not feel secured with (At your age, I am presuming you are seeking for marriageable partners).

Was it because he tried to control his wife too much or for some other reason?<br><br>did u like sort of pissed him unknowingly? like maybe some guy tried to ask for ur number and u gave it to the guy or something like that? there's just something not quite right with this guy... seems to have something troubled in him that caused him to flare up so easily.</div>
