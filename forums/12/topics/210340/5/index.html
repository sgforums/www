He keep shaking the glass of Mac and i could feel the glass moving.  then i asked him not to.  He said the bunch of guys inside were shaking it first.  and i was saying let them do it, dun 'dou' with them.  he was so angry and we had a fight and he juz left and went home (we were supposed to go back tog).</div></blockquote>your bf a bit sot, childish with "wanna win" character leh. Wanna challenge with some guys over this. He got nothing better to do meh. Can feel that he's sensitive, inferior, paranoid, and in his own world of illusions. He strongly believe those guys were out to challenge him. I wonder with his kind of attitude, how will he be able to survive in the working society? Next time you will hear he resigning because of trivial issues with his colleagues in his company.<br><br>Last time I got one newly joined staff who go round telling people I shouted at him. In fact I didn't and the most I did is brief him firmly on what his jobscope is and what he's suppose to do for the day. When I found him very unsuitable for my departments (sleeping halfway during the course of work etc, slacking in work etc) , I transferred him to out of my departments, as I cannot unconfirm his probation and ask him out of the Company right away. Thus my fellow colleague got this problematic guy in her departments. Then later she told me this guy never listen to instructions, and prefer doing his own ways. I wanna tell her if a particular staff is ok and can do work, will I release him out of my departments meh. Oh ya this guy resigned within two months. This guy used to be from the IT industry and got retrenced.<br><br>Back to your topic&gt;&gt; Luckily you have a good temper if not you'll be fighting with him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hallo, vgal,<br><br>I believe there are two excellent advices in this thread, from the man who divorced, and the woman who was with someone who divorced.<br><br>I think your BF syndrome is very much due to that.<br><br>I dont think it has anything to do with childishness, selfishness, ego, dominance, etc said by the rest of other people.<br><br>Perhaps it's hard to imagine, but a divorce can seriously set a man off his balance. A man will be in terrible self doubt, agony, hurt, disappointment, feel a failure, and carry extra difficulties from friends, family, and relatives.<br><br>As you mention also, he just got a new job.<br><br>This is double whammy.<br><br>I imagine he is very much in a sensitive state right now. Not only is he divorced, but he is also trying to settle into a new career, get a footing.<br><br>A career for a man is important, an identity.<br><br>He is trying to re-establish his footing, his life.<br><br>Also read his SMS, he said he's at a different stage.<br><br>So....with this condition....<br><br>When you talk to him, hey how come you hide eating noodles here? It may be a joke for you, since you are happy, but it will bring him into a state, a state when he was in pain, when he was quarreling with his wife, and when he is presently still in recovery from agony. Your small joke is a stinging critisism to his ears.<br><br>How should I put it......like when you rub salt, a healthy person can take a bath with salt, it's nice for the skin. But imagine someone with cuts, and takes a bath with salt and rub it on the skin, it will be painful.<br><br>Same like your jokes, it's nice for you because you are healthy, but painful for him, because he have cuts.<br><br>Simply......you have to remember that he is nursing his hurt....cuts all over.....<br><br>So.....try to tune in to his frequency, try to be more patient, more sensitive.<br><br>If it's hard on you....since the frequency tuning may be too wide.....then perhaps you can consider giving him more time to heal.......<br><br>Because I believe it might be a little unfair for you also if you must tune the frequency too wide for him.....so consider if you need to give him some time to heal (aka temporary breakoff).<br><br>Best wishes,<br>#$%^&amp;*</div>

Loving your ex-girlfriend/wife is certainly different from loving your current one (Synastry explains this through different energies coming from different natal chart) But sometimes (especially so for divorced/separated cases or BGR of many years) because our emotions become so jaded and sombre, that we refuse to restart. We thought that we have invested so much over the years, only to find it a failure at the end of the day, therefore we must resume where we left and reluctant to begin all over again.<br><br>You see, chances are, you don't have to begin 'all over again' - you just need to begin from where your flaws surface and work hard on them. And for some people, that probably means the very beginning because this is how they have handled their relationship all through their life. And when you snowball this phenomenon, you can roughly guess how 'unmarriageable' he is because much unevolved personalities will prevent/hinder them to achieve a fulfilling relationship.<br><br>Man usually won't talk much about their failed relationship to the next woman of their life, especially so if the problems lies with them. Because it is not glorious and is a raw punch to their esteem. Sometimes, he just doesnÂ’t want to be reminded about this hidden self of his and continue to reiterate the behaviour subconsciously. In the end? He faces the same music and consequence all over again. He fails and fails, until he enlightens himself.<br><br>When I was young, probably about four- six years old, I have foul temper (Moon in Aries) and often beat up my older brother. When after I reached Primary school at seven, I self taught emotional control and reason with myself how futile it is to hit someone.<br><br>Then it became a past.<br><br>I overcome the subject of temper at the age of seven. And using myself as a measure scale; is your man willing to humble himself to explore his untouched emotions and learn what life has to teach him? Even if he has to 'return' to as young as seven and learn what I was learning back them?<br><br>If you want this relationship to work, you got to evolve him. And for that to happen, you have to reach inside of him and lift him out. He may or may not allow you to do that, but you could probably try. Be prepare for conflicts because your man will resist against your attempt and chances are, you may perish from trying and give up altogether, like what his ex-wife probably felt when she signed the divorce documents.<br><br>If you don't want to shoulder this burden, you may want to reconsider your decision in the near future.<br><br>P.S:<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b] If you want love somebody, grow along with him</span></strong> - have him/her walk beside and not behind you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers       [/b]</blockquote>I think i dun have the time.

So when he was angry, i rather take a step back and be patient.  But, this cant be happening all the time.
