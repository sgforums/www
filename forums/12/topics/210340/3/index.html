            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What you are witnessing, could just be a surface or brief introduction to the real him.</strong></span><br><br>I agree with this... Sometimes these are really tell-tale signs... Do you know what led to his failed marriage?<br><br>Chances are perhaps his ex wife couldn't stand it any longer? He might love someone a lot, but he loves himself more i guess... Think: Would you ever leave him alone at East Coast Park like this? If it were me, i sure go find a place to hide and cry... So hurting!!!<br><br>But of coz these are just our assumptions... You know him best so you are the only one who have the right to judge him...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He is dominant, bossy, inferior, sensitive and anger easily. He expects you to answer every of his ridiculous questions. And he always points the finger at you. By the way do you know if anything unhappy occur to him during work? Example bad relationship with Superiors / Colleagues resulting in office politics. Being scolded by Superiors or customers etc. Colleagues gossiping behind his back and he heard the hearsays and got angry and spoilt his day. Or maybe he got a past unhappy relationship with his ex? You can talk to him while making it out also <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> But think he not bad lah, at least he got good command in English.</div>
