            <div class='col-md body'>It takes two to work a relationship out. Two to amuse each other in a relationship, and it's not just yourself trying to fulfil all her needs and desires. No one wants to end a relationship, especially one with 3 years invested in it.<br><br>However, I would rather confirm if she's really in love with another guy, than dragging the matter. Hurt for once than suffer for months, since you already mention that you would rather that the blow. Who knows she may say it's just some untrue speculation.<br><br>Well, personally, I believe that it will be the best if two people can be together for life, but there's no guarantee even when you're married in today's society. You won't believe how many times I hear my profs, friends and classmates mentioned about their divorce. It doesn't make me less desiring for a lifetime relationship, but it prepares me to accept a break ups better. Besides I would rather end a relationship before marriage and kids come in the picture.</div>

And it's quite a dangerous thing to put a relationship on top of all everything else....<br><br>Never make too many presumptions about how your gf thinks of the relationship, that's many a time a killer to relationships... Miscommunications and groundless detest simply arises....<br><br>There can be many ways in which a girl would appreciate a guy... Not all girls would appreciate a 100% caring guy... Some girls want more of other qualities... All in all, if she've decided to leave you you can't stop her. If she's not, DON'T presume. It often only hasten the break up... Nobody would know what to expect whne they 1st enter a relationship, so don't tell us IF you know this would happen you won't have gone into the relationship... A love relationship is not all about sweetness... It's also about bitterness and often many battles... If you're only all out for the 'sweetness', I'll suggest you go catch a GOOD movie or something rather than enter a relationship....<br><br>Regards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been with my "ex-gf" for 3 years too. Just broke up and she already have a new guy. Even a blind man could see what is happening here, though she still denies it. She could be so heartless, I hardly recognise her anymore. Saying all sorts of things that hurt my feelings. I can say honestly that in this 3 years, I loved her with all my heart, I've treated her good, and she has never found reasons to be unhappy when she was with me. I never even quarreled with her, until she initiated the break up. But when she changed her heart for another guy, She's like a complete different person. But amazingly, I am still very much in love with her.<br><br>"Maybe she'll wake up someday and find that I'm the one for her<br>Until that day, I will still be waiting for her"<br></div>

And she began the discovery without having the 'wisdom' to understand what she really wants in a guy and what she is looking for. Obviously true for a first-hand relationship, because simply she has nothing else to compare and contrast, take note, etc.<br><br><strong>Lots of quarrel leading to breaking up and patch back </strong>again, etc - such cracks of a relationship cannot be mend. (Note: it cannot be mend). Going through it one time, probably it fated, this relationship could probably endure and move on. Anything more than that, chances are, the ultimate conclusion would have been declared since then, regardless of how many conscious delaying effort and tactics one/both are trying to make. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And you just made one of the top ten mistake man often make in a relationship: <strong>but i realli did my best to fullfill whatever requirements she wants</strong> - the last thing you would do to keep a relationship running and alive with energy is to feed whatever your partner demands and wants, according to her standard and liking. Love gets dull and a woman would lose interest quickly. Under theories of the art of seduction, your action automatically opens her up to potential seducer and Poof! Comes a third party - Twice somemore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I understand three years is a long time and probably both of you have learn many things as a couple. You love her alot, although she not very faithful in her ways. Pushing your likely outcome into your subconscious, unless she tells you straight in the face, you rather avoid the obvious truth. Here is what you should do: face issues with yourself and weigh the pros and cons. Find the answer yourself, rather than to wait for time to provide you with one. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Why regret if you knew that this relationship will turn out to be in way? There are many lessons for you to learn and if you don't realise the hidden morals behind it, you are just wasting the three years of being together. The fault of people is that they lead relationship and when it ends, everything goes with it. That's utterly foolish. You may lose the relationship, but don't lose the lesson that comes with it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

(Note: it cannot be mend). Going through it one time, probably it fated, this relationship could probably endure and move on. Anything more than that, chances are, the ultimate conclusion would have been declared since then, regardless of how many conscious delaying effort and tactics one/both are trying to make. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And you just made one of the top ten mistake man often make in a relationship: <strong>but i realli did my best to fullfill whatever requirements she wants</strong> - the last thing you would do to keep a relationship running and alive with energy is to feed whatever your partner demands and wants, according to her standard and liking. Love gets dull and a woman would lose interest quickly. Under theories of the art of seduction, your action automatically opens her up to potential seducer and Poof! Comes a third party - Twice somemore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Why regret if you knew that this relationship will turn out to be in way? There are many lessons for you to learn and if you don't realise the hidden morals behind it, you are just wasting the three years of being together.

Plan and attempt another way to bring out that intention, yet to minimize the conflicts possibility. You see, most of the time in a relationship, when one side communicate heart-to-heart and leads to quarrels, psychologically, it deters him/her from speaking again in the future. In the long run, it will affect the relationship severely. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Hard to know what to give and not?

I can say honestly that in this 3 years, I loved her with all my heart, I've treated her good, and she has never found reasons to be unhappy when she was with me.

Most of what is said is correct.  let me tell you I love a beautiful woman for almost 8 yrs. Of course our relationships have ups &amp; down. When we quarrell I apologise even she started the tiff. When she want to get angry she simply throw her weight on me even over small petite things. People have limitation. When I got angry and talked sense into her , she left . Normally it wil take few days for us to patch things back. Never I thought she changed. She became very violent with her words . later I know she found someone new. I asked her about us. she refuse to say , She said I should know. She said she doesn't want to know anything about me anymore . So guys , talking about feeling hurts, no words can describe.</div>
