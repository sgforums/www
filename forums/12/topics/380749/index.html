              <p>Hi TheMissus,</p>
              <p>Why not buy him a new tie? This is provided that he actually uses one though. On the other hand, you could bring him out with you for dinner at a restaurant instead.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hmm.....gadgets....you mean computer gadgets...?</p>
              <p>If he likes gadgets you can buy something incremental which improves his computer (or whatever equipment)</p>
              <p>But I am not sure that it's such a romantic or meaningful gift....Gadgets are so technical and sterile.</p>
              <p>Maybe it's better to get something else.</p>
              <p>I recommend a small cake, card, and a book (the book can be on gadget topic, or other interests)</p>

              <p>Husband? <br>Below $200 have alot, get something he will need it.</p>
              <p>Guys want thing tat can be used!, not really to put there for display.<br>EDITED HERE: Unless is something that can really make him seems high-class.<br>Go to the subforum i think club30s? ask ask, cos i dunno ur husband's age.</p>
              <p>Maybe get ur husband a pair of nice shoe or watch.PLEASE, no ugly shoes or casio watch..Although some may say got heart enough but deep down some will think, Want to get , might as well get something better, or can be used.</p>
              <p>If he smoke, get him a nice wind-proof lighter etc.. It really depends how much you understand ur husband, wat's his likes &amp; dislike.</p>
              <p>That's wat i'll think...Hope it helps.</p>

              <p>Does your husband use a card holder? (eg. for storing clients' contact details) or simlpy those card holders for storing keys?</p>
              <p>There are some of these expensive card holders(but still within your budget) that you can get out there in the market . Plus, some come with pockets for putting in photographs. You can develop card-sized photos (cost you only $1 at those photo-developing stores) and then put into the transparent pocket.</p>
              <p>He can store his stuff and when he uses it, he remembers you when he sees the photo. Kill 2 birds with 1 stone.</p>
