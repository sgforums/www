              <p>I think that pretty much sums up what you could have passion for.</p>
              <p>in addition, model making, watching anime, singing karaoke(add on to the love for music) or reading(books or novels, FHM/Maxim not included unless your passion is ...)</p>
              <p>what else, Dining can also be a passion? like you would love to try all kinds of food and tastes from everywhere? Singapore is all about food. :P</p>
              <p>No offence but, some people have passion for buses and trains? so good that they know their serial numbers and every technical specs of it.. not to that extend, but for all you know, anything can be an interest to anyone.</p>
              <p>Even drinking wine or beer also can be a hobby. but of course you'll probably need to know the manufacturing details and content and some history of the drinks.</p>
              <p>Go out and try to find it!</p>

              <p>Nothing wrong  in being interested in nothing.</p>
              <p>But first take care of your sustenance. That is you have a regular income, or have enough money for life. And that you have a home.</p>
              <p>Then just be yourself. Do nothing, sleep all day on off days. Its your life, you don't owe anyone an explanation, neither you must be this or that according to other peoples specifications. This is for singles with no family obligations. Married with children, sorry you can't have that kind of lifestyle.</p>
              <p>But there is some truth in the old wisdom. Happiness come in doing good to others. Look at people who are contented, and satisfied with their life, they are always doing something for others, either directly or indirectly.</p>
              <p>Extroverts who extrudes graces are light in the heart and head</p>
              <p>Introverts who only receives, are congested in the heart and head.</p>

              <p>You know how most people have something they enjoy doing, or something that makes them excited<br><br>Some people very enthusiastic about something, i,e after school they will be like woooo song got time play basketball liao!<br><br>Then they go play basketball with their friends, enjoying themselves while doing so, and they end up being fit etc<br><br>Some enjoy going shopping, weekends their bunch of friends will go shop all that, end up they got nice clothes, good fashion sense etc<br><br>Me however i cannot honestly say i enjoy anything in life =/ When I go out with friends, do sports, go exercise etc, it is only only only for the sake of not being a no-life person, i am not actually excited about any of these things i do at all im like a dead person inside</p>
