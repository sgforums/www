U can tell that this person is of better quality then u, but I tell u, u are just of equal chance of winning the girl's heart over. Coz the both of u have some strength that is unique to urselves. If there's sincerity that the girl can see when u approach her, u are on the right track. Y do u think that some wives or gfs stick to their hubbies or bf, even when they r in jail?? becoz they may be bad in their actions, but to their wives, and gfs they are all clean and sincere to them. that is wat that touch human beings.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

Just yesterday u mentioned that there was a ray of hope shining on ur side, and now I'm really sorry to hear this. I understand that it is like a lifting u up by a crane and drop you down flat on the ground. Can understand how sucky life is for you at this moment.<br><br>Just to be honest wif you. I think ur ex left you for good. Sorry but have to let u face it hard, so that u wun deny to urself the fact.<br><br>As to why I camoe up wif this deduction is becoz you have mentioned that, u just broke up recently, and she found a new bf. But the thing is that she is likely to have liked that guy not out of love. I think she just need someone to with her, and that guy just happen to be there at the point of time. Basically she needed a support. I dunno if you agree wif me but it's how I see it. Chances are that it maybe a short term r/s, unless she already bore some feelings for him when both of you were together. If not she must have loved you dearly, and on your part have hurt her deeply, before she will come to such a situation.<br><br>Maybe having to read this analysis will help you see the picture better. and u can come up wif a better idea of which direction you want to go. I'm sorry for all the harsh words that I used in this post. But I hope that it will wake you up, and maybe think about all the things that u could have avoid and change for a r/s to work out. Once again sorry for the harshness.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

It just that same as a good friends who promises to help you, but stabs u at the back. The words hurt more than anything else.<br><br>Hey, it's nothing wrong for you to take the r/s seriously. Imagine wat will happen if haven't taken it to heart. U wun have lovew her this much. No doubt that u are deeply hurt, but on the other hand you have also experience her love for you. do you think u will experience the time that you had if you had not felt for her that deeply. Hey... dun regret it. Love is a feeling, and feelings cannot be controlled like I said. To be in a r/s wif her already make u special, and I'm sure she has brought a lot of happiness and joy and moments worthwhile to be recorded in ur head rite?<br><br>maybe the memories and the pain are going to stay there for the next few weeks or months, but soon it will be gone.. it will be like a luff... The first of anything in life will e most momerable, but it applies to depressing situation as well.<br><br>Before you know it it's half a yr past and soon u will have to force urself to remember the momories... By then u will know, u have forgotten abt it.<br><br>Cheer up...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
