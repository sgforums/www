Initially, I told her I wan to patch back due to the emotions I have with her. She was very harsh to me as maybe she bear the hatred in me. Right now, she has considered me as a very close friend to me.<br><br>However remembering the good points in the relationship can be very torturing. It is like a mirror shattered in front of you. I have a couple of times broke down thinking about it.<br><br>What I think is that it has to take time to calm both of us down. (Maybe using the tranparent tape to mend back the mirror....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>speaking of a broken mirror rite.....<br>(not to pour cold water on u la.....)<br>i think rite, no matter how u try to mend it, to use superglue or transparent tape to put it back together, there will still be scars thee lo. visible signs of the mirror having been broken b4........plus...when a mirror actually breaks rite, it doesn't just break into two huge pieces rite? there are bound to be small fragments lo...den these fragments get lost....when they do get lost, n u try to put the mirror together, den there'll be a hole present.....<br><br>i mean, get wat i mean or not? it wun ever be the same lo.....(toking bout a r/s after breaking n patching)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually it's not true that a broken mirror cannot be mended again. It has to go thru a very tedious process of melting the glass down and have to ensure there are no impurities in the recycled glass.. But after that the mirror will naturally be able to withstand less pressure and impact then a brand new one. But still it works.<br><br>The problem is that, it's so tedious and the quality of the glass is not as good as before.. but wif care and think the mirror can still be wat it was before. However, they have not come up wif a way to recycle the silver that's in it.
