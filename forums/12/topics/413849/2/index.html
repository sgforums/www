              <p>I must most definitly agree with your last statement. *I would however like to know. if you would grant me the honour of your time, how to actually turn it into a satirical piece"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyhow, i don't have parents to burden but i would like to lead a life of which my parents can be proud of. However this is by no means a way to slack of and become a bum or as you say failure.</p>
              <p>PS. I disagree that parents fear their children being failures for that very simple reason.</p>
              <p>There are billions of people of this planet and many of them are bound to jobs or certain contracts that they are not happy fulfilling; many of them insinuated by their parents mind you. In my opinion one should break free of those bonds and do something that they love and be successful at it. If one loves his desk job and in so makes his parents happy, more power to you! However is one slogs at a job he is purely mediocre at but is capable of so much more in another field i believe he should pursue that field no matter how hard the journey because of his love and passion for it.</p>
              <p>Yes there are situiations that many that are in that require them to be bound to their jobs as such but there will be a chance to break free from those bonds....opportunities are many in this world and there is no age limit to success. Yes im an optimist.</p>
              <p>Some may say that not everyone has the capacity for it but i believe that hard work can surpass genius.</p>
              <p>About your statement regarding confidence, I completely and utterly agree with you. However at any point in ones life there SHOULD be something to be confident about. Perhaps I am spoiled and thats why I cannot see past this point but i think in order to gain confidence is to pursue whatever you are doing to the best of your capabilities. In life getting to know people is extremely important hence my little portion about confidence and networking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, in regards to getting laid.</p>
              <p>Yes i have been played before, it hurts like hell.</p>
              <p>"<span>“There's a sucker born every minute”</span>" - P.T Barnum</p>

              <p>I must most definitly agree with your last statement. *I would
              however like to know. if you would grant me the honour of your
              time, how to actually turn it into a satirical piece"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyhow, i don't have parents to burden but i would like to lead
              a life of which my parents can be proud of. However this is by no
              means a way to slack of and become a bum or as you say failure.</p>
              <p>PS. I disagree that parents fear their children being failures
              for that very simple reason.</p>
              <p>There are billions of people of this planet and many of them are
              bound to jobs or certain contracts that they are not happy
              fulfilling; many of them insinuated by their parents mind you. In
              my opinion one should break free of those bonds and do something
              that they love and be successful at it. If one loves his desk job
              and in so makes his parents happy, more power to you! However is
              one slogs at a job he is purely mediocre at but is capable of so
              much more in another field i believe he should pursue that field no
              matter how hard the journey because of his love and passion for
              it.</p>
              <p>Yes there are situiations that many that are in that require
              them to be bound to their jobs as such but there will be a chance
              to break free from those bonds....opportunities are many in this
              world and there is no age limit to success. Yes im an optimist.</p>
              <p>Some may say that not everyone has the capacity for it but i
              believe that hard work can surpass genius.</p>
              <p>About your statement regarding confidence, I completely and
              utterly agree with you. However at any point in ones life there
              SHOULD be something to be confident about. Perhaps I am spoiled and
              thats why I cannot see past this point but i think in order to gain
              confidence is to pursue whatever you are doing to the best of your
              capabilities. In life getting to know people is extremely important
              hence my little portion about confidence and networking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, in regards to getting laid.</p>
              <p>Yes i have been played before, it hurts like hell.</p>
              <p>"<span>“There's a sucker born every minute”</span>" - P.T
              Barnum</p>
              <p>Who is to say whether they are male of female. True that females
              do mature faster than males but i would dare say there are as many
              suckers on both sides. There are women who are really good at
              getting what they want and there are men who are equally as good.
              So what happens to those in between? Therein lies the question.</p>
              <p>My post about that was more targetting the people that regard
              picking up women as if it was rocket science. *Note: That was in
              regards to the people that pay Thousands of dollars to learn how to
              pick up girls.</p>

              <p>I am a person who will gladly eat humble pie if it requires and is fitting. However let me point out the points your "insight" completely failed. I can see you did not take the time to read through my passage properly or it is just that you are a narcissist yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, I literally meant i have no parents. Im an orphan. I did mention however mention that i would like to do them proud. I am studying and currently trying my best because this is what i want for myself.</p>
              <p>Your perception on the "fear" part was a complete miss. I am very well aware of the path that i have chosen to take and in that the consequences of my actions. I however know that it is possible to have the best of both worlds in regards to family as well as freedom.</p>

Losing your path aye ?" - Not true at all and to take that the points i am talking about reflect the inner me was extremely naive of you. My path is going to be an arduos journey. Also, who are you to say that self belief is wrong or bad? If one cannot be first confident with oneself in one form or another, what else is there? It may be true you are an extremely brilliant man however not many people have achieved the statement of confidence you mentioned above.</p>
              <p>It is true that being content is easy but as i said, if you you wish to lead a certain way, why settle for anything less. The ability is within yourself and no one can tell you that it is not. Through hard work and dedication, it is definitly possible.</p>

                                              still choose to ignore ?" - My dear Jojo, i don't know the kind of people you have met within your lifetime but you do reflect the typical person who has not traveled the world and experienced many other cultures and people of different social statures. I do not pretend to be all that but i have met my fair share of "cunts" in the world and guess what? Some are rich beyond words, some of them born into it and people suck up to them day and night. Im sorry sir but your point is not valid. Pride does come before a fall but many people can and have picked themselves back up only to continue their ways.Sometimes the experience doesn't humble a person.</p>

              <p>I do live in my own little world and so do you. Perhaps one day i may come to accept some or even many of your points when i have lived as many years as you have.

Your "all seeing eye" wasn't close but did hit a point or two.</p>
              <p>I think perhaps it is you that fears the wind of change, a person that cannot live in "your own little world". That person is me :)</p>
              <p>I think you are a smart person but just extremely narrow minded. Im willing to accept your points and debate them without taking cheap shots at you but i see that it has become part of your nature to insult anything or anyone that does not agree with you.</p>
              <p>Herein lies the question, why contradict yourself on so many occasions? Think about it, you're not dumb but not as smart and learned as you make yourself out to be :)</p>

              <p>You are a full blown HYPOCRITE, yes you are boy.</p>
              <p>Here you were ranting, and all along forumers here thought you are a spoiled little brat rebelling against your own parents.</p>
              <p>Shame on your little trick or treat.</p>
              <p>Me taking cheap shots indeed, FYI you're the one playing all the cheap tricks here.</p>
              <p>Pretending to be what you are not, and telling others what they should be living like when you never lived in our shoes before.</p>
              <p>What exactly are you looking for in Aunt Agony ? Some cheap thrills to lighten up your boring life in the orphanage ?</p>
              <p>Get a life dude. No need to suffer like a fool.</p>

              <p>TS very funny, post a long thread (I did not read), others reply, TS gonna argue with others and then goes on and on and on.</p>

              <p><br>LOL, after you pointed this out, I notice it's true!</p>
              <p>The even funnier thing is, TS posts wall of text, forumers feedback, some negative but some are quite accurate in their assessments about the wall of text, and the TS is not only arguing, but claiming that he's not of  the "norm". This claim is extremely funny because it's exactly when you go to a mental hospital and this retarded guy claims, "I am different from everyone else, you all are retarded, I am the only sane person in this whole world". See the irony?</p>
              <p>And if the topic is about Life for Dummies, which I think patience and peace should be virtues of life, then the actions of the TS is extremely contradictory.</p>
              <p>You do not win respect by winning others in arguments. You win respect by setting an example so good that everyone wants to be you naturally.</p>
