              <p>Wrote this on the bus while watching the world go by</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style='font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: "Courier New";'>Is it that a person like me is
                  truly bohemian by nature or is it that I lack the set of skills to create bonds
                  with anyone?<br> To be honest I just find the boring mundane day to day life extremely boring.
                  My perpetual need for human contact and excitement is simply to keep me
                  moderately sane. I do enjoy some extremities such as drugs but for now, that is
                  nothing but a closed chapter in my book. <br> The main issue you might ask is why do I behave is such a narcissistic way?<br> To give you an honest answer it is to find a simple yet happy life by no means
                  subjecting myself to the completely orthodox way of living. I mean to be honest
                  why not be happy and do what you want for god sake. Live free and be the person
                  you were born to be. There is of course no justifiable reason for hurting
                  others along your way and/or not repaying gratitude unless of course you happen
                  to be a complete and utter douche.<br> One might question if this is still applicable if let's say my parents want me
                  to grow up and be a doctor and I'm supposed to study my ass off have no social
                  life forever so I don’t hurt them. O please are you really going to buy into
                  that self sacrificial bullshit? I mean really now, what your parents want is to
                  make you the best that you can be in order to enjoy a good successful and HAPPY
                  future. So if at the end of the day you have lived a full, virtuous life and
                  happy life I truly don't see what is the fucking problem?<br> Fine let's go to say you are into that self sacrificial bullshit and study hard
                  blah blah try your best to get that fancy piece of paper to hang on your wall
                  while giving up your youth and everything fun.<span>  </span>At the end of the day ending up as a "enter race here" scrooge
                  mcduck with loads of cash and lots of cash to spend on your three spoiled
                  nephews and son.<br> Recognize that money only opens up doorways and yes many that may grant you
                  temporal happiness while true happiness is nowhere to be found.<br> <span> </span><br> True happiness in my opinion lies within oneself and exploring ones soul. Money
                  helps, so make a fucking fortune by learning to be smart and streetwise like
                  bill gates or something! There are loads of ways to actually fulfil your
                  desires as well as earn a decent living that enables you to pursue your hobbies
                  as well as fulfil your life.<br> <span> </span><br> Honestly most vices are and will be detrimental to your health.<br> Let's touch on smoking first. So why so you smoke? Peer pressure? Not enough
                  manhood to say no?<br> All this can be simply summarized into one word: weakness. It may have been
                  your ex-girlfriend that smoked like a chimney or the group of young smoketards
                  you were in as a youth and inadvertently got hooked.<br> What does it do to you? Help you unwind, makes you feel good or looks well with
                  your jacket. Admittedly smoking is one if the more forgivable vices aside from
                  alcohol but we will touch on that a little later. It does give you a sense of
                  relief but at the cost and blackened lungs and a chronic breathing problem in
                  the near completely unforeseeable future. It's all essentially about cost and
                  consequence as well as control.<br> Now moving on to the most drank thing besides water, alcohol.<br> Alcohol is essentially vice and temporal buffing in your confidence,
                  foolhardiness and your ability to see slamming any chick raw dog as cool. It is
                  however known as liquid courage and the ability to drink will help you along
                  somewhere down the road where you will be required to drink. Let's not forget
                  to always drink while well aware of your limit so as to avoid passing out,
                  puking all over yourself and have your idiot frat-boy friend’s stick a beer
                  tube up your ass and posting pictures of it on Facebook. Drinking loads may
                  seem to impress girls for the moment but the true opportunity lies in being the
                  only sober idiot there to send them home and possibly get some nice pussy. You
                  can do both and train consistently, no short cuts you pussy.<br> Talking about shortcuts, drugs on the other hand have another name which is cut
                  short. The cutting short of your sanity and temporarily lobotomizing you
                  leaving you completely vulnerable to your own mind and imagination which can be
                  quite scary you sick bondage fetish bastard. It is a awesome social experience
                  where there can be lots of sex and happiness but it is as temporal as your
                  premature ejaculation. The fact of the matter is you slept with the slut that
                  your dad banged and now have his herpes as well of the rest of your life
                  problems awaiting you in re land of the sober. Of course I have tried drugs
                  before and refrained from such stupid activity and merely explored the infinite
                  possibility of my mind which was enough enjoyment. Now understand that whoever
                  says they are addicted to drugs and can't quit is a complete and utter liar. It's
                  a mental thing and if you can't get over that then how are you supposed to get
                  over your penis being huge, o wait...is not!! Well unless you tried physically
                  addictive drugs like crack which was stupid to continuously do in the first
                  place. Use your head for once and not the one that goes into your girlfriend’s
                  mouth.<br> <span> </span><br> The thin line between confidence and being a complete fuckwit is actually
                  extremely thin. Being the former you will be easily liked and fuckable while
                  being the latter you will be even more fuckable just that every other person
                  hates you and is spreading rumors you have a small penis. How can I be
                  confident you may ask? Simple, walk and talk as if you know exactly what you’re
                  saying, for god’s sake do a little research before spouting off like Japanese
                  av actresses squirting vagina, and if there is any time you can elaborate on a
                  point you are interested in or know a lot about in an inoffensive manner
                  without boring the people around you. Watch the body language of the people
                  around you as well as Thor tone of voice. Of all, the most important thing to
                  do is to analyze the person you are talking by focusing on his most interesting
                  topic, himself. Even if you don't give a shot about his pet puppy that died
                  getting raped by your neighbours pit bull. It's always good to listen as
                  knowledge is power and re power of knowledge is unfathomable. The use of such
                  information can aid you in your social climb or your own growth as a person or
                  lastly ammunition to destroy the bastard if he ever becomes a fag.<br> Being a fuckwit is even easier, do the first portion of the above but focus on
                  no one else but yourself only giving the poor bloke a chance to talk once your
                  done and cracked a few jokes on where he gets his hair cut. Here you are sure
                  to attract attention as well as the weak who will follow you as pathetic little
                  boot licking minions. However everything in moderation and you will be sure to
                  succeed in either.<br> <span> </span><br> With confidence and/or arrogance you will come across people in whatever scene,
                  group or stereotype you belong to whether it's the emo fags, shuffle sluts
                  hiphop bitches, schooltards or enthusiasts of multiple sorts. Within these
                  people you are darned sure to come across a girl you like or want to bang.<br> Although girls don't want to admit it, the plain fact is they like tossers, the
                  kind guy always gets the back fucking seat unless he's a tosser. Being a tosser
                  towards a girl is simple. Be detached from whatever you are doing, remain calm
                  at all times, never show too much of your inner self and pay enough attention
                  to her as you would your pet dog who you don't really care about. During this
                  time it would be wise to so your research on her character, not fucking stalk
                  her Facebook....well not just at least, and formulate a plan of action in that
                  noggin of yours. No the flowers and telling her how pretty she looks doesn't
                  work anymore as...she most likely already fucking knows you retard. Simply ask
                  her out casually and multiple times till it's a yes, permanent no or she files
                  a restraining order. Being established as the alpha male in the group is also
                  an important step as well as being permanently representable and groomed. Yes
                  inner beauty is important but god it's important to at least be aesthetically
                  pleasing. Who the hell wants to go out with a retard that looks and smells like
                  dog shit. Seriously.<br> Don't forget that I'd you're in this for the wham bam thank you mam then stick
                  to the first portion above and have sweet tongue, smart assed lines with a dash
                  of confidence play your cards right and ahaaaahhhhh.<br> Of course the alternative of picking these cheap sluts from the clubs would be
                  drastically easier unless you are a complete retard with 0 social skills and an
                  iq around room temperature.<br> Studying a tad bit of pick up artistry will most likely help but all you
                  actually need are the basics in which lies confidence.<span>  </span></span></p>

                  and offer to take her home etc. Good drink training may be required. The alpha
                  male theory applies here as well if you get good enough; no girl is really out
                  of your reach.<br> Alright I'm no expert but to hell with it, rinse and repeat till you strike.
                  Out of so many women in the club if you can't score even one you must be quite

              <p>My dear sir,</p>
              <p>Going on the basis of your initial post which was filled with sarcasm and no clear sign that you actually understood anything, i was simply stating facts, not resorting to childish modifications of the passage :)</p>
              <p><br>Also, i do respect other peoples opinions, however what makes you so credible?</p>
              <p>All you say is that you know better. The fact is many people have much more experience in life than i do, i'll admit, but i don't agree that life has to be as arduos as you say.</p>
              <p>I am a person that believes that life can be simple and happy according to the way you live it. We as singaporeans are spoilt and complain about many things, when there aren't actually that many to complain about.</p>
              <p><br>Tell me my good sir, which part of what i wrote is a fantasy?</p>
              <p>And how can using the wrong words make your statement subjective? Your logic is flawed</p>
              <p>P.S this passage was supposed to be satire and taken with a pinch of salt</p>
