What happened was this.<br><br>There was one day i noticed something was amiss with this friend of mine, so  I went up to ask him what was wrong. His reply was that he was ignoring me because he thought that I was angry with him. But I was not angry with him, nor did he offended me. He told me since I was not angry, than it is ok.<br><br>So I wanted to know what did I do to let him feel that I was angry with him with him but he did not want to tell me why. I pestered him for the reason but he did not want to tell me. But the problem was that his attitude towards me did not change. This is very frustrating to me. I tried to reconcile with him telling him that if there was anything that I have done that haveoffended him, I was sorry.<br><br>I just felt that if there was a problem, it is better to talk face to face and thrash it out. What is the use of him running away from the problem and ignoring me? I tried talking to him or asking him out, he just waved away my good intentions. I just felt very hurt by his actions, and he does not even bother about how I feel. I just feel very frustrated.<br><br></div>
