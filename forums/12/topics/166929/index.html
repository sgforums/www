If she already warn you to keep away from her but you still continue to pester her like that, she actually has the right to call in the police on the charge of harrasment and stalking and you could be jailed for that or at least be warned by the police for first timer. And if you continue like this, you'll be charged in court and she can get a protection order against you.

Does she look so stunning that you must have her ? Or is she the one whom you can chat for hours with?<br><br>My advice be her friend first know her well before ever thinking of chasing her. Do not scare her away so fast, chasing a gal need time not rush work.  There are somethings which gals can hide very well from friends but once you are her bf, she will show the real bad side.<br><br>There is a trick I can teach you in order to impress her at the porm. Ask her friends if she likes flowers or which toy character. If she like flowers try to buy the biggest bunch you can afford. Or if she like snoppy for example buy the biggest you can find. The key point is bigger and better than others. winks I think you are smart enough to understand what I am saying.<br><br>Next thing I want to point out is that your mindset got to change a bit. Instead of targeting her alone, try to mix with her friends. Once you have gain the trust and respect of her friends chasing her will be much easier.<br><br>Chasing a gal porperly is an art only a few can master.</div>
