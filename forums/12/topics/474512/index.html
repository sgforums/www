Ok try to cut it short, there this girl i kinda admire and we went out last week to a movie. This girl is from my workplace but different agency and she is really "popular" thru her cuteness, lots of guys like her and keep teasing her, just to let you guys know i am not working there anymore. But lucky for me, we both went out on a date to watch a movie and that day was the best ever. We talked alot, never get bored, we even have physical contact by pushing each other and stuff, we laughed and share our secrets/stories. I even walked her home and before she left.. she said "thanks for the outing". Its our first date i guess so i dont expect any kisses or hugs haha. It was quite magical.<br><br><br><br>Then next day, the magic all gone. We exchange sms'es but its only one sentence coming out from her. I was deep in confusion. But the following day, the magic appeared again. She called me but i ended the call for about 5 mins after. We even exchange sms'es in a happy way. But the day after that, no more magic. I dont get it. <br><br><br><br>I noticed a slight disturbance in her when i said I wanna join back to the agency she working. She even messages me that "If i were you, I go find other job because you are 20 years old and above". The agency she working are all 20-30 years of age so what she said doesnt make sense which is obvious to me that she dont want me working there. And on the next day, she messages me "if god is willing, our friendship will strengthen"..."be precious of us being friends" ok obviously that im being friendzoned. But what's with all these signs? im really confused and slight hurt. What happen if i just join that agency, will she hate me? but did she actually like me or not?<br><br><br><br>btw i accept that we remains as friends but i have a feeling she is hiding something. Please tell me guys</blockquote></div>

              <p>She wants you to seek better opportunity elsewhere, she obviously thinks her agency has very limited potential for career growth.</p>
              <p>You should keep in contact with her.. don't forget to toot your own horns as you make achievements while climbing the career ladder.</p>
              <p>Given how popular she is, and she certainly knows it. She'll be looking for a man who can provide for her and be the man she can admire.</p>

              <p>now i see. Looks like now i have a choice....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because I will be back on studying this coming january. And that agency she working has flexible timing schedule. I can choose the day i work and it pays fairly good too. So once i picked that job, i can also focus on my studies. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks jojobeach for letting me know what is in her thoughts but i guess i have to forget this girl because this option of me getting this job is the only secure thing for me. ahhhh... this sucks so much</p>

              <p>she means giv it up and dun go kindling false hopes. that usually results in u unwittingly annoying her.</p>
              <p>let me put it this way will be easier for you to accept.</p>
              <p>if she likes you she will make sure u get the hint and if she thinks u dun she will try again dun need to go create opportunities </p>
