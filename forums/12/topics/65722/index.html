            <div class='col-md body'>I m entering da 2nd cycle in terms of age &amp; I m still a single. Sometimes I envy couples whenever I see them doin "couple" things while I'm not. But I dun feel anymore "lonlier" in general than I m now... Or rather I m happy being single despite all kinds of feelings dat came &amp; went along da wae.<br><br>Y monks &amp; nuns can remain single... from wat I noe (limited knowledge...) they r WILLING to forsake emotions &amp; such to embrace the teachings. Since they r willing to do so, they MUZ have gone thru alot of tinking B4 finally deciding...<br><br>As for ppl like us. As Shan Cai said, it depends on individuals... I've read articles &amp; books on human relations &amp; found dat males can "tolerate" lonliness more than females in general. Meaning females need love more than males.<br><br>I m NOT saying dat males r heartless or cold in general, juz dat they can be... cool &amp; clear in emotions (sorta...). I oso seen many females who r happy being single their lives. As said, it DEPENDS on individuals. Anywae, there is NO wae a human can live without love, lest dis person REALLY cold blooded. Famliy love, frenship love, love for hobbies, stuffs &amp; things they do... all these r considered love... (Here I go again...)<br><br>Juz my view... coz I myself CAN live without love of a "spouse" type or (GF if U wanna sae it simply) &amp; yet many of my males frens cannot...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

And she is not married and also never had a bf. In fact even on New Year and Christmas, she spends her time working in the office. I have never pressed her about her life since it may be offensive on my part.<br><br>But from my own personal experience,,, it is possible for me not to have a companion, but I would grow mad and evil.
