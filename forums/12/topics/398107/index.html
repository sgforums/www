              <p>Take the advice of a medical student and go seek some  help from a psychiatrist.  If you feel you don't need professional help, at the very least spend one day a week going out with a friend, so you can share your problems with him/her.</p>
              <p>Regarding your use of language, its pretty much a form of escapism.  In other words, you avoid saying what you really want to say by saying something shocking, or crack jokes. Hang around people you can trust and who will spend time listening to you.  That way you dont have to keep pretending or avoiding the issues that you need to talk about.</p>
              <p>As far as I know.  Its currently an employee's market out there.  The economy is slowly recovering and companies are trying to rehire staff to make up for all the belt tightening measures they implemented in the last 2 years. Go find some headhunters and let them do the work of hooking you up with a job.</p>

              <p>I survived two global recessions.</p>
              <p>First was 1986 when my parents lost their jobs and I had to go do illegal part time club as a child waiter.</p>
              <p>Another was 1998 when I had to take up downgraded jobs.</p>
              <p>You'll live. As long as you are not handicap and you have two hands and legs and a brain you can survive.</p>
              <p>Your Life Got No Meaning? Hah, I went thru a tumultous divorce. I was married for only mere 2.5 years when my wife left me for another idiot guy overseas.</p>
              <p>Grow up.</p>
              <p>Don't be a sissy. You're too man for that.</p>
