              <p>If he really love you, he will work and suffer for you no matter how hard it is. For suffering for one you love contain elements of happiness too. Happiness that you are able to suffer for the one you love and do thing for him.her.</p>
              <p>Choose A but, change A personality. Force him to work. I guess his weakness of not wanting to work is causing more unhapiness then not having money itself.</p>

              <p>I've known it for some time. People do not change, they only put on a front to impress or put off other people. Eventually the impression wears down or the said person wears out.</p>
              <p>Waiting for someone who is "right for you" is just another way of getting what you want. There is no such thing as "love"...it's a lot more base than people would like to believe.</p>

              <p>Now then you tell us your evil plan....nbcb........if you want to abandon B, and you know it's not right, then can you please don't come up here and try to pick our brains for to justify your own sins?</p>
              <p>Girls like you are the reason why alot of good guys were murdered.....yes, murdered by you.</p>
              <p>You should be lucky that B didn't had plans to abandon you like what you are planning to do to him. Yes he is pathetic, but I won't be surprised if A also plot to abandon you for a better girl C in the future.</p>
              <p>I want no part of your plot and neither do I wish to further comments on your post. I know LIFE will teach you a lesson and make you realise that you cannot survive in this world without morals.</p>

              <p>If he really love you, he will work and suffer for you no matter how hard it is. For suffering for one you love contain elements of happiness too. Happiness that you are able to suffer for the one you love and do thing for him.her.</p>
              <p>Choose A but, change A personality. Force him to work. I guess his weakness of not wanting to work is causing more unhapiness then not having money itself.</p>
              <p>If both parties are working hard to help the other party, i am sure even though both are suffering, both are happy.</p>
