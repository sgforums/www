              <p><br>10k is nothing to an elite, but a bomb to a worker who need to raise a family of 4.</p>
              <p>So different version ya. Well, you can alway loan from banks or loan sharks, take the condo as the mortage, no problem, even 100k they might also lend you, i use to borrow from them, taking my landed property in joo chiat as mortage, then later, i return all back.</p>
