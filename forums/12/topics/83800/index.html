            <div class='col-md body'>Scape_Goat_Token, there is nothing wrong with you. It is just part and parcel of growing up, something that everybody will need to overcome.<br><br>Tell you what, try switching to play some team based games and if you still cannot stand defeat, then it is best for you to stay away from those games. It is not going to do you any good if you are going to end up feeling pissed everytime you loses a game. Not good for you and even worse for those people who love you. Think they are going to feel so hurt if they have to keep seeing you feeling sad like this everytime.<br><br>I'm not asking you to quit those games completely, just get away from those games until you are mentally prepared to accept defeat if you lose. Before you even play the game, always do a small self-simulation by yourself by imagining that you have already lost a game. If you feel that the pissing feeling is coming back to you again, then you will know that it is still not the right time for you to play those game yet.<br><br>You will learn how to accept defeat....when you are so hungry to  play those game...eventually and you will probably have to force yourself to overcome that pissing feeling and learn to accept defeat...just for the sake of being able to play those game again.<br><br>Good Luck and be a better man~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
