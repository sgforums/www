            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lolsuck:</div><div class="quote_body">infact i have this problem for very long time,hope u guys here can advise me on what to do its kinda long..sorry!<br><br>i got a crush on my classmate 4years ago..at that time we arent in gd terms,just chat in icq and irc if she is online...<br>in sch i dun have the guts to approach her..<br>soon she did not come online often came online to d/l mp3s only,we got no chance to chat anymore.<br>after afew mths of not talking to her,i pluck up my courage to ask her for her fone number,that was the 1st time i asked a ger for her number,i was quite a shy person in sch at that time..and she was in my class for the 1st year..<br>But the sad thing is that i still have no guts to call her.. i would sms chat with her and she will only reply me sometimes and i did sms her goodnight everynite..but ofcos no reply..<br>after 2years of not much talking..we suddenly bcome very gd frens in sec5,i was in NA so i studied till sec5.<br>she and her group of frens cant be together anymore,so i was by her side.. i introduce her into my group of friends..all male... all of them know i liked her they helped me alot..<br>but to no avail.<br>that year,i celebrated her bday with her by having bbq party at west coast park..i planned everything i almost gave her everything to let her enjoy.. paying all the expenses when we go out as shes not kinda rich and im slightly better as in still have 1-200 of allowance per mth..<br>so i shower her with gifts and sponser her handphone,clothes so on..<br>at that time we were just like couples,calling each other when we woke up,talk everynight..study together.despite my mum cooking everyday lunch and dinner,i still meet her out to eat with her,bcos if i dont she will just skip her meals.<br>just days b4 xmas i decided to try again by asking her to be my gf,but again i was rejected... it was my forth time,i asked thru sms 3 times and irc 1 time,but all rejected..<br>The following day we meet up because her ex bf, my used to be good fren wanted to patch with her,ask me to help.. this gd fren of mine,knows that im interested in her when we were in sec3. he told me to leave the matter to him and he would help me,but in the end he sneak from behind and got her to patch without me knowning... i was disappointed but i forgave him.. now he wanted her to patch with him again,he wants me to help him quietly by not letting this ger know bcos he knows that me and this ger are close buddies...<br><br>:at the moment she kinda like a guy from her ex-cca group and always talk about this guy,shes kinda shy too interms of not able to approach the guy she likes..<br>when i know about it i often encourage her to approach him,creating chances for them to talk,gif her opinion and also console her when she know some bad news about thsi guy.<br>ofcos during all this talking,i felt hurt deep inside:<br><br>Anwyay i meet up with my buddy and b4 telling her about my frens plan and tell her i like her..but i did not ask her to be my gf,and she jsut said,"u wanted to meet me just to tell me that?" smiling away like its kinda ridiculas..<br>so after telling her i told her her ex-bf wanted me to help him get her back to him,and she was furious.. but did not blame me or anything..<br>things still goes well,we still talk on the fone from night to morning hog onto the fone for hours even watching a show on tv we would just hold the fone and stay quiet to watch the show.we would only talk during advertisments.<br>after that she went home.. 2dayhs later it was Xmas eve.. i had a small party at home with my frens and i invited her to my home with all tis frens of ours..<br>we had a enjoyable night...<br>the following day on xmas things arent the same anymore.. she started to ignore me,she asked me to gif her more room to breath..leave her alone..and stop all fone calls,sms... she never wanted to tell me why and i never got my answer..<br>i felt so hurt all this while.i wanted to call her to talk or meet to talk abt it,she just dont want to meet up.<br>i was so pissed off that i hate her!really hate her...i thought i treated her so nice.. waited her for so long..from single to attached to single again.. instead of appreciating me,she avoided me!<br><br>but one fine day,she ring me up and said she misunderstood her..she knows i dote my godsister alot and she called her to explain..insisting that we did not give her a chance to explain herself.. but it was no use i was still very pissed off that time..<br>until last oct,her bday i gave her an sms and we bcome kinda close again,i forgive her and forget about everything...we all start afresh..<br>now we are kinda gd frens again,just that we dun tok everynite or call each other when we got awake.<br>But ever since we bcome close again,i does quite afew sweet talks to her,which i usually dont do.<br>1)i would praise her like saying she have slim down,bcome much prettier..<br>2)I did not ask her to let me know when she reach home safely anymore.<br>3) i did not tell her that her skirts are tooshort and ask her to get a longer pair.<br>4) i did not try to ask her to slp early like wat i use to..<br><br>This vday.i have asked her out for a date,telling her just wana have a gathering with this very gd fren,as iknow shes under quite some stress.. i would like to help her relief some stress and try to enjoy as much as possible..as a fren,and she agreed.<br><br>i spend 1wk to plan everything and make sure she could haf a big suprise.. but after doing so much,spending so much $.. i asked myself..<br>=isit worth it?<br>=now she got a new crush too..why am i doing so much things for her?<br>=she doesnt seems to appreciate me more than just a fren..y did she reject me so many times... isit bcos im really bad in my looks? bcos she always fall for guys when she dun really or dun even know them.. and the relationship doesnt last longer than 1-2mths..<br>=Will it be bcos of how to behave in the past,like toking to each other like a couple and im always there when she needs me... so she thinks that,that is what she wans from a bf and she got it..so there is no need for us to get into a relationship?<br><br>Hope u guys would spend some time reading and teach me what to do, thanks.<br></div></blockquote>Gosh... Hmm...<br>To my opinion...<br>You're really the faithful guy around in this world..<br>If I am a girl right now, I would want to meet you man..<br><br>Heard of the song by Ricky Price?<br><br>Yes, it is Heaven Knows..<br><br>There's one portion that says:<br><br>My friend keep telling me, if you really love her, you gonna<br>set her free, and if she returns in kind, I 'll know she mine...<br><br>Let her go... if she still miss the days with you, she will come back to you..what you can do now is maybe.. be happy.. just like me<br>HEhe .. can see that you're the shy type too..<br>that's it take so long to get you started..<br><br>Love sparks or whatever.. I think is the days a guy touched a gal' heart.. it just can't be measure using the time factor.. you know..<br><br>Sure enough, you have a good female friend with you now..<br>My advise is the Ricky Price's song... who knows you might know someone better than her.. and you can turn to your that female friend for advice.. hehe... Do some sports, know more ppl, and concentrate on your studies..<br><br>I almost also fall into this kind of trap.. I think I had made up my mind and do what i want to do in life and not everything because of this gal.. etc..<br><br>Happy is the Keyword, my dear.<br><br>Hope I can enlighten you in one way or the other coz I am the one who is just like you...<br><br>he he<br><br>Thank you for your opinion for This good good GAL and its just ME<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
