            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sorry to those who had already read my thread &amp; even commented in another forum before. I had decided to "shift house" here. So here goes my story again:</strong><br><br>Hi, I am a female, just hit 30<br><br>Just gotten myself out of a bad marriage which broke off bitterly. I was in the relationship for 7 years.<br><br>He was my first true love.<br><br>I had not much dating experience and I have never cheated on my partner during the whole course of our relationship together. In fact, whilst still together with him, I was so tame that I shut off any possibilities of friends with the opposite sex.<br><br>I am now single.<br><br>As it is, I should be single and AVAILABLE.<br><br>But the thing is, dating scares the hell out of me. I have been conditioned not to respond too well to the opposite sex.<br><br>For one, I'm aloof. And I am absolutely averse to cheesy pick-up lines. What would I do? Just simply don't respond, that's all. A sure kill joy. I rarely pub/club (only a few pathetic times up to date). I dun drink &amp; nor do I smoke. I've talked to some guys online. And for your info, I dun cyber (u know wat I mean), seldom meet up and absolutely do not go for flings and ons.<br><br><blockquote>Once, I did meet up with someone online. I had thought he sounded like someone quite chivalrous cos he was telling me that he was helping out with his ex-girlfriend with her marriage. I thought that was rather generous of him.<br><br>But once met up, he told me that all ppl have needs (which was a fact and I accepted it graciously by not arguing). Then he went on to rattle the next few hours about Singapore's politics to me (which was boring but otherwise fine as I can listen objectively). He wasn't touchy and he told me from the way I converse with him over the net, he realized he ought to act proper for our first meet-up, so he didn't drove his car along (as in there were many scares in the news about male strangers driving off the females to some place isolated). That was brilliant. I appreciated it.<br><br>Then later that night after an amicable part off, he sms me to ask me if I had slept. I replied no. Then he sms me about him "needing". And NEEDless to say, I was absolutely turned off.<br><br>Well, I've isolated that as a single episode. Hence, few days later when he sms me again, I replied his greetings. He asked me if it would be okay to meet up again &amp; I replied sure, why not? To go out as friends and chat. But then, he sms again that probably "we could go further". So I replied again saying I think rather simple. Having company for dinners is fine. But he pressed on saying there "could be more".<br><br>I have not replied him since and his last sms to me was asking if I was out dating or not, which for unknown reasons, turned me off totally.</blockquote>I know that my above narration is rather long but I hope to let you all in as to have a better insight to my problem. I am not the most gorgeous woman on earth but I know I would look more than presentable if I'd bother to dress up. The thing is, I cannot stand having males to sms me "funny" things, that is why I hadn't give out my number to just any guy. I wonder if I had been feeling depress cos I don't feel like going out to socialize at all and dread &amp; fear the prospect of dating. I don't like the tension of talking to an unknown guy and my mind radar immediately "sense" whether the guy is trying to undress me mentally in his mind instinctively. I absolutely hate that.<br><br>Am I abnormal? Wat should I do?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think ur divorce is meddling with ur ability to allow u to get on with your social life. But nonetheless, that guy u say in ur narration is really an idiot. He is nothing more than a sex fiend. Its obvious he is thinking thru his pants, and hence u should not continue being friends with him anymore.<br><br>I would suggest that maybe u try dating agencies? Because they usually pair u with people of the same interests as u. So more likely, u will meet a guy who is the person u like. And dating agencies usually don't introduce guys like the above. If they do, at least u can complain to the dating agency about the guy they introduce to u. I am not saying that people u meet on-line are not reliable, but u never know the true intentions of someone hiding behind the screen.</div>
