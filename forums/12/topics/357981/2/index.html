              <p>Serene,</p>
              <p>Why do you need permission to leave him ?</p>
              <p>Obviously the relationship is not working out for the both of you. It doesn't matter if he is having an affair or not.</p>
              <p>Are you trying to convince yourself that he wouldn't treat you this way , if he is not having an affair ?</p>
              <p>Trust me, not all guys will treat their gf bad when they are eating side dishes else where. At least the smart ones don't.</p>
              <p>You must be thinking.. well if he doesn't love me, he'd have broken up with me , yes ?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, he's the one who is treating you bad and you're the one taking his craps. So, why should he leave you ?</p>
              <p>Try treating him like dirt.. he'll be the first one to run out the door. Don't believe me ? Try it.</p>
              <p>Why ofcors it's all your fault. If you leave him.. it's your fault.. if he leaves you.. it's also your fault. So who cares who initiated it. Its YOUR fault anyway.</p>

              <p>Anger surfaces in him. Why?</p>
              <p>Internalization. He is concerned only about himself. He is thinking inwardly. This causes mental discomfort, and the slightest disorder (according to him) causes an outburst.</p>
              <p>The key is he is only concerned about himself. Selfishness has got into him. He wants something, and he is not getting it or its not readily available. Something or someone is in the way.</p>
              <p>Who, what?</p>
              <p>You, that girl, his boss, loan shark, his ex, his father, his bf, who knows.</p>
