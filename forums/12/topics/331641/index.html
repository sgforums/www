              <p>I'm have wasted a day stressing myself till now!<br>Just wanna vent my emotions for a while...</p>
              <p>I'm stressed over Graphite 08, Project work and problems with my current project team..</p>
              <p>I'm supposed to finish texturing + some concept art for characters and environment by 25th. I didn't finish my concept art btw. I intend to give up my studio projects stuffs to get some time to breathe and give time for Graphite...</p>
              <p>Wthwth? And then there's this prototype we need to do... <br>I'm very bothered about it because lecturer reminded us this is the last chance for us to finish up our prototype. Our group got a D+ for the last crit. It's the worst grade among other groups. ... Lecturer even get us down to sch during holidays to get us started off with the prototype... but we didn't play test =.= . AH!</p>
              <p>I think wat I wrote is so confusing.... oh well.</p>
              <p>I kind overload myself with extra responsibilities... <br>I'm currently the main artist in the team... now I'm trying to learn how to manage the team, solve the problem etc... and I'm trying really hard to be a game designer and come up with idea on how to make a paper prototype out of a 3D game. Omg it's hard but... nobody seems to be taking up the responsibility for the prototype~~~! .</p>
              <p>And there's this freeloader in the team. He practially spent his whole holiday overseas... He's supposed to complete his prop models by 18th and on the 16th, he told us he's going overseas!!! =.= . AH!</p>
              <p><br>Time is really running out! <br>What's wrong with my team members =.= .<br>Aren't they worried about their portfolio?!</p>
              <p>I don't understand! Doing so little will only leads u to a disadvantage...</p>
              <p>AH! =.=</p>
              <p>Okies I'm done. I hope I won't collaspe from high blood pressure... LOLX. <br>Alright feel better now. =.= tt's lame.</p>

              <p><br>If I'm not wrong, to make prototypes out of a 3D game.....you need to capture screenshots from all three axis, namely X, Y and Z axis, print it out and stick onto your props?</p>
