FOrcing her or persuading her to tell will only lead to more problems for her and more unhappiness for her. So i suggest u sit back and wait for her to tell u on her will. Just be there and encourage her can le. Dun ask her to tell if she dun wan to.</div>

So, you are not gonna ask her anymore and you will let her settle it herself but in any case if she is prepared to tell you, just let her know you will be around.<br><br>You have to harden your heart a bit and ignore her crying for sometime.<br><br>Girls when they see no response of concern from guys to their crying will find other ways to seek attention from you. However, there's the stupid 1% girls who will commit suicide one. Just pray hard that your girl is not that 1 %.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Keep on making WILD GUESSES (e.g. - you trade sex for $$$?, you got raped?, you slept with so &amp; so?) on what's troubling her, say them one by one, slowly, &amp; observe her reactions, till you see tell-tale signs on whether you've hit the jackpot.<br><br>2. Cook up a story. Tell her that you know someone who had gone thru some bad experiences (story-telling time, the worse the better) before &amp; had since recovered &amp; that you find it okay &amp; took it very well...say it's normal as human beings do make mistakes...then slowly, tactfully ask her WHAT HAPPENED.<br><br>3. Tell her you FOUND OUT what happened already. See what she has to say &amp; carry on ACTING &amp; PROBING from there...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I've posted the 'story' before... If some of you could remember...(Greg, Dan, Dan's dad... can't remember what else did I use...)<br><br>Although till now she still didn't tell but it seems that my conclusions are most probaly right... But I just don't want to say it unless she herself tell it to me...<br><br>The 'story' is too tragic to make wild guesses... It might just remind her what had happen and drive her crazy...<br><br>I had left it to her to cool down and settle it herself... I do not know if this kind of thing happen to a girl how much time they will need to do that... but It's been more than 6 months...<br><br>I do not think she will be the 1% who will commit suicide because I told her this before... there are a lot of people now living and caring for you... if something happen to you... they might not be able to continue...<br><br>Sad to say but I really can't be sure that I will not view her differently after she tell me... that's why I can't tell her I will not view her differently regardless of what she has to say...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've a similar experience of a god bro. He's someone who's very eMo and he's actions and wat he says is the same as what is happening. And he kept saying the same bloody things until i was so fed up that i can't concentrate. And i just e-mail him saying:" U think u are helping me by nt telling me anything? If so, then y do u let me noe or show such signs in the first place? pls dun be so farking selfish and think that ur actions will do me good. I Have my own way and u have ur own way. Ur way of helping ppl is not mine. Since u had start giving hints, pls dun play such childish games with me." and then he opened up. But i suppose if u use such methods to a gal.. erm.. nt quite good la, but maybe some sentence can do.</div>

It's too harsh...<br>You see... what most probably happened was...<br>well... very close to <strong>looksee's</strong> examples...<br>So you see...<br>I do not think any girl would still have the mood to make use of the situration and play some mind games...<br><br>I'm not gonna dig her things out and try thinking of some revengeful methods... cause that will let the whole world know about it...<br>I just want her to tell so that I can at least give her comfort or something...</div>
