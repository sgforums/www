            <div class='col-md body'>hello.<br><br>after reading through about your current situation, i felt rather sad for you. maybe i won't understand how you are feeling right now but i guess i can at least give you some advices.<br><br>well,when your parents got rather stressed up,its definite that they will be having bad temper. maybe you are unable to do anything for them in order to relieve their stress. however,i guess that at least the only thing that you can do is to study and work hard so that they won't be worrying about you. at least,a burden off for them.<br><br>i know its hard to get yourself in mood to study but eventually you have to. at least score good results for your parents,at least make them happy and lighten their burdens off. i am sure they will be glad enough to know that you are able to  take care of yourself and you are in good hands even though you are on your own.<br><br>study and work hard.<br>lighten their burdens off.<br>i guess they will feel much better knowing that you are disciplined and doing what you are supposed to.<br><br>cheer up and be strong.<br>(=<br><br>hopefully i could at least help you with just this little bit.<br>take care.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Simplify, please take care of youself and your studies, this is the most basic that you can contribute at this given situation. Your O's are next year and this makes you 15, 16 years old rite? To some you may still be considered young, but to your family, in times of crisis, you are expected to be old enough to contribute.<br><br>WHen your parents are stressed up, and looses their temper, they are not feeling any more good than you do. Do not take it to heart that they do not love you anymore or so.<br><br>At such times, a united family is very important. Give your parents any support they might need. Even if they do not say anything, ask if you can do anything, even how small to help. THe worse case is to isolate yourself from your family during this time. Everyone, no matter how strong they seem, needs support.<br><br>Do take care!</div>
