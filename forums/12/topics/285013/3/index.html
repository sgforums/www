            <div class='col-md body'>To TS.<br><br>I know you are angry, but there are two issues here.<br><br>1) You are obviously very angry, and it is triggered by parents and grandparents. While you may claim that they are idiotic, have you ever asked yourself that you could have stand up against them politely and firmly of your own decision. perhaps you are angry because you are swallowing these issues.<br><br>You got to solve this emotional feelings first and learn to be patient and happy first.<br><br>2) Regarding the issue, Knowledge is useful, whether it is the knowledge you gained from your degree course or outside. Therefore, you cannot say that your degree course is useless. Its false statement. Your degree course is useful to some extent.<br><br>If you dun want to study your course because it is not what you what and you got another path in your mind already, then just quit university loh. University degree does have a certain security and advantage, but if you are <strong> continuous learner, smart; have strong character and have right attitude</strong>, you will still get high pay job or your business in the end, because companies just care about your performance and ability in the end.<br><br>THere are always professional companies who insist on recognised degrees and others who just say that as long as you got the relevant experience, that is all we need.</div>
