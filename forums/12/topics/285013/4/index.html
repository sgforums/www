Many people, especially poly graduates (including me), are struggling hard to get into uni but they couldn't but you, the lucky one, have the chance to pursue a degree so you should cherish this opportunity.<br><br>I understand the pressure from your grandparents and parents to get a degree. It's annoying when they 'force' you to do something against your desire. But as you are in your 2nd year already, there's no point to rebel. You could have done so before entering uni but now you're halfway there so don't give up. So might as well continue your studies and get the damn degree. It's better than nothing.<br><br>Instead of being angry with your grandparents, think about other things that concern your uni life. Do you meet many good people in uni? Well, I'm sure there's some good things abt sch. Just think about it.<br><br></div>

A degree is something good to have, something to fall back on, but whether you are successful or not, the piece of paper certainly isn't going to matter much. You can be really successful without the cert, and I know plenty of businessmen who can prove my point, but the cert is something for you if you happen to be in the non-successful portion. Don't tell me you'll 100% be successful lor, if yes then you better drop out. Anyway, if you're in IT or something and have the hunger to succeed, let me know, maybe we can work together. I always have projects coming in and need people to work with me on them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so you are a psycho major at nus?<br><br>Ya i agree psycho courses is a real waste of time. LOL. Do you think people actually need 3 years to complete a stupid degree just to understand people. I think if you want to understand people, just 1 year of studying will do. And what else, most people actually go on to study honours...Wow 4 years. Then they study master...<br><br>at least if you are taking an engineering or science course, you will feel the heat as you do not quite understand some of the topics.</div>
