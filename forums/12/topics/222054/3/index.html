            <div class='col-md body'>totally agree,i see your point. dating at a young age doesn't mean you can last for 7,8 years before stepping out and taking another step into marriage.<br>it's a waste of time and money pratically dating at such young age so why not use your youth for sports and recreational games and study hard.leave dating till adulthood.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It's just that if you unhappy in a relationship, then what's the point of being attached? Love is supposed to be happy and funny, both parties enjoying it at a mutual level.<br><br>The fact that you are young now means you can go explore a huge variety of girls now than just stay and fall in love immediately with one, just because she is pretty. The prettier a woman is, the more she can make you go crazy. Being single means you have the chance to see every girl and love singlehood ,yet enjoying the company of females around you.<br><br>At the same time, you can see which girl is good for you, perhaps even for marriage. Just because you are young doesn't mean you can afford to make mistakes with the opposite sex.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Somehow, I found this thread really funny.<br><br>Stop trying to act man. Pride and backbone? Somehow, when you typed that, you might have gotten back your pride, but you lose your maturity. Pride and backbone is something you possess, not something you SAY and it will come.<br><br>That said, I have to disagree with the thread starter.<br><br>Seeing your opinions, I think you're a pragmatic lover. "Pragmatic lovers will avoid infidelity to avoid adverse consequences, and carefully weigh the costs and rewards of a relationship".<br><br>Monetary problems, or age does not play a part. When you've found the person you really love, you will never look back.<br><br><strong>The valuble thing about relationship is the process, not the end result. </strong><br><br>Just as this quotation indicates - "Life is not about the amount of breaths you take, but the things that takes your breath away", I believe love is not about the end result. The process is much more important.<br><br>Though you can party with girls or guys, go clubbing, live a life without commitment, it will still eventually tire you. In the end, all you will need is someone to care for you, and someone to be there for you when you need him or her.<br><br><strong>Some people believe in the RIGHT feeling, while others believe in the RIGHT timing.</strong><br><br>But ultimately, they all want to settle down and have someone to spend their days together, right? So why not start now?<br><br>All of that aside, I agree with doko that it's better to be single, than to be attached unhappily.<br><br>What is the point of being together when one party is unhappy?</div>
