            <div class='col-md body'>I think this topic got its bad point and good point la.<br><br>Personally, i've been into many r/s and been through many breakups.<br><br>R/S can be complicated and demanding. It needs alot of understand and effort to maintain it. Expect the unexpected at times. Learn to move on. Experience gain will be necessary in future r/s. Dont because of a few breakup then come to a conculsion that single is good.<br><br>After my breakup last time (now im attach), i have all the time in the world to do anything i want. After some time, you just need someone who is there for you and you just wanna feel love again. The feeling that normal friends cant give and im not talking about sex.<br><br>If you feel that you want to fall in love, then i say, go ahead. Dont hold back and think about your sad past. Move on and go on. Love is everywhere and if it comes to you, your heart will know.<br><br>Before NS or After NS, it doesnt matter. If $ is an issue in an r/s, i suppose it can be work out. For my r/s, me n my gf never draw line between your money or mine. She is very thoughtful and she sometimes will pay for my meals. So, look for a nice girl and not those that want to suck your money like a leech.<br><br>Theres pros and cons in everything . Single is good and getting attach can also be good. I think must see how you handle the situation.<br></div>

You may plan well with the right timing and age but if the girl don't suit u, better to give up rather than hang to it. Don't think that when u are ready there will be a right gal waiting for u.

            <div class='col-md body'>What I think.<br><br>Being single or attached has its own pros and cons.<br>It takes 2 hands to clap, not one. No point lamenting on what the guy/girl should do to make each other or themselves happy.<br><br>If they love each other, all things come willingly and both would be happy. Howver, if it comes to a stage where one party is exploiting the other, its time for a reality check.<br><br>If all is good, the status quo is good. Leave it. As long as they are people, lets just wish all these happy couples happy and lasting relationships.<br><br>JMHO.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You should know that theres no 100% there a r/s will work out. At least give your best and if in the end breakup, at least you've tried your best.<br><br>About other guys behaviours, i think its their problem. For us we feel digusted but we cant do anything about it right? In the end , they are just giving a bad impression to the girls.<br><br>Dont be bothered so much about them la. Just take it as a joke lor.</div>
