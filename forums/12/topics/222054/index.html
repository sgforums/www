More like, guys want a girlfriend for a wife. They believe it is the key to happiness. Some might want to get attached to show off their prize. Both genders do. Girls want to show off their handsome hunk to their girlfriends. The guys want to show off their prize or be proud of possessing it. Some might want to get attached because they deluded themselves that the girl is the one after knowing her for a short while only. But do they know the girl at all? Does she have a track record of dumping guys or going after rich guys? Is wanting a girlfriend really the solution to be happy?<br><br>The thing is, people will still be essentially the same with the relationship, if not, more insecure, especially if they can't keep their woman in love with them. Some people just will not stand loneliness. Or they rather be unhappy while still together with a woman.<br><br>Have you ever noticed why is it that in this forum, it is usually the guy with the problems with their relationships? Occasionally, some girls will complain, but usually it is the girl losing feelings for the guy, which still boils down to the guy being the victim?<br><br>The problem is a lot of guys place too much importance for getting a girl to be happy. Im not saying that getting a girl is wrong or you should start being gay. But you should be happy with your life instead and live your own dreams, with the girl as someone who share your dreams, not make her your dream or your master.<br><br>Then you see your friend who is attached. Outside, he is laughing like mad. Inside? Maybe he is worrying here and there. Or unhappy there is a guy trying to bang his girl? Sometimes, there will be up and down.<br><br>Like what  said, guys should find the right woman for them, except that I don't agree that when you are rich, you can spend anything on her. You are simply spoiling her! The modern relationship is supposed to be 50-50. Women don't exploit men. Men don't do it either. But in reality, it will be different. We try not to take advantage of the opposite sex.<br><br>That's my view.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>l will like to highlite abt sum tinz that doko say ...and l feel that is quite true..<br><br>Quoted by doko<br>The problem is a lot of guys place too much importance for getting a girl to be happy. Im not saying that getting a girl is wrong or you should start being gay. But you should be happy with your life instead and live your own dreams, with the girl as someone who share your dreams, not make her your dream or your master.<br><br>Dun always tink of how to impress or make a gal happy..u oso must be happy oso mah..y dun the gal do the other way and make us happy ne?<br>Gals and guys are of the same rank!! l hav to emphasise on this..we hav the same VALUE!! dun becos she ur gf...and u love her to siao..always plz her, make her happy..this is a whimpy person...a whimpy guy will do all these..and l am not embarrassed to admit that l used to be one in my 2nd r.s... a gf is to show ur happiness and accmpy u to old..Not for u to keep pleasing her and making her happy..<br><br>As a guy...we must hav backbone and character!! And one thing nver emphasise a gal as 1st priority or treat her like if u dun hav her..u will die..there are more impt things in life...such as Career and Respecting our parents who bring us up...be filial to them...l will nver put a gal as 1st priority ...used to be one siao kia..who put great emphasis on my gf...But find it stupid la..<br><br></div>
