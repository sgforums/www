A total different from the rest relationships..... I used to be victimised... or end up being the upset and totally hurt one. Now with this new guy, I'm happy. Things are just day by day and we laughed together at the silliest things... With him, I did things that I used to dream about and I didn't even need to tell him. It just happened. Honeymoon period still... of course but it seem like ages we've been together for. My sister told me that I should take things as they come and not think so much but I am scared.... I am scared that all these happiness will juz come and go so quickly. I'm a little haunted by my old relationships of coz. Badly that I got scared. with him.. there wasn't a break. I just ended my relatonship with this other guy when my heart died and my current bf was just there for me. sigh... I also dunno why but I feel scared... everyday. Is it normal for me to think that it's ok to be happy and blissful? Are all relationships like this? Can someone share with me how you feel when you are in a normal relationship?

You are haunted because you fear such scenario would recreate themselves into your present Love - but have you learn those lessons, this fear wouldn't even brought forth into your relationship because understanding would have made you stronger and grown up.<br><br>And because you are so afraid, you will unconsciously behave in such a way that it REPEATS what has happen into the present and in turn, create a reiterated future. It is like you using the same key to make the same trigger - your behaviour is the key and the trigger is a self-fulfilling prophesy that comes true based on the SAME key you used in the past.<br><br>Those enigma that we hid in our subconscious, do not be afraid to tackle them head-on. These past issues must be handled properly and appeased the tension from within, so that you can enjoy the fruit of your relationship and NOT having to worries incessantly while leading a new relationship during its honeymoon period.<br><br>Apply what you thought you have learn from your previous relationship to avoid costly mistake. But at the same time, give yourself a break. Don't take everything too personal and serious that it hinders your progression in your relationship. Until when you hit something, just sit back and revel in the ride.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

I do not know and nobody knows.<br><br>It is OK to be scared but if you allow the fear to govern your life; it is possible that you will unconsciously self fulfill the prophecy. So always live life with positive thinking.<br><br>Conduct your relationship like it is going to last forever (except don't give your money to him.) Conduct your relationship like if it fails, another better one will come along... you see girl, you have no choice but to do it like this. This is the way life have dealt us the cards. Make the best of everything and always hope for the best and always expect the best.<br><br>Don't live your life in fear of disappointments... but live a life of competence and positive thinking. Competence is very importent.... positive thinking without competence is foolhardiness.</div>

Now here goes... Recently, I'm in a new relationship. A total different from the rest relationships..... I used to be victimised... or end up being the upset and totally hurt one. Now with this new guy, I'm happy. Things are just day by day and we laughed together at the silliest things... With him, I did things that I used to dream about and I didn't even need to tell him. It just happened. Honeymoon period still... of course but it seem like ages we've been together for. My sister told me that I should take things as they come and not think so much but I am scared.... I am scared that all these happiness will juz come and go so quickly. I'm a little haunted by my old relationships of coz. Badly that I got scared. with him.. there wasn't a break. I just ended my relatonship with this other guy when my heart died and my current bf was just there for me. sigh... I also dunno why but I feel scared... everyday. Is it normal for me to think that it's ok to be happy and blissful? Are all relationships like this? Can someone share with me how you feel when you are in a normal relationship? <span style="color: red;">Coz I really dunno what it is like to be in a normal one</span>.</div></blockquote>How are you going to know what's a normal relationship like? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You're confused.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>How can you define a relationship as normal?

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah you had some bad experiences and its haunting you ever since. But until when do you want to live your life full of "what if he's not the one?" Question is "what if he is the one?" It's normal of you to feel scared but its ultimately your choice to stop feeling scared or not. It's all in the mind and if you are mentally strong enough, you should overcome your fear and convert it to a valuable lesson learnt and move on with your life.</div>
