              <p>I met this girl i was interested in. So i asked her out, she agreed, she was 30 min late. We had a one hour conversation until she had to leave to pick up her sister somewhere. I pick up the tab $70.</p>
              <p>Then I ask her out again, she agreed, she was 30 min late again. We makan at some place, I pick up tab again - $60.</p>
              <p>Third time, hoping its a charmer, I ask her out for movies. At first I text her on wednesday to ask her if she is free on saturday. She answered me 5 hours later to tell me she get back to me on the same day. Check my Iphone on same day, no answer.</p>
              <p>Then on thursday, text her again to remind her about it, she never answered. Today friday, still no answer.</p>
              <p>Is she stalling me? Wonder if she is interested or not?</p>
              <p>I ask one friend for advice - he tell me to forget it maybe she has other guys in mind, and not to call her as that may be perceived stalker.</p>
              <p>Ask another friend for advice - he tell me to call her to pursue her. Make her feel good.</p>
              <p>So what is your take on this? Feel sad she hasn't replied after two days.</p>

              <p>She just replied me to tell me that she's doing some house cleaning. Could not reply me for two days because busy.</p>
              <p>Then she said she isn't free for this weekend.</p>
              <p>I somehow doubt her authenticity, she really took a long time to reply, that gives her a chance to think of what to make up "stories". But I wanna move on, I also met another girl whom I more interested. The other girl at least when we go out, we go dutch. Rare attribute in a singaporean girl.  </p>
              <p>So, I am wondering if she's really stalling me? She got other dates?</p>
              <p>You see, we met on a social dating place.</p>
              <p>Should I continue to pursue her?</p>

              <p>She isn't interested in you. Using you to pay for free meals.</p>
              <p>She is also dating other guys. U are not the only fish in the ocean. She haven't outright reject u yet, because u got on her spare tire list.</p>
              <p>If she can't find something better, she may call u up again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your other girl go Dutch because she is cautious. At least she is not a shameless user like the previous one. <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">But second date onwards u should offer to pay. Or at least send her home on your dime. </span></p>

              first gal? move on, she's not interested... humans are like this; if they like someone, they will check their phone like every few minutes to see if the person got text or call... 
              
              why i know? because i were where you are now... life experience; listen to those who been there, done that. 
              
              PS: before i marry my wife she check her phone minimum every 30 minutes. now, wait long long then reply... sigh...

              <p>Man I love this forum! Especially this section, Aunt Agony!</p>
              <p>Alright bro! I experienced what you just had. Your answer is "<strong>MOVE ON!"</strong></p>
              <p>Don't ask why. You farked up!. PERIOD. GG ADY! Btw, I don't text. I call.. </p>
              <p>Maybe you could share us the details what kind of convo you just had with her. There must be something wrong in the convo which turned her off. Then, there must be some room for the improvement for future references. You know.. noone is bound to be perfect scorer. </p>
              <p>Btw, you never reminded her about the date!!! If she is interested in you, no reminder is needed. She will answer you very fast. Btw, 30 mins late is alright. My ex used to tell me to be 2 hrs late because she needed to make up. You know... girls need to look good infront of you. </p>
              <p>But guys, you should never be late. It's a death penalty. Don't ask why. That's how the women play the game. </p>
              <p>Anyway, I know how you feel. So shitty. Just think of her a typical Biatch. You will move on. Tho think of a girl that way makes you a loser. Well... that's how I moved on.</p>
              <p>Peace! :)</p>
              <p>$70 and $60? lol.. thats part of investment. It's some sort of business. It's alright. Money can be made back. But, experience is priceless. Anyway, money is a big issue to you. I would suggest you not to date because girls cost you money and time. =/</p>
              <p>Your call... </p>

              <p>Won't work buddy. Leave her alone. </p>
              <p>I had an experience like you did. We had been texting for awhile due to long distance. As for the reason, I often don't make phone calls. We had done few video calls. Anyway, it was just all of sudden that she turned cold. She never texted me when I did not text her. I only got replies when I texted first. So, I moved on just like you (I'm not sure if you do). I just did not text her anymore. </p>
              <p>I got texts from her one day without texting her first. She was just asking my help. </p>
              <p>Technical stuff. I'm sorta geek you know. I can solve technical issues just asking me thru texting. Anyway, it's just friend. I did what I could do for a friend's favor. </p>
              <p>Problem was solved. I said to her, "you are welcome." She replied, "Lol, I have not said thank you." I said, "Lawl, that is cool." I also made a joke, "thank you for your time." She was so offended right after I said that.</p>
              <p>LOL.</p>
              <p>She then never texted me if I did not text first. Never asked how I was doing.</p>
              <p>It's cool. I move on. :)</p>

              <p><br>What return on investment?? We are specialist, an hour of consultation and being with a good looking girl like me is worthly of that $70 or pathetic $60, you go specialised doctor is more than that you know.</p>
              <p>TS should appreciate the time she spent with you, paid your fees, in fact, only half of it, you book a girl at my place for an hour is much more than that ok.</p>
