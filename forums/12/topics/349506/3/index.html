              <p>i will try to shorten the story. Sometime back met this wonderful guy and things were really looking bright. I love him deeply and he did too.11 feb we were still fine and as per normal but by 13feb he discarded our plans for valentines day (later realised he had to keep some1 else accompany as he could definately could not half himself).</p>
              <p>Valentine days he broke off with me, citing reason as he could not forget his ex who was with him for 10yr (she had repeatedly lied to him &amp; cheated on him) and asked me to give him time.</p>
              <p>we did remain in contact as friends  and he once told me (after we brokeup) he love me</p>
              <p>but today he sent me an sms saying he had already patched with his ex and they were going to get married.. The ex was the one he love.</p>
              <p>Turns out all the while he was lying and lying and lying....</p>

              <p>You are not the only one who went through this kind of betray and hurts.</p>
              <p>My ex BF is more worst.. he was assigned on an oversea project and need to be away for 1 yr. I thought it was ok. And we are still seeing each other on off when he fly back. But after 3 months.. he told me he busy can't fly back.. or even he back we meet for a cup of coffee... then he start to disappeare, no call no sms, no email.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Until he was caught by my bestfriend, he confessed he was back about more than 6 months patch with ex and planning to get marry. He never tell me he wanted to break up at all. And i was waiting for him to return to sg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't be sad you are not alone.. i was with that moron for 3yrs. Wasting my time. Haiz..</p>
              <p>There sure a nice guy out there waiting to take care of you.</p>
