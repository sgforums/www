              <p>i will try to shorten the story. Sometime back met this
              wonderful guy and things were really looking bright. I love him
              deeply and he did too.11 feb we were still fine and as per normal
              but by 13feb he discarded our plans for valentines day (later

              could not half himself).</p>
              <p>Valentine days he broke off with me, citing reason as he could
              not forget his ex who was with him for 10yr (she had repeatedly
              lied to him &amp; cheated on him) and asked me to give him
              time.</p>
              <p>we did remain in contact as friends  and he once told me
              (after we brokeup) he love me</p>
              <p>but today he sent me an sms saying he had already patched with
              his ex and they were going to get married.. The ex was the one he
              love.</p>
              <p>Turns out all the while he was lying and lying and lying....</p>
