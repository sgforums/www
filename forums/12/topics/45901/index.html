The fear to love is because of the fear to accept the risk a relationship contains. Being protective and drawn back is because this is what your mind does to defend itself psychologically.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Sorry but to say: there is no relationship without risk. All I can say is that - when the time for you to release yourself and try another shot - is the time you will fall in love again. Heart become cold, or you chose to put it in the freezer?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Someone to pour your hearts to? If you are talking about a partner, it will come when you open the iron gates to your heart. If you are talking about 'someone' as in anyone - you could private message me. I am always around, until further notice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Quote of the day: To love and win is the best - to love and lose is the next best thing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
