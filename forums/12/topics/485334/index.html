              <p>The world doesn't revolved around you. There's nothing wrong with society/people. You're so arrogant - you are sticking out like a sore thumb and expects everyone to like you. When people don't like you, you think that they are the problem..instead of looking at yourself at mirror. Remember - you are working in a social enviornment, you are not working alone. </p>
              <p>Obviously, a lot of people find your actions make them feel uncomfortable. It may not be wrong, but you're making them feel uncomfortable. I see it as being polite to be able to interact with people in ways that will make them feel comfortable, instead of alienating them making them follow my rules. </p>

              <p>You will look back and regret those $50s spent in each of those 12 mths wasted on nothing. You don't need to spend money to play games to pass time. Trust me, I've already regretted wasting money on hongkong TV shows, magazines, movies, DVDs when I was teenager (I had a craze about hongkong shows, like k-pop craze, which is why I didn't follow korean wave now. To add on, I also dislike korean pop music and korean food).</p>

              <p>Let me share something with you. I once told my friends that I wanted to get plastic sugery one day so that I can look more attractive and feel more confident.

              <p>Now, I know that people are going to say, "Oh, if he loves you he will love for who you are."

              <p>Too bad, girls are materialistic, guys are shallow. I'll stop complaining and make sure that I am a worthy partner. Those people who claims that SG girls are materialistic, STFU, because you're expecting too much.

              <p>And when they get rejected they claim that girls are materialistic, but they never once looked at themselves...<strong>they think they're entitled to a hot girl who will...."suffer" with them....</strong></p>
              <p>My TS, word of advice from a sixteen-year girl. <strong>You are not entitled to people's respect or acceptance.

              Yup, life is difficult and short so why further complicates it.  We just need some simple food to survive, a 3m by 1m area to rest and cultivation of our mind, other than these are only filling and reinforcing our greeds.
              
              Of course we can take advantage of the current technologies, but remember, always be the master of our tools not slave.

              <p>Yup, life is difficult and short so why further complicates it.
              We just need some simple food to survive, a 3m by 1m area to rest
              and cultivation of our mind, other than these are only filling and
              reinforcing our greeds.</p>
              <p>Of course we can take advantage of the current technologies, but
              remember, always be the master of our tools not slave.</p>

              <p>When you're retrenched, all your "good friends" colleagues will immediately treat you like invisible. I know because I was retrenched once in mid 2000s. "Good friends" colleagues whom I used to treat them to lunch, buy them gifts. They too also did gave me gifts lah. But I know why I was treated because they no longer need to curry-flavour me and all past curry-flavouring me all wasted as I was retrenched.</p>
              <p>I rather spend money on myself than on things to fit in now.</p>
