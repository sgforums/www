            <div class='col-md body'>About your CCA on the computer club. I can see your efforts that u have contributed in the past 3 years and aiming to join the committee member.<br><br>But unfotunately u are not selected to be one.<br><br>So u ask yourself 3 things<br><br>1. Have u ask or petitioned to your teachers or club facilitator about your interest in joining the committee member? If no get your butt up &amp; see them with immediate effect!!<br><br>2. How much can you contribute to the club when u are a committee member?<br><br>3. Have u ever thought of the responsibility of a committee member that has to go through, whenever there is challenges up ahead of them. So are u ready for the stress that is going to be pressed onto you? If u can't take stress i suggest u either stay as a normal member to slack &amp; learn or think thrice b4 u join in.<br><br>Lastly who says normal member can't contribute in terms of improvements &amp; suggestion. Committe members cannot survived without the opinion of junior members. And don't have the negative thinking that the committee member will take advantage of you juz because you have no status &amp; that u are in the same steam as them.<br><br>Did you know that committing suicide is a chargeable offence even though u are pronounced dead on the scene of your death.<br><br>Dun forget that u are 16 years old &amp; is liable to be charged under capital punishment.<br><br>I can tell u what are the process that is going to happen to you is that you will be handcuffed in your coffin &amp; your family would be wailing &amp; crying more horribly than the ghost in the 7th month period.<br><br>So do you want to see your family suffer in this fate &amp; having your name stained &amp; tarnished in this foreign country of yours juz because of depression that is pushing u to suicide?<br><br>Its not worth it &amp; u have no rights to take away your life juz like that!!<br><br>So for the better you pls live on &amp; face those challenges that is opposing you!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Only Heroes dun give up like that &amp; your parents would be very proud to have a hero like you if u choose the path to overcome challenges... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by SGEMP:<br><strong>Dear Aunt Agony and everyone<br><br>I am SGEMP, (Yuen Shek Ngai), a Hong Konger, a loyal member of sgForums, and a student, 16, from Damai Secondary School<br><br>I am very unhappy with what had happened for today 23 October.<br><br>Today before my Damai Secondary school assembly, at about 1230, as I rushed my way down to the hall that damn Jordan and his wicked ugly Malay gang of seven of 3E4 obstructed my way there, and knocked me to the pillar when I tried to overtake them.(In response I used middle finger to scold these goddamned bums.) Them, instead of condemning them, the teachers in the hall condemned me! I want them crushed dead by a Bishan-bound service 59 bus--------and their entire families wiped out by bird flu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They will all be knocked down into hell!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Then when the prize-giving ceremony came (1-something pm), I realised that prizes that could have been won freely free of charge i.e. the SKM were all won by the others! (If not remember wrong, I could only get my SKM badge after a purchase of $10 NANAS 2006 calender, which was yet to arrive when I had truly ordered for IT!)<br><br>I do not know why in recent years it is getting harder and harder for me to won in any prizes or competitions without much expense while others were easier without spending much of their fortunes? WHY? Why the Chinese gods are so fuckingly unfair, keeping on abandoning me when at the time I needed them most??????  WHY??????<br><br>I am very damn angry on this injustices on top and below!<br><br>Later in the computer club meeting(1415 pm), although I was satisfied with the CCA score I got (in LEAPS system), but I am very disappointed that others, not me (a secondary 3 express student about to be promoted to secondary 4 express the next year), were appointed by my CCA teacher for the position of Computer Club Committee members. They all went up effortlessly, only by their teachers' help! Such fucking unfairness and injustice!<br><br>In the past whole year I worked very hard, under my chemistry teacherÂ¡Â¯s advice,  in my Computer Club, attending the CCA regularly and participating, eventually completing, in everything as instructed by my teachers without fail, in hopes of getting enough points and a leadership role, that is, the committee member.<br><br>And what did I get in return? Everything is wasted. I was damn unfortunate. I was unfortunately not appointed into the committee. What a fucking waste!<br><br>And that extra CCA points all gone, I have no choice only but to suffer for the next whole year under them, without any extra points to lighten my damning fucking asshole load!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Finally back home, over a minor disaggreement of placement of skipping ropes (4-something pm) evolved a terrible arguement and meltdown between me and my mother, unfortunately. My mother suggested me to place the ropes in the shelf near to the computer I am using to issue THIS agony note, but I disagreed for cleaness reasons because in that shelf were my computer peripherals such as my thumbdrive, audio-speakers and so. And maybe because I did not heard her "OK", so in my angry fuckingly angry protest I shutthe door and boycotted today's skipping session. And so a flame war started until I reasoned "I could have either misunderstood you or didn't hear clearly what you had said just now."<br><br>And as the flame war goes on I have came up with my mind of go to the overhead bridge near my home and JUMP DOWN onto the PIE, let me die from the impact or the traffic. I WANTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE!<br><br>And so, I asked myself: Is all these caused by bad luck, bad fengshui, bad Wen Chang fate, or else? Is it all because I was too cheap? Is it that I am damn incapable of winning? Is it that I was being stripped of my potentials and chances especially to both leadership and winning prizes, awards? Or is it because I am of late-night born, snake and Taurus that I was only fated to win later in life as a late-formed supreme being? (I mean, Â´Ã³Ã†Ã·Ã�Ã­Â³Ã‰?)<br>And am I totally useless, shunned by Singapore society?<br><br>If all these were yes, and essentially if there were no improvements in the near future,  I had rather go and commit suicide rather than living a bitter, hopeless, fruitless life, since by now I believed that in life, I could not get what I desired for(I do not have even my desired friends, only to be with the undesirables daily!), and in death, I have no grievances.<br><br>I wanted to die by suicide as now I wanted to live but cannot and that now I wanted dead but also cannot!<br><br>And that if all these were yes, I would want to give up everything including the bus guides I had and my most hatred life, by committing suicide until I am dead, all my blood were leaked out of my body and no air comes into my body and my wholebody becomes senseless, numb!<br><br>Up till here, I feel that I wanted to commit suicide, because I felt that I am cheap, slow developing, very useless, very incapable, very inable, and very hopeless, not optimistic of my life. I don't think there would any more achievements for me in the near future while life is getting very bitter for me, being futile, fruitless, hopeless.<br><br>And so I believed that only by commiting suicide would I be able to get what I wanted.<br><br>Also I think it is better for me to go into fortune superstition because only this is good for my future.<br><br>(And so I would be out tomorrow 25 October afternoon in Kuan Yin Temple praying for my fortune and my future, and where necessary I would look for a roadside stall providing luck-telling for help. Even better I have considered of changing my name.)<br><br>[b]What do you think about my plan to consult fortune and commit suicide? And is there any way to help me out? I urgently needed help!<br>HELP IS NEEDED FROM EVERYONE!</strong><br><br><strong>And So I would appreciate if everyone here could help me out before it is all too late, by providing useful advices and suggestions for me to improve on, with the sincerely welcomed suggestions and advices sent to here, my Private Message, or my email account hongkongsheky@yahoo.com.sg</strong><br><br>Also I decided to go on strike, not doing anything, not even to post on this forum!<br><br>Thank you and I would like to hear from everyone soon.<br><br>Thank you for your invaluable help rendered to me in my miserable times.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br>ysn<br>Yuen Shek Ngai (SGEMP)<br>24 October 2005, Singapore Bedok North<br>[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I think you need a change of mindset more than a change of fortune.<br><br>P.S: Anything about fortune, you can PM Zacken99.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fm wat u wrote, U blame gods, people, society &amp; even yourself for not able to achieve wat u wan. Are u having expectations beyond your mind and body could take  - if yes, slow down for a while, 'rest' ur body &amp; mind. Since u are loyal member of sgForums, do visit the bar forums to loosen ur 'mental' nuts a bit <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>'Bad luck' is being in the wrong places, timing &amp; *events that is beyond our controlled. (No one to is to blame, just dun give up easily, *plan ur mission or projects, keep on trying and trying...)<br><br>Make failure your teacher, not your undertaker. Success would become meaningless without effort &amp; challenge. Failures make a success sweet! Of coz dun make repeated mistakes over &amp; over again, and do the same thing with the same *attidute and EXPECT different results.<br><br>Example: if u are a gamer, u play every games using cheat code or god mode, U kill all enemies &amp; proceed to higher level without sweat, begining u may feel good and entertained, but after many games for months and years... u will realised that games are meaningless without challenges.<br><br>Do find out if u are suffering from depression - it can leads to sucide!! The causes of depression can be many and can happen to ANY body. Over work, studies, exam &amp; parent pressures and so on. Find out more about depression on the net. Talk to the right people/parent, and seek help if necessary.<br><br>NOTE: be aware of ur moods (Negative -emotions) dun let them control u. Remember -anger or -worrying abt problems u encounter daily...<br><br>- 1 Does NOT solve the problems (Can u solve problems by being angry or worrisome <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> )<br>- 2 Blinds U from having a calm mind to think of solution and see 'situation' clearly<br>- 3 *It could make things worse (Wat happens if 2 Depressed and Angry person bump together = D + Anger)<br><br>DEPRESSION<br>2: a state of feeling sad : dejection (2) : a psychoneurotic or psychotic disorder marked esp. by sadness, inactivity, difficulty in thinking and concentration, a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping, feelings of dejection and hopelessness, and sometimes suicidal tendencies.<br><br>+ God help those who help themselves, u have to clear/solve ur negative emotions(Anger/Hatre) 1st  b4 any1 can help. In the end, itz ONLY up to u to decide, and have control of ur mind/mood, dun lose it. But if u do, I dun pity u, I pity ur parents and those who loved u. To me, it jus another mishaps I read daily on newspapers, it dun bother me after that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
