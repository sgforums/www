Them, instead of condemning them, the teachers in the hall condemned me! I want them crushed dead by a Bishan-bound service 59 bus--------and their entire families wiped out by bird flu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They will all be knocked down into hell!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Then when the prize-giving ceremony came (1-something pm), I realised that prizes that could have been won freely free of charge i.e. the SKM were all won by the others! (If not remember wrong, I could only get my SKM badge after a purchase of $10 NANAS 2006 calender, which was yet to arrive when I had truly ordered for IT!)<br><br>I do not know why in recent years it is getting harder and harder for me to won in any prizes or competitions without much expense while others were easier without spending much of their fortunes? WHY? Why the Chinese gods are so fuckingly unfair, keeping on abandoning me when at the time I needed them most??????  WHY??????<br><br>I am very damn angry on this injustices on top and below!<br><br>Later in the computer club meeting(1415 pm), although I was satisfied with the CCA score I got (in LEAPS system), but I am very disappointed that others, not me (a secondary 3 express student about to be promoted to secondary 4 express the next year), were appointed by my CCA teacher for the position of Computer Club Committee members. They all went up effortlessly, only by their teachers' help! Such fucking unfairness and injustice!<br><br>In the past whole year I worked very hard, under my chemistry teacherÂ¡Â¯s advice,  in my Computer Club, attending the CCA regularly and participating, eventually completing, in everything as instructed by my teachers without fail, in hopes of getting enough points and a leadership role, that is, the committee member.<br><br>And what did I get in return? Everything is wasted. I was damn unfortunate. I was unfortunately not appointed into the committee. What a fucking waste!<br><br>And that extra CCA points all gone, I have no choice only but to suffer for the next whole year under them, without any extra points to lighten my damning fucking asshole load!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Finally back home, over a minor disaggreement of placement of skipping ropes (4-something pm) evolved a terrible arguement and meltdown between me and my mother, unfortunately. My mother suggested me to place the ropes in the shelf near to the computer I am using to issue THIS agony note, but I disagreed for cleaness reasons because in that shelf were my computer peripherals such as my thumbdrive, audio-speakers and so. And maybe because I did not heard her "OK", so in my angry fuckingly angry protest I shutthe door and boycotted today's skipping session. And so a flame war started until I reasoned "I could have either misunderstood you or didn't hear clearly what you had said just now."<br><br>And as the flame war goes on I have came up with my mind of go to the overhead bridge near my home and JUMP DOWN onto the PIE, let me die from the impact or the traffic. I WANTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE!<br><br>And so, I asked myself: Is all these caused by bad luck, bad fengshui, bad Wen Chang fate, or else? Is it all because I was too cheap? Is it that I am damn incapable of winning? Is it that I was being stripped of my potentials and chances especially to both leadership and winning prizes, awards? Or is it because I am of late-night born, snake and Taurus that I was only fated to win later in life as a late-formed supreme being? (I mean, Â´Ã³Ã†Ã·Ã�Ã­Â³Ã‰?)<br>And am I totally useless, shunned by Singapore society?<br><br>If all these were yes, and essentially if there were no improvements in the near future,  I had rather go and commit suicide rather than living a bitter, hopeless, fruitless life, since by now I believed that in life, I could not get what I desired for(I do not have even my desired friends, only to be with the undesirables daily!), and in death, I have no grievances.<br><br>I wanted to die by suicide as now I wanted to live but cannot and that now I wanted dead but also cannot!<br><br>And that if all these were yes, I would want to give up everything including the bus guides I had and my most hatred life, by committing suicide until I am dead, all my blood were leaked out of my body and no air comes into my body and my wholebody becomes senseless, numb!<br><br>Up till here, I feel that I wanted to commit suicide, because I felt that I am cheap, slow developing, very useless, very incapable, very inable, and very hopeless, not optimistic of my life. I don't think there would any more achievements for me in the near future while life is getting very bitter for me, being futile, fruitless, hopeless.<br><br>And so I believed that only by commiting suicide would I be able to get what I wanted.<br><br>Also I think it is better for me to go into fortune superstition because only this is good for my future.<br><br>(And so I would be out tomorrow 25 October afternoon in Kuan Yin Temple praying for my fortune and my future, and where necessary I would look for a roadside stall providing luck-telling for help. Even better I have considered of changing my name.)<br><br>[b]What do you think about my plan to consult fortune and commit suicide? And is there any way to help me out? I urgently needed help!<br>HELP IS NEEDED FROM EVERYONE!</strong><br><br><strong>And So I would appreciate if everyone here could help me out before it is all too late, by providing useful advices and suggestions for me to improve on, with the sincerely welcomed suggestions and advices sent to here, my Private Message, or my email account hongkongsheky@yahoo.com.sg</strong><br><br>Also I decided to go on strike, not doing anything, not even to post on this forum!<br><br>Thank you and I would like to hear from everyone soon.<br><br>Thank you for your invaluable help rendered to me in my miserable times.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br>ysn<br>Yuen Shek Ngai (SGEMP)<br>24 October 2005, Singapore Bedok North<br>[/b]</blockquote></div>
