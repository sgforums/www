Yet a healthy person like you dont know how to cherish life.<br><br>Dont wait till its too late to cherish wat u have in ur life nows. Especially ur family.</div></blockquote>^ good advice, along with lots more given by others...<br><br>SGEMP -<br><br>Btw posting your actual name and real life details on a rant like this is a fantastic idea to get in real life trouble. Things would be great if someone pointed this to your teacher. FYI I'm sure I can't be the *only* person to know someone teaching in damai. In short, delete the posts. Unless of course you're trying to get someone you don't like in trouble.<br><br>Next, as countless people have undoubtedly said this is like ... CCA ... dunno what it means but if it's something in secondary school it's undoubtedly another harebrained project to make teenagers waste time thinking it's gonna help for entry to JC/poly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  It won't. I've not heard of a JC/poly turning away people with 6pts for O's. If you get 20++ points no amount of weird activities will get you a spot unless you do something like run 100m in 10sec or less  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Lastly, you simply sound like you're getting picked on. Maybe you don't like to realise this but your best bet is to a) find friends b) talk to a counselor c) talk to your teachers to mediate between you and your peers. If you don't change things you'll just keep getting picked on. I dunno why but that's just how things are like in school ... at teenage time anyways. People like to form cliques then have fun bullying those who don't fit in anywhere, for one reason or another. If *you* don't change you'll just keep getting picked on. This at least was my experience.<br><br>PS stop talking like everyone owes you something. If you want something, go get it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey.. Why you keep thinking of being a leader ?? you think itz cool ? Fun ? Or you just wanna show those around you that you got the power ? If you are having this childish thinkin of yours.. i think.. you better go back to Primary School.. Just to let you know.. Being a leader is NOTHING FUn.. im nt afraid to let you knw.. i went through My sceondary school before.. So what if i got some high ranking post inside the prefectorial board ? So what if im a Senior NCO of Npcc ? You think itz fun ? Itz Not.. Being a leader is whereby you are ready to lead ppl anytime anywhere.. you must be very very flxible.. if any of the teacher comes and demand an answer from you.. you must give them the answer they want.. Itz not that easy while trying to be a leader.. i went through before and i know.. You think itz fun staying back after school almost everyday till 7 or even 8pm ? you think you can handle.. ? ive done that in my Secondary School days.. every week, you have to plan things like programs, Duities, writing out your reports, thinking of new stuffs so that your fellow School mates wont get board with the CCA.. You have to keep coming up with all this things.. Nt to mention that during the holidays.. gotta plan for Orientation Camps, Leadership Camps, Bonding session etc etc etc.. I remembered.. there was a year.. During my Nov/Dec Holi, While all my friends are enjoying their holiday and all that, i gotta go back to school to settle my camp stuffs and my CCAs.. This is the price that you gotta pay.. DO you think you can handle that ? Seriously, From what you type.. I DO NOT THINK SO.. Leader will NOT complain when he or she met some problems.. He or She will think of ways to overcome the problem.. NOT COMPLAINING.. i dont think theres any teachers around would like to have someone like you to be  a leader for a particular CCA.. you are there to Lead the Whole TEAM.. NOT there to add on the problems for your teachers..  you are just like some of the typical Students who feels that they can do this they can do that.. but once you give them the job.. they give you Shit back..  Or like some primary school kids who likes to complain..  So.. what i trying to say itz.. just be yourself.. itz the best.. if you the qualities to be a Leader.. thats no way that you wont be.. your teachers would have choose you instead of the others liao.. and.. just a reminder for you.. by posting such stuffs in a publice forum.. you are only tryin to give a negetive impact on your Schools image.. if your teachers of Principle find out about this an decides to take actions.. you have to bear the FUll Resposible for starting this thread.</div>

I was then requested to head to canteen by the leader, Maurice Chng of 3E1 (2005), while fellows especially those in 3E4  all WANTED me to suffer or be ostracised!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>It fucks, it sucks, man! It's fucking unfair man!<br><br>And so I requested politely to them requesting them not to let me suffer or be sabotaged, while I requested another 3E1 member to pass me the latest news of the "blackbox operation election".<br><br>I have since went down, given that my stomach is rumbling very loudly, and had lunch as soon as possible.<br><br>When I returned, to my surprise, they all, including those supposed to stay for my meeting, all left, only leaving pieces and pieces of waste paper on the table!<br><br><strong>And concluding all these, Blackbox elections only kills their loyal fellows, while it seemed that those in roboracers wanted to have me killed and the whole ILLFATED project scrapped in a fuckingly unacceptable manner!<br><br>And so if not for that FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING JORDAN OF 3E4, then such FUCKING DAMN ASSHOLE SHITTY incidents would not have happened!<br><br>And so in retaliation:<br><br>Although I would not commit suicide in retaliation; but:<br><br>1) I would not care for the roboracer project<br><br>2) I would not be submitting back my CCA scoresheet<br><br>3) I would want to have that FUCKING CB JORDAN killed and destroy everything named Jordan  using nuclear weapons and destroying all the transportation the serves places named "Jordan" using air raids and local vandals!<br><br>and 4) There is a wikipedia page about my DMSS and I was the one who suggested for the page, planning to expand after the exams.<br>Now that I am unhappy with my comclub members, I would conduct STRIKE and terminate all the plans for the expansion of my DMSS @ WIKIPEDIA page FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME, THE FASTEST BEING WHEN THE RELATIONS IMPROVE.<br><br>SO FOR THE TIME BEING DO NOT EVER EXPECT ANY EXPANSION FOR THAT PAGE UNTIL THERE SHOWS SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>and 5) I would PULL AWAY ALL MY SUPPORT FOR MY COM CLUB and hope my com club to FALL AND DIE if such blackbox operations were to continue!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>Because take the grasses for example, if one locates a big plank over the grass patch, would the grass thrive in the lack of light and air?<br>No, right! Because they did not have chance or opportunity to thrive adn were not given the opportunity!<br>Such things just equates to what happens in a blackbox: NOTHING GROWS EVERYTHING DIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>So taking this theory if such fuckingly unfair blackbox operations were to continue then I would definitely hope my school's com club to fall, collapse and be DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>THAT'S ALL!<br><br>I WOULD BE REFERRING THIS TO MY COMCLUB TEACHER!!!!!!!<br><br>ANY SUGGESTIONS AND ADVICES ARE SINCERELY WELCOMED!!!!!!!!</strong><br><br>SGEMP<br>27 October 2005[/u][/b]</blockquote>excuse me. i found out that you seem to hate the class 3e4 especially. also usually, people don't want fellow members to suffer. who would anyway? and did you find out what they were doing in the first place? please do not jump into conclusions without getting the facts right.<br><br>how do you know that they were electing you to suffer? how did you know that they wanted you to be ostracised? and do you think that you are so importatnt that without you the other members cannot continue with the wiki page? how do you know you are that important that without you the roboracer prooject would be a failure? do you think that without your support the computer club would fall apart?<br><br>no, absoulutly no. if the computer is so united, one member less would not make such a difference. and you hope for your computer club to fall apart. without it, you are without a cca. without a cca, you would not get any knock off points. do you wish for that to happen? i doubt so.<br><br>you are a coward, just because of a little thing, you choose commit suicde. do you think death is solves everything? it isn't, you left unfinished business behind. you left your family mournining your death. you are a coward. you don;t dare face reality. if being a commitee member means so much to you, why don;t you approach your cca commitee and ask them to vote if do they want you. i'm sure that's fair.<br><br>and one last think. think why were you not chosen to be a commitee member. was it because you were not popular? was it because you were not effient enough? maybe, it's because of the vulgur you use just for a small matter of not being chosen for a commitee member. what about others may i ask? did they complain? did they scold vulgur? please. think again why were you not chosen.</div>

Its ur bad to say without any evidence.. maybe its just some normal election.. do u need to make such a big fuss out of it?? BLACKBOX?? -.-<br><br>Next, do u ever know how difficult is it to handle the club?? the pressure u get from the juniors n teachers?? from what u said about not bothering abt Computer Club makes me think u r not even fit to be a leader.. A leader must hav the potential to lead pupils.. DO YOU THINK U HAV THE POTENTIAL?? Y get into that CCA since u hate it so much?? Y bother about being a leader since u hate the pupils there? JUS GETTA HELL OUT OF THE CCA AND JOIN ANOTHER CCA.. Then did u ever consult any of the teachers regrading ur unhappiness of unable to become a leader?? There must be a reason for the teacher to choose him to become a leader.. so the teacher has his reasons for not choosin you as a leader.. instead of writing out ur feelings to the forum, y not try consulting the teacher to ask for the reasons...<br><br>Thirdly, i bet there are many other ppl out there interested in the competition so if u r not interested y join the competition??? Cum on, don make ur school lose face.. give other ppl a chance to enter the competition.. other ppl may be better than u.. they may make the sch shine instead of lettin ppl like u bring the image of the sch down..<br><br>Then did u know the seriousness of puttin ur sch name in?? if ever anyone found out i bet u will be in deep trouble.. U only know how to shame the school.. Hav u ever brought any glory to the sch?? No wonder you r not elected as a leader.. Tink abt that.. reflect to urself.. do some soul searching as to whose in the wrong..  Btw i am also from computer club too.. and i hav achieved awards for the school.. thats how the teachers find ur talent but wit ur bo chap attitude i think u are gonna fail in wadever u do..<br><br>The society is like that.. you hav to adapt to changes.. If u cannot even face such a small problem in future u will die wit a job.. Well, if you continue to hav tis stubborn character and not wanting to change i bet you will hav a lot more problems in ur life.. *Do u hav a life? haha.. i doubt so.. Cum on.. LIVE A LIFE PLEASE!!*</div>
