              <p>She's not your gf, so don't commit yourself fully to her lah.</p>
              <p>I have this female friend, who keeps a lot of her suitors 'as her friend'. And she goes out with them 1-on-1 basis also de. Top sales, professionals and rich men's sons, most of them drives their own car.</p>
              <p>Don't commit and attach yourself emotionally unnecessarily.</p>
              <p>Focus on your career, when career establish, girls come naturally de, law of this society.</p>

              <p>So... This friendship is nothing to you even though she rejected you but she is still trying to maintain platonic relationship with you?</p>
              <p>There might be a chance for this relationship to take up a higher rung of the ladder, but your impatience is not helping you.</p>
              <p>Maybe she is taking this opportunity to check you out?</p>
              <p>Not everyone jumps into river of love so readily.</p>
              <p>That is why some of us fail when it comes to judge people and their actions impulsively.</p>
              <p>Sorry if I sounded harsh. Just not sure why people demand a quick result/ answer from <strong>certain things which take times to build</strong>.</p>
