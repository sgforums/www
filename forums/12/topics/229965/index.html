Ur heart need to be healed. To protect from getting hurt, you had erected a protective barrier around yourself. It is protecting and trapping you. Don't set up a trap to trap yourself.<br><br>Learn from your past relationships not to make the same mistakes again.  Step by step, step out of there false comfort zone. Time, love from others and the right guy will heal your heart. Probably,you could try to make a note of the kind of guys that you tend to attract to.
