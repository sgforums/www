            <div class='col-md body'>I'm afraid this is a very sensitive and difficult issue. First of all let me clarify some stuff. If you are to convert, it has to be willingness on your part and it has to be because you really want to be a muslim and not because you want to marry the girl. Muslims can have sex why not? Only when the wife is having her period or is pregnant, then it is forbidden. Other then that it is green light all the way.<br>Since you have already state your stand of not interested in becoming a muslim, there is no other way for you two to get married unless she drops her muslim religion which i seriously think the father would strongly disagree. Before the relationship gets any deeper and both of you have made your religion decisions clear, I guess parting is the best but saddest solution.</div>

Love comes after that or whatever. Of course she will be upset, but she is given 2 choices or rather both of you are given 3 options. Break up(the sooner the better so that love does not strengthen and grow along with delayed time), she converts out of Islam, or you convert into Islam. I don't see any other choices. If you really love her a lot and wants to give it a try, then try knowing and learning more about Islam so that converting will come naturally for you, but I doubt you would want to do that and you are not obliged to do so. Hopes this helps... Good luck bro..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL you all got the wrong idea about Islame. I suggest you all just do a search on it on wikipedia before making it out to be a rigid religion.<br><br>But to the threadstarter if you don't even remotely considered converting into Islam then i suggest you break it off with the girl. No point if your going to forsake your religious duties as a muslim just cos you love the girl.</div>
