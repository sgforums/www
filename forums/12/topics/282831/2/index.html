            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Think I got the same situation here. Just got to know this girl, the moment i saw her, my heart really melt. So i managed to get her number... Called her up and chat for a while. I was quite stright forward, so I told her I am interested in her.<br><br>Week passed, and no improvement, always sms her or called her, she will be busy, and said she usually don't reply sms during wok, so was expecting her to call me or sms me when she's free. After so long, I called her up and she's drinking with her colleagues, i was like "WTF, thought you are still working?"<br><br>I always sms her but always no reply from from her, or suddenly she will reply you and then disappeared again. Always said she's busy, or things etc. Recently, I gave her the tickets for the Sammi Cheng concert and flower, said nothing, just a thank you,appreciate it. I was really sad and disappointed, at least can call me and tell me personally right?<br><br>Asked her out a few times, but alwys no reply from her. I was really pissed, I felt like a fool!<br><br>I am trying to just forget this girl, I think it's really not worth trying any harder.</div>

(This is a long term process)<br><br>2) make it known to her that there are no romatic feelings for her at all yet still be her friend.<br><br>3) weigh out everything that has happened between the 2 of you thus far and decide whether it would be worth the effort and time to keep her as a friend or to cut your losses early.<br><br>I would cut my losses cuz it sounds to me like you'r getting a little bitter and thats never good for the soul.<br><br>Whats worse is it doesn't sound like you just want her to treat you like "a friend"....<br></div>
