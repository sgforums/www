I have thrown them in the rubbish bins already.  Since then, I am a happy person. Why choose unhappiness to let them be your friends?   Choose to be happy by throwing them away.   These people are just making use of you and treat you like you are operating a customer service centre.   They are not genuinely interested to be your friends.</div>
