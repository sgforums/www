              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Here is how the story goes. Miss B is an old colleague of mine and she has decided to match make me with her friend, Miss A. Miss B tells me that Miss A is still single. Miss A is 3 years younger than me, I am in my early 30s. Miss B ask me to take Miss A to my church on Sunday service as Miss A is keen to go visit church. However, Miss A is not a Christian but has an open mind to Christianity. Miss A lives in Johor but is a PR in Singapore and works in Singapore. Miss A travels daily through the causeway to get to work to Tanjung Pagar. Miss drives to work. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Because Miss A wanted to attend my church, I was keen to help her. But at the same time I was careful not to turn it into a date because she is not a Christian but I do want to get to know her better. So I felt that we should be friends first. This neutral zone is safer and don’t risk any form of misunderstandings. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">On the first Sunday service, I called Miss A and ask her if she is keen to come visit my church. She said yes and she was excited. So I agreed to drive up and cross the border into Johor and then come back to Singapore where my church is. The journey was far and long because her house is 40km away. I needed GPS to locate her house. Then I pick her up and during the drive, she was so chatty and easy to conversate with. During the Sunday service, she ask me a lot of question about Christianity, I was happy to answer her. After service, I gave her a ride back to Johor. During the ride, I inform her that I was giving her a general introduction to the church, how to get there and where to park, brief history, bla, bla. Since she drives, I inform her that the next round, she could drive down to church and if she needed somebody to accompany her or a friend, she could call me and I be glad to accompany her. Then her whole face went black and she became unhappy. When I drop her off at her house, she never said a word of thanks to me and left. I thought I never see her again.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The next week, she called me to ask me to accompany her to Sunday service. I inform her to come 10:00 am sharp because if we are late, most of the seats would be taken. This time she came 10:35am. She was late and we had to sit upstairs. This time she wasn’t too keen to listen to the Pastor delivering his sermon, instead she was playing with her Iphone. Then a guy came and sat next to us. She started talking to him, not bothered to listen to the Pastor delivering his sermon. She told me that he is her ex colleague and he regularly attends this church. Before the service could finish, she hastily left 20 minutes before it ended, leaving me and the guy. I was asking myself, why does she need my help to take her to church when she could have ask this guy instead. I then tried to make conversation with this guy, but he was rude, he ignored me and went the opposite direction when the service ended. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then there was a bowling tournament organized by the youth at my church. I make an invitation to her. This time she gladly accepted it. So on the day of the church bowling tournament, we decided to have lunch together. This time she turn out to be quite chatty and very easy to talk to. She turned out to be an easy person to talk to. After lunch, as a gentleman, I paid the bill. This was not a very high class restaurant, just a mediocre one because I didn’t want to turn it into a “date”. I just wanted a more friend to friend setting. I wanted to get to know her better without starting any form of pursuit. I want to know if we are compatible. I’ve seen guys play the role playing game of chasing after girls, just no point for me, because its just not genuine. I prefer friendship first. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">After that we played bowling and some church games until it was 11pm. So since I invited her, I can’t very well let her go to her car alone. As a gentleman, I escorted her to her car parked in the basement. But she forgot where she parked her car. Some we took 30 minutes to find her car and finally we found it, and after she got into her car, I bid her farewell. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then its been a few weeks. Some sad things happen within my extended family, my grandmother past away. After the funeral, I was feeling a bit down. As I was about to attend Saturday service, then I got a text from Miss A, asking me to accompany her to church again on Sunday. So I decided to postpone my church service to Sunday, just to accompany her. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As I was on my way to church, she text me, telling me to go in first as she was going to be late. I wasn’t amused with her “reverse psychology” because the church is a mega church with 5,000 people attending. So if I go in first, how is she going to go in and find me? Some more I could have gone for Saturday service instead and can sit with my friends at church. Instead, now I have to go to church sitting alone? So I text back to her to let her know that I will wait for her. But she answered back sarcastically, and told me since I wanted to wait, she will be late lo. She text me again and told me to go in first and she’ll find me. Sigh, this time I really go in but was locked out of church because it was communion ceremony going on. So I waited until communion was over, and they reopen the doors. Then she appeared. She made me missed communion and offering. I was so unhappy. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">We then sat together. This time she played with her Iphone again, not interested to listen to the Pastor deliver his sermon. Then she told me that she had to leave early again. So we both left when the pastor halfway delivering his sermon. Only two people stood up and left among 5,000 people listening intently during the service. We stood out like a sore thumb. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As we were on our way out, she told me that today was mother’s day and ask me if I was celebrating. I told her that my whole family is not celebrating as we are in mourning because our granny just passed away. She continued to say that she is going to celebrate mother’s day with her family, never even bothering to express any form of condolences to me. I was surprised at her rudeness. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then as I was about to escort her to her car, she said she had to go to the toilet and told me not to wait for her. Another sulk from her. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I just tried at every chance to be nice to her and to get to know her better. But its her sulking and she is not punctual, always come late. I said to myself if she is not Christian, its still ok, maybe her character is good. But as I see now, we are not even compatible and she irritates me. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I don’t know. What do you think? I don’t think this is going to work out. I think me and Miss A should just be friends. </span></span></p>
