Don't try to control her life but learn to say NO sometimes. Learn to give and take. Let her know you are not happy with how she treats you and she will like you more. She will respect you more and love you.<br><br>i did tell her, i did let her know that i'm not happy with certain treatments, although not explicitly, but she knows. most of the time her reply to me would juz be "i'm like that lor"<br><br>then what can i say next? i also dunno.<br><br>Mistake 2: Don't just leave her alone when she blasts her temper on you. Say you are not going to argue with her. Defuse the situation with a joke. Treat it like it doesn't hurt you.<br><br>can try, but its going to take hell a lot of effort.<br><br>Mistake 3: You are being too nice a guy. Don't get me wrong. Show her respect, manners and don't take her for granted. Stop being a wimp by trying to pacify her. That's not the main purpose. The point is not to allow her to take you for granted, allow her to treat you like dirt.<br><br>yeh. sometimes i hate myself for being such a wimp also.</div><div class="quote_body"></div></blockquote>Don't worry guy. Now you know all these mistakes. Work on correcting them. Have you ever thought of leaving her? Seems like her character is such that it will make you suffer silently. She seems like a stubborn and rigid person. Are you going to spend your life with someone who keeps putting you down?<br><br>Guy, have the courage and discipline and work on those weak areas. Your masculinity will show in time.</div>
