              <p>My dating agency arranged a couple of dates for me and I went out with my first date. We spoke quite a bit and i found her to be quite suitable because we shared many interests. However, as a result of the dating agency arranging other dates for me, in the next upcoming weeks, I didn't have time to follow up with her. I went out on other dates, a few i found to be unsuitable due to our differences. One almost success but due to religious differences, we just remain as friends.</p>
              <p>So now it has been 3 1/2 months. Do you think I should call up my first date? By now, not sure if she had found her guy. However, she did tell me that she would inform the dating agency that she would like to see one guy in one month. So, she spaces out her dates, unlike me, I see almost every one every week.</p>
              <p>Do you tink she may get angry because I didn't contact her for a long time? Or she thinks that I may see her as a second fiddle? </p>
              <p>Let me explain, I don't see it this way because this is the very nature of dating agency. As a client, I am very distracted when they give me one date every week, so I didn't have the time to call her up (to follow up).  </p>
