So i walked along the mall to meet my fren lookin after another shop... n next to her shop was a shop selling socks, attended by a nice japanese gal. Quite fair, her hair dyed copper brown with nice honey voice. Cos I was bored, I went talk to her...one thing let to another and I offered to send her home ( i took the long way to her place..bout an hour..hehe). So we chat alot in the car..even though her english very limited....she position her body sideways to face me n she keep looking at me while talking to me.. well, ask her if she wants to go out later, she said yes energetically in a cute-japanese way.. even tho I ddnt say what my plans were exactly..neway,i send her home..she says she feels happy wen talkin to me, etc.. i told her i meet her next week again, etc etc..<br><br>point of the story: wen a gal talks to u, if she positions her body to face u, she is sending signals unconsciously that she likes u. And if she dosent reject u wen u ask her out..thats a pretty obvious sign right? Neway, reinforce my 1st point....the more she talks to u, it means she is interested in u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

So i walked along the mall to meet my fren lookin after another shop... n next to her shop was a shop selling socks, attended by a nice japanese gal. Quite fair, her hair dyed copper brown with nice honey voice. Cos I was bored, I went talk to her...one thing let to another and I offered to send her home ( i took the long way to her place..bout an hour..hehe). So we chat alot in the car..even though her english very limited....she position her body sideways to face me n she keep looking at me while talking to me.. well, ask her if she wants to go out later, she said yes energetically in a cute-japanese way.. even tho I ddnt say what my plans were exactly..neway,i send her home..she says she feels happy wen talkin to me, etc.. i told her i meet her next week again, etc etc..<br><br>point of the story: wen a gal talks to u, if she positions her body to face u, she is sending signals unconsciously that she likes u. And if she dosent reject u wen u ask her out..thats a pretty obvious sign right? Neway, reinforce my 1st point....the more she talks to u, it means she is interested in u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>seems more and more like business .. but at same time a bit BS ... so qiao go 2 shops oso the sales girl so responsive .

I think depends on how u 'flirt' and your personality as well. Also need to think positive!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
