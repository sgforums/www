            <div class='col-md body'><p>what i observe in general those that can keep their 'good looking' galfriends guys are usually not having money problem. either they family rich, or they can get enough of it to sponsor the dates. as for gals some of them or majority of them never been through hardships, or rather they are provided for by their rich families, or average doing families. or they just work part time on their own to sponsor some bags if their bf cannot get them in time. only after a certain age will they setle down because shelf life aging. forget about true love, watch some love movie read a novel and chill out go slp. there is but very few i can say. that's why so many cross culture love but those you see on media, well its a stroy for media release, one way or another. in this generation sad to say no money no honey.</p></div>

              <p>actually, these kind of stuff applies more to kids....</p>
              <p>adults with sense would not have these much of a problem.</p>
              <p>1)It is common sense that if you ask a girl out, at least have the courtesy to pay for them.</p>
              <p>2)The bf should grow some balls and explain his situation and learn to plan more wisely for future outings.</p>
              <p>3)This should be common sense.</p>
              <p>4)You can tell if a girl is not after your money if she usually pays for her own expenses or even treat you at times.</p>

              <p>well, we're looking for girlfriend and wives, not leeches. Well after some time of dating, you can tell who's one and who's not.</p>
              <p>I will be glad to spend on the one who's not. Also depends on things like earning power and family background. As you start off in your career, you may find it a little tough but it gets better.</p>

If you know you cannot keep it up, don't make it a habit for her. We guys have our pride, but still, a reflection on our actual character is what we would want to show the girl. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>but your statment on being a men must always pay for gf i am sure many will disagree. one thing i know i can accept is mayb the house you buy you pay full, but don't include her name in it. db rules, one to be co-owner you have to pay for the instalments partially also. if not be no power occupant hahaha</p>

              <p><br>look at relationships initially its like an investment. some pend lots on grils only to sex them. then they can go howlian and tell their circle of firneds. just a matter of tme when they got no money you see the other side of them. playboy infront but at work (don;t know what job they doing lah, 'sales executive' can be a sales assistant in a shop attending to people walking in) no planning for life and eventially still ah beng until old. if you asking this tiype of peoblem i think youshould avoid this type of gals as companion. and looking at the other thread you posted on buying condom i think you should stop thinking about dating for a while and concentrate on studies or work or whatever you doing now.</p>

              <p>My gf is those submissive type therefore there isn't those i'm equal to you shit from her which i can't stand. She not a leech and i know that because she will insist on saving money when i wanna buy stuff for her or spend alot on food. It ok if the guy likes to pay for the girl as i believe it part of taking care of her. You ask your wife go dutch la, i'm sure that feels retarded. I treat my gf the same. But if it is the girl insist on me paying i will not. But if the girl want pay then i will pay for her. That is dating la. But gf i will pay. So far date with so many girls i don't have any who ask me pay la so no issue with that.</p>

              <p>hmm.. looks concrete outwardly. if you are happy with the way things worked out like that that's fine. how old are you anyway? holding on to money is not being a giam siap. you need to have some money sense. i don;t know how many gfs or mayb ladies and female you meet in life. if you met lots of them and feel that this gf is for you then its fine with you finefine. if its voluntary spending at your side then its okay. but those gf that insist on you buying things for them and also expensive ones when they hardly know you well i think you better prepare to say goodbye to them.</p>
