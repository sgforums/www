            <div class='col-md body'>It is saddening to hear that you have suffered the agony of being cheated on by not one, but three different unfaithful girls to whom you have given your heart. You seem to have the knack of picking the wrong people to fall in love with.<br><br>Am no expert in this area, but if you do not want the same thing to repeat for the fourth time and possibly turn you into a misogynist, you may wish to consider changing either:<br>1. Your perception of an ideal mate, or<br>2. Your treatment towards a loved one, or<br>3. Both of the above.<br><br>For perception, perhaps you have chosen your past girlfriends based solely on their looks, rather than on their characters? Please do not take it to mean that good looks and good characters are exclusive of each other. Just trying to point out a logical assumption that good-looking girls tend to attract more attention, hence have more alternatives to choose from (some translate this as more temptation and more opportunities to cheat).<br><br>For treatment, I'm not advocating you to behave like a jerk from now on, but perhaps you may have been too nice and "clingy" in your past relationships? Read some of the other posts in this forum, maybe you might find some similar lessons and gain insight from other people's experiences.<br><br>Hope these pointers could help you avoid a fourth heartbreak. Good luck.</div>

It seemed to me that you don't really know the woman you are getting before jumping into a relationship. If she has an unsettled affair/relationship with her ex, by knowing that piece of information in the first place, would it change anything? Possibly, it would caution yourself before devoting your time and love into this BGR.<br><br>Interestingly, you are not really bothered by her act of infidelity, but the question of whether she wants the relationship hovers your heart. And what on earth are you encouraging her? A love blinded Leo? Blinded by the affection and love this karmic relationship brings forth and veils your senses?<br><br>Don't be a fool.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If you can't bear to see her sad and since she loved her ex, probably as much as you did to her, then what's holding you back? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What's holding you back, if you truely understood what you just posted?</strong></span><br><br>You are likely a substitute/rebound for her ex and she played an emotional parasite on her part. She wants to move on, but the variables were: she got into a relationship with you and trying to move WHILE handling you and her past simultaneously. This process leeched emotional energy, mental strength and summon rain of tears. Somewhat like a soul being captured by demonic powers and you are needed to remove that vile thing. Of course, you will be drained... probably to death, dry and parched.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> She was never ready for a relationship with you - this is a untold truth.<br><br>Why?<br><br>If love is in the picture, would that scenario ever happen? She would probably struggle emotionally, but it could still be manageable. Making out? Can't live without him? Leave you whenever she found his presence? Is this the so called love you are getting?<br><br>Don't be deluded by false love; she has made her choice. It's your call.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
