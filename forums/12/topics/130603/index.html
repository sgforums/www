            <div class='col-md body'>sorry bro<br><br>What I am got to say is a bit hash but is a fact. I do not want to offend but I just could not stand seeing another one of the good guys suffer again.<br><br>from what i see is another case of kena played out by gf haiz..<br>being the good guys we try our best in the end the result is just the same.<br><br>To tell you the turth, I do not believe a single word your gf says. She says she loves you and got ot work to do but in fact goes to bed with other guys. Wow thats great man.  So is it right for you to say you love her and go to bed with other gals?<br><br>I just hope that you take a step back and see that she is playing with you all along. She may even be laughing at you for being so weak and never fight for her. You do not get it do you? she play with your heart and you pity her? haiz you are so lucky to get rid of her so early before you 2 got married. I actually pity her ex cos he will have to get a wife like her. He will never know when she will sleep with another guy and pass some nasty virus to him.<br><br></div>

That means it had happened before. Has your girlfriend already cheated on you twice, including this time?<br><br>Even if she chose you again, even if you won this battle again, could you still bring yourself to trust her again? How many more battles like this could you bear to face? Do you really want to be "always be bother about this"?<br><br>It is no battle lost. Not when what you could gain by winning is not the heart of a girl, but the name of a cuckold.<br><br>It is a battle won. Your letting go has won you dignity for yourself, respect from your peers, gratitude of one whose love you no longer have, and, last but not least, the chance to give your heart to another more deserving.<br><br>You're not stupid -- you're just too involved.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Slamdoink,<br><br>A relationship is Not a battle, nor a competition, please bear that in mind.  What you have here, is a situation in which a girl has to choose between 2 people, &amp; she has chosen someone who she feels she can be happier with.<br><br>However, your girl should bear in mind that a relationship is Not food.  She shouldn't "sample the cuisines" to see which 1 she likes better, then swing to &amp; fro.  I'm Not saying this is definite, but she might be playing 1 guy off against the other.  So, next time you make her upset, she'll say, "I think my ex makes me happier, should try him again", &amp; she may say the same thing to her ex.<br><br>Is this ultimately what you want?  Do you wish to be emotionally blackmailed for the rest of your life?<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by slamdoink:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, it had happened againÂ… this time round I lose the battle. My gf went to work as usual and I asked if she wanted mi to fetch her home after her work. She said she need to do OT and might be late. So I said ok and if you changed your mind, I will be here.<br><br>The next morning, I received an SMS from her. She told me she met up with her ex and her ex told her; he wanted to settle down with her as in get married with her. They told thru the nite and they make out.<br><br>I was shocked when she told mi that and the first thing that comes to my mind wasnÂ’t the make out part but rather would she still want mi? we talked for couple of hours and she hinted she wanted to be with me. She just need time to settle things with him. And she did!!! He was out of her life!!! However he played the disappearing act and it caught my gf attention. She felt lost and seems like she cant live without him!!!<br><br>They patched back after she told me she had chosen mi. she say sorrie and sorrieÂ… im not angry with her actually I encourage her. Cos if you never try, you will always be bother about thisÂ… am I stupid or watÂ… but I just lost the battleÂ…<br><br>i love her a lot but i cant bear to see her to be sad... well once always say is better to have two happy person rather than to have three sad people...<br><br>but i really love her... can someone just pull mi out from this black hole!!!<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She's a material Girl.... Leaving is a correct choice.<br><br>Respect a girl is correct. Once this trust/relationship/respect is in any way disrespected forget about her.<br><br>Basically weather the boy or girl cross the line.... he/she is not worth it to go along any more.<br><br>You just can't control anyone not to cross the line again. If he/she can patch back after crossing the line, meaning she knows this is what he/she can do &amp; get the same result(s) again. It will be a strong temptation to cross the line again &amp; again &amp; again. In the end the one who always "Yuan Liang" will be hurted long in the heart.<br><br>Just once not "Yuan Liang", he/she will turn over &amp; finds all sorts of reasons to get out. It's human behaviour. 99.5% humans will find all sorts of reasons to get out of troubles, even cats &amp; dogs will do this!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>
