It is obvious that my dad is seeing a thai lady in Hat Yai.

She took good care of us and my dad, leave the best food for us and my dad, she look after us and my dad when we were sick. But when she is sick, she will suffer alone and continue do her household chore with no complaint at all. She treats my dad like a king. Listen to all his command and dare not provoke him. To my dad, whatever he does or say must be right and insist that my mum to follow even if its obviously wrong. Whenever my mum tried to argue, she will get a bad scolding and humilated etc.<br><br>I hate my dad. Since young, I have seen him scolding my mum stupid loudly even in front of relatives/friends or even stranger. He is very demanding and unreasonable. He expect my mum to do every single thing for him and if she make any slightest mistake, she will get a very bad scolding from him. Even the cutting of his toe nail too short can get a real bad scolding ! Everytime my mum will quietly suffer and sometime secretly cried in the kitchen etc. At times i even saw her putting down her pride and appologies for what that is obviously not her fault. This really hurts and make me hate my dad more...<br><br>Months ago, my dad when for operation, my mum took great care of him, visit him everyday, cook tonic, porriage etc. Help him wash up, accompany him for checkup, carry with her my dad medicine and accompany him everywhere he goes so as to remind him to take his medicine. If she failed to remind my dad of his medicine, she will get a bad scolding.<br><br>My mum keep thinking that by treating my dad better, he will stop seeing the thai lady. But she is definitely wrong. Now that my dad has fully recovered. Immediately he left for Hat Yai today. My mum has done so much for him and was never appreciated.

He has intention to spent all the money for the rest of his life, enjoying himself alone and leave nothing for my mum to prepare for her old age. He rather remit money to the thai lady than to give any to my mum. He has never realise who has been taken care of him when he is sick, who has been giving him such a comfortable life like a king for the past many years.

            <div class='col-md body'>There's only one thing you can do to help your mom. Love.<br><br>Love her with all your heart and soul. If she needs anything, always be the first to respond to her needs. Don't bother about your dad if he continues to be like this. One day, he DEFINITELY will have retribution. One has to learn the hard way if they don't get the soft meassures.<br><br>Continue to love your mom no matter what the cause. As a son/daughter, you are precious to your parents, because at the end of the day, you are the ones who will in turn shower them (or one of them in your case) with love should anything go wrong.<br><br>Additionally, I'm not saying that you should hate your father. But do have a willing heart to forgive him once he repents and ammend his ways. All the best to you!<br><br>Best of hope!<br><br>S.H.I.N.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a very devastating situation for your mother. I believe none can uinderstand the pain and grief she has gone through.<br><br>My heart just goes out to you and your family though I wonder how and what I can advise.<br><br>If need be, will you want to engage a professional counsellor who would have intervened in similar situations before? Refer to this link if you do consider -<a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=75218" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=75218</a><br><br>In the meantime, attempt to keep her company as much as you can. Just in any case of a broken relationship, the person involved will need companionship and close attention is advised so that she can still draw strength from those with her to face what happened and handle it.<br><br>In addition, please continue to write to us. You need as much emotional relief and support as well. Do you have close friends to confide in? A reliable outlet for support and relief will help you to gain ccourage and positive strength to help your mum.<br><br>Lastly, are you of any faith? Do give me a PM should you need more help.<br><br>Meanwhile, stay strong and believe that nothing is impossible to resolve with your love for your mum and family.<br><br>Hear from you soon.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm so sorry to hear about your problem.<br><br>Frankly, despite the fact that you want to help your mom, this issue is between the 2 of them. What u can do is to be there for your mom and learn to be strong enough to overcome all problems you encounter. Be someone of strong character that as long as you draw breath into your lungs, you need not let this problem bring you or your mom down. You all can still survive. Really.<br><br>I am facing similar issue with yours actually. I can't say I am taking it well totally, but everyday is a learning journey for me and my mum.<br><br>So, hang in there and NEVER say die !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  I believe most of the advices have been given, so i should not go back generally to the repeat version.<br><br>Let's see in a more perspective vision. Currently, looks like your dad is runnin another affair in Thailand and it seems very obvious. So do you intend to forgive him, if he repents one day? Sometimes in life, forgive can be easy, forget can be hard. However ask yourself, are you still able to accept him if he repents one day after all these harms and unfaithfullness done?<br><br>Sometimes, a person can get very foolish. Why? Look at this way, forsaking his whole family (wife, kids, all these years of family foundation) just to seek for some moments of pleasures. Is your dad belonging to this type?<br><br>Also, not to frighten you. Most men whom got into affairs with Thail women for just a moment of folly, I don't meant all thail women. Usually they are being "black-magic". If they do not return they will fall very ill or sometimes death. Some didn't even know why they have to return to thailand every forthnightly or monthly.<br><br>There can be many things to write on... but my advice is to seek some "Enlightened" person's help to check if your dad is under any spell or he is just plain visiting bars and niteclubs seeking some pleasures.<br><br>If you need help, you can always pm me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Used to be a similar situation as yours. But i was six at that time. unlike your mum, my mum is more of stronger woman with her own way of life. After the divorce, she brought up the 2 of us alone with a sickness that she had since 12. It was hard, but i guess she's happier rather than staying with my dad. My mum went all the way to Taiwan trying to catch my dad. I dunno what had happened, but all i heard from my mum much later was, my dad slapped her and she demanded a divorce and told him, It's not because of this woman for our end, its ur slap.<br><br>Well.. i guess.. first thing, ur mum have to be strong to decide to fight for her own happiness.. otherwise she can only suffer in silence.<br><br></div>

I can not only see your helplessness and agony in this post, but also the deep love and affection for your mum. If you are independent (ability to work), my suggestion:<br><br>I) To bring her out of this home first. She will will definitely resist (especially if your mum is a Taurus, Scorpio, Leo, Aquarius), but you have to keep 'brain-washing' (psychological conditioning) her that what this marriage has imbue into her psyche - it must now be undone and led away by her child.<br><br>II) In a new environment, everything will change eventually. She must be cut from the karmic cord she had with your dad - meaning, an self-impoised physical separation from your parents first. Financially, you will be stretch to the max at first, but after when your mum had settle emotionally in her own home, encourage and help her to find work in so to achieve three things:<br><br>- For easing of finanicial load. (Physical)<br><br>- Clearing her mind and focus on new things. (Psychological)<br><br>- Interaction between new people; not neccessary a new mate, rather to keep her emotions faraway from her failing marriage. (Emotional)<br><br>III) Once her new life sinks in and when courage shine upon her to raise the issue of divorce, this would be the final stage. Of course, your dad <strong>WILL </strong>fight to the bone for these three things to happen. Why would he want to lose a woman who's nothing more than a free maid to him? He will fight and you as her child will combat back. Resistance must happen if you want things to change.<br><br>Everything walks a long way and love is the only way you could bring a smile to your mum. Keep loving her, not only by action,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <strong>but also through words and gesture like hugs.</strong></span> This is important for emotional restructuring. Discard those-asian side of being uncomfortable and embrace what love would do, like you to your partner.<br><br>P.S: I would fight for my mum if that happens (Aries Moon in 4th house) and she will receive million times more love than what my dad would give. <strong>You have to share the same sentiments.</strong> She will then evolve, for you act as her 'little husband' and would gradually gather what is neccessary to lead a better life in the future. I wouldn't advice trying to psycho her to divorce your dad BEFORE letting her experiencing her new life. She will definitely resist (especially if she belongs to the four astrological sign mentioned). Go on a reverse trip, if it is humanly possible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Sometimes friendship can help forget the pain.<br>Your mom needs empowerment - make her feel that she can help ( i.e. community work) instead of feeling helpless. All these stoic years in verbal abuse your dad did to her will make her feel very useless and powerless. Restore that power in joint community work and she can gain some friends as well.<br><br>If your dad supported you in school and food , you have to be thankful in a way. Maybe you could try  reason with your father. Try to reach an amicable solution or try a counsellor.<br><br>Remember to take care of yourself too.<br></div>
