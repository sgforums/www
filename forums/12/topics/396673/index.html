              <p>I find his tale absolutely enthralling, how this guy bitches about his parents like a 12 year old, and whines when his parents never flush the toilet. Obviously you are the one who has the cleaniness habit or jie pi. Seriously moaning about never flush toielt ? wait till you see the whole floor full of urine.</p>

              <p>esp my mother, she like abit senile liao. every morning before she goes to work, she go open the front door of the house first, left it open, then go to kitchen make water to boil, then do what in the kitchen later.  then sometimes she go back to her own room to take her own stuff, then come out, and then go out of the house and lock the door.</p>
              <p>I was like wtf. why open the front door when you are not prepared to leave the house yet? if you need to do your stuff in the kitchen or inside your own room, why do you need to open the front door open leh? what if there are strangers who drop in the house uninvited? dunno what she is doing and thinking.</p>
              <p>got a few times when I came home after her, the front door was not locked and I was like wtf? did she forgot to lock the door? haiz no eyes see. this is one of the example of her wierd ways.</p>

              <p><br>Don't forget you comes from your Mother, so you will be even better than her at being senile in your future.</p>
              <p>Why do you think that strangers would like to drop by your place?</p>
              <p>For all you know, these strangers might become suicidal and go kill themselves after visiting your place.</p>

              <p>if she has a peculiar behaviour, should you talk to her nicely in lieu of complaining behind her? if you find her suffering from senile dementia, as her child, shouldnt you encourage her to see doctor?</p>
