Yeah, being an optimist I have been telling myself that haha.. but losing the energy and stamina to feel so.. and this phase is way too long.. can only pull myself up for a day... then down for a few days before pulling myself up again.. worse is that the number of days I'm down seems longer and longer... losing it...</p></div>

              <p>Optimist,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Optimists are usually people who can roll with the flows.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are in a time of your life when you are facing a lot more changes and you're having a hard time adapting to it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are a guy, it is very normal. I read an article somewhere that men don't adapt to changes as well as women.</p>
              <p>It takes them a longer time.. and occasionally they go into depression or self doubt, before they finally figure out how to balance the differences in their expectations vs reality.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps you may want to share with us, why you feel so drained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is your spouse expecting too much from you ?</p>
              <p>Are you living beyond your means ?</p>
              <p>Are you burdened by too much debts/liability ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is nothing in your life that cannot be resolved if it pertains to your lifestyle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ofcors there are issues that you cannot change but have to deal with and live with , like illnesses or family tragedy etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So look at what you can change.. and start working on it.  </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I speak on behalf of pessmists worldwide.</p>
              <p>Question, if not for kindness and self image, what other reasons have we got to exude optimism around colleagues, friends and family? No one can or ever will be optimistic and upbeat about life every step of the way unless they're in denial.</p>
              <p>Imho, there's nothing wrong being pessimistic. This dirty comfort of fear cushions the blow. It's human and it's real.</p>
              <p>Also, we choose not to divulge our inner thoughts because people either frown upon sad thoughts or they worry over the negativity.</p>
              <p>If you're feeling down all the time, get a dog. Get lots of beer.</p>
              <p>Dogs are nice. Beers are self explanatory.</p>
              <p>Dogs are loyal, friendly, they wag their tails when happy, bark at you when pissed off.</p>
              <p>And they'll never judge you the way humans do.</p>
              <p>So much more freedom in affection and expression compared to the awkward pat on the back followed by the default, "Cheer up lah."</p>

              <p>Sounds similar to what I'm going through. I always visualize myself walking in a deep valley, where tall mountains on both sides block out the sight of anything.</p>
              <p>It is just one of 'those' days in the cycle. You should get past this feeling in a week. If it persists for more than a month, better seek professional help.</p>

              <p>You will probably find a 100% optimist in a mental hospital.</p>
              <p>And you will probably find a 100% pessimist in the grave.</p>
              <p>All of us have our fear, optimistic and pessimistic qualities and blah blah within ourself. The only difference is how much... And yup, u r normal.</p>
              <p>Just find some1 close to u or some1 who does not noe u at all and tell them all your negativeness... Life is not only being postive... sometimes, u need to be negative... we r all just humans after all...</p>

              <p>Well, i always think that i am going to be happy becaues i have acquired many advices already. However, i found myself still bogging down by things in family, relationship, work and society and its seems that problems are always coming.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps some people are just happy and strong even when they face peoblems compared to others who feel stress easily with the same problems face.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its also hard to compare people though because each of us is unqiue situation and circumstances.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, if you want, i can charge you by being your happiness guru. that is if you have money to spare.</p>
