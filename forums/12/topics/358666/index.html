              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Post is abit inmorale. if u are in pri school please dun read<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span><br><br>iIt's never too good to be too honest<br><br>To protect, and save the others, so somehow hoping that the others might help you in the future. <br>Eg. You lied to the police that mr tan did not kill anybody. Because MR tan is my friend, and i might do something bad the next time, i hope mr tan could help me the next round<br><br>Why do this? Cos i learnt in school that do good things have good outcome. <br><br><br>Ya i also think that lying to make oneself look good needs to have it's limits. But you cannot say things like u earn $1.8k/month at some company when you are still studying pri school<br><br>However i tink ppl lie when they overestimate their ability to do something<br><br>If a married couple Mr jones and Mrs jones. If i am Mr jones and have another girlfriend outside, i will still like to my wife that i am working till late, nt cos im seeing my girlfriend. In the meantime i will try to 'break up' on my side. Problem is that sometimes you are not strong enough to break up the relationship.<br><br>So, since i have helped mr tan before, i hope he can help me with something like telling my another 'girlfrend' that we should stop seeing<br><br>So lying isnt that bad lah</p>
              <p><br><br>Somehow i agree that ppl lie cos they are not good enough to be in life<br>So working with another person who lie maybe able to fuck up a life of someone who is doing good enough. Why? SOmetimes a person who does reallly good in life will become very arrogant. When this happens, he/she will lie more as there is a higher chance of ppl believing him/her.  <br><br>When you liers work together, miracles can happen. Liers know the truth, and they should be able to think from different perspective, somehow making things the looks true.<br></p>

              <p>Another common reason why people lie is to save themselves from embarrassment, e.g lie about ur grades in school, ur work etc.</p>
              <p>Some ppl also lie out of frustrations. I personally hate to lie unless i really have no choice, as i always have to tell another lie to cover up.</p>

              <p>Since you want to take over his stained account, then you must be prepared to face and resolved misunderstanding like this.</p>
              <p>If you're not prepared, then don't be greedy and anyhow take people's account.</p>
              <p>Is there a reason why you cannot use your own account?</p>
              <p>If you insist that I'm a guy, then by all means treat me as a guy lor. I don't even need to convince and persuade you about my gender cos guys like you will NEVER be good enough for girls like me. Like I care whether you can accept it or not, but that's a fact that you will need to live with until you die. </p>
              <p>I only replied because you posted such a misleading post and the contents are so immature and childish. But I think your post content maybe is good enough for like-minded immature kids like yourself lor.</p>
              <p>Please lor, posting this kind of post will not make you look wiser, either you're wise or you aren't. Faking and pretending to be wise just doesn't make the mark at all if you haven't really spent enough effort on your post content. You either have it in you or you don't. In this case, I can tell you that you don't.</p>
