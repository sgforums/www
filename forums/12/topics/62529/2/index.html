Not required kind, rather like all other form of skills, it is gain through practical approach. Usually, you can't prevent yourself from feeling because its so natural and it happens unconsciously. My advice is to avoid controlling it consciously as it will normally have adverse effect because in the end, you will discover you can't do it and probably acknowledge it or accepted it without you realising.<br><br>To prevent falling in love, we need to look into four areas.<br><br>(I) [b]Visual</strong> - Avoid unneccessary contacts of all sort that trigger the sight factors. Do not meet her, do not keep her pictures, put away items she gave you, etc.<br><br>(II) <strong>Communicate</strong> - Avoid unnneccesary contacts of all sort that trigger the speech factors: Do not chat with her, do not email, etc.<br><br>(III) <strong>Sound/Voice</strong> - Avoid unneccessary contacts of all sort that trigger the hear factors: Avoid phones, SMS.<br><br>(IV) <strong>Thoughts</strong> - This is the most difficult stage. You MUST probably satisfy the above three to handle this. To handle thoughts, you must first acknowledge and recongise that this relationship is furtile to pursue - The reasons and stuff. Expand your mind and realise that love is not just about BGR. Spiritual love doesn't need physical/verbal committment. To love, is to see the best out of the person, with you or not in the picture.<br><br>To affect her marriage because of you isn't making the best out of her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Recongise that its normal and natural to think occasionally. To ponder is to enlighten and gradually to attain realization.<br><br>Let me tell you, the most karmatic relationship, often have the strongest magnetic attraction. It's always a effect of nature to have you pay/repay your debts through entering the relationship/accepting the existence of it. By 1st level love - you suffer because by society ethics, you can't acquire such love easily, and more often than not, its painful and unfulfilling.<br><br>Being a Cancer, you will cloud your own emotions when suffering from emotional turmoil - the accuracy of your feelings will fail you. Heed your rational mind. Avoid thoughts like 'ming zhong zhu ding.' because psychologically, its self fulfilling prophesies - You are walking towards where your love cosmic karma wants to lead you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Two ways to handle love cosmic karma - First is the most common: to accept them, which is what bear always say: love and damn the consequences. Secondly, is wisdom and enlightenment. I think you understand such thingy much more than me. Well, anyway, take care! I will be here if you need.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers    [/b]</blockquote>what do you mean by 'karmatic relationship' ? how does one get such a magnetic attraction?</div>

I meant 'karmic relationship.' To recongise the existence of karmic relationship is often only AFTER you entered into one. Relationship, may not always be beneficial. Sometimes, it truly brings alot of pain, conflicts or in simple: lessons for you to learn. Such relationship are karmic by nature - couple had to pay/repay debts to each other until full sum is finished before the relationship ends OR before the love can begin its true romance.<br><br>Magnetic attraction comes in many forms. In astrology, certain aspects between Sun, ascendant, Moon, South node, Saturn and Neptune can signify alot of things. First at love sight, good impression, cultivating love, first love and loads of other thingy are the result of magnetic attraction. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Under Law of Polarity, negative attracts positive. One fine example is the people around you, your girl friends - probably one of them sticks with this guy whom you truely dread and he is kinda jerk (treat her badly, neglect, etc). BUT your girl friend still remains. This is one fine example of a karmic relationship with strong magnetic attraction. Ask them about the begining past and how they became a couple, there is definitely a great attraction at first. Though this attraction dies soon enough and the 'debts payer' will remain and probably suffer until the debts is fully paid. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Every relationship exist for a reason.<br><br>Cheers</div>
