              <p>I'm facing a dilemma, I'm Travelling ALOT right now, and while all that travelling gives me valueable insight and learning experience, it is also my bane, i am at 23 and i don't have a steady girlfriend cause of this. While i sometimes enjoy the different stuffs i do, i sometimes feel sooo soo lonely on the inside, and i know i cant find a girlfriend yet because i know i will move again and the relationship will surely end. SOmetimes i feel so happy but i have no one i can truly share it with, sometimes i feel demoralized but there is no one i can confide in. I dont like this feeling.. And i'd like to find a singaporean girlfriend but i wont be back in SG for the next many years.. Unless i stop my overseas job after i graduate and slack off in SG to find my soulmate..</p>
              <p>So this is a choice between finding my soulmate or advancing in my career quickly.. And frankly i am 50/50 on this. What do you guys think?</p>

              <p>No proper career , you also very hard to find girlfriend de.</p>
              <p>If a nice pretty girl is your motivation. Then work hard and be an achiever.</p>
              <p>Else you can only salivate after another man's pretty wife.</p>
              <p>Keep an open mind. You don't have to only focus on this little red dot to find your soulmate.</p>
              <p>Since you are fortunate to be given the opportunity to expand your choices because of your career, then why would you want to give it up so you can search in a micro dot ?</p>
              <p>Think about it ya.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> It's quite difficult to have your cake and eat it. In reality, relationship do creates certain structures; despite how individualistic we are with regards to our life and perspective, it do somewhat condition us to try 'fit' into this structure. The more individualistically adamant your ideals are, the more challenges it is to squeeze them into the framework of a relationship.</p>
              <p>It is not that a relationship is detrimental to our individual ideals, but rather, it is part of a greater understanding to promote the beauty of understanding, compromising and acceptance. Surely, if the structure of the relationship constricts certain things in life, something has to sacrifice a little. Sometimes in life, it's difficult to have the best of both worlds.</p>
              <p>Also, soul mate doesn't just appear just because you decide to stay in sg and 'slack'.</p>
              <p>You can only decide what is important to you right now at this stage to make reasonably calculated choice/s for yourself - look at the opportunities you own now and decide what you want to do with them. And not plan with things that has not manifest itself just yet.</p>
              <p>Then your thoughts should be clearer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
