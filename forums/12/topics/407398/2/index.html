              <p><br>Serious ulqiorra87, i think you think too much. At 23 yrs old you still young, just relax, work and enjoy making friends where ever you go. <br>Stop worrying about relationship, don't worry when you meet the gal that is the one - you will know it, cause she be the one that you will be willing to give up travelling and other things for, till then just do your job. <br><br>If it is not yours, even if you give up your career now, and fly back, you think you meet her ?</p>

              <p>I was also travelling for many years (around 80% of the time in a year) since my graduation in 2005. I was 24 back then and it was until last year that I finally led a more routine kind of job back in Singapore. Though during that entire period, finding a gf or settling down never really cross my mind. Top most of my mind is just to have fun, get to see the world, experience more of life, earn more and the overseas experience will definitely beef up my career portfolio.</p>
              <p>At 23 years old, u r still young. Focus on your career, find out what you like to do, earn more and if possible, try to hit the management level in 4-5 years. With a good career, still young in the late-20s, and tons of cash (due to overseas expat package), you will have no problem finding a gf once u r back in Singapore.</p>
              <p>For guys, career is more important than family at your age. Once you hit the 30s or when you have given promise to a girl, then family will take the top priority. I have also gone through this route and got to know a very nice girl this year. At this stage, I have no worries about career, financial matters and is able to give my love one the best in life.</p>
              <p>So think about it.</p>
