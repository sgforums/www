            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys..<br><br>I've really had enough. I thought awhile before deciding to post here at AA. Heres the problem...<br><br>My dad and younger sis have super hot temper. They get angry easily. There are times when they showed me attitude but i just ignored it. But certain times it becomes unbearable. For my dad, whenever he is unhappy and i needed to talk to him, he would just ignore me and gives a bloody face. My sis is even worse. My sis would sometimes shout at me and curse me. I got very angry and shouted back at her with vulgarities and sparks flew. Theres this day when my sis said, "Hey! If im unhappy i can choose to talk back at you with a attitude, regardless how nice u ask me. Better heed my warnings." I always put up with such attitudes for at least once a week, especially my sis. I try hard not to retaliate and shout back since we are a family and to avoid arguments. My sis infact is the boldest of all. She told my mum this before, " Eh! If you dont show me respect first, i will never show you any respect, regardless of your status as a parent."<br><br>Ok ... i put up with such attitudes ... Now is my school.<br><br>Sometimes in school, i would get really fed up over certain things and homework. Then theres this 'friend' ( lets call him A) who really gets on my nerves. If he turns moody or angry with me, he would show me attitude and just keep mum. Not a word mentioned. Since I knew that i would clash with him and he's quite irritating at times,  i chose to sit at another place in the class. But just as nice, there are many absentees on this particular day. Since there is an empty seat beside me, he shifted from his place and sat beside me. During POA, i got really fed up with a POA question, hence i turned quite moody. Then A asked me which question im at, i told him im at qsn 4. 10 mins later he asked me the same qsn again and i replied him with the same answer. 15mins later he asked the same qsn again! I got really irritated  plus with the frustration i got with qsn 4, i replied with an irritated tone " What??! Im still at question 4 lah!" To my surprise, he slapped on my hand and said "HEY U CCB! Can you please reply with a nicer tone can anot? I ask you in a nice tone you better reply with a nice tone in return! You know something? If you weren't my friend, i would have punched you at your face given your so fcuked up attitude." I was like WTF, i was really irritated by him and frustrated, cant i reply with an irritated tone? Plus, i shifted my place precisely because i know i would clash with him. Instead he shifted place and sat next to me once again and now this happened.<br><br>Why is it that people can reply me with an irritated tone without getting threatened but poor me have to put up with such attitudes and i cant reply with an irritated tone? Why is it so unfair?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
