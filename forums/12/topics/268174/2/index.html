For many people, falling in love with someone means that that someone has a special quality about him/her that causes attraction.  Why do u feel that he is someone u shouldn't fall for? Qualifications, lifestyle and whatever else u listed are just not reasons enough.<br><br>The real reason, i suspect, is because you think he is no good for u. In the first 2 paragraphs, u already say that u felt that he was not the type of guy u usually go for. That means, he is not the kind of person u have in mind right from the start. Yet, somehow, unwittingly, u have fallen for him. This, plus the fact that you never thought u could love again, cause u to think that u shouldn't love him.<br><br>My advise to you is, search urself deeply. Are u willing to love again? Do you think that this guy is the right one for u? If so, then go for it. Happiness only come once, and it often demands that people take it at the first sight of it. Hesitate, and often happiness slips away.</div>

U might lose yr ex but never lose yrself.<br><br>Seriously,if the new colleague u know is a good chraracter that never look at people of their status while know people by their heart.
