This excuse should do the trick.<br>3) I have no resources/time to woo a girl now. That hurts, and besides I haven't found one I fancy.<br>4) I'm uncomfortable with relationships and all the purported insecurities/questions that it brings, the comfort zone of work seems better.<br><br>Maybe it will give you fresh perspective.</div>

It is fear that robs us of happiness. It is fear that causes us to settle for far less than we are capable of. It is fear that is the root cause of negative emotions, unhappiness and problems in human relationship.<br><br>[b]The only good thing about fear is that it is learned, and because of this, it can be unlearned.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The fear of failure and the fear of rejection are learned responses, programmed into you when you were young. These fears usually set the upper and lower limits of your comfort zone. Because of them, you do enough not to be criticized or rejected on the low side, and you stay well within your limits so you can avoid risk or failure on the high side. Once you slipped into your comfort zone, you stay there, attempting to avoid any feeling of fear or anxiety.<br><br><strong>Your fears hold you back from most of what is possible for you.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The opposite of fear is love, starting with self-love or self esteem. There is an inverse or opposite relationship between self-esteem and fears of all kinds.<br>The more you like yourself, the less you fear failure and rejection.<br>The more you like yourself, the more willing you are to reach out and take the risks that will lead you to success and happiness.<br>The more you like yourself, the more willing you are to take the actions that propel you out of your comfort zone and toward the achievement of your real desires.<br><br>Liking yourself is very healthy. In fact, it is the key to the personal effectiveness and to happy relationships with others. The more you like and respect yourself, the better you perform in everything you do. You are more relaxed and positive. You are more confident about your abilities. You make fewer mistakes. You have more energy and you are more creative.<br><br>Some people have been taught to believe that liking yourself is the same as being conceited or obnoxious. But excalty the opposite is true. Both the "superiority complex", behaving in an arrogant or conceited way, and the "inferiority complex", behaving in a self-deprecating way, are manifestation of low self-esteem, of not liking oneself very much at all.<br><br>People with geniue self-esteem get along easily and well with just about anyone.<br><br>Remember,<br><br>Your self-esteem is largely determined by how lovable and valuable you appear in your own thinking..<br><br>Perhaps the biggest mental roadblocks that you will ever have to overcome are those contained in your self-limiting beliefs. They hold you back by stopping you from even trying. They often cause you to see things that are not true.<br><br>As Henry Ford said,<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>"If you believe that you can do a thing, or if you believe you cannot, in either cases, you are right."</strong></span><br>[/b]</blockquote>wow....u type this all out or quote from somewhere?

Fear of failure is the greatest single obstacle to success in adult life.<br><br>2. Everything that you have know and believe about yourself today, you have learned as a result of what has happened to you since you were an infant. Therefore, if there are elements of your self concept that do not serve your purposes, you can unlearn.<br><br>3. Self esteem is your reputation with yourself and the antithesis of your self limiting beliefs.<br><br>4. Most personality problems are rooted in "love withheld".<br><br>5. Inferiority and superiority are reverse sides of the same coin.<br><br>Actually, if you have noticed, the points i made are pretty hackneyed and i believe you have heard it a thousand times.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>I'm just reminding TS of what she already know and inspire her to do something about applying it.</strong></span></div>
