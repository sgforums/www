Other than that, your other extraneous worries are basically self inflicted and mundane.

And that being the MOST important factor?<br><br>Of course, you won't know if he has feelings for you, but surely, it's a possibility that something could happen. Why eliminate yourself completely even without a struggle? You have already moved on from your previous relationship, so what's holding you back?<br><br>You mean you are only 'entitled' partners with low qualification? Problematic family situation? Penurious background?<br><br>Without those, you can't date man?<br><br>Since you are equally troubled by avoiding and suppression of your emotions, why not try to face them? At least from there, you might actually find an answer to resolve your plight.

The feeling that developed within you is like an involuntary action  ... In my opinion, to be with someone does not require criteria like how much certificate you must have or what's the salary you must have...<br><br>Must fight for your own happiness~ And why will confession breaks up friendship? Don't you think you'll somehow feel relieve after you confess? Okies ...tt's how I feel lahx... Although it requires alot of guts... but I still wanna let that person know...<br><br>Dakara....

I guess if that guy is really that strong, he would prefer someone whom he can learn from.<br><br>I still believe a long term relationship is about compatibility and how each one is able to benefit from one another.<br><br>If you want to flirt with no strings attached, by all means. Even if both of you are together, realistically speaking, in the long term, if he finds that you are not comparable or compatible to him in many ways, there will bound to be a breakup and by then, either he has done with his fun or you have done with yours. But is it worth it?<br><br>So now, what you can do is stop thinking about it and improve yourself so that you are able to improve on your self-esteem.

And I think you like to mope too. Do something constructive. Join a yoga class after work or any exercise classes. Get out with friends and do enjoyable things like having a good dinner, see a show or performance or even join some skill course like taking up art. That will help you to take your mind off him. If you were to be alone, you were bound to keep thinking of him which, seriously won't do you any good.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fear of rejection is one of the major reasons for failure and underachievement in adult life. It is fear that robs us of happiness. It is fear that causes us to settle for far less than we are capable of. It is fear that is the root cause of negative emotions, unhappiness and problems in human relationship.<br><br><strong>The only good thing about fear is that it is learned, and because of this, it can be unlearned.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The fear of failure and the fear of rejection are learned responses, programmed into you when you were young. These fears usually set the upper and lower limits of your comfort zone. Because of them, you do enough not to be criticized or rejected on the low side, and you stay well within your limits so you can avoid risk or failure on the high side. Once you slipped into your comfort zone, you stay there, attempting to avoid any feeling of fear or anxiety.<br><br><strong>Your fears hold you back from most of what is possible for you.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The opposite of fear is love, starting with self-love or self esteem. There is an inverse or opposite relationship between self-esteem and fears of all kinds.<br>The more you like yourself, the less you fear failure and rejection.<br>The more you like yourself, the more willing you are to reach out and take the risks that will lead you to success and happiness.<br>The more you like yourself, the more willing you are to take the actions that propel you out of your comfort zone and toward the achievement of your real desires.<br><br>Liking yourself is very healthy. In fact, it is the key to the personal effectiveness and to happy relationships with others. The more you like and respect yourself, the better you perform in everything you do. You are more relaxed and positive. You are more confident about your abilities. You make fewer mistakes. You have more energy and you are more creative.<br><br>Some people have been taught to believe that liking yourself is the same as being conceited or obnoxious. But excalty the opposite is true. Both the "superiority complex", behaving in an arrogant or conceited way, and the "inferiority complex", behaving in a self-deprecating way, are manifestation of low self-esteem, of not liking oneself very much at all.<br><br>People with geniue self-esteem get along easily and well with just about anyone.<br><br>Remember,<br><br>Your self-esteem is largely determined by how lovable and valuable you appear in your own thinking..<br><br>Perhaps the biggest mental roadblocks that you will ever have to overcome are those contained in your self-limiting beliefs. They hold you back by stopping you from even trying. They often cause you to see things that are not true.<br><br>As Henry Ford said,<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>"If you believe that you can do a thing, or if you believe you cannot, in either cases, you are right."</strong></span><br></div>
