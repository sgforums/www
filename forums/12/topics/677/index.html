            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm a 17 year old girl from a particular JC.<br>I am not ashame to admit that I occasionally masturbate when there is no one at home. However, one day as I was masturbating in my room, I did not hear my brother return home because I was playing the musuc too loud. And when he stepped into the room and saw me masturbating, he had a look of shock in his eyes (of course). He excused himself shyly and didn't say a thing when I went out of my room an hour later. But it was such a horrible feeling to be caught by him!<br><br>The next day when I returned home from school I thought no one was at home because no one resopnded to my calls. I went into my brother's bedroom to borrow a CD of his and what I saw shocked me out of my mind.<br><br>He was in his room, masturbating! He seemed calm when he saw me. I rushed out of his room immediately.<br><br>I'm relaly confused. It seemed as if he intentinoally wanted to be caught. I'm afraid he might have thought that I wanted to be caught masturbating by him, and was just returning the favour. That was not my intent at all. Can someone advice me on what to do? I'm so embarrassed to approach him and ask him myself. What should I do?<br><br>------------------<br>Worried Wreck</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well ... Masterbating is normal ... but letting your brother see it was a mistake ... perhaps you should just tell him you didn't do it on purpose, or else he might even try to take advantage of you one day ... well ... you should have been more careful as to keep yr voulume low ... remember that next time ...<br><br>-AaroN^_^<br><br>PS( try to be more careful next time )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun worry too much, mayb it's not what you think.<br>In the first place, u shouldn't let him see that you r musturbating, really very problematic now. Think the best solution is to act blur and b extremely careful next time, make sure there's no one b4 u do it, ok? Better dun make the matter worse by asking your brother, remember, b extremely, extremely careful next time and dun go into your brother's rm only when necessary...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just like what many have said, its normal for teenages to masturbate ..... absolutely normal. However, u may like to consider taking extra precaution while masturbating, such as locking the door etc ......<br><br>Frankly speaking yr story sounds a bit incredible but then guess these things do happen. Anyway, dun think anything is gonna happen cos most probably yr brother will just keep it to himself...... he wun possibly go and tell yr mum abt it......<br><br>Guess our main concern now is what's in yr brother mind. I am scare that he might imagine you as the partner when he is masturbating, which is defitely not healthy at all........ or maybe u should just have a talk with him. Anyway pls pls do not do anything wrong cos this is serious stuff.....<br><br>Nevertheless, hope that everything will turn out fine with u....... n pls be careful, and dun ever do the wrong thing.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>Would like to tell you that whanking out is normal among all of us. Please lock the door if you have the longing to do it. However, I advice you to stop it if possible. It is not really healthy in the long run, sex is for love, reproduction, not for pure satisfaction. Nature has made it such that sex is most enjoyable with a partner of the opposite sex, if you really want to enjoy yourself, wait till you're old enough to get married and you know what! Otherwise, you should try to stop yourself if possible. If you do it so bloody often, it won't be that electrifying anymore....trust me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there is a better solution for you.<br>1) You are embarrassed to face him, but that does not restrict you to communicate with him. Write him a letter to explain the situation to him and bear in mind not to embarrass him too. =)<br><br>2) Your brother's actions may have suggestive effect on you. Probably both of you have a high sexual drive. There is nothing wrong with masturbation, but should he make any suggestions like masturbating TOGETHER, please be firm and say a NO.<br><br>3) Things are complicated now, do not make it even more complicated. Try to understand your body and be kind to it. Engage in healthy sports like jogging, basketball, badminton etc.<br><br>4) Smile, u can never know how much effect it can do to your life<br><br>PS: Probably your brother is shy bout the entire thing also, probably u should take the initiative to talk to him bout it too .. ... through letters/e~mails/notes/sqeeze a note in his bag ...<br><br>------------------<br>(_|_) (_\_) (_|_) (_/_) (_|_)<br>------------------------------<br>Open your WINDOWS and smell the fresh air!! **pOoT**</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As kids, my brother and I, not unlike most other siblings I suspect, played "doctor", or some other game where "you show me yours and I'll show you mine". These games soon lead to "you touch mine and I'll touch yours". The little "adventures" usually happened in the course of everyday play together, &amp; the location ranged anywhere from a bedroom, a garage or tree house.<br><br>As adolescents, still learning about our own bodies, there were frequent "show-and-tell" learning opportunities. As the lessons advanced, they became mutual masturbation sessions. Heavy petting and to oral sex followed quickly thereafter. Vaginal intercourse was too scary. We knew the consequences . . . a pregnancy . . . with mom and dad discovering our little secret.<br><br>By then, those sex games of our youth were replaced by backrubs with wandering hands, or wagers (over just about anything) or a barter system (the earliest form of prostitution)or by dares, (when we were both really horny at the same time). The stakes or payments were some sort of sexual act for the winner (and loser?).<br><br>There really was no regards that what we were doing was "incest" . . . it was just a word meaning "family sex". There was no immorality or taboo attached to it, it was just a word. We figured it was something that most siblings did and never talked about. Besides, it seemed so natural. We had been the best of friends our entire lives, nudity was common in our household, and it was incredible fun!<br><br>As "full-grown" adults, our relationship has remained rock-solid. Unlike our inattentive spouses, my brother and I still give each other therapeutic back-rubs. At times they become very sensual, and occasionally we've found ourselves, well, sort of naked. Sometime guilt and cognitive dissonance would mess with our emotions, based strictly on our collectively being unfaithful to our spouses. During these "rationalization rounds" we'd talk about the human instincts that drew us together, and the fond memories of our innocent, incestuous past. The theoretical positions taken ranged from the moral to the libertarian perspectives on the issue of consensual adult incest. We agreed that our having spouses was the only issue making us feel bad about these sensuous moments.<br><br>When recently, through divorces, our "having spouses" was no longer an issue, and we found ourselves in multiple coital positions and living together in her house. Our friends, parents, and former spouses, believe our living arrangement to be based on convenience and financial efficiency, and are glad we did not rebound into other marriages.<br><br>We know better.<br><br>When my brother was surfing the 'Net and came across some of the many incest forums in cyberspace, we realized we are not the only ones to engage in incest, nor to even have similar living arrangements.<br><br>So, as a creative outlet and supportive tool, we combined my writing ability with his computer skills and created a web site for those, like us, who are actively involved in incestuous relationships or are at least stimulated by the thought.<br><br>There are enhanced photo-essays, hundreds of pictures, an incestuous family's documentary, a club, and even an Incest Toy Store where you can get the entire "TABOO!" movie series.<br><br>Enjoy, and unite!<br><br>------------------<br>Closet Consanguinal Crusader</div>
