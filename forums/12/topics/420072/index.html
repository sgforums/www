              <p>I was abused during sec 2 nothing sexual, my uncle took the opportunity to beat me and emotionally abuse me. it al cumalted when he attacked me for two hours and beat me up and calling IMH on me telling them a fitious tale. I was diagnosed bipolar and spent a year in IMH , he injected something into me in 2002 and my mom sent me all ovber the world doing intravenously injection with many doctors in australlia i stopped school at that time.</p>
              <p>im now 20+ just finished my army pes e, and I begged my mother and father to bequeth something to me in a will when they die. My father is married with another women who constantly pecks him to not give any money to me.and he isn the kind who is emotionall immature and a miser. he will cave in to pressure not to give me anything.when I told my father my uncle bullied and abused me , he said he will just "pray" for me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That leaves my mother, who i believe is being controlled somehow into not giving me anything by my uncle.my uncle is a high flying executive m, with an mba from UCLA.in the invesment industry.</p>
              <p>I have tried working , working in government and toysaurus as floor staff packing toys.</p>
              <p>I am mentally ill and I cannot soically intreact or work very well as I get depressed when alone when assigend stuff to do.My pay for aug 2010 was $600.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My uncle has an iron hold on my family, he is very inflential..</p>
              <p>My family wants to send me to study in new zealand, but ithink the 75 k fees and 60k living expenses will be better spent into a one room or two room flat I can stay</p>
              <p>what can I do?</p>

              <p>You can interact with pretty gal meh??? but you interact with me very well leh, dun bullshit lah.</p>
              <p>However, you are right on certain points, TS, why buy a house, go new zealand  and buy a house better, like Yi Ming, he also go australia and buy horses, same same botal head and also very rich lor.</p>
              <p>In life, sometime you dun hv to be smart and clever, just do something out of ordinary can also make you rich and famous. As for your Uncle, bring him often to my pub, i can do the rest to smoothen him and not long, you will take over him</p>
