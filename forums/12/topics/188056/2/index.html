Do you really want a promotion/pay increase?Is this what you hoped for?<br><br><span style="color: red;">abit abit lah, need to upgrade to the next level already, current job too simple already... no challenge</span><br><br>if you really wished for a promotion, is this end up what you expected? like you mentioned "10% plus only", did you expect more? And how responsibility increase? is it balnaced with your pay increase? Maybe the pay increase is very little when the job increase is a lot?<br><br><span style="color: red;">pay increase by 10% but work responsibility doubled.. but it's already quite high already for SG standard.... but here not very high just ok ok</span><br><br>Or maybe you want more power and authority in the company, rather than pay increase, but after the promotion, you are still the same in terms of what you can do in the company? mabye you still cant boss people around yet? <span style="color: red;">dun need that i am already bossing ppl around previously.. and not bossing actually.. ppl are seeking for my advice so i just help lor.. they want my bossing..i will be happy to leave them alone</span><br><br>In the first place, do you like your job? if you dont like your job, or you dont like your colleague, dont like your job environment, etc. You wont be very happy no matter what you achieve in job which you dont like in the first place.<br><br><span style="color: red;">like very challenge but also very xiong... tiring.</span><br><br>You said you have "1 lover, 1 sex partner and 1 dunno how to define one", maybe it's time for you to find someone to get married? That way you will find more meaning in life, feel that you work to support a family, work for someone who's important to you(your wife and kids), not for yourself only, not giving your hard earned money to some women that wont be with you forever. But this is really up to you, perhaps you really dont want to get married yet.<br><br><span style="color: red;">cannot help it that one is married and the other got bf and getting married soon too, i wont mind marrying them one..seen like all the good gal are taken already..... i dun mind to settle down... but do i really have to go SDU? sighz</span><br><br>Do you have real friends to share feelings with? maybe most people around you, like those colleague who arrange party for you, can you share real feelings with them? or are they just ppl that you need to social with for the sake that they work with you? In my case, if i have achieved something big, throwing a big party wont make me happier than asking few real good frens out and share the good new with them.<br><br><span style="color: red;">not much fren here now...that's one thing I have to give up when i took up this job.</span><br><br>Hope you bother to read such long a post, and hope it helps too.<br><br><span style="color: red;">thanks.</span><br><br></div></blockquote>[</div>
