              <p>When asking and seeking, I find my life sucks after I make a prank out of my own marriage.</p>
              <p>It all started 4 years ago when I started to immersed in chatroom due to boredom.  I get hooked by having to know girls and trying to search for romanace.  Got to know this lady in the chatroom and we started to chat on the internet and then on the phone.  It was like talking non-stop during my office hours and the chat went non-stop till I returned home.  We chat all things like, works, life at home, children and etc, it was almost a decade after I had such feeling of courtship again (the phone billed was not cheap due to IDD). It was after one month of such event that I decided to make a trip up North to visit her.</p>

              <p>Well, I went up North to seek her and we met.  We actually fall in love on first sight...not through web cam.  We spent time talking and having fun throughout the few days and I did not recalled that we have any sleep for more than 5 hours throughout the 6 days.</p>
              <p>It was heart breaking when I returned back to Singapore, parting was painful.  After I came back, she told me she will tried her best to visit me in Singapore.  It was after 3 months that her VISA was approved and she made her trips down to Singapore.  Again we have a great time together and it was even harder for the parting.</p>
              <p>Well this kind of flying relationship carried on for 2 years plus.  In between, there was other events that happened, such as 3rd parties involvement, families not happy on this relationship and many others.  The distance relationship was difficult to maintain and it was not only costly but time spent together was not enough to really to get to know each other in-depth.</p>

              <p>It was agony to have this kind of relationship, so we decided to get married last year.  We did talked about money and housing issue, I told her that if we ere to get married, we will have to stay at a rented place and buying a HDB will need to be planned.  Other than that, it will be my income after paying the rent and other matters, such as car loan, insurance, etc, will be limited.  She assured me that she would help me out on this as much as possible.  Honestly I was not very sure about the married life as during courtship, love is everything, but once married, it all bought down to living expenses $$$.</p>
              <p>Since she assured me, we carry out the plan and ROM last year and have a small gathering with friends.  During the pre and post marriage, she was unhappy throughout as she wanted to buy nice dresses for the ROM and it all cost few hundreds a piece, and I was trying to reason with her that the dress cannot be a causal wear hence do not have to buy so many.  For the dinner, she wanted the best dishes to serve to friends and relative, I told her it will be costly and we should saved up as we still need money to survive down the road.</p>
              <p>I know I should not restrict her however all the calculation were negativefor me.  I am duly worried, but I had no choice as I was in love with her.</p>

              A priori life has no meaning  - change the life into living and the meaning or the quest/search is absolutely redundant!
              
              Has anyone met life, can anyone meet life? Living is the ''real'' thing, that is. for eg, bathing, reading, loving, running - this is existential relevance. In the very process one is creating and yet not disconnected. The world (existence) was never out there somewhere, it has and always has been and will always is IN us.
              
              Sadly we tend to confuse psycholigical/social relevancy or equate it with living!

              <p>Apologised for the disruption.  Note sure why after I post, it did not shown in the thread.  </p>
              <p>Anyway, after the ROM and small customery, I applied long term VISA for her.  She actually wanted to return to her country to see her family, however she was required to stay till the VISA is approved.  There was small quarrel now and then, this was because she complained that she was bored and I did not have time to accompany her like previously when she was in town.  </p>
              <p>She started to go online to chat with friends and as I know, most of them are guys.  I was quite unhappy but tried to swallow since I can't accompany her all the time.  There was chance where I saw her message to the guys stating that she was single, came over to Singapore to work and living with her friend. I asked her why she did not speak the truth, her answered was that men do not like to be friend with her, if they know she is married &lt; T_T &gt;</p>
              <p>2 months past and she finally got her LT VISA and she said she wanted to go back to visit her family.  I can't stop her and asked her to return early.  When she was back home, we do keep in touch once a day for around 15 mins.  2 weeks past and I asked her why she has not make her booking for the return trip, she said she wanted to stay longer.  I told her I need her too as we are newly married.  After pleading for 1-2days, she accepted and make her booking.  When she came back, she was quite unhappy saying that I did not give her enough time to spend with her family....sianz</p>
              <p>Life goes back to normal, she again start to go online and complained that I sleep early (12am) and did not accompany her (her usual timing is around 2-3am and wake up at 11am, while I woke up at 8am for work).</p>
              <p>She again complained the boredom and I did not love her as much as before.  Leaving her at home alone and not give her enough attention. One month after her returned, we had a big quarrel and she packed everything and said she wanted to go back for good. She book her own ticket and went back to her family.  I did not stop her because I am already so tired everyday have to worry about her, hearing her complained, work stress, etc.</p>

              <p>Yes, I agreed! Courtship is not LOVE, is just having good times with each others.  While Marriage will need $$$ to ensure stability.  LOVE came after Marriage where one will helps to build the other up. </p>
              <p>Between, as there is a Chinese saying, Men turn bad when they have $$$, Women got $$$ after they turn bad.</p>
