            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hey all, anybody else has similar experiences before? Im currently studying for A levels in a jc... Cant call it a top jc... Anyway, im jc2 now and i have never been like the top student or anything since Jc1, ive always sort of been floating in the middle and stuff... And i really feel demoralised, beaten down and just upset in general after prelims. It really sucks knowing that you screwed every single prelim paper up and you just cant do anything about it. Worst thing is that im surrounded with people who are really smart... I feel that im really going to do real badly for As eventually and i really have no alternative path because i dont have an O level cert! Although prelim results are nt out yet but im pretty sure i know how its going to turn out. And it sucks even more that im placed in one of the top classes (by accident or something) and every single one of them are like doing fine and surviving. And i feel that im strugglin real bad and i dont even belong in that class... I really dont know what to do right now. Im caving under pressure and i feel like a total failure... Any advice...? Apart from chiding me and telling me i should have worked hard and how i should have put in more effort... I really did put in much more effort in jc compared to secondary school but i feel that no amount of effort is ever enough! I dont know... 8 weeks till the start of As and im drowning.</p></div>

              <p>I experienced exactly what is happening to you when I was in JC2 . Well,I had too many activities going on and I neglected my studies totally .</p>
              <p>So what I did was that I totally disregarded my Prelims and also my friends who were always talking about which course to take in NUS or NTU . I just focused on my strongest subjects which was mathematics and economics . I am not sure if you have problems with Chinese but I totally flung it .</p>
              <p>I asked my cousins in the Uni at that time what was the cut off scores and I knew then my only hope was an overseas university . So I checked what was the entry scores needed to get in there and I sat down and worked on it .</p>
              <p>However, my results did not turn out that well but the JC was willing to accept me back to re-take my A levels . I re-took and and did so much better . But because I flung my chinese , I still went overseas to study .</p>
              <p>If your parents can afford to send you overseas , go for it . It is an experience you can never have in this live time.</p>
              <p>So you know what to do..... dont be bothered about those around you cause they care less of whether you do well or not . Just focus on where you want to go and start today  working on your best subjects first and then scoring As for them ........</p>

              Its understandable why you are feeling this way.. everyone seems to be doing better, nth gets in your head, time is running out.. the pressure is crushing. Get past feeling demoralized. Pick yourself up and focus on the important things to study. 
              
              Anyway I wanted to say don't be too hung up about results. I literally flopped my As. I remember thinking to myself, 'this is the end'. I thought I needed to retake or start a dip again or just be stuck with a low paying job for the rest of my life. But it led me down a different path. I have a first class honours now and a job that I love. Of course please still study ok hahaha. I'm just saying it is not the end like I thought it to be. Jiayou k ðŸ˜ƒ
