              <p>Hi everyone! I just want to share my previous experience when i pay a visit to a clinic.</p>
              <p>I was sufferring from severe diarrhea and was feeling extremely unwell. It was too cold inside, thus i sat outside waiting for my turn to be call. I was alone and shivering. </p>
              <p>Ten minutes passed, i started to feel the numb on my legs and hands. Slowly, all my muscles starts to cramp up, even my tongue. I couldn't speak at all! I was hyperventilating. I couldn't wait no more. I know that i will definitely pass out before i get to see the doctor. </p>
              <p>So i tried to get awaressness from the people around me by making noise. I couldn't pronounce a single word clearly. There were 3 people outside waiting for their turn to be call. I got their eye contacts and their attention. However, they CHOSE to IGNORE me! One of them even chose to walk away from me and pretend that she did not witness what was going on with me. </p>
              <p>At the instance, i felt so angry and perplexed. Why? Why is Singaporean so emotionless? Why can't they give a helping hand? Why can't they feel the pain that i'm going through? I hated them! </p>
              <p>Can anybody please tell me why? <br><br>If you have similar stories, please share. </p>
              <p>*PS: I'm a pure Singaporean myself. </p>
