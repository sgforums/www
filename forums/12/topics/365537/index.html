              <p>Let the time and distance be the test of yours and her love for each other. If situation and circumstances changes, then it would be better to be just friends and spare each other the heartache.</p>
              <p>Love is not possession or an issue you can force upon others or even enforce it, but setting the one you love free. If she returns back to you, then you will know her love is true. If she does not return or returned changed, you will have to decide what to do.</p>
              <p>Communicate with her on phone or mails just to keep in touch would be good enough.

              <p>You know her only for one week, and now you want her to be your other half for the rest of your life. Now you are worried about her being unfaithful to you, hence you are going to philipines to try and bind her to you.</p>
              <p>It is up to you, but there are a lot of things to consider about. Once you go there, you will not only be seeing her, but also her family. Are you prepared for that? And also, what will your family think about when their son told them that he is going to philipines to look for his gf?</p>
              <p>Adding on, what are you going to do when you go over and see her? Just say hi? Are you going to stay with her family or are you going to find your own lodgings?</p>
              <p>Putting aside the fact that many forummers have said, you are lusting over her, there is also the fact that you don't seem to be really planning ahead. You feel that you really need her a lot, and thus you forget a lot about the basic things which you need to and should have consider.</p>
              <p>This is not a voting thread to let you make a choice whether to go over to meet her or not, but I will still strongly advice you to think through it thoroughly before making any rash decision. Ultimately, it is still your choice.</p>

              <p>A week ago, I got to know this philippines girl in my work place
              and she's from a attachment in her school from her country and the
              things is that she has flew back to philippines just yesterday
              morning, I really miss
              her.                                                     </p>
              <p>Before she return home, I even ask her to be my gf and she
              agrees and she even told me that she'll return to S'pore in Nov
              after she graduated to look for me. I don't know should I wait
              or fly to philippines and look for her myself, she had gave me
              her address in philippines.</p>
              <p>From now till Nov, it's like 5 months away and I can predict the
              feelings might faded away and no doubt that she can go look for
              another guy. Forumers, do you think I should wait for fly there
              myself?</p>

              <p>woah.. one week nia. tho time is not an element to judge.</p>
              <p>For now, just contact her using msn/webcam/phone calls. This is to maintain the relationship and keep an update on each other's life. Dont tell me you dont have her msn or something. Cuz u cant expect no contacts during this 5-6 months right and then expect her to pop out in November?</p>
              <p>Dont fly there. Stay here.</p>
