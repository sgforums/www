              <p>Lust : To have an intense or obsessive desire, especially one that is sexual.</p>
              <p>Not sayin that lust cannot turn to love.. it can. But in short time frame.. it's more likely to be lust. Because "love".. needs time to develop, more an indept admiration than superficial heat throbbing .</p>
              <p>Anyway.... Philippines is not that far away lah.. just gooooo... you've got nuttin to lose , yes ? But please do not just suddenly show up at her house lah, doing that will scare the heck out of her , ya knw what I mean ?</p>
              <p>Good luck.. and let the adventure begin !!!</p>

              <p>it is not a bad idea to go over to philippines and pay her a visit but i think it is also a good idea to seek her permission first before u go, dont just go like that.</p>
              <p>if she is serious about the relationship i think she will welcome u to go, else if she say no then i think u have to respect her and better  dont go.</p>

              <p>You should forget about her if you dont see long-term feasibility.</p>
              <p>In the short run, one of the biggest obstacles is location. Either she move here, or you move there.</p>

              <p>A week ago, I got to know this philippines girl in my work place
              and she's from a attachment in her school from her country and the
              things is that she has flew back to philippines just yesterday
              morning, I really miss
              her.                                                     </p>
              <p>Before she return home, I even ask her to be my gf and she
              agrees and she even told me that she'll return to S'pore in Nov
              after she graduated to look for me. I don't know should I wait
              or fly to philippines and look for her myself, she had gave me
              her address in philippines.</p>
              <p>From now till Nov, it's like 5 months away and I can predict the
              feelings might faded away and no doubt that she can go look for
              another guy. Forumers, do you think I should wait for fly there
              myself?</p>
