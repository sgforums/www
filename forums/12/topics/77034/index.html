            <div class='col-md body'>Read on.........and u be the judge for the moral of the story.......... Have a pleasant day ahead.<br><br>*********************************************************************************************************<br>One fine day,an old couple around the age of 70, walks into a lawyer's<br>office. Apparently, they are there to file a divorce. Lawyer was very<br>puzzled, after having a chat with them, he got their story....<br><br>This couple had been quarreling all their 40 over yrs of marriage, nothing<br>ever seems to go right.They hang on coz of their children, afraid that it<br>might affect their up-bringing. Now, all their children have already grown<br>up, have their own family, there's nothing else the old couple have to<br>worry about, all they wanted is to lead their own life free from all these<br>years of unhappiness from their marriage, so both agree on a divorce.<br><br>Lawyer was having a hard time tryin to get the papers done, because he<br>felt that after 40 years of marriage at the age of 70, he couldn't<br>understand why the old couple would still wants a divorce...while they<br>were signin the papers, the wife told the husband.."I really love u, but i<br>really can't carry on anymore,i'm sorry.." "its o.k, i understand.." said<br>the husband. Lookin at this, the lawyer suggested a dinner together, just<br>3 of them,wife thought, why not, since they r still gonna be frends.<br><br>At the dining table, there was a silence of awkwardness. The first dish<br>was roasted chicken, immediately, the old man took the drumstick for the<br>old lady , "take this, its your favourite."<br><br>Lookin at this, the lawyer thought maybe theres still a chance, but the<br>wife was frowning when she answer." This is always the problem, u always<br>think so highly of yourself, never thought about how i feel, don't u know<br>that i hate drumsticks?"<br><br>Little did she know that, over the years, the husband have been trying all<br>ways to please her, little did she know that drumsticks was the husband's<br>favourite.<br><br>Little did he know that she never thought he understand her at all, little<br>did he know that she hates drummsticks even though all he wants is the<br>best for her.<br><br>That nite, both of them couldn't sleep, toss and turn, toss and<br>turn...after hours, the old man couldn't take it anymore, he knows that he<br>still loves her, and he can't carry on life without her, he wants her<br>back, he wants to tell her, he is sorry, he wanted to tell her "i love<br>u".<br><br>He picks up the phone, started dialing her number....ringing never<br>stops..he never stop dialing....<br><br>On the other side,she was sad, she couldn't understand how come after all<br>these years, he still doesn't understand her at all, she loves him alot,<br>but she just can't take it anymore....phone's<br>ringing, she refuses to answer, knowing that its him..."what's the point<br>of talking now that its over...i have ask for it and now i wanna keep it<br>this way, if not i will lose face.."she thought...still ringing...she has<br>decided to pull out the cord...<br><br>Little did she remember, he has heart problems...<br><br>The next day, she received news that he had passed away...she rushed down<br>to his apartment, saw his body, lying on the couch still holding on to the<br>phone...he had a heart attack when he was still trying to get thru' her<br>phone line....<br><br>As sad as she could be...she will have to clear his belongings...when she<br>was lookin thru the drawers, she saw this insurance policy, dated from the<br>day they got married, beneficiary of course is her...together in that<br>file, theres this note... "to my dearest wife, by the time u r reading<br>this, i'm sure i'm no longer around, i bought this policy for u, thou the<br>amount is only $100k, i hope it will be able to help me continue my<br>promise that i have made when we got married, i might not be around<br>anymore, i want this amount of money to continue taking care of u, just<br>like the way i will if i could have live longer..i want u to know i will<br>always be around, by your side...i love u"<br><br>Tears flowed like river......<br><br>"When u love someone, let them know... u never know what will happen the<br>next min....<br><br>learn to build a life together...learn to love each other.......... for<br>who they are..not what they are..."<br></div>
