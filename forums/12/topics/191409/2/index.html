Learn to release yourself from this tight incarcerated emotional jail and relax your soul. You can only allow spring to breeze through your life ONLY if you allow the bitter winter to conclude. It is a trade off - with your constant refusal to grow, move on and to brood on the unnecessary setbacks in life, what sort of 'you' can you envision yourself to be?<br><br>Cranky old woman that imprisoned herself to her past?<br><br>This is the root of problem - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>your inability to understand the circumstances of the past that enables you to pursue a better future. Instead, you use circumstances of the past to degenerate your future</strong></span>.<br><br>So what if you have hurt someone in the past? Have it occurs to you that it must have happen so that the person you hurt will grow from his injury and you grow from your action? If you do not see life as perpetual learning, you will grow to fear learning. To fear learning is fear to attempt and when you fear to attempt, your mind creates 'reasons' to avoid attempting.<br><br>In this way, you have failed to extract the exact lesson/s your karmic relationship wants you to comprehend and stagnation follows shortly.<br><br>It is OK to explore your soul and view all those unwanted past memories etched into our subconscious. You got to nurse whatever wounds you had previously and not packed them, like boxes, into the back of your mind and pretended that they never exist, for this idealism will shatter when realism slipped into your mind.<br><br>Open this 'skeleton in the cupboard' and face your nightmare directly. Challenge them psychologically and reflect upon the things you feared. Your mind may scream a warning as you attempt to retrieve those memories, but seriously, it isn't as bad as you think it would be. Be honest with yourself, with your past and be accepting on what that has happen.<br><br>You will come and understand that Love wants to teach you something; tap on higher wisdom to know what is it. Embrace the cosmic lesson and you could liberate yourself from being aloof when you discover new courage to steer you away from negativity and reborn into a better being.<br><br>Restore yourself; like Narnia, this winter is too lengthy. Seek to end your torment today.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fact that you posted here shows you aren't as cold/detached as you think you are.<br>You care about what you are feeling and you want to get out of it, it shows you want to change.<br>So that's a good start  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  You don't seem to be a bad communicator, and you aren't that far from what you want.<br>I'm like you in many ways, I'm a girl and also cannot connect with people easily, what I am and what people see me as are very different. So you're not alone. Well the only advice I can give is, find something that gives you a sense of self-confidence, like maybe taking long walks, or just doing something that you love the most, like some activity. Spend time with yourself and learn to love yourself, because it's pretty hard to come by people who will understand this kind of situation.<br>Eventually though you will find some people who will understand you properly.<br>So just hang on. You're not alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haiyou... You care too much about what people think of you liao lar... SOTONG! It's good to care, but too much hor, really too.. cheem. First post very poetic leh..<br><br>*switches back to english* The first thing, is not to think so much. Be happy! I'm sure you are still a young teenage girl and have a great deal of life ahead of you. Maybe you could go volunteering at some elderly services somewhere? Or SPCA? Or children's society. Children are just so adorable, they give out smiles so easily.. and they are carefree and naive. They give out smiles so freely... In this society, we have become rather kiasu leh... Elderly are nice too, but some of the males... =_= Cheekopek. Pets too. Lovely...<br><br>This could serve to be rather therapic (How to spell?)... Theraphy? Therapy? Theraupic? Therapic?</div>
