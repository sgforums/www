Change is never easy, so it would be best to take it slowly. Open up abit, posting in this forum and getting to know more people is a good start.<br><br>Hmm.. I guess all of us have some past that we would rather not bring up, so maybe looking forward is the way to go.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I get very confused when a new person come along. I feel bad when i push the person away but i will feel worse what if i hurt the person. Cos i did hurt someone before.. it just scarey to hurt unintentionally especially someone u care. Mayb i care too much.. maybe i shouldnt care which end up me being aloof and pretending that everything is alright..<br><br>i try to step out of the comfort zone being a volunteer, joing these and there. However, i still can't open myself up. In the end, i just hide myself with a smile but inside me im just nervous, insecure and in pain.</div>
