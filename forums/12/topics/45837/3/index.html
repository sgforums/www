I'm new here and I'm seeking helkp myself. But one thing for sure. Don behave dis way. My gf say I too fierce and break up wif me. I was so hurt but not by the breakup but by the fact I gave her the cahnce to use my anger as excuse. Its really my fault so now I suffer trying to rectify it. You are different. You show care and concern for her. You wanted to shower her wif ur love but she rather go back to the jerk. You should not be sad. Go laugh it off and look for a better gal. If she so insensible then you wif her also no pt right? This is provided her bf really didn't mean to 2x her or he explained his actions wif a valid reason.<br><br>But don look back.
