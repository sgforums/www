When you truely love someone, you would want her to be happy, even if she is gonna be with someone else. In your case, this someone else is a jerk and please go and bash him up. Even in the end she doesn't chose you if they do break up, I hope you remain true to her and that you will wish her all the best from the bottom of your heart. Dun do any things to hurt her like presurizing her to like you in return for the things you have done. Leave the "return" things to her to think, alone. I remember a song which sings "if you really like the person, you have to let her go. If she returns in time, you knows she really love you" (or something like that).<br><br>Good luck to both of you. Remember, there are more things in life than just love. When you are unhappy, dun just sit there thinking how miserable you are.
