Since you CHOOSE to chase a girl who is attached - indirectly and subconsciously you <strong>CHOOSE to ACCEPT the high RISK involved</strong> in failing. So when you did fail your attempt - in this way, basically you do not have the right to comment/blame/etc because nobody put a knife to your throat and make you chase her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You can't stop yourself from loving someone - but you certainly can stop yourself from attempting to going after someone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

To her perhaps you're just an irritating salesman...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Nobody's really at fault here... At least not till now... And you should be GRATEFUL for that...? You're just a HUMAN, not a GOD.... You can't EXPECT to change EVERYTHING.... Once in a while you'll just have to learn to let go...
