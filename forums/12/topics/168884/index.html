(of course by saying this i m giving the guy the benefit of the doubt) he might really still be in the phase of cleansing his system.. probably give him a few more months to see if things get better.. at least if your friend is still ok with wanting to give that friendship serious consideration..<br><br>if his definition of friendship is so way off and even not wanting to acknowledge the existence of the other.. then.. its still not too late to give it up and move on..</div>

If not why should she care so much?<br><br>2) The guy is doing something he is always doing by breaking promise so please do not place him and the guys outside.
