              Suppose to be divorce but he told me before one year, married can be cancel so don't have to go through divorce process. Funny right, already married everybody had known we are husband n wife before then suddenly he become bachelor again.
              
              Its really unfair to me, but what to do? Just accept it and learn from this big mistake.

              <p>You are feeling sorry for yourself because you held on to your traditional beliefs from your country.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the wedding is not a big deal, it's only a show newly weds put on for the sake of their parents' " face value".</p>
              <p>Wedding dinners are for honoring parents, not so much for the wedded couple.</p>
              <p> Most couples in Singapore are already living a married life BEFORE the wedding ceremony.</p>
              <p> Of course it's unfair.. TO YOU....  you thought you sold your virginity to a rich guy. Unfortunately, in Singapore, virginity is not worth as much as you think. </p>
              <p>It's like a merchant thinking his shiny stone is worth a fortune. But the buyers don't think so because it's just a piece of polished rock !</p>

              <p>For most couple after marry will have a happy married life but
                          not mine. Really regret with this married but what can I do, I
                          can’t turn back time. I feel like what happen to me is unfair. Now
                          I really need an opinion about what I have done. But you need to
                          take time to read my long story to understand what happen to
                          us.</p>
              <p>I was being introduce by my brother in law sister to her friend.
                          This guy is a fatty guy and not handsome but they told me he is
                          really a good guy, hard working, can say a success business man
                          (since he own a big house at spore), and very respect to parents.
                          After meet once, he start to message me and then call me, and we
                          become close friend.</p>
              <p>For me, live until age thirty haven’t marry still ok but above
                          that become a worry for me and my parents too. I scare to start a
                          relationship, afraid being cheat or they just want to have fun.
                          Hear and saw unhappy married life make me scare too.</p>
              <p>Many friends and relative shock after know that my husband so
                          fat. He is more than double of my weight. And many may think that I
                          want him because he is rich, own big house. I can’t stop them. For
                          me, as long as he is a good guy, don’t like drink, don’t like
                          gambling, hard working, responsible, respect and can take care of
                          me. Its already enough, no one is perfect in this world. I as women
                          also have to understand myself. If he is better than that then will
                          be good.</p>
              <p>Everything goes well. He show me that he and his family
                          relationship good. He and his family all also very good to me and
                          my family but now no more.</p>
              <p>After married, I just known that husband is a gambler. He and
                          his family relation is actually no good. Maybe his father want him
                          to faster get married because his father also already give up of
                          him. His father then told me that his son have been banded from
                          spore casino. Can u all imagine what will u respond when u hear
                          this? This is really a cheat to me start from the time we known
                          each other.</p>
              <p>On the fifth day after married, he told me he have meeting so go
                          out very early around 7 o’clock. The next day also the same told me
                          he have meeting. Then on weekend he told me his friend have a
                          resort at Batam and ask me to go with him so we go. At ferry he
                          just told me that actually we are going to ship casino. I don’t
                          know why he have to bring me there, have to let me saw he
                          gambling.</p>
              <p>On the 12th day after married, again he told me have meeting.
                          This time I already feel something wrong with him. At noon I try to
                          call him but no answer, then his office girl call me ask where is
                          he? They said they can’t contact him that’s why ask me. Until night
                          he still not come back home, I can’t contact him and his father
                          (that time his father is on travel) I don’t know he go gambling or
                          got car accident. Nothing I can do except crying. I don’t know what
                          mistake I have done so he leave me like that. Then I call my
                          parents and let my parents know what had happen.</p>
              <p>My parents then call my brother in law sister ask her are they
                          known this guy well? Are they known whether he like gambling or
                          not? And the answer my father get is they are friends but they not
                          24 hours together.</p>
              <p>At around 11 or 12 o’clock I just got message from husband told
                          me that he is ok ask me don’t have to worry, he just miss the ferry
                          and will only came back the next morning. At this time suicide
                          really come to my mind.</p>
              <p>The reason for gambling is because he have spend a lot for a
                          wedding dinner party at 5 star hotel. I never ask him for those lux
                          party, why he have to spend it he not afford. What can I do is only
                          forgive him and give him a chance. And I told him that when his
                          father back from traveling, I have to let him know this. He beg me
                          not to do so and I said sorry I have to for ur good. And when I
                          told his father, I heard a lot of bad habits about him from his
                          father. Its really a very complicate, need a lot of time to explain
                          it. Father said his son bad things and son told me his father bad
                          things. For me I don’t care and don’t want to get involved in their
                          family problem. As long as husband is a good guy, responsible,
                          respect and can take care of me is already enough to me. He call my
                          parents ask for apologize of what he have done. Apologize is
                          accepted.</p>
              <p>Again after one month married, on our first anniversary of
                          proposing date. He told me that he feel no good and need to have a
                          rest so we cancel go out for celebrating. Suddenly at night he told
                          me he have to go out, go fish port. I just trust him, he go out
                          until the next morning around 11 o’clock just came back. In the
                          morning his father told me that I have been cheat by husband again.
                          Where got people go fish port until this time ( its around 9
                          o’clock) haven’t came back? I just keep quite have no answer
                          because I also don’t know well anything about singapore (I am a
                          foreigner). From that I starting to check what he did, his phone,
                          follow him where ever he go ( as suggest from his father too). I do
                          all this for his good too, although he might feel annoying. During
                          the time going out/ follow him, I found out that he seldom want to
                          care of his job, seldom want to stay at office. When I ask, he told
                          me now business is low so what for stay at office, must go out look
                          for order. And I never again. They we often go out visit his
                          friends, meet up with his friend, pay his gambling debts and
                          sometimes meet client.</p>
              <p>Again, he told me that he want to meet friend and because I also
                          have to do house thing then I can’t follow him. After 11 o’clock
                          night haven’t come back,call him he said he is at his food store.
                          At 12 o’clock haven’t come back, 2 o’clock haven’t come back, call
                          him many time but he no answer my call then at 4 o’clock morning I
                          ask his sister bring me to his food store and I can find he or his
                          car at there. His sister then send me back home. Again what can I
                          do is only cry, it is not possible to wake up his father and let
                          his father known. I feel really sad, wanna commit suicide, but I
                          still love my parents and I remember my parents told me no matter
                          what happen to you, here is still your home, you have parents,
                          don’t do stupid things, you can come back anytime.</p>
              <p>In the morning, his father knock my door ask me am I ok and ask
                          me to go down have breakfast. In this situation where got mood to
                          eat. I just stay at my room never let my parents know, then his
                          father ask my brother in law sister come to pick me. I don’t want,
                          I don’t them to get involved in this problem anymore since they
                          said they are not 24hour with him, say this married is because we
                          decide not forcing by them, they are just introduce. I also don’t
                          know why my father in law have to do this, ask me to leave house is
                          not a good solution for me. But then although I already said I
                          don’t want to go with them, they still come. For me, at spore they
                          are the closest friend/ family I have. They already come want to
                          help me why I reject them, it is no good. So I follow them go their
                          house and stay there for few days until my parents come.</p>
              <p>My parents then come with me to meet father in law ask what is
                          actually happen, why things become like that. Then father in law
                          said he fell so sorry to me and my parents for this case, say he
                          know his son have many debts outside and he owe spore Along too.
                          And ask my parents don’t help to clear his son debts. I don’t know
                          it is true or not because he never told me and always don’t want to
                          share with me his problem. At that time, he come back home and sit
                          together with us, say sorry to my parents.</p>
              <p>We then sit together with his friend without his father, discuss
                          how to solve his debts problem since he told us he have such big
                          debts outside. The only way is he have to sell his house, clear his
                          debts and move to smaller house and start everything new. Although
                          his father don’t like him to sell house, but no other way.</p>
              <p>Starting from that, he and his father relation become worst.
                          They don’t talk to each other. Son don’t want to come back home
                          have dinner together as usual, don’t want go office. While father
                          in law almost everyday call me back home eat dinner together. Me in
                          the middle of them really hard , don’t know what to do will be
                          good.</p>
              <p>Before my parents go back, I ask him to write what ever he
                          promise me in an agreement letter so everything in black in white
                          not just promise, apologize, forgive since he want to start his new
                          life. In agreement letter mention that he will let me manage his
                          financial, will give 30% of his reminding money after house sold,
                          after clear debts. And the rest will keep in bank with joint
                          account name. He promise to be truth and many more.</p>
              <p>Hear husband have many debts and some more owe Along, he know I
                          don’t like he gambling he still bring me to casino, he starting
                          shout at me. Everyday follow him go out make me become scare of
                          him, dunno he will bring me to Along to clear his debts or not.
                          Stay at home scare Along come look for him and he not at home then
                          look for me how. I think a lot of all this thing. I don’t know this
                          will happen in spore or not but if in my country this will possibly
                          happen, Along can come to look for his wife.</p>
              <p>Don’t know how he did until he become so pity, no money until
                          have to take from his coin box money for meals. When got money,
                          have to pay for debts. Maybe this condition make him become always
                          have bad mood. When I check his phone, who is he talking to, he
                          feel angry.</p>
              <p>All this make me feel sad too. I think it will be better for
                          both of us if I go back my country until he settle his problem. He
                          can have less expend and can concentrate look for new job new
                          business to do. I also don’t have to be face his family faces since
                          they become unhappy with me too because I allow husband to sell
                          house to clear debts.</p>
              <p>Then I told husband I will go back until everything settle,
                          leave him struggle him self.<br> Am I a bad wife?</p>
              <p>All this is just unfair to me. What people can said is I bring
                          unlucky to their family, just joint their family and many thing
                          happen. While the truth are I have been cheat since from the
                          begining, before married. Husband already a gambler and have many
                          debts outside before we married. Husband already being warning many
                          time by his father about his gambling habit.</p>

              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> It is quite a mess, but by now, you probably already have a decision in mind and my guess is that you would probably stick with your thinking.</p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Your situation has less to do with the state of your life/destiny/fate much more than the quality of your choice. Initially, your pain of choice constantly oscillates between two paranoia: the fear of being left on the shelf and the fear of not marrying the 'right guy'. The former obviously had stronger influence over you; hence, your decision to marry him was largely made on a rational basis: (1) He was recommended to possess values that are attractive to you, (2) he appears to be financially sound, (3) he is available and is interested in you. </p>
              <p>Since your marital decision can be said to be largely based on rationality (e.g. biological age is ticking, etc), your conclusion would also likely mirror this beginning (e.g. I am leaving him because I foresee little future, etc). </p>
              <p>In some ways, the choice of marrying him does dissolve your singlehood. However, your subconscious fear of not marrying the 'right guy' is beginning to roar into reality; the core of the issue is not about the financial (although it is the presenting symptoms), but is about being in a relationship with someone of conflicting values. You wanted someone safe, predictable and consistent: living in debts, gambling woes, unprofitable business and lasting family conflicts basically promoted an opposite outcome from your ideals.    </p>
              <p>Suicide is unnecessary; even the talk about getting part of the money is superfluous. The question you might want to figure out is your attitude towards a divorce circumstance - namely being a divorcee. I want to stress that I not suggesting that divorce is the way forward; I am merely asking you to expand your consideration of choices beyond that of suicide - till such extend of even questioning your personal belief of what divorce means to you.</p>
              <p>When you realized that you have choices (even unappealing ones), suicide is unnecessary. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> The talk about sticking with your husband during hardship is arduous for a union accepted largely on rationality basis. Reasons alone - in a purist sense - would mean that it is 'wiser' to leave before the house of cards collapse on you (unless you hold strongly to the concept of obligation or disallowing yourself a no-divorce situation). Those that stick in bad times are usually those that have more love than reasons to be hanging around. Emotional reasons, especially during the dating phrase, are the major factors that cause our hearts to skip a beat, tingling sensation in our feet, palpitation and red flushes.</p>
              <p>Hence, these are - again in a purist sense - a sense of uncontrolled, uncalculated feeling towards another person.   </p>
              <p>Again, the morality of relationship needs to be removed from the equation. What constitute a 'good wife' or a 'bad husband' matters little other than the choice you decide to undertake after having all the information about the person at hand. After all, many people still end up divorcing a 'good wife' or being overly attached to a 'bad husband' - therefore, 'good' or 'bad' labels are poor reference for decision making in love.    </p>
              <p>P.S: Life isn't unfair to you; you can change the course of your action, in which your destiny will alter likewise.</p>
              <p>Just remember: two wrongs doesn't make one right. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>I wanna do away with all this rubbish wedding, it is too damn expensive. All the parasites from the restaurants all the way to the freelance photographers are squeezing cash from us.</p>
              <p>If want to openly declare to everybody, go and publish your marriage at the Strait Times la or have a simple buffet at home, invite all close friends and relatives.</p>
              <p>I got a friend who work as a QC manager at an electronics company, he does part time wedding photography, the biz was so good that he could afford to quit his job and do full time. He advertises his work through facebook, now it has gone viral. It is so rubbish, to pay these people high wages. For me, i would get one of my close friends who is good at photography to do it at half the price.</p>

              to squeeze as much $$$ from him as you can. Go consult a divorce
              lawyer.</p>

              <p>the problem is rather complicated. rather than finding someone to marry at her country, TS choose to marry blindly into a foriegn country, leaving her friends, family and memories behind just to get someone she barely knows. </p>
              <p>The place she came from is unfortuantely a male-driven society. A woman's value is put on her ability to clean, cook, wash...so that they can marry better. And to marry better is marry someone wealthier, and if that someone is wealthier it meant a source of income for the girl.</p>
              <p>Hence, the materialism rather than emotional connect to the significant one because she marry someone she barely knows! <span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you look at her previous post, she kept on thinking that her life is out of her control. She needs someone to save her from being trampled on, betrayed...etc</span></p>
              <p>But I hope TS knows that she is in control of HER LIFE. I advise her to take the money and invest in herself, go to school, get educated and break out of poverty and reliance. Certificates is king in Singapore and TS will need it to find a job. </p>
