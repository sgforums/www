              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>Appreciate if you can share your experience, recommendation or advice should you have had this similar problem I'm facing now........</p>
              <p>Hired a 9 year experienced Indonesia maid - paid more hoping she can help my wife........Maid arrived &amp; complained not happy, wanna transfer on her 3rd day.</p>
              <p>Called agency....... was told to hold on to her, no new Biodata available yet.</p>
              <p>Waited &amp; waited, while bearing with her bad, 'bochap' attitude towards us despite treating like one of our family....same makans, short tour, outings etc.  Of course, gotta bear with her mistakes made........ spoiled 2 TVs by wiping with wet cloth, choked toilet pipe &amp; many others.  Despite lecturing her, she continued her 'bochap' attitude.</p>
              <p>On the 4th week, she ran away (w/o our knowledge) to the agency &amp; accused that my wife slapped her.  Last I heard from maid agency that police report was made by them &amp; she is now under investigation. I guess she's now either in the Home or agency's lodge.  Obviously, agency is not helping us at all, for all this matter!  We (me &amp; wife) are concerned but not worry in proving our innocence.  Yes, my wife chided her at times on her mistakes, but we do not lay hands on her!  We lodged a police report for our perusal to further actions, if needed.</p>
              <p>Called MOM, they adviced to speak with concerned IOfficer for permission to cancel WPermit.  Called police, they dunno if any abovementioned report was made against us, just asked us to wait . . . Called maid agency, I summarized the answer: 'no disclosure until investigation ends' </p>
              <p>Now, what can we do besides waiting........ WPermit is still under my name, I'm still liable for her &amp; I'm sure there will be $$$ charged onto me during this 'investigation period'.</p>
              <p>Your Best Advice Please. . . . .</p>

              <p>The agency will always side with the maid. Agencies are middlemen, the maid is their money making tool.</p>
              <p>I would send the maid back to the agency and refuse to take her back. Demand a refund and proceed to cancel the work permit immediately.</p>
              <p>Dont need to be wishy washy about this whole thing. Not happy don't work, you make a unhappy worker work.. you only get back <strong>passive aggression</strong>. ( bochap, damage items in your house, ignore your children when you are not around). The longer you drag, the worst the situation.</p>
              <p>Is this the first time you have maid ? Maybe your expectation is unrealistic lah. Maids are humans,. they are not your slaves.</p>

              <p>Why you hire Indon maid?</p>
              <p>Malay people always got attitude wan.</p>
              <p>The maid want to use you to gain entry into singapore, so she can start as a maid then escape and work in more lucrative jobs like watressing and dish washing at the hawker centers or restaurants.</p>
              <p>Nowadays it is a popular excuse to accuse employers of laying hands on them - so they can get the consulate help.</p>
              <p>Next time hire cambodian maid - they are more stupid and naive. My neighbor hire one 18 year old cambodian maid. Though dark skin - very chio.</p>

              <p>WP can go MOM and cancel it, look for MOM officers, they will give you sound advices, as an employer, you can cancel WP anytime, but MOM would want you to make sure she is repatriated within 24hrs with you sending her to AP and ensure she check in, once she checked in, none of your business anymore, you are liable to foot the airfares and any compensation as what the MOM direct you to do so.</p>

              Cancel the maid work permit online or you can go to MOM-Work Permit Service Centre at Tanjung Pagar Complex about the matter. You should cancel the work permit so you don't have to pay for the levy. Go to MOM-WPSC (Domestic Maid Dept).
              
              Next time if you wish to employ a domestic maid, you don't have to go through an agency. You can do it online yourself and its easy since everything is online now. Once your application is approved by MOM, you can do all the necessary documentation yourself.
              
              If you go to Tanjung Pagar where MOM-WPSC is located, you can find there are many insurance companies to handle about the insurance coverage and security bond for your maid. There are clinics there too to handle pertaining to your maid medical checkup. Everything under one roof there. Good luck.
