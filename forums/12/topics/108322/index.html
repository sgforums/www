Some people i know, quit when their bf/gf tells them to, or they quit together.<br><br>For your case, perhaps you could convince her that the smoke she exhales are actually inhaled by your family? She's raising the chances of cancer for everyone who lives in the house!<br><br>Look at her in the eyes, tell her that you love her, and that you don't want to see her slowly wither away from cancer 10 years later.<br><br>Alternatively, you can try being mean, tell her you won't take care of her when she withers away 10 years later. (Depends on what your mom's personality is like).<br><br>There's always the Nicotine sweets, gum that are in the market which provides the same nicotine.

            <div class='col-md body'>*agrees with Aaron*<br><br>wow Nick didn't know your mum smoked.<br><br>As Aaron mentioned , passive smoking will eventually harm you and people around her. If she loves you guys and doesn't want you'll to end up with cancer than she must stop smoking. When did she take up this habit? at what age?<br><br>She must really look after her health and your family's.<br><br>If nicotine patches/gums etc does not work , how about Hypnotherapy? But dunno how safe it is or if it has any side-effects.<br><br>Smoking is more of a disease than a bad habit. Just like alcoholism. Your whole family should encourage her to quit smoking,not only you.</div>

See, its really not easy to stop smoking.<br><br>But as her kid, i think you have to take control of her habit since she is still young. Try to keep all ciggas away from her even if you have to hide them.<br><br>Maybe you could ask her to try the nicotine gum just to see if she could replace the ciggas for the gums.<br><br>Peace.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
