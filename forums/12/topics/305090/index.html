            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I am glad that I have found a job straight away after I left my previous job.<br><br>Problem is, I am satisfied yet not really happy &amp; secure with my current job. Simply because I was hired by a different manager (with a HR staff) &amp; to make matters worse, his job scope does not include HR.<br><br>So on this particular day, I was feeling really lazy to get up because the stupid management made a really silly decision to move me into another department &amp; the work load is really too much &amp; the customer is the most 'ma huan' out of all the customers that others had taken care of &amp; it's a very mathematical job.<br><br>So because of my lateness, I got to meet the HR manager &amp; he gave me a dressing down, claiming that I wasn't suitable for the job as he read my resume &amp; commented that I belong to the artistic side &amp; that I am an introvert (that's what I said to him because he told me it's only a relax session with him so I decided to show him my true colours <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) So of course, I proclaimed to him that I would prove to him that I could do this job well.<br><br>1 week of hard grilling, my predecessor made me swallow as much as info as she can &amp; she kept adding more items to the list that she had &amp; she made sure I knew almost everything from A-Z. Luckily for her, I kept asking even though she kept giving me this 'please, don't make me vomit blood' look.<br><br>Because of that, without much prior experience or relation to my previous job, I could understand most of what she taught. She was mean at first then slowly, she started being nice &amp; talked nicely to me, perhaps she knew I was willing to learn as much as I can. Luckily, she passed down the list &amp; spoke good of me in front of the HR &amp; other managers. She even passed me a tag to say that she knew she was pushing me too hard as she wanted me to learn as much as I can since she is leaving 1 week later  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>So after she left, the first two days I was all by myself (yesterday &amp; today). I tried my best to be sensitive to numerical digits &amp; even kept asking around &amp; doing OTs to cover her work &amp; my own work.<br><br>Fast forward, I went lunch with my colleagues &amp; found out things are not so simple as most of them are pretty intelligent &amp; they knew many inside info e.g 'xxx is a temp so I heard HR this &amp; that to her soon'...<br><br>This particular sentence actually makes me worried simply because I am too quiet &amp; I made my first mistake in an email which I was liaising with a forwarder.  This particular person was smart enough to 'cc' to my HR &amp; my manager, emphasizing my mistake &amp; trying to gain support from hers &amp; my side  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So I just gave her the correct thing &amp; she just stopped emailing altogether. "Luckily" my HR was kind enough to side me &amp; told them that I was new (DUH)<br><br>But the problem is...will they fire me just because I am too quiet &amp; still so shaky from my work, but I am still new but I suspect that they just want me to hand up a perfect test score or they'll give me the boot?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Please advice me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is the dark side of corporate world, worse than a real war, at least you know who is the bad people. You can use personality to find a job which you really like to do, rather than coming to office and struggling unhappily. Ignore those people you can't stand. I can understand the emotional distress you suffered. I hate office politics deeply.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
