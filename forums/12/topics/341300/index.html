              <p>what do you mean by 'such a person' ?</p>
              <p>You mean she treats you too nice, that it's difficult to trust? Too good to believe, too good to be true that kind of thang?</p>
              <p><strong>And she's so horny that it seems like she can just fuck around,
                                          but she tells you that she'll only have sex with you - the one she
                                          loves.</strong></p>
              <p>This one is kinda funny.. maybe your friend prefer someone who is not horny or at all and even reject sex from your friend. That way, your friend will feel secure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="icon_surprised.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think it has to do with your friend's confidence level and trust issue. Nothing to do with the girl. Does your friend have a bad experience or something? That made him hard to trust someone who treat him nice.</p>

              <p>To Lorry: He's the kind who is pretty cynical and skeptical and finds it difficult to trust others. There's sex between them, pretty regular but wonders if he's just another sex equipment.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the girl is older than him by 5 yrs. He's a young bloke aged 21. She's from M'sia and he's a Singaporean. He loves her but is understandably somwhat bochap about her (to a certain degree) due to his seemingly nonchalant attitude towards almost everything and everyone.</p>
              <p>He wonders if he's a rebound guy (or at least being treated as one), as the girl's ex came from the same office as him, and she broke up with her ex &amp; then 2-3 mths later went on with my friend. The ex-bf has since left the company. Btw, she's the kind who gets over her ex-es pretty fast.</p>
              <p>Do you think she's gettin' on with him just to fill that void of hers? She's has the option to apply for SG PR or go back to M'sia once her contract ends.</p>
              <p>Friends of him is telling him that she's gettin' on with him just to fill that void of hers. It's like she's making use of him. He's confused. What do you think he should do? I don't wanna tell him anything, yet. Wanna gather some opinions &amp; advices regarding ths kinda situation.</p>

              <p>can understand ur fren's fears, cos she got tog wif him quite soon after her previous bf.</p>
              <p>but look at this way, ur fren got together with her out of his own free will. if he is so worried abt being the rebound guy, then why did he get together wif her in the first place? why did he even have sex wif her? he also made use of her in tt sense right?</p>
              <p>maybe ask ur fren to consider her character: does she lie to him often? asks him to buy her expensive things? wants him to do a lot of things for her, but doesn't do much in return?</p>
              <p>if it's yes for any of the above... and at the moment, ur fren really feels tt she is not trustworthy, and might leave him once her contract is up, then there's no meaning in the rs already right? might as well break up now.</p>
              <p>if he still wants to be wif her, why not he stop having sex wif her first, but reassure her tt she is still the only one for him. and then try to find out fr her where she tinks their rs is going in the future.</p>
              <p>cos sex confuses things... if they stop having sex for a few mths, things will be clearer. and ur fren will also know whether she really likes him. if she doesn't and is just making use of him, she will go for someone else once he doesn't give her what she wants.  </p>

              <p><br> He's the kind who is pretty cynical and skeptical and finds it
              difficult to trust others. There's sex between them, pretty regular
              but wonders if he's just another sex equipment.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the girl is older than him by 5 yrs. He's a young bloke
              aged 21. She's from M'sia and he's a Singaporean. He loves her but
              is understandably somwhat bochap about her (to a certain
              degree) due to his seemingly nonchalant attitude towards
              almost everything and everyone.</p>
              <p>He wonders if he's a rebound guy (or at least being treated
              as one), as the girl's ex came from the same office as
              him, and she broke up with her ex &amp; then 2-3 mths later went on
              with my friend. The ex-bf has since left the company. Btw, she's
              the kind who gets over her ex-es pretty fast.</p>
              <p>Do you think she's gettin' on with him just to fill that
              void of hers? She's has the option to apply for SG PR
              or go back to M'sia once her contract ends.</p>
              <p>Friends of him is telling him that she's gettin' on with
              him just to fill that void of hers. It's like she's making use
              of him. He's confused. What do you think he should do? I don't
              wanna tell him anything, yet. Wanna gather some opinions &amp;
              advices regarding ths kinda situation.</p>

              <p>if he is afraid of taking risks, then break up, if not, stay on lor.</p>
              <p>is he more afraid of being lonely or is he more afraid that he might be being used by her more?</p>

              with you whatever shit, and she declares she loves and misses you

              <p>hmmm.. do you believe that the third-party or friends' perception from outside of the situation/relationship that 2 involved parties are in is almost always true?</p>
              <p>That is, for example, me and some other friends tell him that she is gonna leave him once her contract is up and return to m'sia, don't hurt yourself, faster end the r/s. Her treating-you-well is just a smokescreen. She is seeking to fill that void, and you're that rebound guy. It all makes sense, but he is simply bochap or maybe he is already aware but kept our advice at the back of his mind.</p>
