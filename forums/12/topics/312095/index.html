              <p>But i can't help nor stop myself from thinking this way... Sign..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I jus can't get along with her.. She is my bf bro gf.. Let call her T.. The worst thing is tat.. There isn anything she has done to offend mi.. I jus simply can't get along..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are actually the same age! But we don speak to each other at all.. It started off with hi &amp; bye.. Now things have come to a stage whereby we dun greet each other at all..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This bothers mi coz i wanna get along with all in his family.. My bf has a sis.. She is younger than mi 5years! But we could chat &amp; get along reali well..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the beginning.. I dunno is it coz of this tat pissed mi off from T..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. My bf send her home tog with his bro.. Without any regards.. They both sat behind the back seat treating him as a personal driver!!!</p>
              <p>2. Dun like her tis attitude tat.. Each time his parents send her home.. The least she could say is a word of thanks.. But nope!!!</p>
              <p>3. She stayed over at their house.. Coz my bf &amp; his bro shared the room.. My bf is chased out &amp; have to slp in the hall!!!! @ tat pt of time.. My bf still in NS.. Onli weekend he's at home to slp &amp; rest.. She could have chosen some other time to come!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This are the main things tat have pissed mi off.. But is like.. We totally have no affintiy between us.. I usually have no prob clicking with others.. But with her.. It seems like we dislike each other!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Psychology book says.. If u don't like the person, vice versa.. I think she dislike mi more.. Coz the few times we actually all went out tog.. My brought up is.. B4 eating.. I'll ask Uncle Aunty eat..  She can sit there quietly till her bf nudge her then she will reluntantly call Uncle Aunty eat..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>End dinner.. I'll say my thanks.. Same.. She relutantly say her thanks.. If not for mi, she wouldn't even mutter a word! Is not that she is a young gal.. Already in the woking world.. &amp; in the service industry!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Comes to a point whereby.. I feel v sian whenever i noe she is coming.. LoL..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My bf also.. haha.. Can't blame her for being tao.. The last time we came out.. After calling his parents... I happen to eye contact with her.. Coz sitting jus beside his parents.. She didn look at mi at that pt of time.. So i also din bother saying hi to her..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Childish.. childish.. I noe..</p>
