Isn't being friends alone a gamble itself? You never know when he changed, but that do not stop you from trying to carry on the relationship with him as friends right?<br><br>Ok, maybe what I have viewed the ideal relationship between a couple as... too idealistic. Bear in mind though what is your initial purpose for entering the relationship for. Is it just to have a mate? Or you looking forward to marriage and beyond? Or is it to show off?<br><br>Going into the relationship of bgr is nice, fun, exciting, etc, etc. This is what its supposed to be: to fill your life with joy and happiness, much like friendship. It is the purpose of what you are looking for in the relationship that "determines" the nature of the relationship. If you are looking for fun and enjoyment, well... just jump into the love wagon! If you are looking for a communion with a life time partner, this goes deeper. You are looking for a special one to share your life with you. Not any Tom, Dick or Harry (sorry for using the names here) to just keep you company.<br><br>If you just want to have a relationship just for the sake of having one, you know what to expect and how it will turn out. Break ups and such. This do not really require knowing the person very well because its a hassle and you want to have fun!<br><br>If you go into a relationship with the notion of looking for the special one, you WILL spend time to know the person first before investing and devoting your love into the relationship. This is a lifetime insurance policy, and I don't think you are willing to make a high risk on this one right?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dokono:</div><div class="quote_body">Bonta<br><br>What do you mean "taken the wrong road"? Can you be more specific?<br><br>Why the tissue is a stop-gap measure? So if their love for each other is unconditional, I believe the air-con can be repaired. Unless there is not much love to begin with?<br><br>My point for mentioning this "needs not neglected" for girls is because the guy is always portrayed the bad guy which is not necessarily the case nor is it the girl. Not saying it's her fault or his fault, but to look at the whole picture fairer for both sexes. Yes, it's one of the reasons but not the main reason, I believe.<br><br>Your point on unconditional love. I believe it's all in the mindset on both sides. Love is supposed to be kind, understanding, patient, bla bla. The problem is in real life, everyone is acting on self-interests. So I expect you to care for me and you expect me to care for you haha. In the end, there's resentment for both sides.<br><br>You must understand the party well enough to get into a relationship. Question is, how long do you need to understand? Sometimes you go into a relationship with a girl for 10 years, you want to marry her, suddenly she says "hey let's split." You are so shocked! Nothing is ever guaranteed.<br><br>The point is, how do you know the relationship will not last when you don't try? But that is not to say you don't rush into it. Just take things slowly.<br><br>Peace bontakun <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>doko<br><br></div></blockquote>Everytime you put the "doko" siggy, I have the itching tendancy to put "Doko Ja Nei~~~!?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> "Where are you going!?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Ok paiseh.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>You know the "guys not bad, girls don't love"? or "wild gals are a guy's fantasy" (Ok I made that up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  )? Such people interest you and I because they are fun to be with, unpredictable, wild and great company. One thing with many of these people: They just want to have fun and have no intention of going DEEP into the relationship. So its most likely a mis-match to begin with if you have don't just want to have fun, but want more.<br><br>You are not going to use the tissue to gag the area where water is dripping right? Soon it can't soak more than its capable of and water will drip.<br><br>You cannot expect her to care for you and she cannot expect you to do otherwise. That is not fair to either of you. It should and must come WILLINGLY from both of you. That is the amazing power of unconditional love. You don't expect something yet the person gave you that. Isn't that more precious than the person give the present to you because you expected it?<br><br>Understanding the person well enough... Honestly, I do NOT know "how well" is enough. It is up to you to decide that. "Ok, I've known her for 3 years. I know quite alot about her habits and behaviour. Now I should decide whether to bring it forward to the next level or carry on knowing her more." As Smudgey has said, "its a gamble" BUT you lower the risk by knowing and understanding more about her as she to you and you decide on every "checkpoints" such as this. While you are single and getting to know her more, you are also making yourself available to other people. This way, you are not exactly wasting time right?<br><br>Do note, while you are choosing and deciding, others are also choosing and deciding.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">Good discussion going on, keep it up.<br><br>Hope to see more forumers participating and provide their viewpoints as well.<br><br>Cheers</div></blockquote>Initially I thought you would say, "Please stick to the topic" or something similar...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by blu_sky:</div><div class="quote_body">100th!!</div></blockquote>You win.........</div>

Identifying the incompaitability firsthand before entering into the relationship will save alot of time, hassle and pain.<br><br>2. If the love is strong and the commitment is great, both side should discuss how this could be worked out. No one side is to expect the other to change.

Isn't being friends alone a gamble itself? You never know when he changed, but that do not stop you from trying to carry on the relationship with him as friends right?<br><br>Ok, maybe what I have viewed the ideal relationship between a couple as... too idealistic. Bear in mind though what is your initial purpose for entering the relationship for. Is it just to have a mate? Or you looking forward to marriage and beyond? Or is it to show off?<br><br>Going into the relationship of bgr is nice, fun, exciting, etc, etc. This is what its supposed to be: to fill your life with joy and happiness, much like friendship. It is the purpose of what you are looking for in the relationship that "determines" the nature of the relationship. If you are looking for fun and enjoyment, well... just jump into the love wagon! If you are looking for a communion with a life time partner, this goes deeper. You are looking for a special one to share your life with you. Not any Tom, Dick or Harry (sorry for using the names here) to just keep you company.<br><br>If you just want to have a relationship just for the sake of having one, you know what to expect and how it will turn out. Break ups and such. This do not really require knowing the person very well because its a hassle and you want to have fun!<br><br>If you go into a relationship with the notion of looking for the special one, you WILL spend time to know the person first before investing and devoting your love into the relationship. This is a lifetime insurance policy, and I don't think you are willing to make a high risk on this one right?</div></blockquote>Hi Bontakun<br><br>the n ran home......<br><br>anyways,<br><br>I agree that a lot depends on the initial purpose for getting into the relationship.... and I also agree that when you go into a relationship with a notion of looking for THE one, you will spend time to get to know him better first.<br><br>With friends, like-wise it's a gamble... with lower stakes.<br><br>With friends, we are more torlerant... we are more willing to forgo their "crap"<br>for example...<br><br>what's the diff between your friend being two hours late, and your partner being two hours late? who are you more pissed at?<br><br>If you are waiting for your friend/partner for 2 hours..... a sudden sms is recieved to say that he/she have met up some friends and won't be meeting you... who are you more irritated at?<br><br>with friends, we do not expect too much. but with partners, there will always be a certain level of expectation.<br><br>when you see a friend spending too much money.... you caution him, he doesn't listen. what can you do? and you let it go eventually....<br><br>but if that friend is your partner, you'll feel more irritation?<br><br><span class="small">hmmmm.... am i making any sense??? had a bad night last night... brain not functioning like norm.</span></div>
