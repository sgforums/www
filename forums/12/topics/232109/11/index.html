You never bother to state that they're so in the 1st place...

But I've already WARNED you PREVIOUSLY...<br><br>You DON'T go around BASHING people, making PERSONAL ATTACKS and GIVE ADVICES BASED on your SINGLE PROPOSED POSSIBILITY (which you fail to state them to be unless you were questioned and cannot hold up an arguement).<br><br>Making a statement like DONOKO IS AN IDIOT WHO GOES AROUND GIVING SENSELESS TALKS, PRIVATE MESSAGING THE FEMALES AND DISTURBING THEM USING SEXUALLY ABUSIVELY VERBAL WORDS. is PLAIN IRRESPONSIBLE. ESPECIALLY when you never even bother to state or suggest that it's only a POSSIBILITY in the 1st place...<br><br>Are you saying that EVERY STATEMENT you make can just SO HAPPENS to turn into a POSSIBILITY at ANY POINT of time as per you wish? That only goes to how LITTLE CREDIT we can give to what you say and how LIGHTLY we should be taking your WORDS and ADVICES...<br><br>NO DOUBT, I must admit that you can QUOTE good statements (probably from somewhere else), BUT LEARN to be RESPONSIBLE for YOUR OWN WORDS!!<br><br>ESPECIALLY HERE IN AA! You don't just ADVISE them on something which might or might not be true without them knowing it... Making them SO CONVINCED that you're speaking of the TRUTH when you actually means just a POSSIBILITY!! It's like an IRRESPONSIBLE DOCTOR prescribing a DRUG who might give a patient SIDE-EFFECTS if not FATAL ONE! And when found out that it's a WRONG DRUG, that doctor would just go... "Hey, it's still a POSSIBLE drug right? The patient could have chose not to take it right?"<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: red;">LET ME WARN YOU AGAIN!!
