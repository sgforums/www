            <div class='col-md body'>I had a broken family. Then I met this guy when I was very young and fell head over heels in love with him and he did too. But somehow, many things werenÂ’t quite right. Example, he wld be able to treat me to dinner and all lavishly in the beginning of the month whereas towards the end, I wasnÂ’t even able to get a drink (of normal beverages like soft drink) out from him. Fast forward the story, I was married, pregnant. Had to give up my studies. My dad looked down upon him and refused to give any support. His mother was one kind of a money-faced and I wld be thankful if she didnÂ’t leech on us though of cos I do ustand to support our parents is an act of filial piety but we were down in our worst times. He had a job that didnÂ’t pay him very well and I was living off my savings which werenÂ’t much to begin with.<br><br><blockquote><br>Originally posted by dokono:<br><br>Now? Everyone had about the same rights due to democracy and the most important thing that holds them together is this word called passion. <strong><span style="color: red;">The higher the passion, the longer the relationship.</span></strong> When both parties are madly in love with each other, they could see a long term plan for each other. They couldn't see through each party's personality's flaws and then they rush into marriage. </blockquote>Agreed.<br><br>Fast fast forward the story. I begin my 1st job right after my 2 months confinement after my pregnancy. I had to abandon all tots of future studies as I did not hv any money and cldnt depend on anyone else (not even my ex) for my household expenditure. My ex? Apart fr the nominal (itÂ’s really a pittance) household allowance I had received fr him twice during my pregnancy, all throughout the 7/8 years of our marriage, he had not contributed a single cent. Be it from the groceries, my and his transportation, food, bills from rent &amp; PS, town council, CPF housing deduction etc when afterwards I got my own HDB flat, nanny (to take care of my kid) then subsequent maidÂ’s sal and her levy, misc etc etc, I was the sole contributor. I gave him allowance instead so that he cld survive to look for more jobs. It nvr did occur to me strange when he cldnt settle down a stable job. And ea time he had failed, I wld encouraged him all over again even though as the yearsÂ’ passed, it kinda gets very demoralizing actually. Then it began to dawn on me his flawed character traits. Is this love? I began to question myself. Yea, when IÂ’m around in the house, he wld appear all so loving and he love his child fiercely. But which loving husband can bear to see his wife suffer (those initial days were horrible, I can go w/o proper meals just so to make sure ends meet) and still go on abt without this urgency to tie down any job? I didnÂ’t ask much of him. Even some McDonaldÂ’s crew or so wld do, just to tie down one decent job with a stable income to help me out so that he can support himself at the very least and IF possible, help out the family. But he turned up his nose and scoffed at those jobs. It has been a battle within myself constantly. Did he really love me like what he had proclaimed? Many other things happened meanwhile which I shant go into details.<br><br><blockquote><br>Originally posted by dokono:<br><br>Alas, <strong>when the love of one side has faded, their loyalty starts to waver and they begin to conjure reasons why they cannot be together.</strong> Oh, she could not trust him or he could not trust her or other sorts of funny reasons, other than the passion was not there which by the way is actually the main reason why the relationship could not work out. Other side reasons include insecurity, mistrust and clinginess.</blockquote>I believe this is when my side of the love start to fadeÂ…<br><br><blockquote><br>Originally posted by dokono:<br><br><strong>You did have feelings but they were not high enough to prevent the breakup?

In fact on some occasions, heÂ’s gotta borrow fr me some petty sum to tide him over and even though heÂ’s said that he wld returned, he nvr did and I nvr pursue. Initially as well, he did express his vehement interest to gain custody of our child &amp; we had had many unhappy episodes over this. I cant bear to think what wld happen if he had our child and perhaps heÂ’ll be running back to me for our childÂ’s misc when in reality I wanted him out of my life for good. Friends? Sure I can be friend with him, but only if no interest of gains are involved. But at the looks of it, I wld say itÂ’s hard. WeÂ’ve yet to settle the ancillary matters in case if ur wondering.<br><br><blockquote><br>Originally posted by dokono:<br><br><strong>You did have feelings but they were not high enough to prevent the breakup? You know what? The girls I know who love their boyfriend too much can't bear to breakup.</strong> </blockquote>Feelings? Who doesnÂ’t hv them? In fact on off on occasions, via sms, heÂ’s proclaimed that he still loves me and think abt me. What actions then? Nil. Feelings? Me? GoshÂ… thatÂ’s y IÂ’ve said, itÂ’s been a tough 6 months for me while weÂ’re no longer living together anymore. But thatÂ’s all in the pastÂ…<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by dokono:<br><br>So, to add on, <span style="color: red;"><strong>the key to a loving relationship is not only about deep love for each other, but also a sense of deep responsibility for a long-term relationship.</strong></span> No one is perfect. But working out is not easy as evident in so many examples. It's easy to say but hard to do. And it sounds like you are not confident in trusting a person completely to be your life partner. Well, I have an advice for you. Know what you want in a life partner, not just the passion/chemistry.<br><br>Best of luck to finding your Prince Charming.<br><br>doko</blockquote>I hope that the other guy I was talking abt wld be someone I cld entrust myself to. Then againÂ… too soon? Love is so scary when it tries to knock on your door too soon. Shd I keep looking? Shd I settle? I am not one who just dump people you know! Then again, I wld say if needed be, having been thru wat IÂ’ve been thru, break-ups are essential. On the other hand I wld like to reiterate, I am not one who takes r/s lightly.<br></div>

Initially as well, he did express his vehement interest to gain custody of our child &amp; we had had many unhappy episodes over this. I cant bear to think what wld happen if he had our child and perhaps heÂ’ll be running back to me for our childÂ’s misc when in reality I wanted him out of my life for good. Friends? Sure I can be friend with him, but only if no interest of gains are involved. But at the looks of it, I wld say itÂ’s hard.

At least better than my mum at that time, in some ways but not others...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>You really need the support from your family to raise the child. Nevermind if he is able to get the custody or not, this is not within your control to decide who gets to be with the kid. Focus more on how are you going to raise your child up well.<br><br>Coming up from a broken family myself, I know how much my mother went through at that time and I am glad it did not turned out worse. At least I wasn't raised to be some spoilt brat or bad dude.
