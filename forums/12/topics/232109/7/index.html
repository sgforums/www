It's just not there any more. You just can't force it, right? No doubt you loved him before but now the feeling is gone. When the feeling is gone, of course there is no future. </strong><br><br>It breaks your heart? Because you can't bear to see him sad because you need a reason to justify the breakup. So if it breaks your heart, why did you break up with him? Just don't make sense. It's whether you want or don't want only. Let me ask you something. If your desire to stay with him is greater than the desire to breakup, will you still breakup?<br><br>As for two-timing, I did not say it's on purpose. Sometimes, you just don't like the guy anymore but you are still with him. Maybe last time, but not now. And then, you start looking for a new one before you dump the old one. That's why I say you are not two-timing in mind beforehand. Im not saying you plan to betray him first. There are many such cases in this forum so usually a girl does not do that you say?<br><br>Remember, there are some girls who have a backup because they can't stand to be alone but in actuality, they don't love the guy.<br><br>More stories of guys securing a new girlfriend before they do the dumping? Then how come there are so many stories of guys complaining of being dumped/rejected/change of heart/single in this forum and other forums? Why?<br><br>Don't get me wrong. The guys you mentioned deserved to be bashed as well. I do know such people. Im speaking for guys who are sincerely good and get rejected constantly. I don't blame girls.<br><br>The breakup occurs not only because of irreconcilable differences but also because most importantly, you don't like him anymore (while he still likes you).<br><br>Im posting this not because I hate girls or what but because of their actions. They don't match what they say. As a woman, I believe you know it. They frustrate the guys.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by smudgey:</div><div class="quote_body">hmmm...<br><br>doko, your pt "if people want to get together, they can if they want to" is very true....<br><br>look at our grandparent's era, our great grandparent's era, where marriage partners were chosen by their parents..... where some only first set eyes on their partners on their wedding day...<br><br>most of them made it work. they stayed together all their lives.... but are they truely happy? maybe..... maybe not...<br><br>They made it work because they had no choice. they were taught not to expect passion, love, etc.<br><br>but ppl in our generation, we expect that. we expect our love to be strong, passionate, and the I-want-no-one-else-but-you love. IS that wrong?<br><br>no.<br><br>your examples on couples from diff backgrounds, religion, race, etc... well they probably have that. and when you have that, when you are certain that this is the man/woman you wanna spend the rest of your life with, most (not all) differences can be worked through.<br><br>so what is the key??? the key is the love. if the love is deep enough, strong enough, most are willing to go through all sorts of trouble, difficulties, etc to stay together.<br><br>incompatability, that is a prob when something that both parties cannot/unwilling to compromise on. why? maybe because the love is not strong enough...</div></blockquote>Smudge<br><br>I don't know where you get the idea they were taught not to expect any passion. Well, it could be but even if they were taught not to expect any passion, you think all of them would believe they could not love naturally? Passion is instinctual and always will be. After some time, the passion naturally dies off. I believe they couldn't give much care less about passion in the long run though because survivability is the key issue here.<br><br>People last time had responsibilities and were more traditional. The man would find a lady he loved and of course, hopefully, a lady who loved him. He would become a father who would earn a keep for the family while the woman stayed home and did the household chores and cooking.<br><br>The husband held a lot of power in the family and earned a lot of respect from the woman. The man was respected as a head and as a fatherly figure. Women's role in those days were supposed to support the man, at least morally. This mindset was carried over even in our parents' generation.<br><br>Now? Everyone had about the same rights due to democracy and the most important thing that holds them together is this word called passion. The higher the passion, the longer the relationship. When both parties are madly in love with each other, they could see a long term plan for each other. They couldn't see through each party's personality's flaws and then they rush into marriage.<br><br>Alas, when the love of one side has faded, their loyalty starts to waver and they begin to conjure reasons why they cannot be together. Oh, she could not trust him or he could not trust her or other sorts of funny reasons, other than the passion was not there which by the way is actually the main reason why the relationship could not work out. Other side reasons include insecurity, mistrust and clinginess.<br><br>So, to add on, they key to a loving relationship is not only about deep love for each other, but also a sense of deep responsibility for a long-term relationship. No one is perfect. But working out is not easy as evident in so many examples. It's easy to say but hard to do. And it sounds like you are not confident in trusting a person completely to be your life partner. Well, I have an advice for you. Know what you want in a life partner, not just the passion/chemistry.<br><br>Best of luck to finding your Prince Charming.<br><br>doko</div>
