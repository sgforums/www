            <div class='col-md body'>Hi dude, it takes both hands to clap.  Since your gf has called time and you have tried to salvage.  I think its no point forcing the relationship, as they rightly say, there's no happiness from being forced.<br><br>just let go, be friends or not, I cannot say, depending on you, if you feel so hurt, then I think you cannot be friends anymore.  I actually feel that "lets be friend" thing is just an excuse, its a nice pleasant way of ending a relationship - i know some couples can do it , but personally i think i cannot be friend with someone who is my lover before.<br><br>besides, if i break off, i will break off all contact, its no point seeing , hearing about you and only to get reminded of the pain.....<br><br>chins up, the end of a relationship is start of another better one.</div>
