I said "usually", not all girls.<br><br>He betrayed your trust? Good that you left him, otherwise I will flame you for not leaving him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Again, this boils down to another third party. He betrayed your trust and so fast, you stopped loving him? The bond is so weak? Maybe your love for him is not that much after all to begin with?<br><br>Third parties not the only reason? You are right. See, I am not so bad. I agree with you again. Sometimes, people are insecure, needy or possessive, making it very tiring to maintain the relationship.

A girl once commented that girls behave similarly in a certain fashion or another to guys in areas of relationships. I think she is speaking common sense to me.<br><br>You know, your first paragraph can be just summed up with one sentence- You just have no feelings for him anymore. And it's not your fault that you have no feelings. It's just not there any more. You just can't force it, right? No doubt you loved him before but now the feeling is gone. When the feeling is gone, of course there is no future.<br><br>It breaks your heart? Because you can't bear to see him sad because you need a reason to justify the breakup. So if it breaks your heart, why did you break up with him? Just don't make sense. It's whether you want or don't want only. Let me ask you something. If your desire to stay with him is greater than the desire to breakup, will you still breakup?<br><br>As for two-timing, I did not say it's on purpose. Sometimes, you just don't like the guy anymore but you are still with him. Maybe last time, but not now. And then, you start looking for a new one before you dump the old one. That's why I say you are not two-timing in mind beforehand. Im not saying you plan to betray him first. There are many such cases in this forum so usually a girl does not do that you say?<br><br>Remember, there are some girls who have a backup because they can't stand to be alone but in actuality, they don't love the guy.<br><br>More stories of guys securing a new girlfriend before they do the dumping? Then how come there are so many stories of guys complaining of being dumped/rejected/change of heart/single in this forum and other forums? Why?<br><br>Don't get me wrong. The guys you mentioned deserved to be bashed as well. I do know such people. Im speaking for guys who are sincerely good and get rejected constantly. I don't blame girls.<br><br>The breakup occurs not only because of irreconcilable differences but also because most importantly, you don't like him anymore (while he still likes you).<br><br>Im posting this not because I hate girls or what but because of their actions. They don't match what they say. As a woman, I believe you know it. They frustrate the guys. But I still like girls.<br><br>doko</div>

So sweet of you to cry even though you do the dumping? And then the guy gets confused that she still likes him. You know, when the guy does the dumping, people will say he's a bastard. But when the girl does the dumping, people say he neglected her. So she's always the good guy forever? haha...<br><br>You are hurt even more because you have to look like the bad guy? You care about your face. haha...You are not hurt. You don't even care about the relationship anymore.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by smudgey:</div><div class="quote_body">  Look at it this way.... if u know that the relationship is not going to last... u basically can not ever see yourself marrying this guy. Do you go on in this relationship... thinking "hey he have not ask me to marry him, so no need to think about it."<br><br>then the one fine day he decides to pop the qn. you say "errrr.... i don't think i can marry you....ever"<br><br>should we all wait for that day to come and then say no thanks?<br><br>By the way Bontaku, in my point of view, when anyone enters a relationship, it's always a form of gamble.... you'll never know the other person well enough, and even if you think you do, ppl change.<br><br>hence there are times, at certain point of the relationship, you stop and ask yourself, would you be able to live the rest of your life with this person? if the answer is no.... you can't just hold on hoping things will change, cos if they dont aren't you wasting both of your time.... </div></blockquote>So you are saying you don't see yourself marrying him that's why you choose to end it? why? Don't love him? Maybe you loved him but he's not rich/stable enough for marriage? Treat you badly? What determines what feels right? I still have not been getting solid and specific answers from you from a female perspective. Or could it be you don't know what you want?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by smudgey:</div><div class="quote_body">Keywords.... MOST GUYS, not all.<br><br>HIDE emotions. that does not mean they do not feel.<br><br>and MOST guys here in the forum, are more in touched with they're feelings... and besides, they are voicing their emotions behind a screen via a keyboard... it's more "safe"<br><br>I've known guy friends who agonised over their decisions to end the relationships too.... just that they only choose to reveal it to their close friends, and hide from the rest.<br></div></blockquote>Most guys here in this forum more in touched with their feelings? Sgforums is frequented by so many people in Singapore as well as other countries. I believe there are so many internet users now. So you are saying people who don't visit this forum are not in touch with their feelings. Thanks for letting me know.<br><br>I too have close friends who agonise over their decisions to end the relationship. So does it mean guys hide their emotions well? Girls also do hide well you know. In fact they act more on emotions.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by smudgey:</div><div class="quote_body">well that is sterotyping isn't it? If we are going to sterotype, the same can be said about guys right? </div></blockquote>If describing a certain fashion the way some girls behave in a certain manner is stereotyping, then what is not? When people say "oh girls are more emotional or girls are more gentle or guys here are more in touch with their feelings", aren't they stereotyping as well?<br><br>No worries, I don't take comments personally, not like some people haha. If my views are lop-sided, yours not ? haha...nvm<br><br>peace<br><br>doko<br></div>
