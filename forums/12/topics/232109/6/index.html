            <div class='col-md body'>its shocking to see just how many poeple this happens to....i too have had this happen to me,from an ex bf.the hardest part is when they say they still wanna be friends.its the worst decision you'll ever have to make.in my case,we were friends for a week,until i found out that he left me cause he was cheating on me with one of my best friends,and they were doing it in our bed.but anyway,this took some time to get over,it put me in the lowest part of my life,but a good friend helped me through it....and from then ive realised theres more to life than being with someone,ive some of the best times of my life since we split up....sure it gets lonely sometimes,and you cant help but miss them.....but you have to be strong.....ive chosen to not to enter anymore serious relationships since then,but its up to the individual whether you get right back on the dating horse again or not....just give yourself time to adjust,and sort your feelings and your life out before you rush inot anything.i have to add....my ex bf and i broke up over a year ago,and we've only recently in the last few months became friends again.the friendship will never be as good as it was.....but its life.....things change,thats the way it is,just stay strong,believe in yourself......you can get through this,and you will be a much stronger person when you've recovered form the hurt and anger.it took me almost a year.....and im nto completely over it yet still....but its great to move on with your life and make yourslef happy.after all,you should eb the most important thing in your life.take care friend,pm me if theres anything.....goodluck.</div>

Is the friend/partner accustomed to be late? Have you found out why he/she/it is always late? Is it a habit? Or is there some last minute situation? If you know its a habit, its something you may have to accept, be it friend or partner. If its some situation, you can ask what is going on.<br><br>On the part being habit or something that is natural of the person. Its your call you accept and bear with it or try to change it OR you can just forget it totally and let it go.<br><br>If the person sms you he/she/it has met with some friends and decided not to meet you, it brings to your mind "Has this person been doing that? Even before I decided to date him/her/it?". If this person did this before you two dated, you should have found out about this beforehand. If the person did this AFTER you two dated, then its something you two may have to discuss about.<br><br>You caution a friend not to spend so much, he bo hew, you can't do much more at that moment. If the partner does the same, you have to ask youself this, "Is he like this before I met him? Or after we got together?" If he is like this before you two dated, shouldn't you have noticed this point before?<br><br>If you had a bad night, I suggest you rest well. Sleep is VERY HELPFUL.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by smudgey:</div><div class="quote_body">even if you are, is he able to accept the "unchanged" you in his "evolved" state of mind?</div></blockquote>Change is the only constant. If you can accept his change yet he cannot accept yours, this only means you two were NOT meant to be together. You are ready for something he is not. You have not found the person whom you can truely share your life with back then.<br><br>Besides, his "evolved" state of mind which somehow hinders him from accepting your "unchanged" self shows he has plans and you most likely are not in it OR you are unable to catch up with him? He felt you are stagnant when he is moving. Dunno.<br><br>Being unchanged... perhaps its the thinking of being "unchanged" that has infact CHANGED the "unchanged" person such that the partner saw it and realised he/she/it is not the exact person he/she/it supposed to love?</div>
