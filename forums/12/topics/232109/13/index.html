And you really think he has often thuoght it through carefully for the TS as he has claimed before he dispatch his advices? That's the problem... He's getting 'pseudo-popularity'. I'm ok with people getting 'popular' in here, as it's often never my concern. But having people just following his advices blindly based on his 'popularity' alone is too dangerous. Especially when from time to time, his EXTREME conclusions and advices are based on little facts or none much at all.<br><br>Note that ALOT of times, his advices just BASH the girls involved in a thread. Or telling people to break off because the GIRL don't deserve TS or is SO and SO.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> His comments and advices are often TOO SEXIST. The WORSE part is that there're actually blindly supporting his advices or following them. To have someone post IRRESPONSIBLE (wanting fame instead of offering to advise is NOT a style to be encouraged in AA) advices, people listening and following BLINDLY, carrying out the advices (which often is EXTREME) is TOO HIGH a RISK to take...<br><br>As much as I do NOT wish to make the current moves that I'm making now... It's NOT FAIR to the ones heeding advices here, for only through learning the HARD WAY would they truly know what's good for them if they had follow advices blindly... and some of them might not even know what had hit them when they fall under such reason and circumstance....<br><br>To give a fair amount of credit. Donoko DO despatch good comments from time to time over certain instances. But his SEXIST point of view, ARROGANCE (refuses to admit any mistake despite so many people telling him so), relative lack of experience in BGR (highly based on theories alone) would have made him VERY UNSUITABLE to be advising in AA...<br><br>I do accept people with different point of views... And I even tolerate those that do not make much sense to me... But like I've said... Having BLIND EXTREME ADVICES CONSTANTLY is just TOO DANGEROUS.</div>

Especially when from time to time, his EXTREME conclusions and advices are based on little facts or none much at all.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Note that ALOT of times, his advices just BASH the girls involved in a thread. Or telling people to break off because the GIRL don't deserve TS or is SO and SO.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> His comments and advices are often TOO SEXIST. </span>The WORSE part is that there're actually blindly supporting his advices or following them. To have someone post IRRESPONSIBLE (wanting fame instead of offering to advise is NOT a style to be encouraged in AA) advices, people listening and following BLINDLY, carrying out the advices (which often is EXTREME) is TOO HIGH a RISK to take...<br><br>As much as I do NOT wish to make the current moves that I'm making now... It's NOT FAIR to the ones heeding advices here, for only through learning the HARD WAY would they truly know what's good for them if they had follow advices blindly... and some of them might not even know what had hit them when they fall under such reason and circumstance....<br><br>To give a fair amount of credit. Donoko DO despatch good comments from time to time over certain instances. <span style="color: red;">But his SEXIST point of view, ARROGANCE (refuses to admit any mistake despite so many people telling him so), relative lack of experience in BGR (highly based on theories alone) would have made him VERY UNSUITABLE to be advising in AA...</span><br>I do accept people with different point of views... And I even tolerate those that do not make much sense to me... But like I've said... Having BLIND EXTREME ADVICES CONSTANTLY is just TOO DANGEROUS.</div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;"><br>I agree with Devil.<br><br>I also told dokono few times that he's very biased against girls..<br><br>but he insisted that he's not..<br><br>and he likes to assume things..<br><br>sometimes he really get on my nerves and make me wana vomit blood.<br><br></span></div>
