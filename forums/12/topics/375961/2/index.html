              <p>Why are you surprised?</p>
              <p>Lots of shallow people around - if someone can 'fall in love'
              cos of a person's looks ONLY then there is a lot more reason to
              'fall in love' with some one cos he/she has limited interaction
              with you that is almost always pleasant.</p>
              <p>The virtual world is an artificial utopia where interaction is
              almost always by choice, you only need to be bugged by those you
              feel like being bugged by (just click BLOCK or IGNORE if you don't
              feel like talking to someone), no exposure to real life bad habits,
              and everything else is a fill in the blank DIY Imaginary
              Friend.</p>
              <p>Occasionally the imaginary friend built up in the people's minds
              can be close to the real thing so that's lucky. But how many of us
              are single faceted people who can be expressed merely through words
              on the screen? If 90% of our meaning is through body language, and
              5 % is through tone - then someone  you know on screen really
              only knows 5% of you - from your words only.</p>
              <p> My point being that whatever love they claim is for the 5%
              they know online. Whether or not it will sustain when they get to
              know the other 95% - well, who knows? So take it as what its worth
              - 5%.</p>

              <p>I like to make virtual friends because I like to chat. I like to listen to diverse perspectives, how ppl feel on certain issue. I wont debate or argue if their view is different from mine. I wont imposed my values on others. I just like to listen and maybe gain new insights from the chat. It happened a few times when the interaction sparks off and the other party thinks they fall for me. I was taken aback by their "affection" for me. Flattered but taken aback nonetheless. The three guys are young adults. Nice people and the last thing I want to do is to mislead them, I'm single but still, this is a virtual world. They din even see my photo before. So it appear strange that they could fall for me just by chatting online.</p>

              <p>u think a person with very very good personalities but is ugly got more bf or a person with below average personalities but with a super super pretty face and devil figure got more bf?</p>
              <p>first impression is everything, and b4 u know a person, we judge the person by their looks, if they are ugly, we have a rough gauge of the person, while if the person is pretty, we have a low expectation of the personalities since she is pretty... boys with raging hormones should know best, well i am one of them tho..<br><br>if u think appearance dont matters, u are just very pretty/beautiful/sexy or u are very lucky.. congrats then!</p>
