As far as i know, even if u del away all the sms in prepaid card or wat, there is a storage system in the telecom companies. they can always be retreived.<br><br>If the enemy wans to pursue it, she can get into trouble. If they dun wish to, shes fine. I guess if shes hurt, she can always find a fren to comfort her. That is better than doing sth which only temp solves the problem.</div>

Best is ask her to remain silent and not answer any of their questions. Unlikely police can do a thing also...unless they have a device that can track the location of the SIM card anywhere in singapore...</div>
