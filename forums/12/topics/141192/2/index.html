With teens violence on the rise, you never know what they'll do.  Your friend might get others into trouble, an innocent person they suspect to be the sender of the smses.<br><br>It's really a waste of money if you think about it.  Your friend can just brush of the insult and not think about it.  To send "revenge" smses will only be a waste of money. ,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prepaid cards may provide anonymity, but they do not guarantee untraceability. It is still possible to pinpoint or triangulate the physical location of a mobile phone transmitting the signal by locating the base stations that receive the signal. And with the introduction of GPS features in the new generation of mobile phones, it may not be too difficult to locate the caller with just the SIM card number from the phone company records either.<br><br>It'd be advisable if you discouraged your friend from engaging in such petty acts of harassment, as they serve no tangible purpose and, as in this case where her cover is blown, would only further degrade her standing in the eyes of her so-called "enemies".</div>
