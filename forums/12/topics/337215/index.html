              <p>Don't wreck your brains trying to figure out what is on her mind. If you're receiving mixed signals, it is safer to assume she is still trying to figure things. Give her time, be patient. Wait and see what happens.</p>
              <p>Spend more time with her to find out more. Sometimes, half the fun lies in not knowing.</p>

              <p>i guess why not you just tell her how you feel. what is the worst scenario that could happen? the worst thing that can happen is rejection. if u never try, you never know.</p>
              <p>or you could hint to her that you like her and see how she react then. or you can take it slow then. let nature take its course then.</p>
