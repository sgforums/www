              <p>I sometimes likes to tease my friend there. Like push him, make jokes about him, stare at him so near to his face and sometimes i even bite his arm lol.</p>
              <p>ok now the point is that i often do those playful stuff to him and he thinks im falling in love with him. WHAT? i only like him as a friend la but not love leh. And now everytime i try to tease him or what, he getting more and more addicted to it. Like he keeps on smiling at me in a weird way instead of teasing me back. And he even hold my hands together like some bf/gf when i try to push/poke/touch him.</p>
              <p>This is really getting awkward for me so i stop talking to him for awhile. Now ever since that, he tries to grab my attention like walk infront of me then stop. Sms me saying i've done bathing or eating dinner and such. Even ask me out for a movie date and making lame conversation. Omg la this is so the opposite of what i wanted. I really like him as a friend but now its I never expected this to happen. I dont think he did all these for a revenge or try to piss me off from all those teasing i did to him because he should have stop right about now but he still sms me and try to let me know he exist. ahhhh so weird la. Now i feel like avoiding him every time we meet leh.</p>
              <p>Any of u peoples got experience this type of awkward moment?</p>

              <p>I don't know about you...but I definitely don't do such things to my guy friends...you should maintain a little distance from them to avoid sending the wrong signals...</p>
