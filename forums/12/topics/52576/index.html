The relationship has set roots in it - your daily life, friends, social events, etc probably revolves around the both of you - you feel the pressure and find it difficult to go back to single life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Are you sure there is reasons to remain in this relationship other than just the fear of walking alone in your life from now onwards?<br><br>Cheers</div>

Breaking up might not always be a bad thing in life... Some people might agree if they've experience in struggling with a down turn relationship just to see it fall apart finally...<br><br>4 years shouldn't be taken as a determinant factor... Whether you let it go or not, what's his decision? A relationship works both ways.... And you're tired... Are there really good reasons to keep the relationship going other than the fact that it has been 4 years...? What are the chances of him turning back and things going on smoothly...?</div>
