              <p>there is nothing more loving in this world than a parent's heart. They may very well clear debts for her even if it means ZERO $$$ for retirement. But your parents are spoiling her by clearing her debts......You just have to constantly ask your parents, "Where's your money for retirement if you keep paying her debts?" That may jolt them into some thinking.</p>

              Your parents will definitely not have the heart to stop her. After all, which parent would want to see their child being hounded by debt collectors. Tell your parents that by giving her more money, they are actually encouraging her actions. To put it in a bad way, when they passed on, who is going to help her with her debts? 
              
              State it to them that you will not fork out a single cent to clear your sister debt as you would have your own family by then. She will be left on her own. Even if they leave her a sum of "fund" for debt clearance, it's only a matter of time that it would dry up. Let them fear on how they think their child could not cope later on in life. 
              
              Also, tell them to inform your sister that from now on, they are not going to clear any of her debts starting from the last one. And that, if she is going to dig up some more holes, nobody will be helping her at all. They must be aware that their child is not in the correct route. They need to be firm with people like your sister. You guys must be prepared that she will come back begging and saying she will commit suicide or whatever, leave her alone. Introduce her some financial saving plan which could help her in her future finance management.

              <p>Tell your parents very clearly, you are well aware of what your sis is doing and Do not drag you into the mud.</p>
              <p>She can only cry to your parents and take them for granted limited times. In the end, she is proving to people around her how untrustworthy she is.</p>
              <p>If your parents still choose to keep "enabling" her , then you need to steel your heart and turn your backs to them.</p>
