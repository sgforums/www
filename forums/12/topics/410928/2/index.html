              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hi all =D</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Thank alot for all
              the new replies, advices and the care and concern. And thx again
              for those tat have perviously replied and adviced.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I currently have
              decided on the following for now:</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Think and find what
              degree course i really want and like to study before i
              ORD</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Take a full-time
              degree from either SIM/MDIS after my NS</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Find and get a
              part-time job during my 3 years of studies, so as to gain some
              income and working experience</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>***But</strong> i am still very worried, lost and
              can't seem to solve the following 4 problems:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Money
              problem:</strong> When my dad retires at 70, how am I going to pay
              for all the bills? Though I think my dad has some savings but I
              think it’s not much to last long</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">After i get a
              private degree i will be already abt 26yo and
              with starting pay of abt 2K to 2.3K/mth. Cause from what i
              hear private degree holders get much lesser pay and slower
              pay increment than local gov (NUS/NTU/SMU) degree holders
              right?</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Will i be able to
              hit the 3K/mth mark in 4 years of work when i hit
              30yo? Cause by then my dad will surely retired as he will be
              70 or 71yo already.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As i have roughly
              calculated tat i need to earn abt 3k/mth to be able to pay for
              my mum's expensive medical bills (2k+/mth), house bills, insurance,
              my parents and my daily expenses. With nothing left to
              save which i don't mind as long as my parents are taken care
              off and not have to suffer.</span></li>

              <p>Yes indeed, you are a worry wart Mr Shortcake.</p>
              <p>Your parents can live till 70 years old or not, that is still an unknown.</p>
              <p>Your family is renting or you are living in HDB ?</p>
              <p>Other than your mother's medical bills, how much is the mortgage and how much longer till it's completely paid off ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would suggest you read up on Mr. Tan Kin Lian's blog or website.</p>
              <p><span class="url">www.<strong id="yui_3_1_1_1_1285453785732491">tankinlian.com</strong></span></p>
              <p>http://tankinlian.blogspot.com</p>
              <p>He provides a lot of useful financial/insurance information for people like you. Attend the financial planning workshops when you can.</p>
              <p>As for your point number 2. Perhaps you are refering to government organisation. In the private sector where every industry is result oriented, your work performance is the key to your success.</p>
              <p>How much you can earn after your degree and how fast you get your increment depends on your field of work and the company you work for.</p>
              <p>What kind of profession are you considering ?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>shortcake,</p>
              <p>A degree does not guarantee your career success. What it does is
              increase your career ceiling.</p>
              <p>Higher positions in the corporate world always require a degree
              minimum. But it does not means that anyone with a degree is
              eligible, you still have to prove your capability first.</p>
              <p>However, without a degree, even when you are the best person to
              take that promotion after working hard for years at the company,
              the management will not be able to promote you because you lack
              that piece of paper. You will likely be bypassed by someone more
              junior than you who does have a degree.</p>
              <p>NUS/NTU or other government funded universities are more
              recognized because they are well established and employers know the
              curriculum and standards well.</p>
              <p>If you prefer private, just make sure you go with the well
              established brands, not some kuching kurak Universities name no one
              ever heard of.</p>
              <p>It's all about credibilities. Their teaching staff and
              curriculums.</p>
              <p>People in higher managements are alumnis in private, public
              funded and/or overseas universities themselves. So private or
              public doesn't really matter.</p>
              <p>Personally, I prefer private universities because they tend to
              be more flexible and customer oriented. Although they tend to be
              more expensive. ( I think, so do your research on the costs).</p>
              <p>Good universities , private or public, teach the same core
              subjects anyway ( with minor differences in electives etc.) So
              either way you won't go wrong.</p>
              <p>Know what you are good at, and find your own path.</p>
              <p>You should consult your parents on the financial decision. It's
              foolish to put yourself in a quandary without finding out the real
              position first.</p>
              <p>Your mother's condition is not dire yet. And your father doesn't
              seem to be in a financial fix either.</p>
              <p>If they are willing to financially support you on top of their
              current financial liabilities, then you should graciously accept
              their assistance and do your best in your academic
              achievements.</p>
              <p>All parents wants to be able to provide for their children, it's
              their pride and joy. Besides, it's only for the next 3 years,
              better than having to subsidise you for the rest of your life right
              ?</p>
              <p>The last thing they want is uncertainty on your part. If you are
              unsure of your decision/ability to finish the degree well, then
              it's best you don't waste their money.</p>
              <p>If they clearly expressed their inability to provide financial
              support, then you have to figure out your own way to pay yourself
              through school or seek full time employment.</p>
              <p>However, in life, you have to expect the unexpected. There will
              be situations when events can change all your well thought out
              plans. Just learn to adjust and adapt.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>in fact, have you consider part time degree instead?</p>
              <p>since you are taking a private degree, i would suggest you taking part time degree. reason being, part time degree may take longer but at the same time you may work.</p>
              <p>besides, you are able to study while you are serving your Ns. although i nt sure what vocation you are. so you can start during your ns year perhaps next in take during march? i m not too sure about that. how long to get the degree wise, i m not too sure. perhaps 3 - 5 years? so by working and studying at the same time, you can contribute some $ to the family at the same time further your studies along and gain some working experience. these couple of years might be your hardest years. but then again, if u succeed going thru this years. perhaps your life might change when the day come.</p>
              <p>i m not sure if someone suggest what i have mentioned as i have only read your first post and your last post. so yea. if my suggestion is repeated. then jus ignore. ;)</p>
              <p>i'm also a nsf that is studying con currently.. ;D</p>
              <p>jus my 2cent worth of thoughts dude. ;)</p>

              <p>Mr shortcake,</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, you are excluding the more lucrative professions based on your post.</p>
              <p>While a general management degree is a degree, it is also the most available and the easiest to attain. Meaning there is a big supply pool out there.</p>
              <p>When a profession has a high barrier of entry, high market demand, and limited supply pool, it becomes very lucrative.</p>
              <p>So if you are looking for bigger, faster $$$, taking the easy route ain't gonna cut it.</p>
              <p>That is why professions in science and engineering are so well paid. IT not so much, because of global outsourcing ( ie.India) meaning there's a huge supply pool out there at cheaper costs.</p>
              <p>Think about what kind of position and department you want to work for in a corporation. HR, Legal, PR, Ops, Finance/Accounts, Customer services, Tecnical, RnD, etc. What kind of degree do they look for ?</p>
              <p>Bear in mind that a support based job is not as lucrative as one that brings in revenue for the company.</p>
              <p>In choosing your profession, try to match it to your personality and/or consider your inert abilities.</p>
              <p>Example, Don't go into marketing when your language and communication skills are lousy.</p>
              <p>HR means it's all about policy, implementation and human relations.</p>
              <p>Don't become a teacher if you are impatient and don't like kids (duh~)</p>
              <p>A lot of students choose what they think is easiest to score/complete, but didn't think about if they will fit into these kind of work after they graduate.</p>
              <p>As you go into the workforce, more options will open up for you. Not forgetting NS is a good place to build up your networking buddies.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Father:</strong> 60+ years old, only primary school education, working as a private school bus driver earning about 3K/mth or maybe a little more. He is going to retired in about a few years time as his bus is going to reach its maximum usage age thus needs to be scrapped. And it cost too much to buy a new or secondhand bus as business is not as good as before too many competitors. Not sure what he is going to do after that or just retire and enjoy his old age as he should deserve it, he has been working hard for most of his life, wakes up 5am comes back at 8+pm. I am proud and thankful of him.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

She now can only live if she has a kidney transplant or do not miss her kidney dialysis sessions every week which is very sad. She now has to go Kidney Dialysis 3 times a week at a private dialysis clinic, which cost about $200 each time so tats about $2400/mth excluding medicines, checkup and monthly doctor appointments. Luckily she has a government insurance called “medishield” I think to subsidize her maximum of $1000 every month, but this subsidization has a limit of I think 200K then we are on our own. Therefore, for now my dad still can handle her bills. We tried asking about NKF, but due to my father’s earning it will only be just a little lesser than the private one she is going now which has a good professional doctor and staff and also I heard that NKF staffs are sometimes volunteers in my opinion is not good as it’s a matter of life and death if you what I am trying to say, I believe Life &gt; Money.</span></p>

Has a flat with his wife far away from us. But problem is that his wife controls as in really control all his cash and him, so he has never contributed to the family income since he worked. I am not very close with him due to the age gap, to me he is the root to my main problem as being the eldest son he doesn’t even contribute a single cent even when now my mum has such a serious and expensive illness. But, my mum is ok with that as he is her most favorite son as long as he comes back home to see her she will be very happy already, but sadly such as a easy task he also can’t do due to him been overly controlled by his wife, he doesn’t come back much like only 1 or 2 times a month that’s all. So when my dad retires my parents only has me to depend on, which I don’t think I can handle such important and heavy responsibilities on my own.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Lastly Me:</strong> I am, male, single, 21 years old this year, when I entered NS, I started thinking about my future and all these problems started to surface. I will ORD or finish my NS next year August. I have a Electrical and Electronic Diploma (DEEE) from the Singapore Polytechnics with a GPA of 2.8. But I do not like engineering, just got into the course because I followed my friends, which is one of the bad decisions I made in life. This GPA is not enough to get me into a local university unless it’s a private one like SIM or MDIS. I currently do not know what I want to work as or have a dream job, but I know I do not want to sign on as a regular for the SAF as I need to be in Singapore at all times in case of an emergency at home as my brother is either very hard to contact or nearly impossible to get to.</span></p>

Please leave my brother out of the solutions thanks, as I think he is hopeless unless he leaves his wife, but that is impossible as he love her a lot.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span>1)<span>     </span></span></strong> Should I continue to get a 3 years business degree in one of the private universities after my NS?

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span>2)<span>     </span></span></strong> Money problem: When my dad retires, how am I going to pay for all the bills? Though I think my dad has some savings but I think it’s not much to last long.

              <p><br>Pardon me if i missed out any other details in your later replies. I just browsed through them.</p>
              <p>Do find a chance to talk to your elder brother. Forget about the fact that the both of you aren't close.</p>
              <p>Whether he is married or not, he is still a part of your family and is every bit your parents' son. It's his duty too to take care of your parents, and in your case, your mum's especially.</p>
              <p>Isn't what they always teach us in school? <strong>Filial piety. </strong>Your parents have worked hard to provide for the both of you over the years. It is only to be taken for granted that he should return the favour.</p>
              <p>From my point of view as an outsider, I feel that he hasn't done enough for your mum.</p>
              <p>He could have spend more time with your mum. Perhaps, bringing her for dialysis or check ups. Or he could try to drop by to have meals with your parents whenever he could.</p>
              <p>Yes, he is married now and have to spend time with his wife and also need to have his own personal time <strong>but</strong> it won't hurt him to drop by and visit your parents and spend time with your mum to help sooth her pain and all the suffering that she has to go through because of her kidney failure.</p>
              <p>What your mum needs most now is the care and concern of you guys. She is going through a lot because of her disease. Every parent in the world would miss their kids once they move out and i'm sure, your mum feels the same. Your brother being back often would be sure to lift her spirits.</p>
              <p>Financially, I'm pretty sure, he could have done more for your mum too. He should help to pay for your mum medical expenses since he's already out working and is having a regular income.</p>
              <p>I do not believe in pathetic excuses such as the purse strings are controlled by his wife. He's a guy for goodness sake. And it's his mum here we're talking about. What right does his wife have to stop him to help to fork out part of the medical expenses?</p>
              <p>True, they may have their own plans in the future. Perhaps they are saving up for a kid, for his education or to buy a car. But he ought to do his part as a son too.</p>
              <p>Do have a talk with your dad too. </p>
              <p>Find out more about your family's financial situation. Whether the medical expenses are too heavy a burden for him to handle and what plans does he have after he retires, how is he going to pay for your mum's medical expenses.</p>
              <p>Who knows, it may actually be your dad that doesnt want your elder brother to fork out any money in the first place. </p>
              <p>Or your family's financial situation is actually rather secure and your dad already has retirement plans.</p>
              <p>Don't rush into any decisions without finding out all the facts first. Know about all the facts and then after proper consideration, make the decision that you feel is correct or rather more appropriate.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Hi</strong> all, I am StressBoy, a Singaporean, thank you very much for reading this, any helpful advice, comment or feedback will be sincerely appreciated thanks. Lastly, sorry for being very longwinded here and my poor language used here.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have been facing the following problem, it’s causing me to be stressed and sad everyday and sometimes also angry with myself whenever I think about it. This is sadly a daily affair because it’s a life problem regarding my parent’s and my future.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My Background info:</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Father:</strong> 60+ years old, only primary school education, working as a private school bus driver earning about 3K/mth or maybe a little more. He is going to retired in about a few years time as his bus is going to reach its maximum usage age thus needs to be scrapped. And it cost too much to buy a new or secondhand bus as business is not as good as before too many competitors. Not sure what he is going to do after that or just retire and enjoy his old age as he should deserve it, he has been working hard for most of his life, wakes up 5am comes back at 8+pm. I am proud and thankful of him.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Mother:</strong> 50+ years old, only primary school education, housewife and follows my dad’s bus as a conductor, sadly about 3 years back she suddenly gotten Kidney Failure due to the cause of taking too many medicines since young as my mum has not been a very healthy person, she for example has asthmas. She now can only live if she has a kidney transplant or do not miss her kidney dialysis sessions every week which is very sad. She now has to go Kidney Dialysis 3 times a week at a private dialysis clinic, which cost about $200 each time so tats about $2400/mth excluding medicines, checkup and monthly doctor appointments. Luckily she has a government insurance called “medishield” I think to subsidize her maximum of $1000 every month, but this subsidization has a limit of I think 200K then we are on our own. Therefore, for now my dad still can handle her bills. We tried asking about NKF, but due to my father’s earning it will only be just a little lesser than the private one she is going now which has a good professional doctor and staff and also I heard that NKF staffs are sometimes volunteers in my opinion is not good as it’s a matter of life and death if you what I am trying to say, I believe Life &gt; Money.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Elder Brother</strong>: Late twenties, Married, earning about I think 3 to 4K/mth excluding his wife, not sure how much she earns. Has a flat with his wife far away from us. But problem is that his wife controls as in really control all his cash and him, so he has never contributed to the family income since he worked. I am not very close with him due to the age gap, to me he is the root to my main problem as being the eldest son he doesn’t even contribute a single cent even when now my mum has such a serious and expensive illness. But, my mum is ok with that as he is her most favorite son as long as he comes back home to see her she will be very happy already, but sadly such as a easy task he also can’t do due to him been overly controlled by his wife, he doesn’t come back much like only 1 or 2 times a month that’s all. So when my dad retires my parents only has me to depend on, which I don’t think I can handle such important and heavy responsibilities on my own.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Lastly Me:</strong> I am, male, single, 21 years old this year, when I entered NS, I started thinking about my future and all these problems started to surface. I will ORD or finish my NS next year August. I have a Electrical and Electronic Diploma (DEEE) from the Singapore Polytechnics with a GPA of 2.8. But I do not like engineering, just got into the course because I followed my friends, which is one of the bad decisions I made in life. This GPA is not enough to get me into a local university unless it’s a private one like SIM or MDIS. I currently do not know what I want to work as or have a dream job, but I know I do not want to sign on as a regular for the SAF as I need to be in Singapore at all times in case of an emergency at home as my brother is either very hard to contact or nearly impossible to get to.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Thank You again for your patience for reading the above, I just wanted to be clear and accurate and not miss out on anything important. Please leave my brother out of the solutions thanks, as I think he is hopeless unless he leaves his wife, but that is impossible as he love her a lot.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now for the problems I am and been facing:</span></strong></p>

              <p><br>1) You should continue to get a 3 years education in your desired degree course. BUT YOU SHOULD NOT APPLY FOR A STUDY LOAN FROM BANK. - Because you do not need to be financially burden with paying off your study loan upon graduation.</p>

              <p>It's important for you to break and shatter your own dreams now and begin your career with zero dream.</p>

              <p>4) If you do not understand the importance of saving money at your current stage, you will only end up spending as much as you earned in the future. And that will only bring you back to square one and you can certainly deceive yourself in your future that you just need to earn more money and more money.</p>
              <p>Please take my advice seriously and start learning how to save money and instill it into your blood and core before it is too late for you to do so in your future.</p>

              <p>Because you can only build your own dreams ONLY when you have no existing dreams.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) If you do not understand the importance of saving money at your current stage, you will only end up spending as much as you earned in the future. And that will only bring you back to square one and you can certainly deceive yourself in your future that you just need to earn more money and more money.</p>
              <p>Please take my advice seriously and start learning how to save money and instill it into your blood and core before it is too late for you to do so in your future.</p>

              People who told you to do a degree don't have a freaking clue. A general degree from a local college doesn't get you anywhere these days. But at least you gain a lot from the experience. A degree from a private u is to me practically worthless. And you wanna take on a loan and miss out on 3 years of income for that? 
              
              If I were you I'd look for a sales job. Becoming a realtor is better than selling insurance. Otherwise just get a job and be prepared to do well at it. A few years of working experience will do you good; you can always go back to school in a few years time.

              <p>You see, you will not be suffering from lack of confidence, depression or even low self-esteem if you are a TRAITOR.</p>
              <p>Just take a look at Osama Bin Laden, ex-FBI agent but turned traitor against America, look at how confident he is when he says "Death to America", or when he appeared in one of his funniest home-videos.</p>

              <p>TS, I can't advise you cos I'm facing crossroads in life too, although admittedly much less than yours. However, I am lost as well. I did a science dip, but now holding an accounting job, and don't like it, but idk what else much to do, still thinking, wondering, worrying...I regret the money spent on my accounting studies so far, cos I don't seem to have absorbed anything.</p>
              <p>Maybe put your studies on hold first?? If you are not sure what you want yet. Otherwise it's a waste of money, time and effort...and your sanity. Not to mention you might feel hopeless after sacrificing so much to study something you don't like/hate, and yet you didn't make much progress...don't make the same mistake as me..</p>
