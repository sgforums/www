              <p>The girl incidence is probably another matter and does not link with the birthday matter I guess. That one can just ignore her la. If it really disturbed you so much maybe you could just leave her a message on msn (offline also can) and tell her you are not into her blabla. Just let her know what you feel towards her, don't expect any replies coming from her. I'm sure she will read la. At least let her know thats it.</p>
              <p>Hmm.. I don't think he is rude la. But I don't think you are playing mind games either. The serious thing is probably because there are other much more impt matters than this... Chill man. Next time don't anyhow chip in lor. Usually it's the popular ones that will get more attention<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              haha no no cant la bec she is in teh group and that thing happens long time ago liao if I suddenly brought up the matter then a bit weird.
              I tried to play it off in the first place, but I feel that incident at the club has affected her greatly she "suddenly forgot". Normally shes the co-organiser to other people's birthday.

              hmm we dun go out as a group to select present. Normally they would buy present without the knowledge of others. But they would inform them they getting something for that person.

                          no la i dun blame them for not celebrating in fact i dun celebrate birthday de.I just dunno why they "suddenly forget" (dunno if forget is the word) hahaha
                      They could have sun bain celebrate my birthday wif that girl at waraku. But strange nobody remembers my birthday is also in november like hers. Usually they would analyse whose birthday is in the month we will soon bian celebrate together
                       
                          I think ur right either im just not importantor that girl was too traumatized hahaha.
              
              or either that they are very paiseh if i they were to bring up the my bd topic and continues to "forget"

              <p>To me the word 'Friends' means group of people with common interest.</p>
              <p>Once its over so is the relationship called 'Friends'.</p>
              <p>TS such scenario happen lots of time so take it easy. My current schoolmates is also somewhat like that. When they need help, they flock to you. When you are useless to them/need some help, they can just abandon you to a side/ignore you.</p>
