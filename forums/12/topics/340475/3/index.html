              Just my point of view from reading all your post...
              You keep saying that you dont mind that other "forget" to celebrate your birthday then why you still post this staff??
              The moment you post this mean you mind alot. If you really dont mind about it, you wont keep saying that you dont mind and still keep asking why they forgot...
              And for your infor, in this real world, not everything come in as what we want. You may had plan all your way but some part will still go out of your planing..
              
              Just take me for a example..
              I know that i am not the popular one amount my friend. And i dont alway chip in money for their celebration. I only chip in as and when i like.. As i know for sure they wont do it for me.. And for the past 10 year, i got nobody to celebrate my brithday with me untill i get myself a real close gf.
              Everyyear i being waiting to see who will be the one to be real friend enough to "remember" my birthday. But everyyear i get disappointed. But hey, so what when they forget your birthday?? The sun still come out, the day still shine and the earth still rotate. It not like that you will die when they forget your birthday. It not like that they wont be your friend when they forget your birthday. Ask yourself, you want some truth friend or just some birthday celebrating friend??
              
              If you really want them to "remember" your birthday, you might as well treat them to your "birthday treat". This move will make them have no choice but to buy something back to you.. But this also show that for everything and time you spent on them, you want the same amount of thing and time back..
              
              My only advise to you is that dont think too much on this matter. Remember birthday or not is no big deal. As for that girl, what she want to do is her problem. If you dont like her, why do you care whether she talk to everyone else behind your back but not to you?? She have her freedom to do thing she like.. In the outside world, everyone is wearing a mask.. They can be a "real" friend in front of you. But they wont ask you anyway and anything when you are not in front of them.. Choose your friend carefully. Most of the so call friend we have are the passerby friend. Amount those they will only be a few that can stay and become your thruth friend. Dont need to care much about what other do and say.. As long as you done all your staff right and make sure you got nothing for them to say back can already..
              
              Stay happy is more better than "worry" so much on this tiny little staff right???

              ya thats right im not gonna chip in in the future unless I find the person can be friends. 
                  No la the girl inside the group wait she spread rumors behind my back i how to "hun"? ahaha
                  ren yan ke wei wor...its like backstabbing lor
                  The main organiser normally is the girl and a guy in my group. The guy likes her. So there's something going on btwn him n her i think.
                  I being naive la think that if I treat people well, they will also treat me well. The bdae incident shows these.

              <p>TS such scenario happen lots of time so take it easy. My current
              schoolmates is also somewhat like that. When they need help, they
              flock to you. When you are useless to them/need some help, they can
              just abandon you to a side/ignore you.</p>
              <p>I just hang around them and laugh/joke around but do not commit
