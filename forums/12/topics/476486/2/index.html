              <p><br> I am not sure if he is scared of having no girlfriend. All he said
              to me was that he is interested in this girl and want to know if he
              has a chance. Not everybody can just simply fly into Tacloban and
              ask the nearest aid agency, if he could help out. The place is a
              disaster zone, ground zero, nobody can go there. Besides he needs
              to be trained and have certian skills like doctor or nurse before
              he can qualify to help. Best he can do is to donate some cash, at
              the nearest Oxfam office.</p>

              I wonder why is Jojo biitch talking to itself. Instead of posting useless comments, jojo should look into finding how to avoid turning its kid into a full blown asperger retard.

              <p>I got this friend, he non-stop bug me advice about this girl. I ask you guys, what you think?</p>
              <p>OK my friend had a bad backlash from his ex girlfriend because he was a workaholic. At times he forget to bring his phone, when his ex watsapp him, on something, it took him two days to reply, or when his ex make an appointment, he could not make it due to work responsibilities, his ex would take revenge on him by doing the same at him. Until the day came for the break up so it made him get very anxiety problem…like the way he bug me for advice.</p>
              <p>So here is the story:</p>
              <p>1) This friend due to work stress, he switch job to this <span>MNC</span> factory. There he met this sweet girl, 6 years younger than him. She’s 26, he is 34. He works late then one day she sametime him (office version of yahoo messenger). They would talk all sorts of things till late night…this continued for weeks.</p>
              <p>My friend got interested and ask his colleagues if she is single. One co worker confirm she is single and encourage him to go after her.</p>
              <p>Then one day, she receive two bunch of flowers…my friend got nervous, he wondered if it was a secret admirer. He ask one colleague if its from her boyfriend. His colleague (same one who assured him), just shrug and say it could be because she just graduated ? Or a secret admirer?</p>
              <p>He ask me, i also shrug but i told him to be cautious, because girls just don’t simply receive bouquet of flowers at the office, unless its from her boyfriend. So he gave up.</p>
              <p>2) 6 months later he quit the job because of job stress and can’t get along with boss. He thought all ties were cut…but then this same girl watsapp him to ask him how is he? Then later, she ask him, where he is working…my friend thinking not wanting to give out info so freely (sly of him) ask her to come out and have a drink with him (he call it yam cha session la to make it not look like a date) so he can tell her. But she ask him to come by the factory to say hi to everybody. But he say he now start new job at new place, too far from Tuas la. He waited..but no reply.</p>
              <p>3) So today, he forgot to bring his phone (left it at home)...he call me justnow, bug me again. Ask me if let say she watsapp him to make an appointment, he took one who day to reply, would she take revenge at him? (Next time he wastapp her, she will purposely take 2 or 3 days or never reply to him: like what his ex did)</p>
              <p>First question:<br>I told him if she did means, she is not mature to be his gf. But what you guys think?</p>
              <p>Second question: Do you think a girl that receive two bunch of flowers at office, means she got boyfriend already?</p>
              <p>THird question: What is she trying to do? Is she gaining attention? Or she is dead serious about him? Or he is imagining?</p>
