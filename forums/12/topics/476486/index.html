              I got this friend, he non-stop bug me advice about this girl. I ask you guys, what you think?
              
              OK my friend had a bad backlash from his ex girlfriend because he was a workaholic. At times he forget to bring his phone, when his ex watsapp him, on something, it took him two days to reply, or when his ex make an appointment, he could not make it due to work responsibilities, his ex would take revenge on him by doing the same at him. Until the day came for the break up so it made him get very anxiety problem...like the way he bug me for advice. 
              
              So here is the story:
              
              1) This friend due to work stress, he switch job to this MNC factory. There he met this sweet girl, 6 years younger than him. She's 26, he is 34. He works late then one day she sametime him (office version of yahoo messenger). They would talk all sorts of things till late night...this continued for weeks. 
              
              My friend got interested and ask his colleagues if she is single. One co worker confirm she is single and encourage him to go after her. 
              
              Then one day, she receive two bunch of flowers...my friend got nervous, he wondered if it was a secret admirer. He ask one colleague if its from her boyfriend. His colleague (same one who assured him), just shrug and say it could be because she just graduated ? Or a secret admirer? 
              
              He ask me, i also shrug but i told him to be cautious, because girls just don't simply receive bouquet of flowers at the office, unless its from her boyfriend. So he gave up. 
              
              2) 6 months later he quit the job because of job stress and can't get along with boss. He thought all ties were cut...but then this same girl watsapp him to ask him how is he? Then later, she ask him, where he is working...my friend thinking not wanting to give out info so freely (sly of him) ask her to come out and have a drink with him (he call it yam cha session la to make it not look like a date) so he can tell her. But she ask him to come by the factory to say hi to everybody. But he say he now start new job at new place, too far from Tuas la. He waited..but no reply.
              
              3) So today, he forgot to bring his phone (left it at home)...he call me justnow, bug me again. Ask me if let say she watsapp him to make an appointment, he took one who day to reply, would she take revenge at him? (Next time he wastapp her, she will purposely take 2 or 3 days or never reply to him: like what his ex did)
              
              First question:
              I told him if she did means, she is not mature to be his gf. But what you guys think?
              
              Second question: Do you think a girl that receive two bunch of flowers at office, means she got boyfriend already? 
              
              THird question: What is she trying to do? Is she gaining attention? Or she is dead serious about him? Or he is imagining?

              Crazy la you. You giving want craptatone advice here. 
              
              Be a gentleman? My friend haven't even hit first base. How you know he is lame, you know him personally? Did i say he was blaming vaginas? 
              
              Go back and take care of your mentally deranged son first la before you start talking nonsense. No wonder your son is crazy because the mother also crazy. One day your son could become the Sandy Hook killer, running around with a bushmaster looking for the nearest kindergarden for vaginas girls to shot at.

              Yes like your son. Its karma. He will become forever alone loser.  
              
              Its either that or he bend over and become Bubba's boyfriend....in a jail cell.
              
              I never ask for your advice but since you are here, you should concentrate on your lonely son before he start growing bigger backside and all the gay bubbas in USA start to get attention on him. 
              
              Your son has two paths due to the retard style of his momma. Either he is going to end up dealing drugs, go to jail, become Bubba's girlfriend, bend over everyday. Or he could become sandusky old man's girlfriend, everyday teach him how to play football and after that go to shower, piap piap. 
              
              Second path for your son when he reach 18, he is going to go mad with asperger syndrome, Buy a bushmaster one day and shoot you in bed. Your hubby by then would have divorced you, can't stand a beech wife like you. After that he will look for the nearest kindy, and start firing at them. Later he go to 14th floor, and jump.

              This is normal conversation with a crazy IMH patient Jojobeech, No100201 who kidnap a retart child to pose as her own child. SHe is one of those crazy idiots who kidnap children and keep them as slaves in the house.

              I am a future parent, how can she say that to me? Outrageous.

              Correction, Jojo biitchh, has been the idiot that has been ravaging these forums, providing shiity advice day by day, to poor disillusion youths. 
              
              I have been around to see and know who this Jojo the yo momma with retard son, is. 
              
              I didn't start it, its the Jojo idiot who started it. I tell you this kind of garbage people like Jojo just talk talk  all the way thinking she is so smart, like she can contribute a lot to the GDP of singapore, when she is a refugee who ran away to the USA, seeking asylum with her hamsap husband,, claiming that they were political refugees persecuted by PAP. 
              
              Jojo is a coward and traitor to the singapore cause. SHe knows her son is a wierdo and would die on the first day of national service..due to his weak body and retarded face (look like the sandy hook killer). THat is why she fled to USA to seek Obamacare, so she can exploit the system and get as much free anti-depressants as she can, to feed her obsessed child.

              I am not sure if he is scared of having no girlfriend. All he said to me was that he is interested in this girl and want to know if he has a chance. 
              
              Not everybody can just simply fly into Tacloban and ask the nearest aid agency, if he could help out. The place is a disaster zone, ground zero, nobody can go there. Besides he needs to be trained and have certian skills like doctor or nurse before he can qualify to help. Best he can do is to donate some cash, at the nearest Oxfam office.

              <p><br> Correction, Jojo biitchh, has been the idiot that has been ravaging
              these forums, providing shiity advice day by day, to poor
              disillusion youths. I have been around to see and know who this
              Jojo the yo momma with retard son, is. I didn't start it, its the
              Jojo idiot who started it. I tell you this kind of garbage people
              like Jojo just talk talk all the way thinking she is so smart, like
              she can contribute a lot to the GDP of singapore, when she is a
              refugee who ran away to the USA, seeking asylum with her hamsap
              husband,, claiming that they were political refugees persecuted by
              PAP. Jojo is a coward and traitor to the singapore cause. SHe knows
              her son is a wierdo and would die on the first day of national
              service..due to his weak body and retarded face (look like the
              sandy hook killer). THat is why she fled to USA to seek Obamacare,
              so she can exploit the system and get as much free anti-depressants
              as she can, to feed her obsessed child.</p>

              This jojo is quite stupid and brainless. I post about a friend, and she starts lamenting about my friends, really irrelevant and off topic. Is this how Jojo talks in public? Low IQ. 
              
              No wonder the son is so stupid, I hope one day he meets a nice football coach who will teach him the wonders of bend over, pal, I'll give you all the love in the world. Yeah, Sandusky will be his future mentor. 
              
              See? jojo is running out of topics to insult me, have to copy me somemore. Originally Jojo is the one who fled to America so she can make use of Obama care to obtain free depressants and anti spastic medicine for her spooky child.
