Then they have to worry about her being woo away by other handsome men. So, alot of worrying, for what?<br><br>Same goes to handsome men, my fren got this handsome guy and everytime show off to us, now she find that her bf is very demanding and hard to please him, she is damn worry that he may court any one of us.

Before she is already happily attached. Its been few mths since I started to have feelings for her. i didnt tell her in the begining its because of my inferiority complex. Her boyfriend is my good friend.<br><br>Its been a very long time since I had those feelings. Is it love or is it just infatuation? Or isit just that I need someone to hug me and put her arms arnd my neck and whispered 'I love u' in my ear to make me feel loved.make me feel wanted?? Am I really ready for a relationship with her?? I myself donÂ’t even know the answer to these qns.<br><br>I love her for who she is, not wad she can give me. I donÂ’t care bout her past. When I look in her glistening eyes, i can see a tint of sadness among the happiness in her beyond the happiness is a little girl lost and suffering the constant torture of trying to balance bf, studies and parents itÂ’s a very important year for her this yr. I love her bright and cheerful character. I think of her everyday. I would be happy even if she just called or msg me. But I am very afraid to make my feelings known to her, cause my past experiences keep haunting me the fear and the agony of rejection again is really to much for me to take furthermore my already plummeting confidence in myself keeps hindering me. Many people like her, I donÂ’t think I will even stand a chance if i confess to her, yea who would like to be seen with a fat and ugly bf<br><br>But now she and her boyfriend just broke up. The feelings i have for her is still there. Its been 8 months since i liked her. I tried to bury myself in my work to distract my thoughts but it doesnt work. What shld i do? Should i just wait for her to get over her ex and confess or shld i just keep those feelings to myself.<br><br>I am at a loss.</div></blockquote>What others hve posted are bullshyt no matter how convincing it sounds to u.<br>It's bullsyt.<br>The secret to a better chance is to let yor PERSONALITY SHINE during this time.<br><br>Say if she is pretty,then she will probaly have tons of guys who go gaga over her and desperate to be her toy boy.<br>She is probaly sick and tired of guys who display such attitude.<br>And if u think your chance to being with her is to be one of these guys then u are so wrong.<br>If u are to become like guys whom she previously rejected then your probaly going to join her list of "rejected"<br>Why?<br>Because gals know when a guy is desperate,they can sense it and as pretty like she is,she know and have come across tons of guy like this who are all the same and she knows that she can reject guys like these all she wants<br><br>However,when a pretty gal come across a guy who is inifferent to her and not acting liek the usual guy,she will question herself and start asking herself questions like "why isn't he looking at me like the other guys","is he gay"?<br>THat is what the same feelign which they feel when u constantly think of a gal u like[what she is doing,what does she likes...etc]<br>Of course pls dress well and have a GOOD SENSE OR HUMOR IN A COCKY WAY.[this is VERY important]<br>Eg:when u guys exit from the movie late at night,dun offer to send her home until your 4th meeting.<br>even until your 4th meeting,offer your kindness to send her home but say it like this "It's late and i would like to send u home but i don't do charity so u gotta earn it[get her to treat u lunch/dinner or supper ON ANOTHER DAY]<br>This create another opportunity for u.<br>If she say she can go home herself,be firm and do not let her look thro your dissapointment,end it with a cocky line "dun attract any molestor"<br><br>The main thing is to NEVER EVER make yurself look desperate to the gal.<br>Humour in a cocky way is a GOD ingrident to making gals do the job of wanting to meet u up.<br><br>Good luck.<br>Be fun and relax,just enjoy.<br></div>
