            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nobunaga Oda:</div><div class="quote_body">Few months back, I developed a fondness for someone I shldnt have. Before she is already happily attached. Its been few mths since I started to have feelings for her. i didnt tell her in the begining its because of my inferiority complex. Her boyfriend is my good friend.<br><br>Its been a very long time since I had those feelings. Is it love or is it just infatuation? Or isit just that I need someone to hug me and put her arms arnd my neck and whispered 'I love u' in my ear to make me feel loved.make me feel wanted?? Am I really ready for a relationship with her?? I myself donÂ’t even know the answer to these qns.<br><br>I love her for who she is, not wad she can give me. I donÂ’t care bout her past. When I look in her glistening eyes, i can see a tint of sadness among the happiness in her beyond the happiness is a little girl lost and suffering the constant torture of trying to balance bf, studies and parents itÂ’s a very important year for her this yr. I love her bright and cheerful character. I think of her everyday. I would be happy even if she just called or msg me. But I am very afraid to make my feelings known to her, cause my past experiences keep haunting me the fear and the agony of rejection again is really to much for me to take furthermore my already plummeting confidence in myself keeps hindering me. Many people like her, I donÂ’t think I will even stand a chance if i confess to her, yea who would like to be seen with a fat and ugly bf<br><br>But now she and her boyfriend just broke up. The feelings i have for her is still there. Its been 8 months since i liked her. I tried to bury myself in my work to distract my thoughts but it doesnt work. What shld i do? Should i just wait for her to get over her ex and confess or shld i just keep those feelings to myself.<br><br>I am at a loss.</div></blockquote>Everyone got their needs and wants?Afterall,we are all humans!You try and you will know,you never try you will never know.It that is what you really want,go for it.Don't like fear stop you!There is nothing to fear.It's in your mind how you think.After when you die,you can't even try!you got nothing to lose! go for it!</div>
