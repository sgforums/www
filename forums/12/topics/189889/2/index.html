            <div class='col-md body'>Stereotyping is what I see in the people discussing this thread. Maybe itÂ’s because of the surrounding that affected our thinking. The things that people of different race do portray the way we think about them.<br><br>Take my race, Chinese, as example. Why in Singapore, people do not call notorious hooligans gangster, but instead they call them Â“Ah BengÂ” or Â“Ah SengÂ” or Â“Ah LianÂ”? Does that sound like Malays or IndiansÂ’ names to you? The answer is no, because we got used to seeing Chinese gangster, with hot streak golden hair, hanging around doing nonsensical acts and naturally weÂ’re lead to the thinking that Â“Ah BengÂ” are Chinese who always gets into fights.<br><br>Why do people say Indians smells? Go to Little India. I can greatly assure that 9 out of 10 non-Indian Singaporean will find the place stinky. But what can we do about it? If you can take it (the smell), good, go ahead and stay. Else walk away without any sign or gesture indicating that Â“Hey! You smell! Get outta here!Â”<br><br>Why do people have the thinking that Malays are lazy? I suggest you that a look around your neighborhood, especially under the void decks and the parks. Who do you see on those benches and slacking?<br><br>Sometimes if you have a thinking that affects the entire surrounding, my suggestion would be to best keep it in your heart. =)<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.... i guess i see ur poit... as a member of a minority, i have to admit.. when chinese burn their stuff all around the neighbourhood its very annoting.. when they spit all over the place.. it bugs me... when they speak in chinese in the presence of other races in a group is very rude.... when they pass remarks about other races it infuriating.  I guess its all the way people live.<br><br>I Dont expect the way people live their lives to change. These are all petty issues. It does not bug me if a yellow man calls a brown man balck. Thats stupidity...<br><br>What annoys me is that when it comes to issues like emplyment, race plays quite a significant factor. It is most evident from the eyes of a minority.</div>

It pushes the seed of racism (lack of understanding) deeper within individuals and hence society.<br><br>To be tolerent does not mean being understanding.. it mean u have to supress ur actual feelings, pushing them into regression while putting on a smile. Its ignoring the problem rather then solving it.<br><br>Tacit msgs of hate will be passed on from father to son in homes. Explicit acts of racism will not blatently be displayed, utill an opportunity presents itself.<br><br>The thing is.. the policy of tolerence is a time bomb. It tells people to see the lines that define race and stay witin ur own boundaries. It does not tell u to integrate as a people " regardless of race, religion or colour" It breeds seprate identities. Not one identity. The Army works cuz sections and teams build one identity. Same with any good team.<br><br>Singapore with the government's current attitude towards race is a ticking bomb.</div>
