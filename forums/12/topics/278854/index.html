It's so hard to tell whether she feels the same way for me or not. After the jc jae admission, we had some class outings and everyone in class exchanged msn and handphone number and etc. After I added her on msn, the very next day, she initiated a conversation with me and we just kept talking and talking, for about 6 hours I think.<br><br>From then on, we have always talked a lot on msn.

We can talk a lot via msn or sms, but in school, she just seems so indifferent to me. We hardly talk to each other 1 on 1 (i am usually too shy to) but I don't know about her.

We can talk so much via msn and stuff, but she just becomes so different when we see each other in school. On the contrary, she seems to talk more to other guys as compared to me. I don't know what she feels about me though, since we have gone out together alone to town, to libraries or Macs to mug, etc etc a few times.

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not just based on how she's so chatty with me on MSN, but all the times we've been out together alone, we can talk so freely, click so easily, laugh so much together, that I really feel a bond with her, something I have never felt before with anyone, not even my ex girlfriends. I don't know if she feels the same way as well, so we're like stagnant now. And even nowadays we're also starting to drift slightly apart in MSN as well, initiating less conversation than last time.

It's so hard to tell whether she feels the same way for me or not. After the jc jae admission, we had some class outings and everyone in class exchanged msn and handphone number and etc. After I added her on msn, the very next day, she initiated a conversation with me and we just kept talking and talking, for about 6 hours I think.<br><br>From then on, we have always talked a lot on msn. Can talk for hours at a time, and we can just simply click so well and our msn conversations will never run out of topics even though we talk so much on msn. What's more, she's usually the one who initiates the msn conversation, cause I am more of the shy type who hardly initiates msn convos with girls.<br><br>However, here comes the problem. We can talk a lot via msn or sms, but in school, she just seems so indifferent to me. We hardly talk to each other 1 on 1 (i am usually too shy to) but I don't know about her. We only talk occasionally in school to each other, and even so, we don't talk that much unless we do group work together or something.<br><br>I don't know whether she likes me or not. We can talk so much via msn and stuff, but she just becomes so different when we see each other in school. On the contrary, she seems to talk more to other guys as compared to me. I don't know what she feels about me though, since we have gone out together alone to town, to libraries or Macs to mug, etc etc a few times. She also mentioned my name a couple of times in Friendster bulletins when she's doing some friend test like "Give the name of a guy" or something. Just the 2 of us, and yet we seem so distant in school.<br><br>Any help?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Why are we so distant in school? </div></blockquote>Yo, leave the gal alone, she wants to finish her studies first ya.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>should have known better if you have ex girlfriends in the past..<br><br>i have to disagree with some of the posts here, the important thing is if you dont establish that kind of friendly "touch" ( im talking about those acceptable places like hands, arms, hair, not face she thinks you treat her like puppy, or under the waist) in the earlier period of getting to know her, like you said you had opportunities going out with her alone. Its in every girl's instinct. Best is if she returns your touch in the supposedly " first few dates" that you have met her.<br><br>if not, you will forever end up on friends street. Courtship is just like a bubble that can be burst anytime. For all you know, you might have ruined it. Trust me when i say its better to be dumped than to remain friends. The exams could be just an excuse.</div>
