AA will always welcum u back anytime...<br><br>i knoe i would~ ^_^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>t|rEd:<br>u silly girl... u still young to go out and see the world. U deserve to have someone to love you, to cuddle u... Not that I'm saying u dun have, but like wat babyacid said, u r over-exposed, hence u r afraid to step into a r/s. Well, maybe getting involved to early in this forum does change some of ur opinions in life, esp in love. I still want a big treat from u in abt 9-12 yrs down the road.<br><br>I understand wat u mean abt losing the 'feel'.. I have these feelings too.. Think u spoke my heart out too. Well, if u notice, I seldom do much advising nowadays, more on crapping. Taking babyacid's post (which I'm sorry that I din contribute much), I only replied once, but still read the post though just that I can't find the feel to reply. Coz sincere and keep-u-company post are different.<br><br>Me also know that u dun want reply for ur things that u said. It's ur style, and have seen it ard for the past few mths working together in this forum. that's y I never counsel when I reply ur post, but only want to hear u out. Furthermore seeing u like a mirror reflection of myself, coz I'm more or less like u too. Prefer to listen and help others, and solve my own problems.  but just want u to know that if u need an outlet to vent ur frustrations, a shoulder to cry on, a person for u beat, or an arm for u to bite, I'll always be there... Always there for u...<br><br>Will miss you... and will always be happy to hear from you and welcome you back... Can keep in contact or not?? But dun expect me to msg ur mother's hp all the time horz.. hee hee.. kind of scary by the idea to go thru someone to have a msg passed to u, though the msgs dun carry sensitive words.<br><br>Okie.. I'm kind of sad now though.. but still got one phrase of crap. Ur application for unlimited no-pay-leave is granted.. hee hee...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Duties will be covered by Bear.. haa haa..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Take care...
