Or maybe you think you dun look presentable enough outside? Well, these kind of things are always connected.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe its time that u open up ur social circle, networking, activities<br><br>to bring up your self esteem, confidence and lower ur overwhelming self consciousness.<br><br>u already stated that u know that pple ard u are understanding. its your thinking of reproaching urself that u are neurotic over n over again that makes things go in a vicious cycle. (if u know wat i mean)<br><br>u need to change your thinking into a more healthy one.<br>naturally, humans contantly seek to be in an environment to be in a happy disposition to make themselves feel better. you shld too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u know the reasons and I think it's rather brave of u to voice them out. You have done nothing wrong anyone or to yourself,so stop feeling embarrassed abt it. No doubt you are at low point of your life but i feel this is the right time for you to bounce back stronger than ever. Have more faith in youself. Rem, u are out to prove to no one,but yourself, that you can overcome urself and the obstacles facing u.<br><br>Adapting or readjusting to the increasingly chaotic pace and stressful lifestyle is already not a easy feat for most of ppl who have jobs now, let alone you.</div>
