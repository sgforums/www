              <p>I heard his Mum used to be a whore for Japanese soldiers back in WW2, so that's why he is so familiar and descriptive about many lewd sexual acts.</p>

              Sexless, I don't think this forum can help u much.
              
              I think u  have being very patient, seriously. A relationship without sex...might as well just be friends. But since you already decide to marry her, you have to go through this with her.
              
              From what I read about what you wrote, I can see a few problems.
              
              1) Her self-esteem is a major issue. If she does not feel she is attractive enough for you, does a boob job makes her feel better? Ask her why she feels not good? Maybe both of u can join gym together and do some physical activity together?
              
              2) Her friends are also important influence factor. If she has close gfs, ask them to communicate with her. Maybe they can even teach her how to enjoy her own body because we men will never understand woman as much as their own kind does. 
              
              3) Her upbringing ~ understand her upbringing is important because maybe she was instill the mindset that sex is a dirty thing. Abortion is bad and do leave scars on woman. Woman like mind-fuck so u must constantly reassure her that u are hers, you belongs to her instead of the other way round. 
              
              4) Finally, stress to her how important this marriage is for both of you. If she have the intention in saving this marriage. I am sure she will try but instead of just jumping into bed you can slowly teach her to like your body like how you like her. Ways of doing so is like shower together, rubbing her back for her, cuddling [not petting]. Don't relate physical contact just to sex, show her physical contact is a form of love and communication and sex is the ultimate union between 2 person [communication without words]
              
              Ok, that all from me. 
              
              I hope your marriage works out, u are a nice guy I must say. If you are bad person like what those ppl in the forum says, u would just walk out of your wife as there are so many fishes in the ocean. The fact u took the effort to write and seek solution shows you love her. I hope you guys give sexless a break and respect ppl's problem.

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have been contemplating to post on this forum but I feel the need to rant a bit and hopefully get some useful advice for my situation. As the thread title says, I'm in a sexless marriage.</p>
              <p>I will provide details of my relationship with my wife and some details of myself that will not compromise the privacy of my wife and myself.</p>
              <p>To start off, I have known my wife for 5 years and we decided to tie the knot last year. My wife was a virgin when I dated her although she was with her ex-bf for 7 years (not that it matters to me). On the other hand, I have dated several girls before and been in a couple of sexual relationships. When I got to know my wife, she was still with her ex-bf but of course, their relationship was in a very bad shape. Her bf sort-of cheated on her by allowing himself to be seduced by a girl naked in her dormitory, but he did not have sex with her. To summarise, my wife felt the need to move on from this man and date someone else.</p>
              <p>At the time where I first got to know my wife through a friend, I was not attracted to her. Also, I was dating a stewardess at that time so it has never cross my mind to consider dating her, until some events took place. I think it all started with my birthday party, stewardess was supposed to come but couldn't make it and my wife came to the party. After the party, a few of my friends and myself went to a park for drinks and  I asked my wife along because I felt that she was feeling down at that time and I wanted to cheer her up. On my actual brithday, my wife asked me out for a movie and I agreed and of course, she wished me a happy birthday. From there on, I started to look at my wife in a different way, and we started dating each other. I like my wife for her intelligence, her common interest with me and similar views on many aspects of life. So stewardess girl was out of the picture and I eventually marry my wife at the age of 27.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now on to the sexuality part.. My wife was a virgin, I was her first sexual partner but it was not easy. It took several tries before I was able to have intercourse with her as she was feeling great pains as I try to penetrate. At that point, I knew that my wife requires encouragement in-order to have sex as she feels more pain that pleasure out of it. In our first few years of relationship, the frequnecy of our sex is about 2 times a month which I feel is not a good frequency. Then, something happened.. she got pregnant. Both of us made a decisive decision to abort it during her first few weeks of pregnancy as both of us are not ready for a child at that time. (You can call me names if you want, perhaps I deserve it) That was the turning point of our sexual life, it turned for the worst. After abortion, we did not have sex for a year.. not even petting. Prior to getting married we did have sex once in 6 months although we could not complete the full intercourse as she was experiencing discomfort. During our trip to Japan, we did not have sex either. A few months before our marriage, I had a talk with her about our sexual relationship and asked her about the possible reasons of the pain. She said that it is probably because she was scared to get pregnant again. I tried to help her by introducing a vibrator, game and lubricant but to no avail. I also managed to persuade her to visit the gynae to check if there is anything wrong with her vagina, there wasn't. Anyway, I still love my wife despite her seemingly asexual behavior and decided to marry her thinking that perhpas after marriage things will get better for us.</p>
              <p>Well, things did not get better. During the few days in our hotel after the wedding dinner, we did not have sex at all. Whenever I try to touch her intimately, she would be irritated and reject me. After a few attempts, I got fraustrated and laid in the bathtub for an hour refusing to talk to her. At that time, I almost felt like crying. It has been 6 months since we tied the knot and we only had sex once though it was not a full intercourse.On one occasion, feeling fraustrated after a rejection from her, I threaten her saying that she should be prepared to face the consequences. I ignored her after that and just focused on sleeping. A few weeks later, I brought up the issue of our sexual life again. I told her how I have been feeling and that I still feel disappointed about what happened on the wedding night. Feeling fraustrated, I told her that I have thrown in the towel and I have lost interest in having sex with her. She kept quiet and did not say much.</p>
              <p>I think I'm a person with high libido, so I needed to have an avenue to meet my needs. My wife allows me to watch porn and masturbate, so I have been doing this in order to keep myself from feeling depressed. Recently, I found an article that might be related to her problem so I forward to my wife and she concurs with the conditions she is facing in that article. She is probably having this condition called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginismus">Vaginismus</a>. The only friend that I've told of my situation advised me to persuade my wife to see a sexologist which she agrees to. The relationship with my wife is seemingly good and we are going to Greece on our honeymoon next week. I'm currently fraustrated that she is so passive on our sexual problem and it seems to me that she do not compremend the seriousness of the situation.</p>
              <p>I hope that someone can offer some valuable advice on how to improve my current situation and no, I'm not going to visit prostittues in Geylang or have an affair.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your time reading this, I know it is kind of long winded.</p>

              <p>Hi Dude,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think you have a very real problem that needs professional help. Imo sex is integral to a relationship especially if yer already married. Visit a female psychiatrist GH (I think female can relate to her better and she will be more willing to open up to same sex) and if needed she will escalate the problem to the respective department. My gut feeling is that after the abortion she sort of dislikes sex. And to top it off she did not seem to enjoy it from start more so of a chore becos of partners needs (which is normal).</p>

              <p>I think you might have pushed it abit this time. The chap had sex 2 times a month... i seriously cannot understand how that comes across as having a high sex drive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think if a guy can continue to love a woman through marriage with having sex 2 times a month that is something (clap clap). In fact I'll be surprised if divorce papers weren't filed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Honestly it's between the 2 of them. In this case I assume the wife has also admitted it is a problem (scared of being pregnant or whatever).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sex to a guy is more of a physical need and he does not really need emotions to be involved as compared to a girl whereby emotions help out. It's similar to eating.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think if he is already doing his handjobs to help relieve the problem it is a good start.</p>

              <p>If girls believe that marriage is all about love and sex is like a reward i.e. fish for the dolphon in the zoo when he does something right...oink oink.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then how about marriage being just all about love and guys find sex with whores. We get sex and love. Girls get love and no sex. Whores get $. Win win win.</p>

              <p><br>Genie, how come you can so easily believed that TS only had sex 2 times a month and you don't believe what I have wrote?</p>
              <p>Is it because TS didn't tell you how often he had to ask for sex and how he reacted in a not so (clap clap) manner towards his wife whenever he got rejected and felt frustrated towards his wife?</p>
              <p>Is it because TS failed to write it out in black and white how disappointed and angry he was during those times when he had failed to obtain sex from his wife?</p>
              <p>You want to tell me again about the love which he had continued to love his wife?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you really need TS to write out all the ugly things that he had "forgotten" to include in details about himself before you feel NOW is the right time to tell him off?</p>
              <p>If TS had written out all his ugly thoughts, I would say he is ready to learn to be a better man and deserves to be forgiven for what he have done.</p>
              <p>I will do your (clap clap) for TS if he had told us that he haven't tried to had sex with the wife because his wife was uncomfortable about it. How do you want me to do the clapping when he did threatened his wife into submission?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Honestly, it's between the two of them and he should not have posted in here if he or you cannot stand to hear this kind of replies from me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are a guy and that's why you supported him and I believed you would've done the same things as him and yet feels so right about doing so. You guys are really all the same isn't it?</p>
              <p>It's true that love begins from the lower part of the body for guys and love begins from the upper part of the body for girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really, if you feel like giving TS your support because you are able to side with him like he is your son, I also hope you can also side with TS's wife like she is your own daughter.</p>
              <p>Would you have agreed with your son-in-law and tell him that you're sorry because you believed the problem lies in your own daughter?</p>
              <p>Do you believe you need me to tell you this so that you will then start looking clearer at the many things that were not written in this situation?</p>

              <p>Actually apart from his trolling, what he said is true. Sex is a part of marriage. Like i said before, You can lust on someone without being in love. You cannot be in love with a person if you do not lust on her/him.Except Platonic Love. Lust (or lechery) is a craving for sexual intercourse, sometimes to the
              point of assuming a self-indulgent or violent character. Lust, or a

              <p>Sex is part of marriage -&gt; when come to this kind of topic that will greatly affect the self-interest and benefits of guys, I will see many guys becoming self-righteous all of the sudden.</p>
              <p>So what do you all think about sex before marriage? Is that right also? Would you also allow your daughter to be fucked by her many bfs before she get married? Would you also agreed if your future gf/wife also got fucked by many other guys before she marries you?</p>
              <p>So what do you think of guys visiting whores and prostitutes? Is that right also? Would you allowed your daughters to marry guys who have frequent whores and prostitutes before?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bottomline, guys who behaved casually about sex before they were married, simply do not have the RIGHTS to come here and act self-righteous about it.</p>
              <p>Please take a good look at your own life and how you have lived your life first, before you come here and tell me you DESERVED to be treated fairly about your moral demands regarding sex in marriage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And don't mix up sex with love. You can still love one another even though both of you are no longer capable of having sex with each other. You will still continue to love one another even though both of you no longer desired for each other's bodies. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So nowadays guys are more likely to dump their wives when they are no longer desirable to provide sex for them in a marriage?</p>

              <p>You fail to realise that women actually have needs. But because men having a penis and having a different body structure, we crave for sex more. And yes blame us.</p>
              <p>And as for your questions, its up to your beliefs and morals on how you treat sex seriously or casually . Each of those questions have may have different answers also. And as how i lead my life, who are you to question me ? Have i questioned yours ?</p>
              <p>I didnt mix them up. Last post :  <strong>You can lust on someone
                                          without being in love. You cannot be in love with a person if you

              <p>I think sex is just part of marriage. If you are in so much agony about a sexless marriage then you probably should get a wfie or woman with higher sex drive. You can balance that with treats just like dogs. words, money, surprises, fetishes all can contribute to adding spice to marriage in terms of the sex part.</p>
