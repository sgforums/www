              <p>You fail to realise that women actually have needs. But because men having a penis and having a different body structure, we crave for sex more. And yes blame us.</p>
              <p>And as for your questions, its up to your beliefs and morals on how you treat sex seriously or casually . Each of those questions have may have different answers also. And as how i lead my life, who are you to question me ? Have i questioned yours ?</p>

              <p>But If you are talking about the TS, If that guy is a sex manic and overly demanding of his wife to satisfy him, his wrong to put the blame on his wife.</p>

              To Parn and JoJo,
              
              Please don't judge TS unless you know him personally.
              
              Also Parn, calling woman whom enjoy sex = sluts is so wrong. 
              
              What's wrong with woman enjoying sex?
              
              In this time and age, people's mind is still so narrow mind. Is this the majority Singaporean speaking? If a HUSBAND wants to have sex with WIFE is immoral, I think you people should be sent to middle-east and start wearing veils and u really know what is being a WIFE about.
              
              Finally, I assume jojo and parn are girls whom seems like on their way to become man-hater.

              <p>Please don’t judge TS unless you know him personally.</p>
              <p>Also Parn, calling woman whom enjoy sex = sluts is so wrong.</p>
              <p>What’s wrong with woman enjoying sex?</p>
              <p>In this time and age, people’s mind is still so narrow mind. Is
                      this the majority Singaporean speaking? If a <span>HUSBAND</span> wants to have sex with <span>WIFE</span> is immoral, I think you people should be sent to middle-east and
                      start wearing veils and u really know what is being a <span>WIFE</span> about.</p>
              <p>Finally, I assume jojo and parn are girls whom seems like on

              have lust to men too, but is it considered immoral and dirty ?</p>
              <p>But If you are talking about the TS, If that guy is a sex manic

              <p>Lust IS a dirty word. But.. lusting after a whore/prostitute.. now that's normal for a dirty man.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>Like yourself, I married in my late 20s, and now ard your age, sex is dwindling to a stage where the possibility of striking toto is higher than having sex.</p>
              <p>I also do not understand why women can survive without sex, or any form of sexual phsyical contact. To be fair, they probably wouldn't know why we need it too. My wife also allows me to release my frustration by way of masturbating through porn and other material, but this kind of relationship is a little trying. How does one justify a relationship or marriage without sex?</p>
              <p>Some of the women here(I do not want to name who) think we treat our wives like prostitue just because we want sex, but this isn't the case. We want it because we need it! I know far too many men who go for alternatives like Geylang to seek out their urges, but there are still some of us who love our wives enough with the discipline or morality not to step into this stage.</p>
              <p>However, I do not agree that you should try to lower your libido by way of medication. We are who we are! 2 strangers who live together, should try to compensate and accept each other as they are, and not try to change their partner. All the views which we have given, are well...just views and suggestions. It is still up to you to make the decision.</p>
              <p>Normally, if 2 person have some kind of problem, a 3rd party person like counsellor would be good to help, provided both agreed to go. It may not necessarily solve the problem, but it will let each other see a different perspective of the relationship.</p>
              <p>So, good luck to your efforts to for a better sex life :)</p>

              Good luck in finding a man then.
              
              I think u got better chances being a lesbian.
              
              They actually have a medicial term for it call "Lesbian bed death" because lesbians have less sex than any other type of couple, and they generally experience less sexual intimacy the longer the relationship lasts. 
              
              If a woman does not want sex with men, I seriously would advice them to consider.
              
              So Jojo + parn seems like a great couple together, I think u 2 should hook up instead of hating "lame" man in the forum.

              <p>Yes, I have taken a look in the mirror lately, and no, I do not
              look all that bad.</p>
              <p>Not all guys boast about how they were long long time ago. I
              assume you met the wrong ones. I can put in some effort to flame
              you back, but it is pretty pointless because your views are already
              fixed.</p>
