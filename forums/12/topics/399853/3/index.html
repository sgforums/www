              <p>Since you have already decided to see a specialist about your wife's problem, then why don't you go for the appointment first and see how it works out?</p>
              <p>By the way, the previous posters all have their points. You may have been neglecting your wife's emotional needs. So take note of that and try not to stress her anymore. Sex involves both parties, so you have to share some of the burden/fault/responsibility too. Concentrate on the problem at hand and quit getting upset and blaming your wife.</p>

              <p>Erm.. I dont think your talks with her kinda work.. when u get down to talk u need to forgo some ego n wateva.. she doesn seem to express what she feels deep in.. yea i believe sex in part of marriage n r/s , petting n cuddling will lead to it one, every1 shud enjoy..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anw.. i read some article sometime ago, a women n her teacher husband cant have sex cos she feels pain whenever it happens, in the end after giving birth, she is very comfortable with having sex n no pain anymore.. i know u might not be in the financial condition, but if u plan a little there might be compromisition in terms of finance..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also.. if u get a not turned on girl, or quite innocent girl a dildo n try to lick her private areas.. its like giving a primary 1/2 sch boy a bj.. remember u primary sch boy time when hormones not so active, these kinda stuff u might even feel disgusting.. fetishes like these (dildoing, oral) doesn seem attractive but disgusting at a low hormonal level, it just starts to come after u become more experienced n that will translate into excitement at this point of time.. start her by softcore sex ba.. n i think she needs more foreplay..</p>

              <p>I understand the reason for posting harsh comments 
              on me but I did not marry my wife because she is a virgin. According to 
              the points I have posted on the 1st page, my wife was no longer a virgin
               prior to being married.</p>
              <p>I have read through all the comments 
              and suggestions given in this thread and did some self reflection and 
              analysis of my relationship with my wife. I think my wife is happy with 
              me, simply because whenever I meet her for dinner after work, she would 
              give me a warm smile and hug. Also, our communication is good, we laugh 
              together at things, watch Nat Geo once in awhile and always make the 
              effort to go out for nice dinners. I plan to make an appointment with a 
              sexologist after my Greece trip and I would like to update the outcome 
              of it here, perhaps it might help someone else looking in this thread. </p>
              <p>I
               would like to add more details about the sexual relationship between my
               wife and myself and also our reasons for the abortion and the 
              unreadiness to have kids now. (We plan to have kids 1-2 years down the 
              road)</p>
              <p>I'll touch on the abortion part first. When my wife was 
              pregnant, she was not ready to start a family yet because she was in the
               midst of advancing in her career and her efforts in her own interest 
              (can't say what it is) is paying off in both publicity and finance. I 
              was not really ready for a family at that time because I was in the 
              first year of university and I feel that it will have an impact on my 
              wife. Actually, we were not strongly against having a baby but my wife 
              and I have both discussed that we were not ready to provide a condusive 
              environment for the baby. We made a quick decision because we do not 
              want to wait till the baby develops consciousness before making a 
              decision.</p>
              <p>After the abortion, we went through some counselling 
              with the gynae and my wife took contraceptive pills for a few weeks. She
               complains that she feels depressed after taking the pills. So I asked 
              her to stop taking the pills, although we did not have sex. We were both
               affected by that abortion incident which might be the reason why we did
               not have sex for over a year(I did not attempt to have sex either).</p>
              <p>Onto
               my wife's physical condition, I think part of the reason why she was 
              afraid to engage in sex is because she developed UTI on a few occasions 
              after intercourse. Also, her gynae commented that her vagina is shaped 
              downwards instead of upwards, she did not comment specifically on how it
               will affect exccept that we should try different positions. My wife 
              used to have Eczema which left some scars on her body, which shes says 
              she feels not sexy about it but she gradually do not take notice of it 
              through my encouragement. Recently, she developed some kind of fungus 
              infection on her back, I helped her rub some anti fungus cream last 
              night. She told me that she hopes that the fungus would go away soon so 
              that she can do some night activities with me (I did not advance or hint
               in anyway to her about sex), I just hug her to sleep.</p>
              <p>Actually, I
               think that my wife might be bisexual. She watches porn and she likes to
               see girls with big boobs. Sometimes she will joking say(I think) that 
              if I manage to find a big boob sexy girl, don't forget to ask her along.
               I told her that a sexual relationship other than a heterosexual one is 
              not a good idea because if I have sex with the other girl, it might have
               an emotional impact on both of us. Although she does not enjoy having 
              sex with me now, she does enjoy watching me ejaculate in front of her, 
              she finds it sexy.</p>
              <p>As for having kids now, my wife still isn't 
              ready for it. She says perhaps in 1-2 years time when she is ready to 
              give up her career and her interest. As for me, I'm facing quite a 
              number of issues that requires my attention. There are 2 important 
              issues at hand. the 1st is that I need to help my brother with getting a
               job because he suffered and has recovered from bi-polar mania. 2nd is I
               am making a career switch so I feel I need 1 or 2 years to settle down 
              in the new industry that I will be in. There are also a couple of 
              concerns on my mind that puts me off from having a kid like the 
              competitivesness of the contemporary society, a possible nuclear war 
              etc. I just don't want my kid to suffer these things.</p>
              <p>So I'll be 
              the best I can for my wife this coming honeymoon to Greece and I'll 
              update on the progress of our sexual relationship after a visit to a 
              sexologist.</p>

              <p>I think better also consult a marriage counsellor also, just chat on the phone or go down personally alone of course. Best to keep it hush hush and not tell your wife. Consult on your problems, your views and her condition and see what to do for the next step. On your honeymoon trip, just treat it as a dating trip, nothing else. And yes woman have emotional needs, but men also have their sexual needs.</p>
              <p>For society wise, it is always competitive and more and more
              competitive. Idono whats with the nuclear war cool story there. If
              you want to further talk about it, we can.</p>
              <p>And as for people posting in here, just treat their comments with a pinch of salt. Some have their views, and maybe their personal experience affected their ability to give advice, and thus lead to flames.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>After the abortion, we went through some counselling with the
                                      gynae and my wife took contraceptive pills for a
               few weeks. She
                                      complains that she feels depressed after taking 
              the pills. So I
                                      asked her to stop taking the pills, although we 
              did not have sex.
                                      We were both affected by that abortion incident 
              which might be the
                                      reason why we did not have sex for over a year(I
               did not attempt to
                                      have sex either).</p>
              <p>Onto my wife's physical condition, I think 
              part of the reason
                                      why she was afraid to engage in sex is because 
              she developed UTI on
                                      a few occasions after intercourse. Also, her 
              gynae commented that
                                      her vagina is shaped downwards instead of 
              upwards, she did not
                                      comment specifically on how it will affect 
              exccept that we should
                                      try different positions. My wife used to have 
              Eczema which left
                                      some scars on her body, which shes says she 
              feels not sexy about it
                                      but she gradually do not take notice of it 
              through my
                                      encouragement. Recently, she developed some kind
               of fungus
                                      infection on her back, I helped her rub some 
              anti fungus cream last
                                      night. She told me that she hopes that the 
              fungus would go away
                                      soon so that she can do some night activities 
              with me (I did not
                                      advance or hint in anyway to her about sex), I 
              just hug her to
                                      sleep.</p>
              <p>Actually, I think that my wife might be 
              bisexual. She watches
                                      porn and she likes to see girls with big boobs. 
              Sometimes she will
                                      joking say(I think) that if I manage to find a 
              big boob sexy girl,
                                      don't forget to ask her along. I told her that a
               sexual
                                      relationship other than a heterosexual one is 
              not a good idea
                                      because if I have sex with the other girl, it 
              might have an
                                      emotional impact on both of us. Although she 
              does not enjoy having
                                      sex with me now, she does enjoy watching me 
              ejaculate in front of
                                      her, she finds it sexy.</p>

              <p>Hmm.. its bit complicated i see...</p>
              <p>Mayb the vagina shaping really kinda affected the ability to contract for sex n birth.. maby she will need a caecerian nxt time..</p>
              <p>i understand the ezima thingy, but does she exercise quite regularly? exercise helps alot, when the body is healthy natural things like this comes.. Look at how some developing countries n how the women work alot physically, housework and workplace, rather than dormen lifestyles of women in countries like ours.. places like india.. they dont even feel much from giving birth, like its very natural, some freak stories of babies even droping into toilet bowls at subway trains n they didn even notice until they hear crying, den they realise they gave birth..</p>
              <p>yea then mayb u can have a babies 1 or 2 years down the road, jus dont be too late.. there are -ve implicatns too.. Dont be afraid of nuclear war or wateva.. everything comes with a risk.. lifes would not be totally complete until u have gone thru that n have new experiences as a father n learn stuffs from there.</p>

              <p>Seriously, I think you should not have any children.</p>
              <p>Your wife and you should just strive your best at your careers for life.</p>
              <p>For no better reason than a looming nuclear war, that would throw the world economy off.</p>
              <p>As for sex, the only problem is you wanting sex. Other than that there is no problem. Your wife has a condition only, vaginismus.</p>
              <p>When you did not know of her condition, ok, you were ignorant, and tried to push it and aggravated her condition. But when you know, you again aggraveted her condition by issuing a threat. Its no wonder that she has such a serious case of clamping shut. The aggravating causes goes: unknown cause in the begining, difficult penetration, abortion, career advancement,  your attempts, your ultimatum, and suggestion of counselling.  All these reinforces her condition. Plus a vagina thats shaped downwards. What do you think all these does to her psyche? Super clamp.</p>
              <p>You know her condition. You love her. Think.</p>
              <p>Using insomnia as an analogy, the more you try to sleep, the more sleep will elude you.</p>
              <p>Same for vaginismus, go about your life without sex in the equation. That means no porn, no masturbation, no threats, or anything that would indicate she has a problem. Just go about as two dotting couple as during your courting days. Don't tell her she must go for counselling. Hint that that is a possibility, let her decide. This has to be for a prolonged period, many months perhaps, till she is comfortable with herself. Don't forget the maps and fungus on her skin, this contributes to the notion that she is ugly.</p>
              <p>All these will only pave the way for the sex counsellor to get her to relax. </p>
              <p>Btw, a vagina thats shaped downwards is nothing that some positioning can't fix. Heard of the doggie style?</p>
              <p>But get her to feel comfortable with her body first.</p>

              <p>I understand the reason for posting harsh comments on me but I
                              did not marry my wife because she is a virgin. According to the
                              points I have posted on the 1st page, my wife was no longer a
                              virgin prior to being married.</p>
              <p>I have read through all the comments and suggestions given in
                              this thread and did some self reflection and analysis of my
                              relationship with my wife. I think my wife is happy with me, simply
                              because whenever I meet her for dinner after work, she would give
                              me a warm smile and hug. Also, our communication is good, we laugh
                              together at things, watch Nat Geo once in awhile and always make
                              the effort to go out for nice dinners. I plan to make an
                              appointment with a sexologist after my Greece trip and I would like
                              to update the outcome of it here, perhaps it might help someone
                              else looking in this thread. </p>
              <p>I would like to add more details about the sexual relationship
                              between my wife and myself and also our reasons for the abortion
                              and the unreadiness to have kids now. (We plan to have kids 1-2
                              years down the road)</p>
              <p>I'll touch on the abortion part first. When my wife was
                              pregnant, she was not ready to start a family yet because she was
                              in the midst of advancing in her career and her efforts in her own
                              interest (can't say what it is) is paying off in both publicity and
                              finance. I was not really ready for a family at that time because I
                              was in the first year of university and I feel that it will have an
                              impact on my wife. Actually, we were not strongly against having a
                              baby but my wife and I have both discussed that we were not ready
                              to provide a condusive environment for the baby. We made a quick
                              decision because we do not want to wait till the baby develops
                              consciousness before making a decision.</p>
              <p>After the abortion, we went through some counselling with the
                              gynae and my wife took contraceptive pills for a few weeks. She
                              complains that she feels depressed after taking the pills. So I
                              asked her to stop taking the pills, although we did not have sex.
                              We were both affected by that abortion incident which might be the
                              reason why we did not have sex for over a year(I did not attempt to
                              have sex either).</p>
              <p>Onto my wife's physical condition, I think part of the reason
                              why she was afraid to engage in sex is because she developed UTI on
                              a few occasions after intercourse. Also, her gynae commented that
                              her vagina is shaped downwards instead of upwards, she did not
                              comment specifically on how it will affect exccept that we should
                              try different positions. My wife used to have Eczema which left
                              some scars on her body, which shes says she feels not sexy about it
                              but she gradually do not take notice of it through my
                              encouragement. Recently, she developed some kind of fungus

                              soon so that she can do some night activities with me (I did not

                              sleep.</p>
              <p>Actually, I think that my wife might be bisexual. She watches
                              porn and she likes to see girls with big boobs. Sometimes she will
                              joking say(I think) that if I manage to find a big boob sexy girl,
                              don't forget to ask her along. I told her that a sexual
                              relationship other than a heterosexual one is not a good idea
                              because if I have sex with the other girl, it might have an
                              emotional impact on both of us. Although she does not enjoy having
                              sex with me now, she does enjoy watching me ejaculate in front of
                              her, she finds it sexy.</p>
              <p>As for having kids now, my wife still isn't ready for it. She
                              says perhaps in 1-2 years time when she is ready to give up her
                              career and her interest. As for me, I'm facing quite a number of
                              issues that requires my attention. There are 2 important issues at
                              hand. the 1st is that I need to help my brother with getting a job
                              because he suffered and has recovered from bi-polar mania. 2nd is I
                              am making a career switch so I feel I need 1 or 2 years to settle
                              down in the new industry that I will be in. There are also a couple
                              of concerns on my mind that puts me off from having a kid like the
                              competitivesness of the contemporary society, a possible nuclear
                              war etc. I just don't want my kid to suffer these things.</p>
              <p>So I'll be the best I can for my wife this coming honeymoon to
                              Greece and I'll update on the progress of our sexual relationship
                              after a visit to a sexologist.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Sounds like a vaginal prolapse/relaxation to me. Frequent UTI, downward sloping vagina, painful sex/Dyspareunia.... etc</p>
              <p>But didn't you mention in your previous post that her gynae checked her and said she was normal ?? You are contradicting yourself now. Or her gynae may not be trained in this sub-specialty.</p>
              <p>Anyway.. if she is suffering from vaginal prolapse then she needs to see a Urogynecologist.</p>
              <p>If the prolapse is mild, she can be prescribed estrogen replacement to help strengthen the muscles supporting the vagina.</p>
              <p>If the prolapse is more severe, she can go for surgery.</p>
              <p>As for her skin issues, is she seeking medical/dermatologist help ?Please do not use those creams you bought in general pharmacy. Potent fungal cream must be prescribed by the doctor, and the treatment can be lengthy.</p>
              <p>As for her scars and skin condition affecting her self-image, it's understandable she feels self-conscious. I suggest you go with her to pick out some pretty lingerie and let her wear it during intimacy.. you don't have to convince her to feel good about being naked. Some times, women feels sexy during sex when she is not 100% naked.</p>
              <p>Her clothes/lingerie are like her security blankets.</p>
              <p>Just because you are ok with looking at her scars, doesn't mean she's ok with you seeing her "flaws".</p>
              <p>Don't slight her feelings, ask her what she can do to feel good about herself and give her your 100% support. If she needs to wear a catwoman leather suit during intercourse.. then so be it.. let her.</p>
              <p>FYI, you may not want to put off child bearing for too long.</p>
              <p>A woman's egg deteriorates with age, and the condition of her womb will start to go downhill after 25. A lot of women puts off babies for career.. and end up having trouble holding the pregnancy.. or worst.. unable to conceive.</p>
              <p>While you may think it's cheaper to hold off a baby now.. you may end up paying a lot more for fertility treatment that does not guarantee success.</p>
              <p>Late pregnancy carries a lot of risk. No joke. There's a high percentage of miscarriages and fetal development problems.</p>
              <p>It's always a dilema for a woman.. career or baby .. most women can't hve the best of both worlds.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

                                      big boob sexy girl,
                                                              don't forget to ask her along. I told her that a
                                       sexual
                                                              relationship other than a heterosexual one is 
                                      not a good idea
                                                              because if I have sex with the other girl, it 
                                      might have an
                                                              emotional impact on both of us. Although she 
                                      does not enjoy having
                                                              sex with me now, she does enjoy watching me 
                                      ejaculate in front of
                                                              her, she finds it sexy."</p>
              <p>I doubt she is bisexual.</p>
              <p>While you may be enjoying porn because of sexual stimulation. She may be watching porn to "learn" how to satisfy you.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, there's really not a whole lot of "Sexuality Education" references around, and she jolly well feel embarrassed walking into a bookstore to buy one.</p>
              <p>So the best way for a conservative woman to learn how to satisfy her man is through watching porn.</p>
              <p>A lot of times, a woman say certain things or act certain to test your loyalty or faithfulness to her.</p>
              <p>I know it's frustrating, but that's how a woman tends to behave.. we do have a lot of insecurities and we tend to constantly needs reassurance.</p>
              <p>Her comments about girls with big boobs, is her insecurity talking.</p>
              <p>She is well aware of her own "inadequacies". And is merely trying to cover it up by saying what she said.</p>
              <p>While a small busted woman may say that she admires other women with big boob...she is essentially saying she is "envious". And will actually mind deep inside, if you start staring at another woman's bigger boobs and make the same comment.</p>
              <p>Have you considered surgery to help her attain some fullness in her breast ?</p>
              <p>She enjoys seeing you ejaculate because she is trying to compensate for the lack of "ability" she can provide you.</p>
              <p>I'm very sure.. she must be feeling very incompetent because of her inability to "satisfy" you with her vagina.</p>
              <p>So instead, she feels the need to see you satisfied through other means.</p>
              <p>The meaning of living her life vicariously through your happiness is probably high on her list.</p>
              <p>It's heart breaking... I assume.. for you to understand what she is going through .. to see you happy.</p>
              <p>Anyway...</p>
              <p>Even if you can fix all the physical aspect. The prolapse and boobs.</p>
              <p>You still can't fix her psychological barrier with regards to her fear of another abortion.</p>
              <p>There's no way a woman can enjoy sex with that kind of thoughts hanging over her head.</p>
              <p>You cannot convince her out of it and something you don't want to take lightly. Because the more you try telling her it's not gonna happen, the more she's gonna resent sex. We know a lie when we hear one. So stop bluffing yourself, because you ain't fooling no one.</p>
              <p>Since both of you are not willing to use birth control, I suppose you should just make do with having sex twice a month. Reducing the probability of another unwanted pregnancy. It's only really for 1-2 years...not a long time IMO.</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Sexless:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have been contemplating to post on this forum but I feel the need to rant a bit and hopefully get some useful advice for my situation. As the thread title says, I'm in a sexless marriage.</p>
              <p>I will provide details of my relationship with my wife and some details of myself that will not compromise the privacy of my wife and myself.</p>
              <p>To start off, I have known my wife for 5 years and we decided to tie the knot last year. My wife was a virgin when I dated her although she was with her ex-bf for 7 years (not that it matters to me). On the other hand, I have dated several girls before and been in a couple of sexual relationships. When I got to know my wife, she was still with her ex-bf but of course, their relationship was in a very bad shape. Her bf sort-of cheated on her by allowing himself to be seduced by a girl naked in her dormitory, but he did not have sex with her. To summarise, my wife felt the need to move on from this man and date someone else.</p>
              <p>At the time where I first got to know my wife through a friend, I was not attracted to her. Also, I was dating a stewardess at that time so it has never cross my mind to consider dating her, until some events took place. I think it all started with my birthday party, stewardess was supposed to come but couldn't make it and my wife came to the party. After the party, a few of my friends and myself went to a park for drinks and  I asked my wife along because I felt that she was feeling down at that time and I wanted to cheer her up. On my actual brithday, my wife asked me out for a movie and I agreed and of course, she wished me a happy birthday. From there on, I started to look at my wife in a different way, and we started dating each other. I like my wife for her intelligence, her common interest with me and similar views on many aspects of life. So stewardess girl was out of the picture and I eventually marry my wife at the age of 27.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now on to the sexuality part.. My wife was a virgin, I was her first sexual partner but it was not easy. It took several tries before I was able to have intercourse with her as she was feeling great pains as I try to penetrate. At that point, I knew that my wife requires encouragement in-order to have sex as she feels more pain that pleasure out of it. In our first few years of relationship, the frequnecy of our sex is about 2 times a month which I feel is not a good frequency. Then, something happened.. she got pregnant. Both of us made a decisive decision to abort it during her first few weeks of pregnancy as both of us are not ready for a child at that time. (You can call me names if you want, perhaps I deserve it) That was the turning point of our sexual life, it turned for the worst. After abortion, we did not have sex for a year.. not even petting. Prior to getting married we did have sex once in 6 months although we could not complete the full intercourse as she was experiencing discomfort. During our trip to Japan, we did not have sex either. A few months before our marriage, I had a talk with her about our sexual relationship and asked her about the possible reasons of the pain. She said that it is probably because she was scared to get pregnant again. I tried to help her by introducing a vibrator, game and lubricant but to no avail. I also managed to persuade her to visit the gynae to check if there is anything wrong with her vagina, there wasn't. Anyway, I still love my wife despite her seemingly asexual behavior and decided to marry her thinking that perhpas after marriage things will get better for us.</p>
              <p>Well, things did not get better. During the few days in our hotel after the wedding dinner, we did not have sex at all. Whenever I try to touch her intimately, she would be irritated and reject me. After a few attempts, I got fraustrated and laid in the bathtub for an hour refusing to talk to her. At that time, I almost felt like crying. It has been 6 months since we tied the knot and we only had sex once though it was not a full intercourse.On one occasion, feeling fraustrated after a rejection from her, I threaten her saying that she should be prepared to face the consequences. I ignored her after that and just focused on sleeping. A few weeks later, I brought up the issue of our sexual life again. I told her how I have been feeling and that I still feel disappointed about what happened on the wedding night. Feeling fraustrated, I told her that I have thrown in the towel and I have lost interest in having sex with her. She kept quiet and did not say much.</p>
              <p>I think I'm a person with high libido, so I needed to have an avenue to meet my needs. My wife allows me to watch porn and masturbate, so I have been doing this in order to keep myself from feeling depressed. Recently, I found an article that might be related to her problem so I forward to my wife and she concurs with the conditions she is facing in that article. She is probably having this condition called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginismus">Vaginismus</a>. The only friend that I've told of my situation advised me to persuade my wife to see a sexologist which she agrees to. The relationship with my wife is seemingly good and we are going to Greece on our honeymoon next week. I'm currently fraustrated that she is so passive on our sexual problem and it seems to me that she do not compremend the seriousness of the situation.</p>
              <p>I hope that someone can offer some valuable advice on how to improve my current situation and no, I'm not going to visit prostittues in Geylang or have an affair.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your time reading this, I know it is kind of long winded.</p>

              <p>Sex is not a <strong>must</strong> lah, love yes it must be there but reading the postings of TS, love is missing or something else is altogether parading as love or ... only you (TS) have the REAL answers to that equation.</p>
              <p> Assuming if one's sex life should for some unforeseen reason or ... meet its demise - does it end the marriage or ...? One has to assume responsiblity for what one feels (never mind what the situation is) and not hide behind excuses.</p>
              <p>It is the <strong>emotional stasis</strong> that has both mired in this predicament. Unless one is physically dysfunctional this so-called ''problem'' is not a problem at all but revealing what both of them are all about. Of course, rite/wrong is subjective and acceptance and reconciling may go a long way.</p>
