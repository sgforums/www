              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Sexless:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have been contemplating to post on this forum but I feel the need to rant a bit and hopefully get some useful advice for my situation. As the thread title says, I'm in a sexless marriage.</p>
              <p>I will provide details of my relationship with my wife and some details of myself that will not compromise the privacy of my wife and myself.</p>
              <p>To start off, I have known my wife for 5 years and we decided to tie the knot last year. My wife was a virgin when I dated her although she was with her ex-bf for 7 years (not that it matters to me). On the other hand, I have dated several girls before and been in a couple of sexual relationships. When I got to know my wife, she was still with her ex-bf but of course, their relationship was in a very bad shape. Her bf sort-of cheated on her by allowing himself to be seduced by a girl naked in her dormitory, but he did not have sex with her. To summarise, my wife felt the need to move on from this man and date someone else.</p>
              <p>At the time where I first got to know my wife through a friend, I was not attracted to her. Also, I was dating a stewardess at that time so it has never cross my mind to consider dating her, until some events took place. I think it all started with my birthday party, stewardess was supposed to come but couldn't make it and my wife came to the party. After the party, a few of my friends and myself went to a park for drinks and  I asked my wife along because I felt that she was feeling down at that time and I wanted to cheer her up. On my actual brithday, my wife asked me out for a movie and I agreed and of course, she wished me a happy birthday. From there on, I started to look at my wife in a different way, and we started dating each other. I like my wife for her intelligence, her common interest with me and similar views on many aspects of life. So stewardess girl was out of the picture and I eventually marry my wife at the age of 27.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now on to the sexuality part.. My wife was a virgin, I was her first sexual partner but it was not easy. It took several tries before I was able to have intercourse with her as she was feeling great pains as I try to penetrate. At that point, I knew that my wife requires encouragement in-order to have sex as she feels more pain that pleasure out of it. In our first few years of relationship, the frequnecy of our sex is about 2 times a month which I feel is not a good frequency. Then, something happened.. she got pregnant. Both of us made a decisive decision to abort it during her first few weeks of pregnancy as both of us are not ready for a child at that time. (You can call me names if you want, perhaps I deserve it) That was the turning point of our sexual life, it turned for the worst. After abortion, we did not have sex for a year.. not even petting. Prior to getting married we did have sex once in 6 months although we could not complete the full intercourse as she was experiencing discomfort. During our trip to Japan, we did not have sex either. A few months before our marriage, I had a talk with her about our sexual relationship and asked her about the possible reasons of the pain. She said that it is probably because she was scared to get pregnant again. I tried to help her by introducing a vibrator, game and lubricant but to no avail. I also managed to persuade her to visit the gynae to check if there is anything wrong with her vagina, there wasn't. Anyway, I still love my wife despite her seemingly asexual behavior and decided to marry her thinking that perhpas after marriage things will get better for us.</p>
              <p>Well, things did not get better. During the few days in our hotel after the wedding dinner, we did not have sex at all. Whenever I try to touch her intimately, she would be irritated and reject me. After a few attempts, I got fraustrated and laid in the bathtub for an hour refusing to talk to her. At that time, I almost felt like crying. It has been 6 months since we tied the knot and we only had sex once though it was not a full intercourse.On one occasion, feeling fraustrated after a rejection from her, I threaten her saying that she should be prepared to face the consequences. I ignored her after that and just focused on sleeping. A few weeks later, I brought up the issue of our sexual life again. I told her how I have been feeling and that I still feel disappointed about what happened on the wedding night. Feeling fraustrated, I told her that I have thrown in the towel and I have lost interest in having sex with her. She kept quiet and did not say much.</p>
              <p>I think I'm a person with high libido, so I needed to have an avenue to meet my needs. My wife allows me to watch porn and masturbate, so I have been doing this in order to keep myself from feeling depressed. Recently, I found an article that might be related to her problem so I forward to my wife and she concurs with the conditions she is facing in that article. She is probably having this condition called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginismus">Vaginismus</a>. The only friend that I've told of my situation advised me to persuade my wife to see a sexologist which she agrees to. The relationship with my wife is seemingly good and we are going to Greece on our honeymoon next week. I'm currently fraustrated that she is so passive on our sexual problem and it seems to me that she do not compremend the seriousness of the situation.</p>
              <p>I hope that someone can offer some valuable advice on how to improve my current situation and no, I'm not going to visit prostittues in Geylang or have an affair.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your time reading this, I know it is kind of long winded.</p>

              <p><br>First of all, DAMN YOU for aborting your own child!</p>
              <p>Secondly, DAMN YOU for forcing your sexual desires upon your loved one (Wife/GF) like a prostitute!</p>
              <p>Thirdly, DAMN YOU for threatening your wife just because she had refused to have sex with you!</p>
              <p>Fourthly, DAMN YOU for convincing your wife that she has a sexual condition!</p>
              <p>And HOW DARE YOU COME HERE AND TELL US THAT THE ENTIRE PROBLEM LIES WITH YOUR WIFE FROM THE BEGINNING!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can offer no solution for you to FIX your wife, but I believe you need us to give you a solution to FIX YOURSELF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sex is not the MOST important factor in a relationship or marriage unless you are an animal who cannot overcome your own lust, then by all means go and RAPE your own wife so that you may be locked up and put away in a cage (prison) for as long as it is neccessary.</p>
              <p>Consult a sexologist if you know that your high libido is affecting your marriage!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOUR WIFE IS ALSO SOMEONE ELSE'S DAUGHTER, and TREAT HER WITH YOUR UTMOST RESPECT, LOVE AND CARE!</p>
              <p>You do not have any rights to force or threaten her in any way even though you are her husband! It's just her bad luck to have married someone selfish like you, who have no capacity or whatsoever to look from her perspective.</p>
              <p>What do you think she need? Your COCK? or Your ROMANCE (Not SEX!!)?</p>
              <p>If you really want her to have SEX with you, then make her feel like she want to have SEX with you!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is possible that you are not good enough to romance her and make her want to have SEX with you.</p>
              <p>You are a MAN right? You have a COCK and I also hope you still have your BRAIN to think about what you need to do, in order for you to make your WOMAN want your COCK!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, I will advise you to FOCUS everything you have ON YOUR WIFE'S NEEDS. You will definitely FAIL again if you tried to focus on your own needs again.</p>

              <p>Try to handle your libido discreetly, so that she wont be stressed by it. Because being sexy and desired is a built in need in women. Do not pressure her or anything. Be supportive.</p>
              <p>Treat her as your date. Bring her out, have fun, relax. Do crazy things. Get her mind away from work-related stress or anything whatsoever. Make her remember why she married you, and re-ignite her dream of a bright future with you. Sometimes treat her like a kid and pamper her abit.</p>
              <p>Send her surprise presents. When she ask why just give stupid reasons like, "I was daydreaming about the times we spent together, yada yada" Send to her office too (so that her colleagues will become green and she will be flattered). Give her kisses out of nowhere, play with her hands, her hair. Learn to listen to her. Show a willingness to take on her problems. </p>
              <p>Reassure her!! This is very impt. Some girls are naturally insecure. tell her she looks nice, she have good taste, she is the best. Basically powder her butt. Cos she got issues with her sexuality(i.e. scars) She might be afraid of sex cos of the conditions you mentioned</p>
              <p>Do not force yourself on her, threaten her or whatsoever. Just release your stored up cells in the bathroom. Slowly get her in the mood. If she rejects your advances, just kiss her in the forehead and massage her (if she likes). sayang her abit. Sooner or later you will get what you want (hopefully). Since by doing so, you throw the ball into her court. She might start questioning is she failing in doing her part in the maintenance of the r/s. Who knows after she warmed up in this way that everything will be fine</p>
              <p>Remember dates!!! cos the general perception is guys bo chap. So sure can score brownie points.</p>
              <p>Show optimism in the r/s. Cos gt abortion, den got some other problems.  </p>
              <p>And very impt, enable her dreams! This is where understanding of her becomes important. Be it childhood dreams, future dreams, daydreams, fairytale dreams. Dun need to succeed la, just try try, in maths you score points for working, with women you score points for trying</p>
              <p>agar agar like that la. Dunno will work anot. Just thinking about what girls want nia LOL</p>
