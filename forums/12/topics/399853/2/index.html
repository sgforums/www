              <p>I totally agree that sex is a big part of a happy and long lasting marriage.</p>
              <p>But what you are currently doing is pushing her away from wanting to enjoy this "gift" with you.</p>
              <p>Just because she has married you, doesn't mean you can stop "courting" her. Courtship doesn't end until death do you part.</p>
              <p>A woman's willingness to have sex with a man.. is not just a physical thing. It's very much an emotional experience.</p>
              <p>Start a clean slate with your wife.</p>
              <p>Forgo all that had happened.. and try again.. this time more gently.. more considerate.. more love.. more caring...</p>
              <p>Emotionally she must feel secure with you..</p>
              <p>Stop harping on the past.. give her a future to look forward to.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> After the party, a few of my friends and
              myself went to a park for drinks and  I asked my wife along
              because I felt that she was feeling down at that time and I wanted
              to cheer her up. On my actual brithday, my wife asked me out for a
              movie and I agreed and of course, she wished me a happy birthday.
              From there on, I started to look at my wife in a different way, and
              we started dating each other. I like my wife for her intelligence,
              her common interest with me and similar views on many aspects of
              life. So stewardess girl was out of the picture and I eventually
              marry my wife at the age of 27.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now on to the sexuality part.. My wife was a virgin, I was her
              first sexual partner but it was not easy. It took several tries
              before I was able to have intercourse with her as she was feeling
              great pains as I try to penetrate. At that point, I knew that my
              wife requires encouragement in-order to have sex as she feels more
              pain that pleasure out of it. In our first few years of
              relationship, the frequnecy of our sex is about 2 times a month
              which I feel is not a good frequency. Then, something happened..
              she got pregnant. Both of us made a decisive decision to abort it
              during her first few weeks of pregnancy as both of us are not ready
              for a child at that time. (You can call me names if you want,
              perhaps I deserve it) That was the turning point of our sexual
              life, it turned for the worst. After abortion, we did not have sex
              for a year.. not even petting. Prior to getting married we did have
              sex once in 6 months although we could not complete the full
              intercourse as she was experiencing discomfort. During our trip to
              Japan, we did not have sex either. A few months before our
              marriage, I had a talk with her about our sexual relationship and
              asked her about the possible reasons of the pain. She said that it
              is probably because she was scared to get pregnant again. I tried
              to help her by introducing a vibrator, game and lubricant but to no
              avail. I also managed to persuade her to visit the gynae to check
              if there is anything wrong with her vagina, there wasn't. Anyway, I
              still love my wife despite her seemingly asexual behavior and
              decided to marry her thinking that perhpas after marriage things
              will get better for us.</p>
              <p>Well, things did not get better. During the few days in our
              hotel after the wedding dinner, we did not have sex at all.
              Whenever I try to touch her intimately, she would be irritated and
              reject me.</p>
              <p>I think I'm a person with high libido,</p>

              <p>I really doubt if you have high libido.If that was the case u would have been cheating on her by now. Why do u miss the obvious picture in here?Wife asks u out on ur B-day, then doesn't like sex but gets preg ,irritated when you touch? Let me tell you, she married you for other reasons and ther's sm one else.Wake up!!!<br><br><br></p>

              <p>ts bro.... put a thumbtack at the "after abortion" thing!! and then think... everything went downhill ever since that abortion thingy. maybe... juz maybe deep down inside her that she actually wans the baby but juz go along of wat u said. So i doubt talking would work since she probably lie to u so now u have to be observant. Look at how she reacts when she pass by some couple holding a baby or smth...  her reaction maybe is the answer to your problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok.. not to discourage u or anything ah... but MAYBE bio-hawk has a point. cmon... she got irritated when u touch her... no sex.... pissed? she may have some plan of getting married to u or is it a "forced marriage"? idk... not my place to qn that but juz wan to let u knw my views</p>
