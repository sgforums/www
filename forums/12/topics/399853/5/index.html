              <p>And HOW DARE YOU COME HERE AND TELL US THAT THE ENTIRE PROBLEM
                  LIES WITH YOUR WIFE FROM THE BEGINNING!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Please note there there is nothing wrong with checking things out. Since he is sexually experience and did not have problems before. It is logical to suspect there might be issues with the wife. Which in his second post, he mentions that there is indeed some variation</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can offer no solution for you to FIX your wife, but I believe
                  you need us to give you a solution to FIX YOURSELF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sex is not the MOST important factor in a relationship or
                  marriage unless you are an animal who cannot overcome your own
                  lust, then by all means go and RAPE your own wife so that you
                  may be locked up and put away in a cage (prison) for as
                  long as it is neccessary.</p>
              <p>Consult a sexologist if you know that your high libido is
                  affecting your marriage!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOUR WIFE IS ALSO SOMEONE ELSE'S
                  DAUGHTER, and TREAT HER WITH YOUR UTMOST RESPECT, LOVE AND
                  CARE!</p>
              <p>You do not have any rights to force or threaten her in any way
                  even though you are her husband! It's just her bad luck to have
                  married someone selfish like you, who have no capacity or
                  whatsoever to look from her perspective.</p>
              <p>What do you think she need? Your COCK? or Your ROMANCE (Not
                  SEX!!)?</p>
              <p>If you really want her to have SEX with you, then make her feel
                  like she want to have SEX with you!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is possible that you are not good enough to romance her and
                  make her want to have SEX with you.</p>
              <p>You are a MAN right? You have a COCK and I also hope you still
                  have your BRAIN to think about what you need to do, in order for
                  you to make your WOMAN want your COCK!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, I will advise you to FOCUS everything you have ON YOUR
                  WIFE'S NEEDS. You will definitely FAIL again if you tried to
                  focus on your own needs again.</p>

              <p>Do you really believe what TS has said regarding the wife agreeing to the abortion of her own child?</p>
              <p>Are you a female? If not, why do you think we would so easily go for an abortion? Is it really that difficult to see that TS do not wish to take any blame for the abortion? Is killing your own fetus a common thing for anyone to do? Why did TS also agreed to the abortion? The clear fact is, TS is heartless and cruel. His parents should've aborted him when he was still a fetus! Do you also think this abortion had no effect on his wife? If his wife was the person who initiated the abortion, why would she felt bad after the abortion? There is obviously something missing that TS isn't telling us, can you see it now?</p>
              <p>Too bad if you failed to see TS main point of creating this topic. Is it really that difficult for you to see that TS was whinning about the lack of sex from his wife? Do you think the sex they had together was mutual or was it because TS had persisted so much that his wife need to give in to him?</p>

              <p>But in a marriage, a woman has no choice but to abort the baby if her PARTNER do not want one. Else she may end up raising the child by herself.</p>
              <p>Two consenting adults ? Did the baby agreed to be aborted ? Obviously not.</p>
              <p>Only the MALES will think that a fetus/embryo is just an extra piece of flesh that can be easily removed like some overgrown tissue.</p>
              <p>Just because the baby can't say "OUCH" when the doctor cuts him/her in half ?</p>
              <p>Just because you can't remember what's it like in the mother's womb ?</p>
              <p>Can you remember what you did when you were 6 months old ? No right ? So does it means you don't EXIST ?</p>
              <p>FYI, an Abortion is a INVASIVE surgery. It's very damaging to a woman's body and cause long term emotional damage to her delicate emotional wellbeing.</p>
              <p>There are risks/complications, like infection and internal scarring or on some cases infertility.</p>
              <p>So before you stick your unprotected dick into a woman's vagina,  you better think about the murder and damage you will commit later.</p>
              <p>The problem is two pronged. Not just the wife problem. TS is very much a culprit to his problem.</p>
              <p>So he had great sex before his marriage to the virgin wife ?</p>
              <p>Maybe the other non virgin girls he had great sex with dumped him because he was lousy in BED.</p>
              <p>The only person who wouldn't know a lousy deal is one who has no previous experience to compare to. Maybe that's why SHE ( the wife)  is willing to marry TS .</p>
              <p>Have you try turning the tables around and look at this from a different perspective ???? Ofcors not.. your just a GUY.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Pls read properly, I did not say women cannot cope with the rigors of having a baby and building a career. I said that It is what they chose to do and we should respect it.</span></p>
              <p>But in a marriage, a woman has no choice but to abort the baby
              if her PARTNER do not want one. Else she may end up raising the

              <p>Two consenting adults ? Did the baby agreed to be aborted ?
              Obviously not.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Clearly the baby cannot speak. Thats why i said two consenting adults. Which means TS and wife.</span></p>
              <p>Only the MALES will think that a fetus/embryo is just an extra
              piece of flesh that can be easily removed like some overgrown
              tissue.</p>

              <p>Can you remember what you did when you were 6 months old ? No
              right ? So does it means you don't EXIST ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Stop assuming please. Who said that the baby is just a piece of flesh. Which dumb person would deny the existence of the embryo when science have CLEARLY proven it exists. It is the choice of the parents whether to keep it.</span> </p>
              <p>FYI, an Abortion is a INVASIVE surgery. It's very damaging to a
              woman's body and cause long term emotional damage to her delicate
              emotional wellbeing.</p>
              <p>There are risks/complications, like infection and internal
              scarring or on some cases infertility.</p>
              <p>So before you stick your unprotected dick into a woman's
              vagina,  you better think about the murder and damage you will
              commit later.</p>
              <p>The problem is two pronged. Not just the wife problem. TS is
              very much a culprit to his problem.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Thats why i said, it is a choice made by two aware and consenting adults. And assuming they know the risks associated with it (in which the doctor must advise), It is a path they chose to take. Murder, abortion is not murder in legal terms. And it is a mutual decision. In your previous post, you suggested that TS should undergo a </span><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">vasectomy and that he is self-centred and should die w/o offsprings. Since in this post, you agreed that the wife is at fault too, maybe the wife should go for a total hysterectomy? Pls be fair and dont simply blame the guy.</span></span></p>
              <p>So he had great sex before his marriage to the virgin wife ?</p>
              <p>Maybe the other non virgin girls he had great sex with dumped
              him because he was lousy in BED.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Do you even know what you are talking about? If he do not have any problems with others and only encountered problems with his wife, it is fair to assume that the problem might lie with the wife. Lousy in bed can mean bad technique. And to point it out. You are simply pushing the blame to the guy. by assuming 1) he was dumped, 2) he was bad in bed. both in which can happen the other way around. So from my experience, many girls (i did not say you), says that guys blame them for things. but you have done the same as those guys. </span></p>
              <p>The only person who wouldn't know a lousy deal is one who has no
              previous experience to compare to. Maybe that's why SHE ( the
              wife)  is willing to marry TS .</p>
              <p>Have you try turning the tables around and look at this from a
              different perspective ???? Ofcors not.. your just a GUY.</p>
              <p>Your perspective IMHO is flawed. Filled with prejudice. </p>

              <p>Now if a woman goes through Hysterectomy.. will she be able to carry a child at all ?</p>
              <p>Go and do some research before you come and talk nonsense.</p>
              <p>Asian guys are too chicken shit to go through vasectomy, and they are too chicken shit to admit it.. so they just tell their wife to go get her womb removed.</p>
              <p>So as long it's not "legally" murder.. it ain't murder ? Which moron came up with such a bright idea?</p>

But you can always fertilise the egg and put inside another. Since some girls complain that they have to be pregnant. It is not that there is no solution for it you know? Anyway asking people for such drastic actions like vasectomy and hysterectomy is silly. And it was only intended to show you how you simply push all the blame on the guy.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Hey. Look clearly leh. You yourself can try to counter me by saying that that his wife is only 27. How old do you think is TS. And he clearly said he wanted babies in the future. So the point cant apply.</span></p>
              <p>That is why I specifically mentioned ASIAN men are just chicken
              shit.</p>

              Chicken shit.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Its actually not a comparison. Its to show that women also have the option. Since in your rage you suggested that TS is should go for the procedure. I merely pointed out that there exists a possibility for women too.</span></p>
              <p>Yeah yeah.. killing is killing.. murder is the legal term.. Wats
              the difference really ? Call it different names.. it's all the
              same.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Its different. go check dictionary. And a fetus cannot feel pain. And a fetus is not a legal entity yet.</span></p>
              <p>Legal or not legal.. it's still taking another's life. You want
              to harp on it being legal or not.. geesh dude..you're not that
              smart really.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">To be legal means something society accepts, for whatever reason. So its different. I am not smart. The vast majority of earth's population is probably above me. &lt;3</span></p>

              <p>TS is not very keen in having babies... he is NOT likely to.. because of  current economic reasons and the future outlook in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Yes indeed there are other options for women, so are options for men. Yet most time.. it is the women who has to take up the options.. why not the men ? Are Asian men really so afraid of having their tubes tied ?</p>
