            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I have been contemplating to post on this forum but I feel the need 
              to rant a bit and hopefully get some useful advice for my situation. As 
              the thread title says, I'm in a sexless marriage.</p>
              <p>I will provide 
              details of my relationship with my wife and some details of myself that 
              will not compromise the privacy of my wife and myself.</p>
              <p>To start 
              off, I have known my wife for 5 years and we decided to tie the knot 
              last year. My wife was a virgin when I dated her although she was with 
              her ex-bf for 7 years (not that it matters to me). On the other hand, I 
              have dated several girls before and been in a couple of sexual 
              relationships. When I got to know my wife, she was still with her ex-bf 
              but of course, their relationship was in a very bad shape. Her bf 
              sort-of cheated on her by allowing himself to be seduced by a girl naked
               in her dormitory, but he did not have sex with her. To summarise, my 
              wife felt the need to move on from this man and date someone else.</p>
              <p>At
               the time where I first got to know my wife through a friend, I was not 
              attracted to her. Also, I was dating a stewardess at that time so it has
               never cross my mind to consider dating her, until some events took 
              place. I think it all started with my birthday party, stewardess was 
              supposed to come but couldn't make it and my wife came to the party. 
              After the party, a few of my friends and myself went to a park for 
              drinks and  I asked my wife along because I felt that she was feeling 
              down at that time and I wanted to cheer her up. On my actual brithday, 
              my wife asked me out for a movie and I agreed and of course, she wished 
              me a happy birthday. From there on, I started to look at my wife in a 
              different way, and we started dating each other. I like my wife for her 
              intelligence, her common interest with me and similar views on many 
              aspects of life. So stewardess girl was out of the picture and I 
              eventually marry my wife at the age of 27.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now on to 
              the sexuality part.. My wife was a virgin, I was her first sexual 
              partner but it was not easy. It took several tries before I was able to 
              have intercourse with her as she was feeling great pains as I try to 
              penetrate. At that point, I knew that my wife requires encouragement 
              in-order to have sex as she feels more pain that pleasure out of it. In 
              our first few years of relationship, the frequnecy of our sex is about 2
               times a month which I feel is not a good frequency. Then, something 
              happened.. she got pregnant. Both of us made a decisive decision to 
              abort it during her first few weeks of pregnancy as both of us are not 
              ready for a child at that time. (You can call me names if you want, 
              perhaps I deserve it) That was the turning point of our sexual life, it 
              turned for the worst. After abortion, we did not have sex for a year.. 
              not even petting. Prior to getting married we did have sex once in 6 
              months although we could not complete the full intercourse as she was 
              experiencing discomfort. During our trip to Japan, we did not have sex 
              either. A few months before our marriage, I had a talk with her about 
              our sexual relationship and asked her about the possible reasons of the 
              pain. She said that it is probably because she was scared to get 
              pregnant again. I tried to help her by introducing a vibrator, game and 
              lubricant but to no avail. I also managed to persuade her to visit the 
              gynae to check if there is anything wrong with her vagina, there wasn't.
               Anyway, I still love my wife despite her seemingly asexual behavior and
               decided to marry her thinking that perhpas after marriage things will 
              get better for us.</p>
              <p>Well, things did not get better. During the 
              few days in our hotel after the wedding dinner, we did not have sex at 
              all. Whenever I try to touch her intimately, she would be irritated and 
              reject me. After a few attempts, I got fraustrated and laid in the 
              bathtub for an hour refusing to talk to her. At that time, I almost felt
               like crying. It has been 6 months since we tied the knot and we only 
              had sex once though it was not a full intercourse.On one occasion, 
              feeling fraustrated after a rejection from her, I threaten her saying 
              that she should be prepared to face the consequences. I ignored her 
              after that and just focused on sleeping. A few weeks later, I brought up
               the issue of our sexual life again. I told her how I have been feeling 
              and that I still feel disappointed about what happened on the wedding 
              night. Feeling fraustrated, I told her that I have thrown in the towel 
              and I have lost interest in having sex with her. She kept quiet and did 
              not say much.</p>
              <p>I think I'm a person with high libido, so I needed 
              to have an avenue to meet my needs. My wife allows me to watch porn and 
              masturbate, so I have been doing this in order to keep myself from 
              feeling depressed. Recently, I found an article that might be related to
               her problem so I forward to my wife and she concurs with the conditions
               she is facing in that article. She is probably having this condition 
              called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginismus">Vaginismus</a>. The only 
              friend that I've told of my situation advised me to persuade my wife to 
              see a sexologist which she agrees to. The relationship with my wife is 
              seemingly good and we are going to Greece on our honeymoon next week. 
              I'm currently fraustrated that she is so passive on our sexual problem 
              and it seems to me that she do not compremend the seriousness of the 
              situation.</p>
              <p>I hope that someone can offer some valuable advice on 
              how to improve my current situation and no, I'm not going to visit 
              prostittues in Geylang or have an affair.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your time 
              reading this, I know it is kind of long winded.</p>

              <p>Just like what you said.....she may have some kind of condition....</p>
              <p>It may be a physical condition, or a psychological one.....</p>
              <p>You also need to be patient about it.....</p>
              <p>Because it is not something that she "choose"</p>
              <p>Just imagine if the situation is reversed.....if you as a man is suffering from some dysfunctions....such as impotency....or premature ejaculation.....such thing is sensitive and is not nice to a person's self esteem.......</p>
              <p>So I think you as a husband need to be more understanding and more patient...</p>
              <p>Recommending a doctor, therapist, psychologist....and so on....is the correct first step....</p>
              <p>Just try to be more understanding and patient....and dont enter into arguments with her....or say she is useless....or blame her.....or scold her.....</p>
              <p>With some time, I believe with treatment, gradually her conditions would improve.</p>

              <p>The decision to abort probably very deeply scarred her emotional self.</p>
              <p>While a man may have no problem killing an embryo because the "baby" does not reside inside him.</p>
              <p>But for a woman to do so.. especially one that was conceived with a man she love... is like ripping out a part of her body and that part of her dies with the baby.</p>
              <p>Have you discussed with her your intention to start a family SOON ?</p>
              <p>It is unfortunate that in Asia, while a woman bears the burden to carry a child, she is also given the burden to prevent pregnancy.</p>
              <p>Are you forcing her to take the contraceptive pills while you refused to use the condom ?</p>
              <p>Contraceptive pills do have side effects.. while you think putting on a bit of weight is acceptable to you... the extra pounds she puts on her body may drastically affect her self-confidence and self-esteem.</p>
              <p>When a woman don't feel sexy about her body.. she won't feel attractive to her man.. and thus will not want to be intimate.</p>
              <p>The fact that you threatened her with "consequences" makes her hate sexual intimacy with you more. How can anyone enjoy any activity that punishes if you don't do it?</p>
              <p>Sex between couple should be enjoyable and foster the relationship. That's why we call it " Making LOVE".</p>
              <p><strong>Perhaps you should be more considerate to her needs instead of only focusing on yours.</strong></p>

              <p>My wife do not take contraceptive pills and she doesn't like the latex feeling either, I had to use the withdrawal technique. My wife is slim but yes.. she feels her body unattractive .. she feels that her bossoms are small. I try to encourage her and did tell her that it is my wish for her to enjoy sex with me.</p>
              <p>My wife would like to have kids eventually but I had a talk about that with her recently and we both agreed that we are still not ready to have kids.</p>
              <p>I purposely threaten her to let her know that our situation is serious but despite my recent threats against her, she does not feel angry with me .. which is why I said she does not seem to understand the gravity of the situation and my needs.</p>
              <p>@Rooney9</p>
              <p>No, I'm not the couple in the papers. But thank you for pointing it out, I think I need to find out which doctor the couple consulted.</p>

              <p>Withdrawal technique is dangerous, try using the period counting thing along with it. More safer. I think mariage counselling or a sexologist like you said. She needs some counselling and some confidence boosting. How about watching porn together ? Pain during sex ? Do some more foreplay, maybe licking at the ears or blowing into them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Confort your wife more, strike during your holiday to greece. But then again counselling and sexologist i will say.</p>

              <p>My wife do not take contraceptive pills and she doesn't like the
                  latex feeling either, I had to use the withdrawal technique. My
                  wife is slim but yes.. she feels her body unattractive .. she feels
                  that her bossoms are small. I try to encourage her and did tell her
                  that it is my wish for her to enjoy sex with me.</p>
              <p>My wife would like to have kids eventually but I had a talk
                  about that with her recently and we both agreed that we are still
                  not ready to have kids.</p>
              <p>I purposely threaten her to let her know that our situation is
                  serious but despite my recent threats against her, she does not
                  feel angry with me .. which is why I said she does not seem to
                  understand the gravity of the situation and my needs.</p>
              <p>@Rooney9</p>
              <p>No, I'm not the couple in the papers. But thank you for pointing
                  it out, I think I need to find out which doctor the couple
                  consulted.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is YOUR wish that she enjoys sex with YOU ?? Wow.. the narcissism.. it's oozing out of your every pores.</p>
              <p>So she has never experienced orgasm ?</p>
              <p>With a woman.. you cannot take the hard route.. (no pun intended).</p>
              <p>We are more receptive to softer methods.</p>
              <p>Give her a carrot. She wants a baby.. you make one with her..your rubbish about not ready for a baby is typical male lameness.</p>
              <p>Tell her you are ready for a baby.. she will be more receptive to sex with you... even if she don't know how to enjoy it yet.. she will still be more willing to do it with you.</p>
              <p>So you only marry her for sex because she is so pure as a virgin? So you would have married that "AIR STEWARDESS" had she turned up ? Dude....air stewarding is just a JOB. And you just insulted your WIFE.. for being just "second best" and you happened to SETTLE ... oh my.. I hope you didn't boast about your filthy past to your current wife.. geesh !</p>
              <p>Well.. the purity comes at a cost... so don't expect her to become this sex kitten the moment you married her or for your case.. penetrated her.</p>
              <p>OK. So you have a problem ..a sexual problem. Pouting and throwing a tantrum doesn't make a woman love you more.. on the contrary you just made things worst.</p>
              <p>And pouting about what happened during your wedding night several weeks after ? Wow.. the wedding night incident is already water under the bridge.. you are more petty than an old maid.</p>
              <p>Let it go.. be gracious and stop behaving like a jerk.</p>
              <p>You are lucky she puts up with you for so long.</p>
              <p>The gravity of the situation ? Let me put this in perspective.</p>
              <p>You want to fuck her.. but she can't stand your selfish and egoistic attitude.</p>
              <p>She can open her legs for you to penetrate just to make you happy.. what's the difference between doing it with a dead person?</p>
              <p>She does not feel angry with you. sure.. she don't ENJOY doing it with you anyway.. you are treating her like a free prostitute.</p>

              <p>Withdrawal technique is dangerous, try using the period counting
              thing along with it. More safer. I think mariage counselling or a
              sexologist like you said. She needs some counselling and some
              confidence boosting. How about watching porn together ? Pain during
              sex ? Do some more foreplay, maybe licking at the ears or blowing
              into them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Confort your wife more, strike during your holiday to greece.
              But then again counselling and sexologist i will say.</p>

And pls dont bring disputes from another one.since when the fuck have i brought ur family into dispute? is it that u can't out talk me and u decided to bring my parents into the picture? have i cursed and bitch at pple related to u? i will if i want to but i am not as ungraceful as u are. And for a cab driver u seem to have alot of free time instead of out on the road. Bro don't come guai lan with me hor</p>
