            <div class='col-md body'>waited at the interchange for the bus back home when i saw this young man (age max 22) wheeling this infant son on his stroller to the queues. the infant has such beautiful eyes and so active for his age(cant even guess his age at all). as he wasnt strapped to his stroller he slowly stood him and looked ard but his father who had a disgruntled look just yanked (possibly) his son by one (read: 1 only) hand off the stroller and onto his shoulder but this child didnt even whimper or cry at all.<br>as i looked away he was placed back into his stroller but i could only imagine how crudely his son was placed back.<br><br>when the father boarded the bus, he carried the stroller onto the bus and impatiently placed the front end of the stroller with a great deal of force. no one can tell the physical trauma done to the child.<br><br>throughout the brief 15mins bus ride till the father got off with his infant in tow the baby barely made noise, only when he desparately sought attention and soothing words from his father. still as active as other infants of this age would be, he constantly stood up to visually explore the sights and sounds of this unfamiliar environment, yet his father treated him as a misbehaving child and ruthlessly grabbed him from his position and forcibly placed him back into a sitting position. he then took the towel on the baby and simply threw it at the baby's face.<br><br>as i watched this scene being replayed repeatedly before my eyes, i was afraid to imagine what treatment this young life might be suffering at home, behind close doors, not physical barriers of wood but fears of hostility and the lack of care and concern for each other, especially this young soul.<br><br>when the child finally gave up trying to stand up, he made a desperate plea to his father for attention by crying for a sec and making baby noises only to be ignored yet again by his father who only bothered to look out the windows and appearing irate, frustrated and impatient with his child.<br><br>as he walked towards the doors, he repeatedly jerked this stroller back and forth , a clear sign he was simply taking out on his innocent boy.<br><br>not once, did the child cry when his father handled him roughly or made wilful demands to be attended to. i shuddered in fear each time those scenes replayed  before my eyes.<br><br>many times i felt the urge to bash him for the way he treated this son, especially after i looked several times into the boy's eyes i could tell he wanted attention from anyone, even strangers. but i was stopped by my own inept.<br><br>i can only hope and pray for a better life for this young life.<br><br>i admit i made quite abit of assumptions, such as whether the man is the child's father, whether was it roughly handling i witnessed or was i mistaken, whether the child would receive abuses at home or not.<br></div>
