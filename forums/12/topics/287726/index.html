Some men find older women nice to be with and some women find younger guys fun to be with. When it comes down starting a relationship proper, things change. Guys will kinda feel pressured when it comes to starting a serious relationship with older women. Is she going to tie me down soon ? Can i meet her friends and relate to them ? What does my parents think? So on and so forth. Its lot like guys set out to find older women when they are looking for a relationship less casual ones.<br><br>For the couple of women i know who went out with younger guys, things were quite fun as they would put it. However they found that there was still a gap in mentality. These guys do not know what they want. They'll hardly bring you out to meet their friends and neither do they meet your friends...and after awhile they will just disappear from your life.<br><br>I may be wrong but sometimes shit happens.

I'm sure there are such people around. It seems that there is a trend of having casual relationships. Free then meet, not free then don't meet. Kinda just in it to drive away boredom and loneliness. However when things start to become more serious then it'll get a lil more tricky. It'll be time to make a decision and thats when you'll see people disappear.</div>

Guys will kinda feel pressured when it comes to starting a serious relationship with older women. Is she going to tie me down soon ? Can i meet her friends and relate to them ? What does my parents think? So on and so forth. Its lot like guys set out to find older women when they are looking for a relationship less casual ones.<br><br>For the couple of women i know who went out with younger guys, things were quite fun as they would put it. However they found that there was still a gap in mentality. These guys do not know what they want. They'll hardly bring you out to meet their friends and neither do they meet your friends...and after awhile they will just disappear from your life.<br><br>I may be wrong but sometimes shit happens. I hope you meet the right guy though.</div></blockquote>i jus feel a r/s is 2 ppl whether they can get along fine.<br>even if serious ones, why bother abt frens and fam??<br><br>cos ultimately the partner is the one spendin the whole<br>life wif.....if frens and fam really like them then must<br>give blessin lor....why pour cold water.<br><br>unless they really mistreat the other and really cant connect.<br><br>also if they could communicate why cant their frens??<br>im sure their frens are likeminded.<br><br>as for fam........shouldnt b a prob one la....<br>why meddle so much into siblin affair.<br>parents wise....well so long as they r<br>nice ppl i dun see why they would reject.<br><br>i think its like excuses....they dun luv the person enuf.<br>if they really love the person then they dun mind<br>wat other ppl say and also dun mind the age and<br>also dun mind to commitment.<br><br>i see many young chaps sayin yes at the altar.<br><br></div>

I'm sure there are such people around. It seems that there is a trend of having casual relationships. Free then meet, not free then don't meet. Kinda just in it to drive away boredom and loneliness. However when things start to become more serious then it'll get a lil more tricky. It'll be time to make a decision and thats when you'll see people disappear.</div></blockquote>so sayin its the job these days makin ppl hv casual r/s</div>
