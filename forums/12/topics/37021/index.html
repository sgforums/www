I think the point is to really find ways to do things together.. new things or old ones that haven been done for a long time... Try not to let a relationship become too monotonous or else it wont be the passion that is keeping the relationship together but a state of used-to-each-other that is keeping things from falling apart.. that is the graveyard to a relationship.. not marriage as they always say.</div>
