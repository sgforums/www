            <div class='col-md body'>I have a friend who's dearer to me like a sis...I told her most of my problems regarding the girl that I mentioned in my other post...both of them were best friends last time...but due to certain circumstances they weren't as close as they were compared to last time...the girl whom I am in love with still treats my friend as a friend...however my friend doesn't really treat her as a friend anymore and told me that she won't be looking her up during the holidays...she told me that she heard a lot of things that the girl did which were not too good...and she was quite disappointed in me as I am still being "disillusioned" by her when many others have already found out the truth...<br><br>However, I believe in the girl and I know that she's quite nice...rumours are always degrading and I have never believed in any of them...anyway now comes my problems...my friend trust me and I trust her too more than anything else and treats her as a sis...but the other girl also treats me as her best friend now...so..should I tell her anything or should I just keep quiet...I really hope both of them can be friends again although the situation seems unlikely at the moment...I don't want any of them to be hurt...I might, out of love for the girl, tell the girl about what her friend thought of her right now but the other girl is also really important to me not as a lover but as a "sis"...There's no reason for me to do so or what I thought I can possibly accomplished by doing so...It's just that I care for the girl and do not want her to get hurt by anybody at all...I know she does not like people to be talking behind her back...but at the same time...I respect my friend too...*Sighs* what should I do...?</div>

If they ever, one day, decided to forgive each other, they will, if not in many cases it will end up in more trouble. nong qiao fan zhuo.</div>
