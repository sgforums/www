              why do u label those who go there as crazy..I don't get it.
              Even professionals like doctors,lawyers, businessman go to,psychiatrists to talk to them etc.
              It's illogical to label them as crazy.
              
              Don't judge them so harshly before you even get to know them and the situation they are in.

              1. Going there not equals to being crazy.
              Go there. They help u. Done. 
              Main thing is, u get help.
              What others think of u is secondary.

              <p>A crazy person will never admit he/she is crazy.</p>
              <p>So, if u believe u r not crazy, then go and see the psychiatrist to be professionally evaluated.</p>
              <p>Hormonal and chemical imbalance in our brains seems more common now, because we didn't know of such things before..so many cases went undiscovered/reported.</p>
              <p>As medical science advance, we will discover more problems so we can find treatment.</p>
              <p>Your case is still controllable.. There r many mental illnesses that r uncurable or even untreatable. Alzheimer's , Pakinson disease, dementia, autism...etc...</p>
              <p>At least for u, u can pop a pill in your mouth to balance chemistry in your brain.</p>
              <p>A psychiatrist is a medical doctor, he/she can only help u if u r willing to help yourself.</p>
              <p>I help out in a school occasionally, there I know of many kids with ADHD,Some as young as 6 years old. they r on medications to calm them down , so they do not become destructive/disruptive, so they can focus and learn. </p>

              <p>sounds like you have double personality.  Whatever, I think a psychologist is more appropriate for you.   If need be, the psychologist will refer you to psychiatrist.</p>

In NUS, they have their own resident psychiatrists who are often fully occupied due to <span id="GRmark_f8e7eb63ca19d3c3143040ceb5e7f52fa888800f_high level:0" class="GRcorrect">high level</span> of stress among students. They also have their own psychologists and <span id="GRmark_9c8fd2e477076a7033bc1fc8c5b110af6706e6f2_counsellors:0" class="GRcorrect" style="background-color: #ffffff;">counsellors</span>. There are also some cases of suicidal tendency among students. There is no need to be ashamed that you visit one and your case is definitely a serious one to suggest a visit.</p>
              <p>It is clear from reading your comment that you do have a problem which everybody has. Ten percent of <span id="GRmark_5f0ab3a771cbe4e059e67cff57c26b01d1f00a6c_American:0" class="GRcorrect">American</span> are on Prozac which is anti-depressant drugs dispensable only by <span id="GRmark_5f0ab3a771cbe4e059e67cff57c26b01d1f00a6c_psychiatrist:1" class="GRcorrect">psychiatrist</span>.</p>
              <p>You should understand that they are doing this since they care about your well-being and your future. Why do not you go to psychiatrists and listen to what he/she has to say first? Why rebels against what you are not sure what will happen?  If they give you medication, why not consider it as people giving you Panadol because of <span id="GRmark_44c660e2dbb4abd4bc0dea7d00608445f8a95936_headache:0" class="GRcorrect">headache</span> or antibiotic because of flu? </p>
              <p>If you fear that that people consider that you are insane, remember that there is a little bit of insanity in everybody. I also think medical science has begun to move away from classifying people as insane because to call somebody insane means there should be a fictional person classified as the "normal man" which do not exist in reality. </p>

              Depression and attempted suicide is no joke. If you think the

              <p>Being outspoken and making appeal to MOE about bullies is normal. In fact you are living your dream as an activist.</p>
              <p>However, throwing paper balls and splurting water at your teachers is a big no no. Showing middle finger at your teacher is a serious offence. You are actually disturbing the class. In Malaysia, I would have been whacked. I remember when I was a schoolkid, I was caught sitting on the railing. For that, the discplinary teacher called me in, he was a big guy, his hand was as big as my head and I was only 9 then. He gave me a big tight slap and I flew half way the room. But those days are over, I recall during my time, discplinary teachers used to cane us like hell. But since we students spoke up, complain to PTA, even got the press to publish about the negative effects of public canning, the schools then stopped canning us.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think you do have a problem. Its more of a displinary problem. U were damn lucky you didn't get expelled. No wonder you were calling your teachers - bullies. They are focusing on you because you reacted very negatively. I can understand that you wrote letter to MOE but doing those actions really make your case to MOE the more bad because as you already said, you are the instigator. You cannot throw things at your teachers. If I did that to my boss at work, I would be sacked.</p>
              <p>But no you are not crazy. I think you have bad displinary problem and your EQ is very low. What you need to do is to focus on your emotional intelligence. </p>
              <p>Tell your principal that you need to see the psychologist to improve your EQ but you do not want to be labelled as crazy because psychologist got the tendency to do that.</p>
              <p>Your problem is that you react to things too impulsively. You need to find out how to react to things more calmly so that people would see a good light or perception of you.</p>
              <p>Is there light at end of tunnel? Likely. But you got a lot of hard work ahead of you.</p>
              <p> You need to confront your problems. Suicide is the coward's way. Don't worry, there have been many people who faced down but managed to get back to their lifes. Just look at the actress Drew Barrymore. When she was young, she had alcohol problems, suicidal tendencies. She bared her breasts in the David letterman show. Everyone thought her life was spiralling down. Nobody in hollywood wanted to hire her. And then she decided to clean up her act, give up alcohol. Today, she produced big budget movies like Charlie's angel. She even directed a movie. And she is pregnant and recently married. She even achieve A-list star status in Hollywood.</p>
              <p>You can do it. Just tell yourself this. You want to improve. Not for the sake of the teacher or the principal but for yourself. Not sure if you are close to your parents. But if you care for them, you should also strive to do better in life. Rather than give up - that is so cowardly. Do not speak of suicide - its only for stupid people with cow sense.</p>

              <p>Fuck them. They have no power to do it. If they "make" you see a psychiatrist, it is because they tricked you into thinking they have the power to "make" you go there.</p>
              <p>You graduate with good results. That is the only piece of paper you have to take with you to enrol in your next school. No testimionial, fuck it. It's not important.</p>
              <p>Nobody can just tag another record to you.</p>
              <p>Most principals have careers at stake. They won't send an email to your next school. Even if you do, the new principal or dean won't discriminate against you just like that.</p>
