              <p><br>REPORT: <strong>JUDITH TAN</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SHE was his patient, and the psychiatrist was treating her for the trauma she suffered when she was sexually assaulted</p>
              <p>  But their doctor-patient relationship turned into a 13-year affair.</p>
              <p>  Dr Douglas Kong Sim Guan (right), 63, was yesterday suspended for three years from June 24 and fined $10,000 by the Singapore Medical Council (SMC), the regulatory body overseeing all doctors here.</p>
              <p>  The behavioural science consultant in private practice was also ordered to pay the cost of the proceedings.</p>
              <p>  The case arose from a complaint by his patient more than two years ago.</p>
              <p>  The gist Dr Kong, also known as Sim Heng Guan, had been in a sexual relationship With her from 1996 to 2009 while he was still her psychiatrist</p>
              <p>  He was practising at The Psychiatric &amp; Behavioural Medicine Clinic (Ang &amp; Kong) at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre when he committed the offence.</p>
              <p>  The woman first consulted Dr Kong, who is married, in December 1993.</p>
              <p>  She was believed to have suffered trauma after being sexually assaulted by her piano teacher.</p>
              <p>  While Dr Kong fought the charges brought against him at the disciplinary inquiry, the fact that he had had a sexual relationship with the patient between 1997 and 2008 was never denied.</p>
              <p>  In his defence, he said that he stopped treating the patient on June 5, 1997, and that their relationship began only after that when she seduced him.</p>
              <p>  But the evidence presented to SMC showed that Dr Kong had been prescribing her medication from Dec 1, 1993, to Dec 24, 2009.</p>
              <p>  It was shown that he wrote her a medical certificate on Jan 22, 2007, and was the "admitting doctor" when she was hospitalised on July 13 that year for anxiety and depression.</p>
              <p>  Dr Kong said that the times they met for dinner and sex were "unsuited for psychiatric consultations", alluding to the non-doctor -patient relationship.</p>
              <p>  He further contended that a doctor "giving prescription to spouse, children or family members or close friends would not create a doctor-patient relationship".</p>
              <p>  He also said that since a mistress is recognised in many countries as a" de facto" wife, "providing prescription to one's mistress cannot constitute a doctor-patient relationship".</p>
              <p>  While there was no evidence that Dr Kong had discharged her from his care, he maintained that he was not aware of "any standard practice by doctors to expressly document that a patient was discharged" or when a patient becomes an ex-patient.<br>  <br>  He also contended that the patient's evidence could not be believed as she had a "borderline personality" and had been out to trap and destroy him since January 2007.</p>
              <p>  The SMC disciplinary committee found that there was proof beyond reasonable doubt that the doctor-patient relationship continued until 2009.</p>
              <p>  It also said that Dr Kong's attempt to liken a mistress to a wife was misconceived, because theirs had started as a doctor-patient relationship.</p>
              <p>  The patient had deep emotional issues when Dr Kong first met her and "his sexual relationship with her can only be interpreted as taking advantage of her troubled state and vulnerability, let alone exacerbating and complicating her marital problems".</p>
              <p>  As for his claim that she had seduced him, the committee said Dr Kong could have stopped her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 22pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">'Encouraged her'</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead, he "encouraged her, directly or indirectly, by visiting her at her home, taking her to her physiotherapist and accompanying her to a hotel".</p>
              <p>  The New Paper's attempts to contact Dr Kong yesterday were unsuccessful.</p>
              <p>  He is not the first doctor to be rapped for having sex with a patient.</p>
              <p>  In February 2008, a former consultant gynaecologist at KKWomen's &amp; Children's Hospital was suspended for two years for having an affair with his married patient</p>
              <p>  He had tampered with his lover's hospital records, failed to account for her visits and did not properly document her medical condition and the results of her medical examinations.</p>
              <p>  The doctor was also suspended from practice for a year in 2009 at the CRM Fertility Clinic in London.</p>
              <p>  According to SMC, a doctor's conduct must, "at all times, be above suspicion".</p>
              <p>  Under its ethical code and ethical guidelines, a doctor must not have a sexual relationship with a patient, or be involved in an adulterous relationship with immediate family menibers of the patient. (See report on right)</p>
              <p>  Such a union would disrupt the patient's family life and damage the relationship of trust between the doctor and his family.</p>
              <p>  Doctors whom TNP spoke to said that they always have a female chaperone in the examination room or leave a connecting door open when treating female patients.</p>
              <p>  "If the topic is an intimate one, always make it a point to have her spouse or partner along," said a family physician in a Bukit Timah clinic.</p>
              <p>  The doctor, who declined to be named, said he plasters his office with pictures of his wife and family.</p>
              <p>  "Always mention the wife when you sense some 'come-on' signals from the patients. It's also good if the wife works with you," he added.</p>
              <p>  Another, an aesthetic doctor with a practice in town, said he would always tell patients who hit on him that he is "attached".</p>
              <p>  "I will let them down easy and still keep a friendly demeanour. Otherwise, it would jeopardise the doctor" patient relationship," he said.</p>
              <p>  Some physicians said they always do house calls with a nurse in tow, refer gynaecological issues to "the specialists", and never touch patients unless necessary<br>and always ask permission before doing so.</p>
              <p>  One patient, who wanted to be known only as Fiona, 28, admitted that temptation once got the better of her.</p>
              <p>  The secretny, who is being treated for sex addiction, said: "There were times during the sessions when I wanted to (have sex with) my psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>  "During the discussions of my addiction, I always get hot and bothered."</p>
              <p>  When asked if she tried, she admitted: "Once, even though he was much older and nothing much to look at.</p>
              <p>  "But that quickly stopped when he, like an old uncle, actually told me off."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The Singapore Medical Council's ethical code and ethical guidelines state explicitly that a doctor must not have a sexual relationship with a patient.</p>
              <p>  It states: "This is to preserve the absolute confidence and trust of a doctor-patient relationship.</p>
              <p>  "A doctor must also not, as a result of his professional relationship, enter into an adulterous or any other improper association with the immediate members of the patient's family.</p>
              <p>  "Such a relationship would disrupt the patient's family life and damage the relationship of trust between the doctor and his family.</p>
              <p>  "A doctor's conduct must at all times be above suspicion."</p>
              <p>  Doctors who engage in sexual relationships with their patients may be found guilty of professional misconduct under the Medical Registration Act.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Lawyers, similarly, have the duty to exhibit the highest standards of professionalism in their relationships with clients.</p>
              <p>  Under the Legal Profession Act, a lawyer who has had personal or sexual relationships with his client may be found guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty.</p>
              <p>  If lawyers become too involved in their clients' personal lives during the existence of the lawyer-client relationship, they may face a conflict of interest, and the clients' interests may be seriously prejudiced</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Those in the teaching profession are expected to live up to their commitment in the Ministry of Education' s Teachers' Pledge.</p>
              <p>  The pledge, which is available on the ministry's website, states among other things, that teachers "will be exemplary in the discharge of our duties and responsibilities".</p>

              <p>This just remind me of an science show I have seen. There is once an psychiatrist name "Dr" Ewen Cameron who invented an treatment method of using an tape recorder to "implant" positive message to his patient like "People like me and respect me" which is one of so-called "brainwash" bullshit methods. It only work for an short time before his patient 's illness returned back again.</p>
              <p>Because Cameron is one of Naruto the pang sai believer who want to win Nobel Prize so much plus the fact his research fund is support by CIA which is in danger of being terminated if none of his methods work, so this time he try to control his patient behaviour by isolating his patient for week and feeling them with drug and electroshock more than standard procedure. In the end he paid an awful price for his patient when their mind become like an infant and the Canada government was forced to pay the compensation to them. Still I think that in Singapore, at least psychiatry is regulated and you will not faced the same problem like Ewen Cameron.
