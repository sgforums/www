              <p>I never said that. In fact TS has some behaviours that don't seem socially acceptable.</p>
              <p>If his family and friends cannot help him, he should consider seeing a psychiatrist on his own to help him avoid worse behaviours.</p>
              <p>Seeing a psychiatrist does not mean you are mad or will have a record. There is a stigma but there is no national database of people who go to one. There is no record unless you commit criminal acts. The psychiatrist will keep it confidential.</p>

              <p><br>Not the time to think about friends anyway. You got a crisis in your hands.</p>
              <p>Maybe you should see a psychiatrist and psychologist. It is not normal to throw paper balls at your teacher. It is not normal to say bad words to your teacher. It is not normal to show your third finger at your teacher. It is not normal to want to commit suicide.</p>
              <p>See them not because you are crazy, see them because you want to change your behaviour. You have behaviour problems.</p>
              <p>The fact that your principal didn't expel you and instead want you to go see a psychiatrist - may mean that he is actually wanting to help you, maybe you can still be savaged.</p>

              Just a suggestion:
              Maybe you can look for friends from unconventional places,mainly those who can be sincere and understand you.
              
              What do you like to do?Maybe you can focus on that.if you don't know, try out different things.A good hobby can help.
              
              Sometimes,it take disipline to control your character to suit others.Just keep on trying.

                  <div class="quote_body">
                  <p>Hmm.. lets see... Since primary 4, i've been suicidal and looking at things in a negative way. The whole story of my life is very long but u just need to know i kena a lot of shit. P4 to p6, nervous every single day for little little things. Sec1 to sec2, depressed and attempted suicide. Sec3, felt like a god and have superpowers. sec4, which is now, depressed again.<br><br>And somehow, i ended up in the principal's office, and she told me she recommends that i see a child psychiatrist.<br><br>How i ended up there..? I have been constant feeling depressed from the start of sec4 until now and i couldn't stand it any longer so i told the dean (AKA the person in charge of the whole sec4 cohort) the whole story of my pathetic life. At first, he asked my form teacher to talk to me. It didnt work so he asked counselors from REACH to talk to me (yesterday i found out that the counselors were sent by MOE, by request of the principal). And again, it didnt work.<br><br>So, i was convincing the dean to just leave me alone because he's not helping at all. And who knows that i suddenly emailed MOE about some issues (the education system and teachers's attitude towards students's emotional and mental wellbeing). I ended up in the vice principal's office but luckily he said i did a good thing by raising awareness of the issue.<br><br>But somehow i started doing things without knowing what im doing. I threw paper balls at my teachers in their face and even spray water at them with Nike water bottle. And when they asked to talk to me, i said a whole lot of vulgarities and insulted them. Then once, i put a bag over my head and pointed both my middle fingers. Right now, i dont fully remember doing those things and the more i think about it, the more unreal it seems. Now, it feels like the world is fading away from me and i can barely continue typing. And my head has been hurting since this morning.<br><br>Before i knew it, the school called me and said the principal wished to see me.<br><br>There, in her office, she dropped the 'bomb' on me. SHE THINKS I SHOULD SEE A PSYCHIATRIST!! AND SHE SAY I GOT HUGE MOOD SWINGS. What????? U don't see me dressing up as a clown and laughing like crazy and then suddenly take a chopper and starts chopping everyone right???<br><br>Apparently, there are different stages of help. 1. teachers 2. school counselors 3. REACH counselors/ MOE counselors 4. Psychiatrist 5. Mental hospital (i think)<br><br>So, I went through number 1, skipped number 2 and jumped to number 3, and now they want me to go to number 4. It seems that the only reason i am able to skip number 2 is because i told the dean i've already been through 10+++ useless counseling sessions.<br><br>The good thing is, the principal say she wont force me to see a psychiatrist if i dont want to.<br><br>But here's the thing.<br><br>I'm not sure if the teachers will leave me alone after this. I know i was the one who seek help first. But now I seriously just want to be left alone. I wanted help, but not such a serious help. The moment the dean told me he has booked professional counselors from REACH to counsel me, I already want to back out liao. Which idiot will actually willingly see a professional counselor and psychiatrist? The thing i really hate about it is the fact that I will be seen as crazy. I'm fine. I'm normal. I'm not gonna let anyone think of me as crazy.<br><br>But my emotions and actions are not something i can control. If i can control it, i wouldn't be here typing this thing. Even if the teachers somehow promise to leave me alone, I know that i will somehow do something that will give the teachers a chance to label me as crazy. Gosh, i think the principal had a talk with ALL my teachers, asking how i behave in class.<br><br>I dunno what to do now. I don't want to see a psychiatrist or a counselor and take whatever stupid medicine, but at the same time, these stupid overwhelming feelings of mine wouldn't go away. I'm totally not gonna see a psychiatrist, not unless they drag me there. So what should I do now? It's impossible for the teachers to completely leave me alone. How can they leave me alone? Me, student who got recommended to see a psychiatrist by the school PRINCIPAL.<br><br>Any suggestion, help, opinion will be helpful. But please, no mean or cruel remarks.<br><br>I do not believe or think im crazy. but i am aware that others see me as crazy.</p>
