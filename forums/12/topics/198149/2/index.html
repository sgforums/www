            <div class='col-md body'>The fact you like yr colleague so much is becos you never channel all yr love and attention to yr wife! You say you still love yr wife but yet you are thinking of other woman and it affects you so much that you post it on here and ask for help. Isn't it contradicts what you say? Try to reignite the passion and fire between yr wife and you.<br><br>Did u make a effort to please and care for yr wife,make a effort to find back the passion during the courtship? Prepare a nite of spa and romantic dinner at a hotel and give yr wife a big surprise. Or prepare a bonquet of red roses and a home make candle light dinner,then have a good nite of making out! Once with the passion back,u will realise it just factuation for yr colleague!<br><br>Good Luck!</div>

We are only humans, and if you think you will NEVER see someone you might find likeable, then you have no preparation to face an encounter like this. In fact, I always think it is good to have someone you enjoy looking at while at work. It helps u to want to go to work.<br><br>Secondly, I think you need to first address the 'home ground' issue. You may love ur wife now. But trust me, it is very easy for human beings to make 'excuses' to themselves. The moment your wife (also being human presumably) does something that irritates you or frustrates you, you will start to 'explain' to yourself that the whole marriage thing appears to have problems. Previously, you might be pissed off but forgive more easily. But now, you have a reason to not forgive and forget that easily. So what to do?? I agree w above poster that during weekends when not 'affected' by outside attraction, to plan something special for your wife and 'fill' up whatever emptiness you feel inside ur heart and try to enjoy the time spent w ur wife as much as u can. Basically protect ur home ground, make it a pleasant place for yourself<br>Thirdly, don't think about ... 'this type' and 'that type' Its VERY limiting. Most human imagination have a 'type' that they think is 'ideal' What they don't realise that simply because something don't fit the 'type' doesnt mean it isnt IDEAL for themselves. Most guys would say 'their type' is the type of wife that is sweet, demure, good natured acceptably pretty.. bla bla..but most men don't marry women like this primarily becos MOST women arent sweet, demure, good natured all the time.<br><br>For an inexplicable reason, my husband suggests you tell ur wife. (hmmm! He says he would tell me) I think if your wife is that type that can understand what's happening <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. This might make both of u closer even! Hee... human nature is something that can be rather unpleasant. Helps if both of u learn to stand on the same line to fight against it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, you can do whatever your heart desires and there's no right or wrong unless you want to go seek advice from police.<br><br>Whether you like her or not doesn't matters at all. Even you aren't sincere towards her and wreck her marriage and yours, it's also your own choice and freedom and free-will. Remember it's your life and there's no gain without putting anything on the line, in this case...it's your marriage against your desires.<br><br>Seriously, I don't really know who is truly faithful anymore in this world that we're living in. Regardless of guys or girls, once they met someone better that they like...they will all become selfish and it's very selfish. So it's not surprising that you chose the better between your wife and the married office girl. Got sick of seeing your wife right?<br><br>All guys and girls are horny alright, and whoever says they aren't horny can go swear a deadly vow and prepare to go to Hell. Who doesn't feels attracted and desires after someone more attractive and desirable?<br><br>One thing though...NEVER tell your wife about this incident. You should and must keep it from her in order to protect her and keep your marriage vows. Cos she will be terribly upset to know about it, and since you should not bring unnecessary emotional upset to her. A Man must know when to lie and when not to lie, and in cases like this...if you should keep it from her to protect her happiness if you still regard her as your wife. She won't tell you anyway if she were in your situation, so don't bring unnecessary emotional pain to anyone.<br><br>Since there's no right or wrong in this kind of matters and since it's your own life and future and happiness that's on the line at the moment. You should make your own decision. You will either end up happier next year or more miserable next year. And it's also a good test to see how much resolve you have in yourself and how much you really wanted her to be in your future. Whatever the outcome may be, if you truly love this office woman...you will be ready for any consequences that follows. Who knows? You might not be miserable ultimately and you could very well be happier and living a more fulfilling life together with her.<br><br>You can make a decision, but ultimately...it's eventually up to her if she is willing to put her own marriage, happiness and future on the line. Why don't you go and find out for yourself?<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
