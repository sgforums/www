But both of you are married, think of your spouse whether does they deserve this or not...

Think of all the difficulties that you have overcome to be together with your spouse and think of all the good times and moments you have spent with your spouse...

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello lawsuit...<br><br>Seriously, you are vulnerable to be sued for sexual harassment or discrimination. Remember you are working. You are also her superior. One misstep and you can ruin your career, possibly more.<br><br>Yaya, I dont need to say all this....career, family, etc, I think you also know already.<br><br>Try to see her in a different light.<br><br>But how? Well, a man's weakness is three and only three. Money, power, woman. Now you are tested with woman. Keep this in your mind and vow to yourself that you will pass the test. This will change how you think a bit.<br><br>I also suggest you devote your energy into something else you like, dont channel so much attention into her. Do you like soccer? Now there is World Cup, you can get satisfaction and enjoyment from it. What else do you like? Think about what you like, what you are obsessed with, and channel your attention into it. Your preoccupation with the girl should be supplanted and replaced with another similarly intoxicating and enjoyable, but wholesome, adventure. This will help you get your mind off her.</div>

Romance and passion is like a fire. It needs to be constantly fed and maintained. Love can still be there but romance and passion needs attention. I think you might have lost the romance/passion factor but you still love your wife. Go find ways to re-ignite that spark with your wife and please do it more often. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you really buay tahan, go find pro n bang a few..

This may sound crude.. But you need to understand the difference between man and animals.. Man has the ability to rationalise... Don't succumb to emotions aka lust for this scenario...<br><br>Alternatively, accept that this emotion is part of you.. Don't have to feel guilty or bad towards it... Have faith in your character. I'm sure if you have the confidence, you can simply laugh it off when the feeling arises. The more you dwell on the "feelings", the more you are feeding it... Man has a unique psycho self of rubbing salt over their own wounds...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Give yourself a break and step out of the torment. You deserve it!<br><br>Lastly.. If it makes you feel any better... Office sexcapades are pretty common nowadays... Plenty of married couples are having Fbuddies behind their spouses' back.. Enjoy the thrill and excitement! But you'll never be able to look back again...<br><br>"he felt guilty after their first robbery... he felt uneasy after their 2nd robbery... he led their 3rd robbery..."<br><br></div>
