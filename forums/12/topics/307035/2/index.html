              <p><br>As much as I tried to summon up some sympathies for you, I couldn't. They said <em>"Youth is wasted on the young" </em>and I hope you won't continue to demostrate that.</p>
              <p>I'd advise you to continue with counselling or even seek psychiatric help. What things go wrong, it's naturally easier to point fingers - I hope you would further examine yourself and become a better person.</p>
              <p>Lastly, you gave the stuff to her... So just let her have it and leave with some dignity; so far as I know, you've already caused her enough harm...</p>
              <p>Alas, such unenlightened mind.</p>

              <p>Looking through your post. I noticed you are like a viral infection.</p>
              <p>The symptoms manifest when the relationship is weak.</p>
              <p>The only way to get rid of you , is to let the virus runs its course.</p>

              <p>The virus, mutates and infect another host.</p>
              <p>But Seph, I sense there is some resentment in you, towards the people around you.</p>
              <p>Your happiness stems from their misery.</p>
              <p>Such a person, cannot love whole heartedly. Meaning you will always have a hole in your heart.</p>
