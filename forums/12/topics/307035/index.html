              <p>First of all why include explicit content in hard solid book?</p>
              <p>Rule of thumb- never write these things down 'cause you know somehow people would find it.</p>
              <p>You're like the many who've asked advices around here (which unfortunately included the long ago me). Stop dwelling on the past.
                  Encapsulating all the memories down into a book is but a manifestation of a secret desire to reconcile. As is your seemingly innocent to "be friends".</p>
              <p>You've scarred her the moment you hit her and <strong>you know it.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"><strong>Do both of you a favour now and remain out-of-contact while you recollect yourself and she herself.</strong></p>
              <p>The above has been said many times by numerous people in your previous thread and yet you continue, apparently not heeding this particular advice. So why post here if you don't heed the advice many had posted?</p>
              <p>Cool down now and forget about trying to contact her. You simply cannot handle the situation now (as what you've said above) and she does not deserve to suffer any of the mistakes you may make trying to handle the situation (again, what you've said above).</p>

              well.. in a way it's ur fault though so you have no right to take revenge though. just leave her alone though. in the first u should not have written it anyway though. but u did so can u just stop ur nonsense n be mature just for once?

              if u have ur way of doing things, why bother writing here to get advice then? if u dun event want to heed our advice though. why do u want to get through to her in the first place? dun u knoe that ur relationship is already over the minute u hit her, so get over it ok? well.. if i put urself in ur shoes, i would leave the girl alone n avoid hurting any further. if u really love someone, you have to know when to let go lo.

              <p>i guess the forumnites are just simply advising you from a third person POV. someone who can see things out of the box. you're so cooped up in this little dimension of yours where all you think is just trying to get things up and running again. i know you're afraid of losing her but the situation is now not in your favour you've got to understand this. you know it actually becomes irritable when you're persistently bugged by someone whom you don't want to see?</p>
              <p>please do yourself and her a favour. stop seeing her for the moment. give her a cool off period. you've already told her you'll wait. you've done your part. its just up to her whether she's willing to give it another go. sometimes, what you really need is time. time to heal all wounds.</p>
              <p>and i hope you do put yourself in your girl's shoes. think about what is she going through. life is miserable enough as it is when she actually gave her 'virginity' to you. if she was one before she did it with u tt is. which girl in the right mind wouldn't get angry when she heard her bf had casual sex before getting tgt with her? and you punched your girl? if i were to punch your face right now you tell me by tomorrow you forgive me and be all buddy buddy again? i believe your message of remorse and regret have gotten through to her clearly. so for now, please just leave her alone for the time being.</p>

              <p>You just want to be friends with her, yet you continue to do things beyond a friend. You want to "wait" for her, yet you continuously do things to rush her. You post in AA, yet whatever we say just bounces off you like a dart against the solid wall.</p>
              <p>Forgive us for not suggesting things <em>your way.</em> 'Cause last I checked, <em>your way</em> involves punching your girlfriend and writing down your sexual escapades with her in a book.

              <p>one moment you were saying broke up, wanted to be friends etc...and then the next moment you write her a book of the memories and saying if you dont write the book, would it get through her? what message are you trying to convey to her? that you cherish the memories and hope to get back together again?</p>
              <p>you say you have your own way of doing things, but has your own way of doing things really helped your situation? it only makes things worse than they were. if you still choose to do things the way you want it and dont want to heed advice, no point coming back here telling us how you regret doing this and that and ask for advice here. in the end, you still go back to do things your own way.</p>
