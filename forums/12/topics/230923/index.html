            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I am writing in here bcos I am not sure if I should be feeling this way for the right reason... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Here's the story: I am a full time teacher based in a private learning center, and my salary is quite high compared to the others in the company (but I think it is considered low compared to wat others can get in other companies). I am assigned a number of classes to teach every week, and I handle around 15 to 20 students every week (I have my own class, and the number stays fixed until the next intake in March). Currently I am handling two main courses for the company, and I teach 3 hours for 3 days in a week and 6 hours for the other three days (but I have to stay in the office for the remaining 3 hours). The remaining hours, when I first signed the work agreement, they told me are for me to prepare for my lessons. So that's fine with me.<br><br>But recently they have been asking me to take over some other teachers' classes...whenever they go on leave, I will have to take over their classes even though their lessons have nothing to do at all with the classes I have to teach. So it is like I have to make extra preparation to deal with the extra classes they assign to me. So if some part-timers take time off for a week, me and another full timer had to handle all their classes...so means extra 4 classes per week, so now it wud be like teaching 6 hours for 4 or 5 days...<br><br>So I am starting to feel like this is unfair, especially my own course that I am supposed to handle need a lot of preparation. I cant prepare when I am in the classroom teaching another class which I am not supposed to handle. I brought this matter up before to my superior, and he said he wud not ask me to take up any of these classes anymore, but after that he just asked the admin to give them to me and I had to accept them, bcos how to go against the boss?<br><br>And next week seems like there is a convention in my company, and everyone is heading to that (even some part-timers) but me and another full time teacher had to stay back to handle the whole center. They are asking to take over some other teachers' classes again and also asked if I can handle the admin table they will be gone. So I am thinking that it is kinda unfair they are dumping all these kinda things on me. Or is it really unfair?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Maybe they think that I am one of the highly paid so I have to do much more work?</div>
