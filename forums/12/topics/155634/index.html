They probably won't drive you up the wall, doing so also won't benefit them much...<br><br>Why is your hubby's debts under your name? Anyway to 'shake it off'...?<br><br>How old is your child?</div>

I had to write to credit card banks asking them to allow for installment payments etc. Bcos of him, my credit history is so bad now that no bank is willing to give me a credit card now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I did not think of killing myself, neither should you think of giving up, especially so if u have a kid to live for... one suggestion is that if the debts are incurred in his name, hv him declare himself a bankrupt, then all the creditors can't come after him or u. and btw, in case u r wondering, even if he is a bankrupt, u won't lose your flat, from personal experience as my ex declared bankrupt..<br><br>so stay strong, live and fight another day!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </span></div>

But he made headlines just a day before I decides. I was so very angry and disappointed with him. But after almost 6 months now, my feeling are numbed. I don't feel anything towards him now not even anger. Now I just make sure my child has food in her stomach etc.... for other thing I've given up!</div>
