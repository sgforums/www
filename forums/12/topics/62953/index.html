Somemore I suspect there are someone in her life rite nw..<br><br>At that time, I was engaging in self-pity, thinking bk the happy moments... and no mood for work (can u imagine starting work when wife just left the previous day?)...or anything at all....but it's great that I have a best pal and loved ones who have been supporting me all this while.......<br><br>Life still gotta carry on....it's not the time to ponder who is at fault nw....cause it's simply useless...As I have told u several times, u gotta let her go..if u had already done yr best to salvage the situation.

I wished I did the same. I think she knows that I have not gotten over her. I did the same thing, well after much begging for her to come back, I eventually forced myself , yeah really dragged my myself through a field of thorns, and told her that I wish her and the new guy good luck, and I will never look back again.<br><br>I do agree with you... I don't wanna see her again, not so soon at least, I have not met her since we broke up. I think it would really hurt me to see her again, double the pain to see her with the other guy.  think eventually I have to force myself to stop calling and emailing her too.<br><br>Really love her man... really do... wants her to be happy, even if it means stabbing myself with a knife.<br><br></div>
