I don't think being permanently depressed is part of life. Seems to me that me, and many other people I see, are either depressed or emotionless, when we deny, hide and repress that depression deep inside us. But we know that will only work for a short time, and when that depression rises to the surface again, it hits us so bad we feel the deepest of despair the soul can feel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Tiramisu,<br><br>I suppose once in awhile, everybody gets that feeling: wondering whether we matter to anyone at all, why problems seem too big for us to resolve, etc.  When we don't tackle problems head-on, all the little little niggly things accumulate into something so huge, it seems unsurmountable.<br><br>It helps to talk to someone, a close friend, a parent, a relative, about these matters.  I know my nephew will drop me an SMS when he feels kinda down, so I have the chance to try &amp; boost his morale again.<br><br>Perhaps what you need is some time-out, to withdraw from others &amp; use the time to nurture yourself.  This is especially true when you've been giving yourself to others: your time, your effort, etc.  You need support during these times, please make sure there's someone you can talk to beside you.<br><br>Not everyone is confident all the time, but we can all hope, Tiramisu.  I'm Not always strong either, but I'm lucky to have people beside me who can help me see that these problems can be solved afterall.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tir4misu:</div><div class="quote_body">its 3.42am in the morning... have been hesitating whether or not to post some thoughts of mine.. well here goes..<br><br>seems like lately everything aint going well for me... big matters... small matters all pilling up into a mess.... y do ppl suddenly get into a sudden emotional distress? the feeling of insignificance... that even if u turned ur handphone off.. not log into msn or whatever ways of communication no one would infact, actually even notice....<br><br>feeling tired...<br><br>'wanna say just say, wanna do just do' a phrase told to me by my friend... sounds seemingly easy to achieve.. but in actual fact.. not..... at least to me...<br><br>what does it take to just do wad u wanna do?<br>what does it take to not fear negative results from ur actions?<br>what does it take to stop assuming and just act?<br><br>probably im just too weak to be like u guys out there who can be straightforward and confident in ur actions.. who knows that u r sure to suceed and thus confident in taking that step...<br><br>nitez...</div></blockquote></div>

To the common folks, it's known as 'think too much.' But of course, knowing your personality, you reminded me of a mandarin proverb - Li bu chong xin.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To overcome your stagnation, you got to remove your fear of failing because you are so afraid of rejection, you pause and consider... so much that nothing is done in the end. </strong></span><br><br>Have you ever tried doing something WITHOUT thinking about the rejection/failing part? You want to be able to remove the fear about negative part? When you have fall enough times... you will gradually get used to it and following on... you will learn the art to survive and NOT to fall the way you did previously.<br><br>This is a natural cycle - learn to embrace them.<br><br>I give you one personal example (can't remember if I did tell you before):<br><br>I used to 'think' alot of Love. This goes even before I ever had my first relationship, so many years back. Everything which came from my thoughts is recorded in the fabled Book of CloUdiSm.<br><br>Everything changed when the first relationship took place.<br><br>I rewrote... renew... refresh... constantly.<br><br>You cannot grasp the essence of success unless you understood what it takes to bring you there. And to understand fully, you got to fall along the way... somehow... absolutely.<br><br>P.S: Quit procrastinating, the release of your mental/emotional bondage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal note: And what's the thing about falling? At the very least, you know I AM ALWAYS HERE... to try and catch you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> [Ok serious] People are AROUND.. dude... people are around. And more importantly, people are concerned... cease the self pity and gain some foothold in yourself.<br><br>There is so much things I (others as well) could tell you, a huge BUT is that because you ain't there. You can only learn so much from knowledge/others - you need experience to complement your learning process. What I speak to you sounds merely logical. You agreed because everything is logical... going through the analysis by the mind. BUT logical is still hardly relevant because you ain't there yet... to understand why. Look at SY... look at where she is now?? Look at her last year... do you see the difference when you speak to her that time? Maturity came in because she finally understood the essence and picture I am painting to her.<br><br>You want to succeed? Have clarity in whatever you are pursuing? Have some strength in personality?<br><br>Start falling now! Learn the use of poison first... before you can create antidotes.</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

To the common folks, it's known as 'think too much.' But of course, knowing your personality, you reminded me of a mandarin proverb - Li bu chong xin.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]To overcome your stagnation, you got to remove your fear of failing because you are so afraid of rejection, you pause and consider... so much that nothing is done in the end. </span></strong><br><br>Have you ever tried doing something WITHOUT thinking about the rejection/failing part? You want to be able to remove the fear about negative part? When you have fall enough times... you will gradually get used to it and following on... you will learn the art to survive and NOT to fall the way you did previously.<br><br>This is a natural cycle - learn to embrace them.<br><br>I give you one personal example (can't remember if I did tell you before):<br><br>I used to 'think' alot of Love. This goes even before I ever had my first relationship, so many years back. Everything which came from my thoughts is recorded in the fabled Book of CloUdiSm.<br><br>Everything changed when the first relationship took place.<br><br>I rewrote... renew... refresh... constantly.<br><br>You cannot grasp the essence of success unless you understood what it takes to bring you there. And to understand fully, you got to fall along the way... somehow... absolutely.<br><br>P.S: Quit procrastinating, the release of your mental/emotional bondage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal note: And what's the thing about falling? At the very least, you know I AM ALWAYS HERE... to try and catch you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> [Ok serious] People are AROUND.. dude... people are around. And more importantly, people are concerned... cease the self pity and gain some foothold in yourself.<br><br>There is so much things I (others as well) could tell you, a huge BUT is that because you ain't there. You can only learn so much from knowledge/others - you need experience to complement your learning process. What I speak to you sounds merely logical. You agreed because everything is logical... going through the analysis by the mind. BUT logical is still hardly relevant because you ain't there yet... to understand why. Look at SY... look at where she is now?? Look at her last year... do you see the difference when you speak to her that time? Maturity came in because she finally understood the essence and picture I am painting to her.<br><br>You want to succeed? Have clarity in whatever you are pursuing? Have some strength in personality?<br><br>Start falling now! Learn the use of poison first... before you can create antidotes.</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers   [/b]</blockquote>experiencing the fall.. and then learn how to cushion it eh...<br><br>guess rite now.. im still afriad of the pain tat could be caused by falling... i mean.. who wont be afriad of "trust fall" when thinking that there wont be anyone behind to support u...<br><br>i will try though^^ i will grow stronger... thx lotz =)</div>

I've always love to act. to do theatre... but i chose my current job because of financial reasons... so when I go watch plays, and look at ppl on stage... I grow so envious! so depressed, thinking why did I chose my line of work. Because a normal job is more secured. why can't I survive doing theatre?
