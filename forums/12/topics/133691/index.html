            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all.. Its me posting again.<br><br>Its been a month since me and her parted. I have been trying to get over it, and still trying. Its not easy....<br><br>After reading the post of "Self Destruct" by Yunhaier.. I believe I am one of the victims..<br><br>For the past one month, I have developed a sense of "I-don't-care" and I have induldged myself in self-abuse... i.e: alcoholism... I cannot survive a day without it anymore. And I think it really takes the troubled thoughts away from me. Try as i might... I simply will end up at the store everynight! getting beer...<br><br>The moment I drink, ah..... soothing...<br><br>I don't understand why.... I do not drink at all in the past.<br><br>Slowly, I began to talk very little and shy away from all people... This is the exact opposite of what i was last time. My mindset have changed alot and I can feel it myself.<br><br>I just wanna share what I am going through. Its a very tedious poccess of going through all this and I am very tired.<br><br>They say "time will heal all wound.." I say its a big fat lie....<br><br>Suffering through a syndrom which i am losing myself.... I do not know how to find myself back...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Malcolm,<br><br>If there's 1 word that raises my hackles, it's the word "victim".  I believe whether or Not you're a victim is by CHOICE.  You can choose to wallow in self-pity, indulge in "Why me?" syndrome &amp; drink yourself silly.  Ultimately, who's gonna end up paying except yourself?<br><br>Of course you're sad when a relationship ends, you're Not alone, MILLIONS of people in the world go through break-ups everyday.  If we had a million drama queens everyday walking around swigging alcohol, withdrawing from people, we'd have ZILLIONS of drunk hermits by now.<br><br>I've gone through break-ups, &amp; even WORSE, believe me, much much WORSE.  But I've refused to be a victim &amp; I refuse to let others think I'm a victim.  I don't need others to pity me, I only need the support of those who're close to me.  I will NOT allow the people who shattered me to see what they'd done.  In fact, if they can hurt me like this, it shows they don't give a damn about me.  Then why should I ruin my life over people whom I shouldn't care about?<br><br>Sure, take time to cry.  But indulging in that self-destruction only shows a weak character, who can't even think sensibly.<br><br>Wake up, will you?<br><br>I know this is harsh, but the word "victim" is so loosely used, it irritates me.  Victim of rape, acceptable.  Victim of murder, acceptable.  Victim of robbery, acceptable.  Victim of a breakup?  What a joke.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mal_colm1979:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all..
