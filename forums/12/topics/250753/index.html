If you realise that your friend is having problems, talk to him. Don't leave friends to fend for themselves when they have problems likely linked to mental health. I am not saying he will start a trigger happy spree in schoo as possibilities are very very low with our strict gun laws. But he could be making a lot of inconvenience to other people as well in time to come. Have a talk, meet him outside for a meal or invite him to group outings and never leave him alone. That was how I helped out colleagues with 'attitude problems' too.</div>

But if he can function and learn stuff normally like other students, you need not be afraid.<br>If you are concerned enough, you should chat with his parents. They probably knows more about his mental conditions.<br>If they are unaware of his behaviour, you did the right thing by highlighting it to his parents so they can do early intervention.<br><br>However, if his parents get defensive and insist there is nothing wrong with him, relax, tell yourself you have already done your part.<br></div>
