            <div class='col-md body'><br>okay its like this....<br>i've been with my girlfriend for about a year.. and life has been rough and tough since she admitted her short fling with a man she's had a crush on... I forgave her out of love but I know deep down I will not forget the pain she's caused..... We've moved on but I can't stop thinking about what she did to me..... Here's my problem:I live in the past and I would often bring up the past when when we fight. She, in turn, would accuse me of not moving on with my life. I really want to but it's not as easy as it seems.<br>I hate to check on her but I go through her mail box, her voice mail...etc I want to stop but I can't &amp; I want to break free but my love for her remains. I want to move on but I'm lost. What on earth am I supposed to do?<br><br>peace out<br>fX-<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to believe in "forgive and forget" and "move on".<br><br>But it does not solve the problem. In fact, the problem keeps coming back to haunt me every now and then. I dun like that feeling.<br><br>Now i believe in "forgive and accept". Only by truly accepting the reality then you can move on and not look back. When I mean "accept" i mean you have accepted the fact that this and this have happened and you have done the best you could and nothing much can be done anymore, so you are happy with it now and *not bothered* by it anymore and you are ready to move on.<br><br>I think if you carry on the way you are now .... checking on your gf and stuff ... both of you will end up breaking off sooner or later.<br><br>If you really think that her fling with that man *bothers* you, why not consider a break from your gf ? This break may mean a permananet one or just a short one. Sometimes, it is good to give each other some space to cool down and *think*<br><br>No matter what it is, all the best to you !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Leave her if you can't forgive and forget.<br><br>Some people think that it's holding on that makes one strong. Sometimes it's letting go makes u strong. This is what i call unrequited love &amp; is the equivalent to<br>banging your head against a wall that isn't there.<br><br>Whatever treasure &amp; wealth u accumulate, they will disperse one day. Whatever high status we struggle for, it will be lost one day. Whoever we love,they will leave us one day.<br><br>Think back. There was a time in your life when you didn't love this person. In fact, there was a time in your life when u didn't even know this person. And u were just fine without them! Loving someone is a learned reaction, through times u have spent together, special moments, etc. Just as you "learned" to love this person, you can learn to unlove them.<br><br>The true fact of the matter is...time does heal. And why does time heal? Because over time u naturally stop thinking of them. This may be due to the fact that u won't be in physical contact with them anymore, u may meet someone new and your thoughts turn to that new person; whatever the case, this is a true statement. so, why not speed things up? believe me, thinking of them, wishing for them, &amp; pining away for them, will not bring them back. And speaking from experience, all it will get u is a new set of wrinkles! And, if they should come crawling back in the days ahead, with their pathetic tail between their legs...u will be in a much better frame of mind to deal with them a second time around if you have put them out of your thoughts.<br><br>Men like to get &amp; forget.<br>Women like to give &amp; forgive.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey,<br>What does love mean to you?<br>It's based on experiences and it's love when u know it's hard to manage when u don't have it. and it's not love in the general sense, it's love from a specific person. and that's when u know u don't bother about the general idea, you bother that the love comes from the person u love in return.<br><br>So do you love her,  or do you own her?<br><br>That's the main thing, you realise?<br><br>Firstly, in my honest humble opinion, the fact that she admitted to you she had a fling means two things<br><br>1) She betrayed your trust, she feels guilty about it, and she wants to earn it back, and she went about it the best and worse way. Giving you honesty. She could have easily decided quietly to herself that she'd forget it and be completely faithful to you. But she chose to tell you about it. She CHOSE it when she didn't have to. That speaks a lot about her genuine adoration and mutual respect for you.<br><br>2) It also suggests that resisting temptation isn't part of her strong implementations. Sure, she's sorry about it, but it doesn't totally get her off the hook. She could easily meet another charming guy, have a fling, and regret it later. The slate isn't exactly completely cleared.<br><br>When you think of her, recall a few things<br><br>Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed Jesus Christ...he sold Jesus to the crucifix. He regretted it later and committed suicide. Did people really forgive him though he asked for forgiveness and was repentful?<br>Some do some don't<br><br>Ask yourself again, why you loved her in the first place. Never threaten to leave her because of this. If you wish to break up with her or forsake the relationship, remember the old times when complete trust existed, and ask yourslef can you honestly honestly be happy in the future knowing what she did?<br><br>My personal opinion. It's  hard and virtually impossible. There will always be a lingering daunting dread involved here. But if love consumes the disdain, then worry not. She's yours to keep. If it doesn't, then worry not as well. Sell away the past, embrace a future with someone else who you can completely trust.<br><br>That's my advice anyway.<br><br>Yours,<br>Darren<br><br>lerping@hotmail.com</div>
