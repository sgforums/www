              <p>This guy hurt me before with his actions.</p>
              <p>And In retaliation, I hurt him back with words.</p>
              <p>I liked this guy and I knew that he liked me too. He was just afraid, not ready etc. For whatever reasons he have, he suddenly ignored me. After 2 months of flirting etc.</p>
              <p>He started 'disappearing' when my sis confronted his behaviour through sms and he cant accept that. So why be angry at me when I have nothing to do in that msg?</p>
              <p>FIY, we knew each other since we were 11 and we were very good friends at 15. I developed feelings for him during the duration of our closed friendship. And he I think he started having feelings for me when he suspected that I liked him.</p>
              <p>He's the type that likes to change friends, and recycles again. maybe due to his childhood? I am not sure myself why.</p>
              <p>It's been 1 year since I saw him, and as I thought I was letting him go, I saw him sleeping soundly in the bus tonight. I looked at him and alighted the bus. But there seems to be this regret of not confronting him in the bus.</p>
              <p>I am not angry at him, well, not anymore. He just disappointed me and I thought I could let him go easily until I saw him tonight.</p>
              <p>P.S. he's the 1st person that I liked(I think I still like him) and it felt really real. What do I do now? How do I let go?</p>

              <p>a guy who truly likes you and wishes to be your other half for the rest of your life, will NEVER hurt you (or at least try his very best not to hurt you). "Disappearing" isn't an act of love; it's an act of immaturity.</p>
              <p>are you sure you want to spend your precious youth with a guy who needs to grow up and be more mature? don't give up the whole forest just for one rotten tree.</p>

              <p>but he has already moved on, so should u. if u continue to hang on to this, u will juz b wasting ur chances with other better guys around. i guess ur feelings for him mustve blocked u from liking any other yea? u shld try giving up n moving on already. open up more to other ppl n stop closing ur feelings to everyone else.</p>

He won't be there when you need him and I don't think you can trust such a person in the long run?

              <p>Hi huzane,</p>
              <p>As some of the forummers here will have told you, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to forget your first love.</p>
              <p>To have such feelings when you saw him again after a period of time is a very normal reaction, as your heart is still quite confused, and you haven't really got over him yet.</p>
              <p>Some of the forummers have suggested that you get into a relationship with another guy, but I will strongly advise you not to do so if you are not ready for a relationship. Instead, you can try focusing your time and attention on other issues in your life, or your own hobbies and interests. </p>
              <p>As to when you will successfully let go of him, I cannot answer your question, for it varies from individual to individual. The moment when you will truly let go of him, is when you have come to a conclusion, without any doubt left within yourself, that he is not the one for you.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
