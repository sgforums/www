              <p>This guy hurt me before with his actions.</p>
              <p>And In retaliation, I hurt him back with words.</p>
              <p>I liked this guy and I knew that he liked me too. He was just afraid, not ready etc. For whatever reasons he have, he suddenly ignored me. After 2 months of flirting etc.</p>
              <p>He started 'disappearing' when my sis confronted his behaviour through sms and he cant accept that. So why be angry at me when I have nothing to do in that msg?</p>
              <p>FIY, we knew each other since we were 11 and we were very good friends at 15. I developed feelings for him during the duration of our closed friendship. And he I think he started having feelings for me when he suspected that I liked him.</p>
              <p>He's the type that likes to change friends, and recycles again. maybe due to his childhood? I am not sure myself why.</p>
              <p>It's been 1 year since I saw him, and as I thought I was letting him go, I saw him sleeping soundly in the bus tonight. I looked at him and alighted the bus. But there seems to be this regret of not confronting him in the bus.</p>
              <p>I am not angry at him, well, not anymore. He just disappointed me and I thought I could let him go easily until I saw him tonight.</p>
              <p>P.S. he's the 1st person that I liked(I think I still like him) and it felt really real. What do I do now? How do I let go?</p>

              <p>...unfortunately...you dont..and cant...</p>
              <p>Our minds do not function like a computer with a recycle icon, whereby memories of both good or bad times can just be clicked away..</p>
              <p>It resides within our mind...and visions of the past triggered by innocent responses draws them upon the full screen of our mind, replaying scenes and scenes of both the good and bad times...</p>
              <p>You had already made a decision, a choice on your free will, to give up on the relationship with him. It must had been a difficult one, for you still care about him, but not enough that you want to continue on with him. You have your reasons, which you justify and tell yourself it is a right one.</p>
              <p>Thus, you need none of us here to tell you what to do for what you had already made up your mind on. Your question is ....if...it ,.....is ....possible to forget him. The answer is........no.</p>
              <p>But within the decision and reasons where you made to leave him, will be where you will draw strength to resist those memories, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlyYuXjhHhU">by logic and reason</a>....</p>
              <p>.....to put aside those memories when it rises, and think of better things more deserving of you to ponder upon, such as your family, cute and naughty nieces/nephews, friends, schoolmates, subjects, your future career, your hopes and dreams....</p>

              <p>anyways its probably coz its ur first crush thats y it lasts so long, usually first crushes lasts long, moreover u guys knew each other for a long time so its hard to forget.</p>
              <p>but he has already moved on, so should u. if u continue to hang on to this, u will juz b wasting ur chances with other better guys around. i guess ur feelings for him mustve blocked u from liking any other yea? u shld try giving up n moving on already. open up more to other ppl n stop closing ur feelings to everyone else.</p>
