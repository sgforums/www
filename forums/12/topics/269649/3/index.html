Why, at 20 years old, she's playing with men is another story, maybe a tale of extreme hurt lies behind that.<br><br>Your love with your gf is of probably of a different type, e.g. caring, loving, steady.

It hurts my conscious and it goes against my own standing on how a person should behave morally.. I am going haywire myself.. I hate the fact that I handled it so badly, compared to AA.. I got attach emotionally and she does not.. AA is handling our "relationship"; much better than me.."</blockquote>I note all the "I"s. Not once was his gf's feelings referred to. Its all about himself not behaving morally, etc.<br><br><blockquote>"I love my gf and I treat her the best that I can.. I know if I end it with my gf over her, I will nv be the same.. I will be forever guilty, like Judas.. Nevertheless, I admit I am a Basta## to get involve with AA.. The lust makes me sin.."</blockquote>Note that "I"s again. Its about himself feeling guilty,not once did he mention how his gf would be devastated from his betrayal<br><br><blockquote>"hi 798, we were nv serious in this relationship.. AA is handling so much better than me.. Ours was a lust and companionship relationship.. Its just me, being emotionally weak.. I hate it over her relationship with her guy frds.. I get jealous and I do wish she gets attach to me emotionally.. guess its ego being at work too.. Sad"</blockquote>Note no references to his gf again. Its all about him and his ego<br><br><blockquote>"As much as I hate to reveal this, girls also keep a lookout for better guys even when they are happily attached. Cos nobody can be 100% sure that the guy that you're with at the moment is "The One" for you."</blockquote>Now he is beginning to go into self-denial. After betraying his gf, he is now trying to justify his actions by saying that his Gf may also be keeping a lookout for better guys<br><br><blockquote>"Yes, AA may not accept me to be her bf.. In fact, she has someone in mind.. Her perspective of our relationship, is what you had mentioned.. The prob lies with me that gradually, I find myself being emotionally attached to her.. Sucks.. I will not break off with my gf for her.. I cant handle it and I will never be the same me, if I do it.. The "judas act" will haunt me for life.. Morally, I will not bear to too.. I guess I have lose in the game.. Sometimes, I admire her for handling it so much better than me.. I am suppose to be the guy, to be the one to "do it and get over with".. I may be a big-time basta## in some of yours' eyes.. And I apologise for it.. I am sorry..."</blockquote>This is the ONE BIG nail on the head. The fact is, I can summarize his attitude as follows:<br>- He hesitates to break from his gf coz AA may not accept him as her bf<br>- Then he talks about feeling guilty, and not once about his gf's feelings<br>- Its all about his image. He does not want to look like a basta## in this society.<br><br>Basically, remorseful??? I seriously doubt so, given the self-centred postings made.<br><br>One big a**hole? Yes definitely.<br><br></div>

Or rather, you may wish that she would be at least as tearful as you if you end this relationship.<br><br>Your ego is sorely hurt that AA doesn't need you as much as your gf does, or she can discard you like a piece of junk.<br><br>I think the first step to redemption is that you need to start from basics, e.g. build your ego up all over again with a different foundation (on true love perhaps, but not on the fact that you can play with girls better than they can with you), while perhaps accepting that you are not as cool a guy as you might think you are.<br><br>I hope that isn't too harsh for you to read.</div>
