I am 25 yrs, attach with my girlfriend for 2 yrs.. Recently, i got involve with a 20yrs lady.. She is a student.. Lets call her AA.. The lust and excitement got AA and me involve in a relationship.. We meet, hv sex, chat, etc.. She is very open-minded to our "relationship".. Both of us accepted the non-committment aspect of our "relationship".. However, I am the one who is terribly troubled now.. I have gradually become emotionally attach to her.. I do not feel good abt her mentioning her guy frds, the dates she had, etc.. Remember, it was me who does not want emotional attachment in the very beginning, and I am the one falling into it now.. AA is handling our relatinoship much better than me.. I know I will never have the heart to break off with my gf for AA.. Yet, this "feelings of the heart" with AA is making me haywire.. Guess it is indeed true with the advice of, "never get involve with having a mistress".. I thanks you in advance for any serious comments and advices...</div></blockquote>hope you get dump by AA and your gf.</div>
