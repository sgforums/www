Perhaps you reckon your relationship is unfulfilling or that your relationship is too calm for its own good and subconsciously, you 'summon' waves to jazz up your love life.<br><br>You may think that sounded illogical, but people does that sort of things all the time.<br><br>It's because our experience in love is never stagnant. In fact, we face challenges every moment of our life.<br><br>You may think that this woman represents non-committed/somewhat free sexual relationship (AOS will likely attribute her as a Siren), but the truth is that her presence presents a cosmic test, which you failed utterly - judged by the strength of your love towards your girlfriend and the relationship. The flesh may be weak, but surely the flesh is the lowest level of all our higher senses. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If the mind, heart and soul can be easily dominated by our animalistic instinct (Mars), which is the lowest level in our human consciousness 'chain of command', then the path you walk will surely lead to misery and sorrow.</strong></span><br><br>To understand the driving force behind your decision to betray your girlfriend, you got to first understand whether was it a push or a pull factor. The former represents a fissure in the relationship, while employing an avoidance-defensive mechanism in respond to this crack and the latter represents flaccid self principles devoid of wisdom.<br><br>Eventually, you may just decide that your 'mistress' is the woman you are seeking all these while. But as you reach for her heart and find nothing but illusions, it may just dawn on you that you are just become a pawn of own karmic debts.<br><br>I pity your woman, not because you are a man who went astray, but rather, you betrayed her in both levels - physically and emotionally. A woman might be able to source some remote reason/s to salvage a relationship if a man loses one aspect among the two, but certainly not both - because it makes no meaning to retain a man who desire to flee and a man like you supply her no reason to stay.<br><br>Perhaps you might want to rethink your situation; albeit holding onto your girlfriend may be the best of both world for you, but such selfish grasp onto her may end up tearing your guilt wounds wider.<br><br>I can safety say that chances are, you won't be able to convert that Siren to settle for you exclusively. Your contract with her never had that clause and you are probably just like the many other guys she had sexual fling with. Therefore, what makes you think that just because she got into bed with you, it implies that you have power over her?<br><br>P.S: Man are often lost when the tables are turned against them, as they become the prey, completely subdued a woman with voracious sexual appetite. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Who knows you might just be one of those sex-buddies?<br><br>Wow she's sure some horny girl. Some guy in bar asked if girls are just as horny, well this proves it. Girls can have sex with guys they don't even have any romantic feelings for.<br><br>Actually inside you know the answer yourself if she's good relationship material. It's either you cut off ties with her and not enjoy the free sex and continue your relationship with your girl while you keep your mouth shut or you risk losing both girls at the same time.<br><br>doko</div>

Unless, of course, at 20, AA is already smart enough not to get serious with a cheating man. Heathens know their own kinds very well.<br><br>It is actually very simple.<br><br>Since ending the affair with AA doesn't seem like an option because you're already sexually and emotionally attached/stimulated, you can either choose to:<br><br>A) Leave your girlfriend and pursue AA romantically because you won't know until you give it a shot. Fair to your girlfriend, fair to yourself, fair to AA.<br><br>***<br><br>B) Unless it's an unspoken agreement, you can always propose an open relationship with your current girlfriend because in this way, you don't have to feel guilty and you may get the best of both worlds. Sustain the sexual relationship with AA. Sustain emotional relationship with your girlfriend. Fair to yourself, fair to AA, fair to your girlfriend.<br><br>***<br><br>C) Continue with your girlfriend and pursue AA romantically and bed both simultaneously. If AA responds to you romantically, you can then leave your girlfriend and be with AA. If AA rejects your advances, you still have the girlfriend and you revert to shagging AA.<br><br>Life goes back to normal but at least you gave it a shot with AA.<br><br>If AA responds to you romantically, you juggle both women... if you know how to, that is.<br><br>If you don't know how to juggle, 25 is a good age to start learning. If you are too moral to juggle, this game is clearly not for you. Find a good woman and marry, start a family and go to church. Stop whining.<br><br>***<br><br>If I were you, I'd leave the girlfriend. Leave AA. Leave the heavy love problems. Find more women to fornicate with. Really the world is very big out there. Plenty of mouths to kiss. Plenty of p*ssy to lick. Many more women will love you very much later on in your life. Stories like yours is nothing new.<br><br>Since AA is 20 and your girlfriend is at most 25 like yourself, all 3 of you have nothing much to lose. At this age, all 3 of you are still finding out about yourselves.  Time is on your side. Everything is fair play.<br><br>Just keep your options open.<br><br>Practice safe sex.<br><br>Get yourself tested.<br><br>Be damned if you pass anything to your girlfriend. Be damned if you give her herpes. Be damned if you knock any of both up.<br><br>Seriously if your girlfriend catches anything from your dalliances, I say she is f*cking suay. Just her goddamn luck. You guys have your fun. Just don't corrupt her with whatever poison you catch.<br><br>And leave the back door open. No pun intended.<br><br>Bolt when necessary.<br></div>
