            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.. Will appreciate forumers' comments.. I am 25 yrs, attach with my girlfriend for 2 yrs.. Recently, i got involve with a 20yrs lady.. She is a student.. Lets call her AA.. The lust and excitement got AA and me involve in a relationship.. We meet, hv sex, chat, etc.. She is very open-minded to our "relationship".. Both of us accepted the non-committment aspect of our "relationship".. However, I am the one who is terribly troubled now.. I have gradually become emotionally attach to her.. I do not feel good abt her mentioning her guy frds, the dates she had, etc.. Remember, it was me who does not want emotional attachment in the very beginning, and I am the one falling into it now.. AA is handling our relatinoship much better than me.. I know I will never have the heart to break off with my gf for AA.. Yet, this "feelings of the heart" with AA is making me haywire.. Guess it is indeed true with the advice of, "never get involve with having a mistress".. I thanks you in advance for any serious comments and advices...</div>

You would cherish what you have with your gf instead of getting involve with AA.<br><br>When your gf find out you slept with another girl, your relationship will be destroyed.

Ya, I do get dissapointed and disgusted with my handling.. I tot a man should handle this better.. I am just emotionally weak.. I hate myself for handling it so poorly.. Thanks 798..

            <div class='col-md body'>Since u r the one tat post yr problems, we should give advice tat is from yr view point...<br>First thing, u need to clear yr guilt... U have to understand tat there is no right and wrong in this world... U r not the only one in this world tat have such situation... It is just tat this situation are not proud to be declared by others &gt;&lt;<br>What u dont find in yr gf, u find them in AA... Tat is the reason on y u involve with her... But, is tat what u really want ??? U have to think what u really want<br><br>U need to clear yr guilt towards yr gf... Coz, end of the day, u dont be with a girl because of guilt... It will only cause u and the girl to suffer if it is because of guilt. U be with the girl because u love her. U have to think y do u love yr gf???<br><br>And lastly, think for yrself... Dont think for yr gf's feelings or AA's feelings... Make decision for yrself... Coz, ultimately the decision tat u make for yrself, benefit all parties...<br><br>Of coz, if it is TS's gf post her story here, the advice will be different too...<br><br></div>
