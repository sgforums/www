              <p>My dad was diagnosed with diabetes for over 20 years. It should be type 2. Being a diabetic, the only way he could stay fit &amp; healthy is to take the medication and keep up with his doctor appointments.</p>
              <p>Here's the problem. He refused to take medication and will drink sweet drinks like there is no tomorrow. Worse, he's a heavy smoker. And he had been hospitalized 3 times. The last time was last year when he a a cut on his leg and the infection was so bad that there was it turn into a big hole. And the doctor said his sugar level is out of control. He almost got his leg amputated.</p>
              <p>No matter how or what me &amp; my family try to do to persuade him to take his medicines, he just wont listen. Instead he raise his voice at us, just like how he had always been doing to his family all these years.</p>
              <p>After being discharge from hospital, he will start his medication but will stop after few months. He look really sick without the medicines. The most recent discharge, doctor even told him he needs to inject himself with insulin twice daily. That insulin thingy was a sign that his condition has worsen since he dont need that last time.</p>
              <p>I read about how diabetes can actually kill you if you fail to control it. Somehow, diabetes wont kill you instantly but will tortures you for years before it finally take your life. My late grandma (my dad's mum) was a diabetic too and she died from diabetes complications.</p>
              <p>My family have done all we could to help my dad but he wouldnt help himself. Since now he stop his medication again, we expect that he will land himself in hospital again soon. And I dont know how much longer he can last. Not to be rude but its a fact. He is coming 65 yrs this year. No medication, drink sugary stuffs daily and smokes heavily just make it even worse.</p>

The pancreas is related to diabetes, i think it's becos it's the organ responsible for insulin the body needs. Pancreas cancer is a deadly killer, it does not show any symptoms until the very late stage. When my father discovered the cancer, it was already too late. He passed on 2 months after he was diagnosed with the cancer. Pls educate your dad, such things can lead to cancer. Ask him to think of his loved ones and family. take care...</p></div>

              <p>My dad had debetes too. But he passed away last year from pancreas cancer. The pancreas is related to diabetes, i think it's becos it's the organ responsible for insulin the body needs. Pancreas cancer is a deadly killer, it does not show any symptoms until the very late stage. When my father discovered the cancer, it was already too late. He passed on 2 months after he was diagnosed with the cancer. Pls educate your dad, such things can lead to cancer. Ask him to think of his loved ones and family. take care...</p>

              <p><br>My condolescene, please take care yourself, diabetes can be genetic, those whose parents or grandparents had diabetes, you need to care for yourself, prevention is better than cure. Singapore childrens are so spoilt by sugar, the food n drink here are so sweet, full of unnatural sugar. In my country, when youngs, the school teachers and parents already teach us about sugar, we only eat porridge with veges, drink tea only, no canteen, and also we are only allow to go city once a month, and most we do there is buy sugarless bubble tea and papaya milkshake, to keep warm, we take sour prunes, we are famous in that, those night stall foods are for tourist only.</p>
              <p>If you look at the obesity stage of singaporeans and Taiwanese, we can get a shock of your life, 7 out of 10 singaporean are obese comparing to 1 in 10 taiwanese, so when I first landed in singapore, i thot i come to a fat world.</p>

              <p>it depends what hits him first. If lucky some diabetic coma can be fatal, maybe a chronic arrest can kill too. If unlucky (most were), they will most likely lose their limbs and suck on pipes or lose eyes.</p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I recently brough in this product Milagro Tea. (<a href="http://www.milagroasia.com">www.milagroasia.com</a>). RElatives were taking it and I saw the improvements myself. Plus, Dad was diagnosed with diabetes from day one and from day one, he took the tea. As such, he has never taken any meds for his diabetes and he is living a normal life like anyone of us.</p>
              <p>If any one is interested to give it a try, please feel free to drop me an email at <a href="mailto:stanley@trelix.co">stanley@trelix.co</a>.</p>
              <p>As there is a cost attached to the tea, they will be a limited number we can give out.</p>
