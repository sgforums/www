And something true to make you feel better, girls do appreciate simplicity more as they get older, it's a growing phase, so relax and work on your personal life first ba.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>I believe sex is harmful.. in a way.. though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .Accidents can happen..<br><br>Love is chemistry?

You don't need a girlfriend because she will be driven nuts by your expression of feelings. Girls tend to go for more self assured guys , not a whiner.<br><br>You need friends.

            <div class='col-md body'>TS,<br><br>well, i am in ur category ya. I got rejected 4-5 times before? Nv have a girlfriend? But then, i saw this particular girl in my uni who is not stunningly beautiful but just i like the way she is.<br><br>A bit ah soh, but then cheezy. I am working hard to know her better and hope eventually i will have by my side.<br><br>Here are some of the tips that u might find them useful:<br><br>1) Don't rush into a r/s but rather build a friendship first<br>2) Behave the way u normally behave. Don't be a hypocrite<br>3) Find the girl's best friend and befriend her so as to get her support to woo the girl (this is important really)<br>4) May sure u look neat and tidy. (u want a untidy and dirty girl? obvious right)<br>5) Cultivate a habit of making sure ur house is clean (do help ur parent in housework -- will be helpful when u get married)</div>
