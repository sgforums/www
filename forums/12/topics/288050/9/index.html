            <div class='col-md body'>there is always ugly guys and ugly gers. So is poor gers and guys ard in this world. Are they doom to be single for the rest of their life?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Some ppl are just born rich, other handsome and those even betters one, both. Money and personality are thing that we can work on, and even outward appearance change to a certain extend. But those are just some of the factor ppl go for.<br><br>For guys we are a bit luckier then ger, coz gertend to be emotion drivien, hence dun mind dating ugly men or even poor men. That is a fact! I'd dated a rich pretty doctor when i was a freaking poor student, and some of my ger buddy dated some of the world ugliest men that pop up from duno which sewage. To them, those guy always seem sweet and stable. Some even boring like blockhead!!! But yet they love them to death. Well, love work in a mysterious way. U are still young!!!<br><br>On the other hand, guys are more visual simulated.There's only a handful of guy that look beyond the ger's outer beauty. That is why most ger these day are trouble with weight, looked, etc issue. C'mon, most ger wont mind their men having a belly tummy, but almost all guy will mind their ger having one. Talk abt fairness? Not all sg gers are $$ minded. Just dun aim too high and thing will turn out better then u expect. To aim high, u must be high in the 1st place inorder to fire ur shot.</div>
