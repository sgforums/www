This is very gross generalisation.<br><br>My belief is simple. If can't carry yourself well to others, then don't blame it on others. There has to be something wrong yourself. Correct it. Don't expect love to give you happiness or to show off to others you have a girlfriend. You have nothing to prove except to your own ego.<br><br>No doubt, girls being who they are, are attracted to looks or money on the surface initially. We always see girls screaming at handsome guys. Or there are some who will stick to rich guys no matter what. There's something more about girls. If you have just looks or money to depend on, then I think you are really pathetic. I mean, without looks, you will crumble?<br><br>You need to have substance. Inside. Your inside must match your outside. That's all I will say.<br><br>My two cents.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why you keep failing and getting rejected time and time again is due to the simple fact that you refused to find out what went wrong along the way.<br><br>There can be many reasons why girls reject guys for dates.<br><br>Yes. If you are born good looking, you do have an advantage.<br><br>But not every guy is blessed with good looks or born with a silver spoon.<br><br>There could be more guys born below average looking in the population then good looking ones.<br><br>So how? Don't need to date? Don't get married? Think again.<br><br>I have so many friends who fall into this category yet they are happily together with someone they love. Some even got married with kids.<br>The girls are good looking, mind you.<br><br>How is it possible?<br><br>It is because they have the right mentality. They know how to work their strengths and take responsibility in their life - how much they earn, how to have a good lifestyle, how to groom themselves up.<br><br>If you think you don't have the looks, groom up. There're no ugly people, just lazy ones.<br><br>If you think you're not rich, then work hard to earn it.<br><br>You're still young, learn from experiences. Always find out what went wrong when things don't go your way. Not finding convenient excuses and put the blame on others. How can you improve this way? You're just protecting your big ego.<br><br>And in the end, it's going to be a vicious cycle and you'll never get out of it.<br><br></div>

You might be working until 55 and still have not repaid the bank for the house.<br><br>Let see, after poly you are (assuming) 19. After uni 21. After ns 23. After UK, say 24 or 25. That leaves you 30 years to work because you want to retire at 55. So assuming the property costs you 1million la, though 1 million is pretty peanuts nowadays, you have to save at least $2777 per month.

I respect you for that.<br><br>Now, why not let that be your long term goal. Let your short term goal to be to get over your self-esteem issues and to develop a more outgoing personality, and before you know it, you will be expanding your social circle, and hopefully your special one comes along.<br><br>Oh and don't make friends with gals simply just because you want to have a gf and view your friends as 'potentials'.
