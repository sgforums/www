            <div class='col-md body'>I have done some superficial research into the major religions of the world, and I'd like to share my views here.<br><br>WHY?<br>It is clear that from ancient times, Man has always tended to believe in the supernatural as an attempt to explain occurrences that they could not comprehend. Early on, before the great religions of modern times like Islam, Christianity and Buddhism, people would create their own Gods. Frequently they were made out of pieces of wood or stone. Thunder and lightning which frightened many were attributed to various thunder and lightning gods. As society evolved, these primitive religions lost their acceptance as people began to question the logic behind them. It was explained how rain fell and thunder was made scientifically, and with that came the end of the reign of the gods of lightning. A major reason for the prevalence of today's religions is that people have yet to explain away the claims made by them. The downfall of the gods of lightning was simply because people who once attributed them to the lightning gods realized that they were wrong. The survival of Christianity and Islam is based on the claim that the world was made by a God/Allah. Up till today, there has yet to be anyone who can convincingly disprove this. As for Buddhism, it does not attempt to explain the creation of the world, instead expounding something else instead---a way of life.<br><br>ANALYSIS<br>Suffice to say that, Islam and Christianity are 2 sides of the same coin. They have similar themes, that of a central God/Allah who is all-encompassing. They also have a holy book as the earthly reference of the teachings of their creator, the Quran/Bible.<br>Buddhism instead offer a route to people to follow Buddha's path to enlightenment and happiness--they do not answer questions on Creation, and they have no answer on it in any case.<br><br>LOGIC<br>Islam/Christianity require faith to believe in them. You have to have faith to take that first step. From a logical viewpoint, they do not hold out convincingly---just take a look the killings and massacres of today's world---with a benevolent God, this should not happen. Since it is happening, either 1)the God in question isn't benevolent or 2)the God in question isn't all-powerful. That is after assuming the existence of such a God in the first place.<br><br>CREATION VS EVOLUTION and about FAITH<br>Clearly, the likelihood of spontaneous evolution as put forward by scientists is based on the probability that everything turned out right, and that probability is so small it could be termed negligible. So, we are left with the only remaining postulation---creation. This is completely unacceptable to some, which is why they go back to evolution. My stand here is: I don't even try to understand it. It is beyond my ability.<br>Many religions mention faith, and most people would agree that faith is a cornerstone of religions. However, to believe in evolution requires perhaps even more faith. Mathematically, there is next-to-nothing chance of evolution ending up in a world like ours. It would actually be more plausible to have a creator.<br>Simply speaking, between evolution and creation, I'd take creation any day. However, between creation, evolution, and leaving the answer blank, I'd leave the answer blank!<br><br>CONCLUSION<br>I end with this: Logic cannot be used to explain our existence. It would be better to ignore it...</div>

Some of the postings are quite good.<br><br>The message board is currently bombarded with threads relating to the WTC tragedy and the "fight against terrorism" war though.
