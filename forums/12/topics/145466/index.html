            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Roxy_Gurl,<br><br>I presume you're saying this to someone in SGForums?  I sympathise with you for having to go through heartbreak, but please maintain some dignity.  The guy you're posting about has Not replied to you.  I hope he's at least PM'd you.<br><br>Perhaps it's just me, but I won't let anyone else see I'm hurting, &amp; I don't like playing the victim, nor being a victim.  I don't need anyone's sympathy, &amp; in being strong, I sometimes get admiration for the inner strength I've learnt to summon in times of need.<br><br>It's only when a guy seeks to present himself as a wronged/maligned party &amp; portrays ME as the heartless 1 will I speak out.<br><br>Similarly for you, don't degrade yourself by grovelling, what is the purpose of it all?  Will it win the guy's respect for you?  Unlikely.  Will you respect yourself for doing this?  Unlikely.  Do you really need sympathy from strangers?  Unlikely.  What you need, is to be strong.<br><br>Cry, scream, shout, break things all you want.  But after moping, start your life afresh.  Do something symbolic of that by getting a new hairstyle, new makeup or have a totally new image complete with wardrobe.  Get your own confidence back, &amp; that's when a guy will be attracted to you.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Roxy_Gurl:</div><div class="quote_body">I know what i wanted already.
