Sometimes to curb acne problems, the specialist will give AHA treatment. But then it depends on the condition the skin is in. AHA-treated skin cannot be exposed to the sun too much. Each time you visit the specialist and get medicine, it's about $200.<br><br>I had a friend who went for another kind of treatment. I'm not sure how it's really like, but he took pills that cost him $6 each. Now his face is totally clear and it's a major improvement from last year. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Visiting the National Skin Centre for antibiotics and cream may not be a good idea. There's this antibiotics which I find that they commonly give out. It's called doxycycline, green capsule. Taking the antibiotics will cause nausea for some. And I'm not sure if this is correct, but using pimple cream to dry up pimples will actually cause scars to form.</div>

But the antibiotics caused me nausea and it was very difficult to carry on with lessons in the morning. And I found that while the acne problem was controlled during the course of taking the medicine, it came back again after I stopped.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>depends on ur skin type (oily, normal or combination) and use a suitable facial cleanser (Cetaphil oily skin cleanser recommended for such skin type) and use some topical antibiotic gel to apply over affected areas.  U mentioned T-zone and i suppose such break outs is due to over production of sebum in this area and use some pore unclogging wash can also help to reduce the build up of oil and thus reduce chances of out breaks.....if problem persists, consult a dermatologist at the National Skin Centre. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
