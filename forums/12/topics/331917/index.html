            <div class='col-md body'><p>breathe deeply during those situations. and before meeting or when u start feeling nervous. try talking to yourself. as in not out loud but maybe jus for yrself to hear. say whatever u're feeling, how nervous and all that shit. it works for me when im nervous. if it gets really bad, consult professional counselling? good luck :D</p></div>

              <p>what kind of situations make you nervous? meeting new people?</p>
              <p>Like what ghast had said, close your eyes and try to breathe deeply and empty your mind of all thoughts whenever you're feeling nervous. Drinking some water will help to calm you down too.</p>
              <p>Try to seek professional help if it's real bad.</p>

              <p>You should pay a visit to your nearest GP for immediate consultation.</p>
              <p>You might need to take some anti-anxiety medication for a while.</p>
              <p>If it's not a psychology problem, then it's probably caused by some damage in your brain.</p>

              <p>your anxiety problem might take some time to overcome, if u force yourself maybe it might get worst.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how about considering looking for a job that dont require u to face customer directly? u can look for job that talk to customer over the phone instead. job like helpdesk, customer service over the phone might be suitable for u.</p>
