You already said that your friend is NOT a lesbian and its a weird reason to break up - have you ever realise that you trying to get close to her is a weird reason as well? In his mentality, there is no smoke without fire.<br><br>There are two reasons why a break-up was initiated:<br><br>I) Helpless and ruin ego - a competition between among man could be easy plotted and win. To share his girl with another girl... and changes other variables affects the man's ego, rational and decision making skills. He would rather give it up for he doesn't know how to handle them.<br><br>II) He probably wanted to leave the relationship; this is an excuse used to shake her off.<br><br>You have to do the explanation to him privately.

Things just need clearing up, no need for abstinence, nor avoidance..</div>

I'm quite a good friend with this girl, who has this boyfriend, whom I know too. well, I kind of like this girl (I'm a girl too by the way), but all I wanted was just FRIENDSHIP. I just want to be her friend, &amp; she knows it too. You can call me a lesbian or whatever, but I seriously am NOT attracted to her cos of any physical reasons. I'm just attracted to her personality. Anyway, they broke up, &amp; the boyfriend told her, it's cos of ME. He thinks we're having a relationship, but we aren't!!! I can't explain personally to him, cos it would only make the situation worse. She tried explaning to him already, but he said she is denying. Sigh, what a weird reason for a couple to break-up, cos of a girl who is involved with the girlfriend. But my friend is DEFINITELY NOT a lesbian, shouldn't he know best? I don't get it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Her boyfriend doesn't love her anymore and is using you as the excuse/reason to break up with her.<br><br>This entire matter has nothing to do with you, so you do not have to feel bad about it.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>motdedog</strong>, I know it's not a good idea, I don't like that idea too, cos I really cherish this friendship, I don't want her to be someone who just walks in &amp; out of my life JUST LIKE THAT. Not worth it. Moreover I've put in alot of effort into this friendship. She treasures this friendship too.  =)  I'm glad. But still, I shall stay low, try not to get into them anymore, cos it seems like they've patched up, phew. I'm really afraid of stirring things again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>parn</strong>, I don't know if he loves her still, it seems like he still does. Just kind of give up hope on her, which I don't understand why. Sigh. If he's really using me as a break-up reason, ha, how bad of him. But I don't think so still. He is really affected about us getting "too close" I guess. I really don't know where he gets this "too close" idea from. Anyway, they've patched up, hopefully things go well for them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
