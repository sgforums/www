              <p>The best thing you can do after the maelstrom of angst, rage and
                                      regret has passed is to look at the reasons why the relationship
                                      was on the path to doom in the first place. Examine the good and
                                      bad aspects and time-out to reflect on the real reasons why you
                                      hung on for so long in the first place. This the perfect time to
                                      stock up on self-knowledge. Why were you too weak to be the first
                                      to realize it was headed nowhere? What made you forgive him over
                                      and over again?<br> <br> SALVAGE OR LEAVE BEHIND?<br> <br> Before you attempt to move on you'll have to sort through what's
                                      left and decide what to salvage and what to leave behind. There's
                                      no running away from what went wrong, and delaying the process of
                                      dealing with it will only leave you with a similar situation in
                                      future relationships. You should never attempt to rebuild your life
                                      without identifying what went wrong, what your part in it was and
                                      how you'd like things to be different in future.<br> <br> MOVE ON<br> <br> When the relationship is over, you should be aiming for closure.
                                      This is one thing that can't come fast enough. Closure is a deeply
                                      personal experience that tells you that you've reconciled with all
                                      things past, and is ready to talk about your experiences and
                                      welcome new possibilities into your life.<br> <br> You would have moved past the tumultuous emotional state and
                                      arrived at the point where you fully comprehend who you are as a
                                      single person. Don't mix this up with getting involved with another
                                      person or abusing your freedom and physically indulging
                                      yourself.<br> <br> YOUR FRIENDS<br> <br> It's important to surround yourself with people you can trust and
                                      seek comfort in. When a relationship is over, these supportive
                                      individuals will probably have seen it coming and will most likely
                                      react with relief and empathy. Some more distant friends might
                                      react with surprise and dismay, and their outpouring of sympathy
                                      might throw you off. If seeing some of them elicits negative
                                      emotions, avoid them or be direct and tell them exactly what you
                                      need at this trying time. Don't let their expectations of you or
                                      the relationship get you down even more.<br> <br> HIS FRIENDS<br> <br> In the wake of break-up, you might find yourself losing friends who
                                      happen to be sitting on his of the fence. This might be a rather
                                      painful experience for you, but in the long run not having
                                      individuals who remind you if the past will be a relief. It will
                                      let you to choose exactly who you wish to invest your time in and
                                      build a comfortable social circle that lets you be exactly who you
                                      want to be. Lose those individuals who don't contribute to your
                                      life in a positive way.<br> <br> FULL STEAM AHEAD<br> <br> A painful break-up can sometimes change the way you feel about a
                                      number of important life issues. Get a grip, you are still same
                                      person you were before, and this pivotal time might force you to
                                      reassess yourself personally. There will be some stumbling blocks
                                      along the way, but once you get past them, it'll be full steam
                                      ahead.<br> If you've really processed and accepted the past, you'll find that
                                      you're raring to jump headlong into your new life with a vigor and
                                      enthusiasm you never could have imagined before.<br> <br> FIVE TIPS TO TOTAL RECOVERY<br> <br> 1. Rant &amp; Rave<br> Allow yourself the chance to wallow and indulge in regret and
                                      unhappiness for a bit. Cry your eyes out if you need to, and don't
                                      be sorry if you want to call your best friend for the umpteenth
                                      time just to reminisce and talk about the relationship. Letting out
                                      your emotions will prevent them from festering and manifesting in
                                      other areas of your life. But remember you'll have to stop and come
                                      back to reality eventually.<br> <br> 2. Indulge Yourself<br> Now that you have all this time for yourself, take on some of the
                                      things you've been dying to try or that you've pit on hold because
                                      he couldnÂ’t be a part of it. Take up that diving course, enrol for
                                      a language class or take the long awaited backpacking trip with
                                      your friends<br> <br> 3. Avoid The Rebound Trap<br> If there's someone who attracts your fancy before you can even wipe
                                      that last teardrop, watch out for the classic rebound scenario.
                                      Avoid thinking of the new man in your life as a godsend cure from
                                      heaven, you'd just be setting yourself up for a long fall if things
                                      don't work out. The Best thing to do is take things slow, don't
                                      throw yourself too quickly at your new object of love. Make sure
                                      you're over your ex completely before anything further
                                      develops.<br> <br> 4. Cut him loose<br> Tell yourself over and over again that it's over for good. If he
                                      keeps calling to ask for one more chance, or if he just wants to
                                      stay friends even though he's seeing other people, don't fall for
                                      it. The urge to forget all things bad and cling on to whatever you
                                      can hit even the most pragmatic of women. Steer clear, cut him
                                      loose and celebrate your newfound singlehood.<br> <br> 4. Don't Engage In Promiscuity<br> Many might find the new freedom disconcerting and unnatural,
                                      especially if you've been attached for ages. You might find
                                      yourself running scared of commitment and intimacy, and seek
                                      comfort in pulling out all the brakes and indulging yourself with
                                      any guy that comes along.<br> After all the changes that you've been through, the last thing
                                      you'd want to do is dive unknown into sexual encounters. The
                                      thought of free-for-all fun might seem exciting to a hurt and
                                      wounded heart. Trust your better judgement and don't run the risk
                                      of becoming imprisoned in your failure to get over your ex.</p>
