            <div class='col-md body'>Got this from an email, long but touching story......<br><br>I have a boyfriend who grew up with me.<br>His name is Jin.<br><br>I always thought of him as a friend until last year, when we went to a trip from a club. I found that I fell in love with him.<br><br>Before that trip was over, I took a step and confessed my love for him.<br><br>And soon, we became a pair of lovers, but we loved each other in different ways.<br><br>I always concentrated on him only, but by his side, there were so many other girls.<br><br>To me, he was the only one, but to him, maybe I was just another girl<br><br>Jin, do you want to go watch a movie? I asked.<br><br>Jin: "I can't"<br><br>Why? You need to study at home?I felt disappointment grabbing me.<br><br>No I am going to meet a friend<br><br>He was always like that.<br><br>He met girls in front of me, like it was nothing.<br><br>To him, I was just a girlfriend.<br><br>The word "love" only came out from my mouth.<br><br>Since I knew him, I had never heard him say "I love you" before.<br><br>To us, there weren't any anniversaries at all.<br><br>He didn't say anything from the first day and it continued<br><br>till 100 days, 200days<br><br>Everyday, before we say goodbye, he would just hand me a<br><br>doll, everyday, without fail. I don't know why<br><br>Then one day...<br><br>Me: Um, Jin, I...<br><br>Jin: What?don't drag, just say..<br><br>Me: I love you.<br><br>Jin: you...um, just take this doll and go home.<br><br>That was how he ignored my three words and handed me the doll.<br><br>Then he disappeared, like he was running away.<br><br>The dolls I received from him everyday, filled my room, one by one. There were many...<br><br>Then one day came, my 15th year old birthday.<br><br>When I got up in the morning, I pictured a party with him,<br><br>and stranded myself in my room, waiting for his call.<br><br>But ...lunch passed, dinner passed...and soon the sky was dark he still didn't call.<br><br>It was already tiring to look at the phone anymore.<br><br>Then around 2am in the morning, he suddenly called me and woke me from my sleep. He told me to come out of the house.<br><br>Still, I felt joy and I ran out happily.<br><br>Me: Jin...<br><br>Jin: Here...take this...<br><br>Again, he handed me a little doll.<br><br>Me: What's this?<br><br>Jin: I didn't give it to you yesterday, so I am giving it to you now. I'm going home now, bye.<br><br>Me: Wait, wait! Do you know what today is?<br><br>Jin: Today? Huh?<br><br>I felt so sad, I thought he would remember my birthday.<br><br>He turned around and walked away like nothing had happen.<br><br>Then I shouted..."Wait..."<br><br>Jin: You have something to say?<br><br>Me: Tell me, tell me you love me...<br><br>Jin: What?!<br><br>Me: Tell me<br><br>I put my pathetic self behind and clung on to him.<br><br>But he just said simple cold words and left.<br><br>"I don't want to say that I love someone so easily, if you are desperate to hear it, then find someone else."<br><br>That was what he said. Then he ran off.<br><br>My legs felt numb...and I collapsed to the ground. He<br><br>didn't want to say it easily...<br><br>How could he!.<br><br>I felt that... Maybe he is not the right guy for me...<br><br>After that day, I stranded myself at home crying, just crying.<br><br>He didn't call me, although I was waiting.<br><br>He just continued handing me a little doll every morning outside my house.<br><br>That's how those dolls piled up in my room... everyday<br><br>After a month, I got myself together and went to school.<br><br>But what made the pain resurface was that... I saw him on a street...with another girl...<br><br>He had a smile on his face, one that he never showed me...as he touched the doll...<br><br>I ran straight back home and looked at the dolls in my room, and tears fell...<br><br>Why did he gave these to me??<br><br>Those dolls are probably picked out by some other girls<br><br>In a fit of anger, I threw the dolls around.<br><br>Then suddenly, the phone rang. It was him.<br><br>He told me to come out to the bus stop outside my house.<br><br>I tried to calm myself down and walked to the bus stop.<br><br>I kept reminding myself that I am going to forget him, that it's going to end.<br><br>Then he came into my sight, holding a big doll.<br><br>Jin: Jo, I thought you were pissed, you really came?<br><br>I couldn't help hating him, acting like nothing had happen and joking around.<br><br>Soon, he held out the doll as usual<br><br>Me: I don't need it.<br><br>Jin: What?.why?<br><br>I grabbed the doll from his hands and threw it on the road.<br><br>Me: I don't need this doll, I don't need it anymore!! I don't want to see a person like you again!<br><br>I spitted out all the words that were inside me. But unlike other days, his eyes very shaking.<br><br>"I'm sorry..." He apologized in a tiny voice.<br><br>He then walked over to the road to pick up the doll...<br><br>Me: You stupid! Why are you picking up the doll?! Just throw it away!!!<br><br>But he ignored me and just went to pick the doll.<br><br>Then...<br><br>Honk~ Honk~<br><br>With a loud honk, a big truck was heading towards him.<br><br>"Jin! Move! Move away!" I shouted....<br><br>But he didn't hear me, he squatted down and picked up the doll.<br><br>"Jin, move!"<br><br>HONK~!!<br><br>*Boom!* That sound, so terrifying.<br><br>That's how he went away from me.<br><br>That's how he went away without even opening his eyes to say one word to me.<br><br>After that day, I had to go through everyday with guiltiness and the sadness of losing him<br><br>And after spending two months like a crazy person<br><br>I took out the dolls.<br><br>Those were the only gifts he left me since the day we started going out.<br><br>I remembered the days I spent with him and started to count the days- when we were in love..<br><br>"One...two... three..."<br><br>That was how I started to count the dolls...<br><br>"Four hundred and eighty four... four hundred and eighty five..."<br><br>It all ended with 485 dolls.<br><br>I then started to cry again, with a doll in my arms.<br><br>I hugged it tightly, then suddenly...<br><br>"I love you~, I love you~"<br><br>I dropped the dolls,shocked.<br><br>"I...lo..ve..you??"<br><br>I picked up the dolls and pressed its stomach.<br><br>"I love you~ I love you~"<br><br>It can"t be!<br><br>I pressed all the dolls' stomach as it piled on the side.<br><br>"I love you~"<br><br>"I love you~"<br><br>"I love you~"<br><br>Those words came out non-stop.<br><br>"I love you~"<br><br>Why didn't I realize that???.<br><br>That his heart was always by my side, protecting me.<br><br>Why didn't I realize that he love me this much...<br><br>I took out the doll under the bed and pressed it's stomach,<br><br>that was the last doll, the one that fell on the road.<br><br>It had his blood stain on it.<br><br>The voice came out, the on that I was missing so much....<br><br>"Jo...Do you know what today is? We've been loving each other for 486 days. Do you know what 486 is?<br><br>I couldn't say I love you..... Um... since I was too shy. If you forgive me and take this doll, I will say that I love you..<br><br>everyday...till I die.. Jo... I love you!"<br><br>The tears came flowing out of me. Why? Why? I asked<br><br>god, why do I only know about all this now?<br><br>He can't be by my side, but he loved me until his last minute<br><br>For that.. and for that reason... to me..... it became courage... to live a beautiful life...<br><br>So go on tell someone dear to u tat u love them........</div>
