Around week 6, we got close because it was term test then we would study. Then we met this girl called K. I told him that I liked her. Then he told me he liked another girl called P.<br><br>Then when K broke up with her boyfriend, I very happy so I told Z. Then after the term test, I slowly talk to K trying to get closer. After sometime, I somehow felt she is not the right one for me so I give up but still got contact abit. This was somewhere in week 8<br><br>Then somewhere in week 9, K say she got boyfriend, So i guess who la.. after 2 days I found out it was Z then I was laughing and said to him.. "waa so fast.. you sibei zai leh"<br><br>Then week 10 when school reopen, both K and Z gave me cold shoulders, Don't know for what reason. I didn't think much of him cause both of them trying to avoid friends as well. Maybe to avoid gossip or what la.<br><br>Then I started to notice that Z never talk to me and ignore me. But i don't want lose a friend so I also never do much. Then today my class went for lesson, I saw K and Z in the lab and wanted to exit. Z pressed the exit and opened the door but I hold it so that it will auto lock again to play with him..<br><br>Then I let go, Suddenly his face turned red and angry and from the other side keep shouting at me to let go even though I already showed him my hands. The reason why the door never open because he have to press exit again but he didn't.<br><br>Fcuk, Then after that he came out and point at me say "we got class la play play play" then give me the buay song blink.<br><br>knn la cb..<br><br>whats with this fcuker? i never do anything then he treat me like 10 years enemy. technically speaking, i should be the one pissed off with him for stealing friend's crush or what even though i don't like her but he didn't know.</div></blockquote>1) Can I ask the others here if someone got a crush on someone but he did not do any action does he have the rite to complain so much if someone else got the guts to do it ?<br><br>"After sometime, I somehow felt she is not the right one for me so I give up but still got contact abit.
