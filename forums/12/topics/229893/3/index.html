Will do the same!  Ya, so tired about the guessing game or "ai mei" games.  Guys, is it very fun to play such games with gals?  Many gals including myself don't like such games.  Gals prefer guys to be sincere and make the move.  Playing games many times will lead to nothing!</div>

Gal and Guy continues dating etc.. Bingo!<br>Outcome 2: Gal not sure but willing to know guy better.. Continues to date and give guy chance.. Bingo!<br>Outcome 3: Gal not interested to know guy better...Guy should just give up hope and move on or alternatively can still continue to show his interest (but please dun suffocate her..confirm will make her avoid you at all cost) and eventually give up when next target comes along..
