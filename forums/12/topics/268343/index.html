However, as time goes by, candy bend herself a little to accepet who he is but still things wont really solved...<br><br>over this 3 yrs..they had numerous arguements over his same old habit... several times she burst out crying and stuff like tat.....of ccourse, back then (thats like roughly 1 yr back) i did suggest her to end her pain..but she didnt want..and the whole matter blew up even worse...Her bf knows i dont have a gd impression of him..and i guess he must have spoken ill of me as well...she had since stopped talking about their problems to me...<br><br>and all along i thought they were doing great n tat he was improving himself...little did i know tat his same old habit did not turn to the better but worse and candy suffered more...<br><br>tell me tell me... i seriously dont understand her actions... why stick with someone whom u feel tat isnt a suitable life partner? why continue holding on when u feel tat the ending is near???<br><br>I really reallly haiz..... u know as a friends..seeing her like tat really break my heart?<br><br>Ok i did try to talk to her.. but ever since tat incident where by the matter blew up..she doesnt speak much abt it until some time back when candy cant take it anymore about his bf..<br><br>i tried to find reasons for her actions... somehow felt she fear loneliness and nd someone.. tats my own view.. whenever i try to get more information on why she holding on and stuff like that..she diverts from the qtns and always change topics.. Perhaps she isnt comfortable talking to me about their problems again..or she knows wat im going to say..or she just dont wat to hear wat others want to say.. i dont know.. haiz.<br><br>i reallay dont know wat i can do..</div>

In order words, AA is simply just a mountain for people to shout out their unhappiness and the mountain will produce echo to them... Then, those people will feel shiok... that's all  &gt;&lt;<br><br>We cant really judge what is good and what is bad since we always hear one sided story... But we can fire questions to let him or her think, directing possible directions in areas that he or she cant see due to depression, giving him or her spiritual support and blah blah...<br><br>I can understand that friend is more important and it is a pain to see yr friend suffer... But it is not up to u to make her the happiest... It is up to her bf to make her the happiest gal... Even if she break the current bf, can u guarantee tat she can find a better bf ??? There are many possible solutions to a problem... And obviously, breaking is not a solution tat she wants... And since tat is not her solution and she has no other solution, she can only run away from the problem...<br><br></div>
