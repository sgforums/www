Anyway..i just need a space to talk to...<br><br>Ive a dear friend who has problems...but all i can do is just watch n keep my mouth shut...<br><br>Candy has a bf of 3 yrs .. theres many things tat candy doesnt approve about her bf.. many times promises were broken by him whoe once swore to correct his behaviours... However, as time goes by, candy bend herself a little to accepet who he is but still things wont really solved...<br><br>over this 3 yrs..they had numerous arguements over his same old habit... several times she burst out crying and stuff like tat.....of ccourse, back then (thats like roughly 1 yr back) i did suggest her to end her pain..but she didnt want..and the whole matter blew up even worse...Her bf knows i dont have a gd impression of him..and i guess he must have spoken ill of me as well...she had since stopped talking about their problems to me...<br><br>and all along i thought they were doing great n tat he was improving himself...little did i know tat his same old habit did not turn to the better but worse and candy suffered more...<br><br>tell me tell me... i seriously dont understand her actions... why stick with someone whom u feel tat isnt a suitable life partner? why continue holding on when u feel tat the ending is near???<br><br>I really reallly haiz..... u know as a friends..seeing her like tat really break my heart?<br><br>Ok i did try to talk to her.. but ever since tat incident where by the matter blew up..she doesnt speak much abt it until some time back when candy cant take it anymore about his bf..<br><br>i tried to find reasons for her actions... somehow felt she fear loneliness and nd someone.. tats my own view.. whenever i try to get more information on why she holding on and stuff like that..she diverts from the qtns and always change topics.. Perhaps she isnt comfortable talking to me about their problems again..or she knows wat im going to say..or she just dont wat to hear wat others want to say.. i dont know.. haiz.<br><br>i reallay dont know wat i can do..</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> That's her own life to steer and her own struggle to overcome - everything derive from the choice she has made.
