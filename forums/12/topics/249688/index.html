J also often talks to me first during that time i was still yet to develop feelings on J yet........<br><br>then a week later, we were allocated to our respective group as me and A continued to be trained together while J gets another training...... although we were separated, we are still considered close to one another but as time goes by, J seems to be starting to be further apart from me and A.....<br><br>And from that time we have observed that there is little communications between the 2 groups in the dept.....<br><br>as times goes by, our friendships are further apart..... she prefers to talk with her group members rather than us...... and since a few weeks ago when i saw her on the way to work on several occasions, i did smile to her and she did smile to me back when she saw me but we walks on our own although i tries to talk somethings to her........ during that time i can understand that she is not interested in me but maybe i can do something to foster our friendship?<br><br>and when i smsed her my msn address, until now she is still yet to add me..... although she might be seldom online but dun tell me she didn't logged in to msn for 3 weeks?<br><br>now she seems to be more quiet compared to when we first met...... not only me who kenna this treatment but A also kenna that......<br><br>although we still have lunch together but when me and A tries to open a topic to chat with her she was like don't want to talk like that, mostly giving short and simple replies......<br><br>here comes K, from what i understood K (same group as J) might have special feelings towards J but it might be J who appoarching K first as K is a shy and quiet guy...... maybe their group members knows that K might be interested in J and maybe vice versa, they tried to pair them up together by organising activities like karaoke etc<br><br>actually a few weeks ago i can see that J and K becomes friends very fast but now things are getting more and more...... just 2 days ago, they hv a group karaoke session and after the session they asked K, who hv a car n lives near to J, to send her back home<br><br>and i hv noticed that recently, J seems to be waiting for K to go back together and vice versa and when i checked their time card, they left the workplace on the same minutes and that means they left together..... and now the relationship between J and K seems to be developing very fast..... although i want to foster a closer friendship with J but J doesn't even seems to be friends with me and A so.........<br><br>because of the presense of K and most importantly, the fact that J doesn't even wants to be friends with you, just colleagues only, makes me down during the past few weeks or so.....</div>
