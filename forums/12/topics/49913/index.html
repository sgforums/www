A love relationship is not really just about those techniques and rules which make them last.... It's just what the both of you do which makes it MEANINGFUL.... Personally, I find that with a relationship which runs on and on but without much meaning probably defy its purpose too...? Take for example...<br><br>2 people living apart in 2 distant countries... A married couple which keeps an open mind about it... Both very busy with their own life... They don't fly over to visit each other... Not even phone calls or e-mails... Nothing... Perhaps just an e-mail every few months...? They acknowledge the existence of the relationship, and the relationship went on for decades... Some time after the man died... The wife didn't even cry.... Well... That's a relationship for decades...?<br><br>MEANING... Something which you CREATE... If you don't have to be around to CREATE it.... Then you're probably REDUNDANT in the picture....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Having a relationship is just the start...both sides have to work at it....and i mean BOTH sides....its a struggle to keep a relationship interesting...but the rewards are great. On some days, the newspapers contain articles abt this or that couple can be together for umpteen years and find their relationship still going strong (more likely in the New Paper). U just got to keep working at it..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
