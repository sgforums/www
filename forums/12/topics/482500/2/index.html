              <p>Stupid yoyo, if you don't know how the legal system can be used, please stop misleading the naive OP so you can have a lauch. You are covering for your own hatefulness of men and world in general, ask Buddha if he's pleased.</p>
              <p>Plus you judgement of others is a very good picture of who you are. If you had difficulties in finding a guy to hang on, don't jump into conclusions of the same for others. Your stupidity can only be matched by your own arrogance which you sell to the naive people who ask for advice.</p>

              <p>Of course she will do what shw did. Its part of the grieving process.  </p>
              <p>Her first reaction will be denial, then anger, bargaining, depression then finally acceptance. </p>
              <p>The 5 stages of emotional grief and loss, so don't expect that girl to say thank you and be your friend.</p>
              <p>At least she has been warned and will take steps to observe and protect herself.</p>

              <p>That guy has a lot to lose.. given his fear of exposing his
              stupidity to the rest of the world. Want to play with fire.. he'll

              filthy gut.</p>
              <p>Have I seen a man's career destroyed by his sexual affairs. Yes.
              Many.</p>
              <p>This man has a reputation to protect. He screws with his younger
              subordinate,  while cheating on his girlfriend , thats a big
              no no in work and personal ethics..And he is scared people will
              find out. Three strikes and his character is dirtier than a soiled
              diaper. </p>
              <p>Don't shit where you eat. </p>
              <p>And for your information only, I am happily married and a mom.
              So I bet your mom probably did some really nasty crap to you while
              you are growing up , for you to treat women as some objects to be
              used. </p>
              <p>Did your mom tell you all women are evil except herself ? No one
              can love you more than mommy? Yah, its a conspiracy.  some
              mothers do that.</p>
              <p>Ohh wait.. are you from that culture where your mommy picks your
              wife and decides who you have babies with ? If you disobey, you get
              disowned and cut off from the family inheritance ?? If yes.. yah..
              I see why you thinks and behave like a dick head</p>

              <p>Your mom may be your guardian angel but she is just another woman to anyone else. And she will be judged as a woman. When you diss on females, you cast a very negative light on your own mother, who gave birth to you and raised you. Unless you came out your dad's ass.. well that probably explain why you hated women so much and your shit filled brain. </p>
