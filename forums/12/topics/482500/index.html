              <p>I am dating an older guy. He has been real sweet to me and all before we gotten together. He used to text me day and night, always being there for me, teasing and giving me pet names and sharing his past with me. But after we gotten together, he stop putting in efforts. I am always the one who is getting him breakfast, buying him gifts whenever I see something cute. He never plans for our dates, I am usually the one who give ideas on what I want to do (catch a movie, walk along the beach etc etc).</p>
              <p>Things started to get more weird. Nothing makes sense. He told me no one at his workplace can ever find out about us because his dad would break us up as I used to work with him. I let things slide.</p>
              <p>As months passed, he started to cancel on me whenever we have plans to head out. He told me he has last minute meetings, OT and that he has to run errands for his family. We hardly meet since he was always busy with work and also because he has to go overseas for events and exhibitions. All I wanted was to spend some time with him. I admit I was unreasonable at times, I got cold and upset whenever he cancelled on me because I just wanted to spend some time with him. In a month, sometimes I only get to spend a week with him. I always let things slide instead of voicing out my opinions (how can you not know that you will have meetings the day before when you are the manager? how can you not know that you have errands to run the day before?)</p>
              <p>I didnt dare to make plans with my friends or for myself because I never know when he has the time for me and I just wanted to spend as much time as I can with him. Even though i love to dance, and voiced out about wanting to join dance again (latin), he told me that he doesnt like that any other guy except him to touch me. So I gave up the idea on dance.</p>
              <p>He commented a couple of times that he doesnt like the way I dress. And I went to change my entire wardrobe.</p>
              <p>We fought frequently because I felt that he wasnt putting in much efforts in our relationship and also that he hardly spend any time with me. So I actually went to sign up for the gym to distract myself because I didnt want to fight with him.</p>
              <p>Am I over reacting? Because I am in so much pain.</p>

              <p>Hello. You sound like a guy who wishes the girl to take lead in the rs. And I understand where you are coming from since you are a guy. (Guy tend to take the side of the guy right?)</p>
              <p>1. I have been the one who always put in the effort in the rs that I feel like this is a one sided rs. Why? I was the one who confessed to him and he said he was afraid that he will lose me (if I didnt like him) if he confessed to me. He used to send me pictures of cute animals and such, tell me about his past and send me photos of himself when he was younger, now he just stopped. PS And, I will do up handmade gifts that take me weeks to do because he wants to celebrate every monthsary. He just dont.</p>
              <p>2. I am always the one who plan dates. Day 1 till now. ALWAYS. I am the who suggest what movies to watch, what to do, where to go.</p>
              <p>3. Goodness me, I am selfish? You probably have never been in a rs. Let's turn the tables. If you have a girlfriend who is hardly in Singapore, and even when she is in Singapore, she works till 10pm or later, how would you feel? Out of 30 days in a month, you see her for let's say 5-7 days inclusive of weekends.</p>
              <p>4. Have you been at work? Because I am a working adult, I know how things go. Logically, if you think about it, do you have last minute meetings and not be informed about it till when you are about to leave the office? Uh huh. Would you not be informed that your staff would be flying down to Singapore hours or a day in advance before he/she actually touched down in Singapore?</p>
              <p>5. I am the one who wanted to take up dance. Have you not seen a dance before? I would recommend you to something called 'Youtube'. Google 'waltz'. It's the 21st century, not 19th. And what exactly is your definition of touch? A guy/girl touching the other party's private parts huh?</p>
              <p>6. Would you change your wardrobe if your girlfriend CONSTANTLY say that your shirt is too tight for you and it shows your tummy etc? YES RIGHT? My boyfriend will CONSTANTLY remind me that my skirt or dress is too short. FYI I am standing at 170cm. The clothes in Singapore are made mostly for peitie girls or have you not noticed?  </p>
              <p>7. I dont even have my own personal life anymore. I cant even meet my friends as he dont like that I hang out with my guy friends since he claims that I will give them the wrong idea if I hang out with them one-on-one. He hates my girl friends because they never had a good impression of him. He hates that I sign up for the gym because I am already so skinny. So tell me what am I supposed to do? CLINGY? I am more of CRAZY now.</p>

              <p>I recomend you to <strong>break up. </strong></p>
              <p>Trust me, if a guy treasures you, he WILL MAKE TIME TO SEE YOU. Like Bio-Hawk said above, you are navie in relationships. [I guess he is your first]. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Well, if my BF treats me like this, I will give him a middle finger and tell him to f--k off. </span></p>
              <p>I had a relationship before when I was 13. Actually, I feel that it is good that teenagers date each other because they get to learn about relationships. And of course, <strong>relationships <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn't equate</span> to love-making</strong> and when I finally got over him, I know what kind of guys to that I should run as fast as I could even though that person can claim to "love" me. There are lots of guys in this world, I think your BF is a player. </p>
              <p>Be careful, this older and mature guy can manilupate you into having sex with him. </p>

              <p><br>I guess I just love him too much to be able to take all his BS. I really try not to fight with him so often and understand that work is important. He does have a choice, since he is the boss. And no this isnt my first rs. Neither am I a teenager.</p>
              <p>I admit that I am blinded by love and I am stupid to love a guy like him. Like you said, if he truly does loves me, he would have make time. I deserve to be a priority instead of an option. Besides I believe, if someone truly love you, he would see you despite how tired he is because it's worth it  but in my case, he cant be bothered to do so even though we live 10 minutes from each other as he drives.</p>
              <p>He already manipulated me into having sex with him. He has been giving me tons of stress about going overseas with him even though we are together for a mere 4 months.</p>
              <p>He wants me all to himself. That a comment like 'I love him as a friend' is touchy for him. I cant meet my guy friends as he commented that 'you will give the wrong idea to your friend if you meet him one-on-one'. I am going crazy. I cant meet my friends (he doesnt like my girl friends) and I cant go for my passion (dance).</p>
              <p>He even accused me of having an affair once because I went out with a group of friends to USS and was particularly close to a guy (childhood friend) who is attached. And I did tell him I was going out with a group of friends.</p>

              <p>5. I am the one who wanted to take up dance. Have you not seen a dance before? I would recommend you to something called 'Youtube'. Google 'waltz'.

A guy/girl touching the other party's private parts huh?--&gt;<span style="color: #ff0000;"> The question was would you mind other girls touhing him?Seems you do.</span></p>
              <p>6. Would you change your wardrobe if your girlfriend CONSTANTLY say that your shirt is too tight for you and it shows your tummy etc? YES RIGHT? My boyfriend will CONSTANTLY remind me that my skirt or dress is too short. FYI I am standing at 170cm. The clothes in Singapore are made mostly for peitie girls or have you not noticed? <span style="color: #ff0000;"> --&gt; Wow nice excuse to self justify.</span></p>
              <p>7. I dont even have my own personal life anymore. I cant even meet my friends as he dont like that I hang out with my guy friends since he claims that I will give them the wrong idea if I hang out with them one-on-one. He hates my girl friends because they never had a good impression of him. He hates that I sign up for the gym because I am already so skinny. So tell me what am I supposed to do? CLINGY?

              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 10px;">So do his girlfriend a favor. Send her all the evidence of his cheating. Texts, photos..and where you had sex with him. </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 10px;">She wasted 3 years on this crook. </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; line-height: 10px;">He will insist you seduced him.. but dont worry. If she gets angry at you,. let her know she can keep that piece of trash.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> --&gt; Be the bitch you want to be. Since you are so naive, don't listen to idiots/feminists who speaks of revenge and getting back while they have nothing to loose.Tell him you are not interested,change the number and never ever speak to him. All the things above can be used to sue you for defamation. None of these forum trolls would help you out if this came to be. It's for sure a bitter experience, learn from it and move on.Amen.</span></p>

              <p>Hello. You sound like a guy who wishes the girl to take lead in the rs. And I understand where you are coming from since you are a guy. (Guy tend to take the side of the guy right?) --&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Not the wussies. I told you he's cheating on you while none others could figure this out from this limited info.Infamous arm chair general and feminist jojobeach could only think of flirting.</span></p>
              <p>1. I have been the one who always put in the effort in the rs that I feel like this is a one sided rs. Why? I was the one who confessed to him and he said he was afraid that he will lose me (if I didnt like him) if he confessed to me. He used to send me pictures of cute animals and such, tell me about his past and send me photos of himself when he was younger, now he just stopped. PS And, I will do up handmade gifts that take me weeks to do because he wants to celebrate every monthsary. He just dont.<span style="color: #ff0000;">--&gt; U are really naive and has no clue how such things work. Imagine a cute rich guy coming to you and saying everything you said to the guy,would you let it pass?Especially when it cost you nothing?Don't act so saintly, you would not too. That's what happened here.</span></p>
              <p>2. I am always the one who plan dates. Day 1 till now. ALWAYS. I am the who suggest what movies to watch, what to do, where to go. --&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">That didn't give you a clue that he didn't want you?</span></p>
              <p>3. Goodness me, I am selfish? You probably have never been in a rs. Let's turn the tables. If you have a girlfriend who is hardly in Singapore, and even when she is in Singapore, she works till 10pm or later, how would you feel? Out of 30 days in a month, you see her for let's say 5-7 days inclusive of weekends. <span style="color: #ff0000;">--&gt; I don't count days like you do.</span></p>
              <p>4. Have you been at work? Because I am a working adult, I know how things go. Logically, if you think about it, do you have last minute meetings and not be informed about it till when you are about to leave the office? Uh huh.

              <p>Have I seen a man's career destroyed by his sexual affairs. Yes. Many.</p>
              <p>This man has a reputation to protect. He screws with his younger subordinate,  while cheating on his girlfriend , thats a big no no in work and personal ethics..And he is scared people will find out. Three strikes and his character is dirtier than a soiled diaper. </p>
              <p>Don't shit where you eat. </p>
              <p>And for your information only, I am happily married and a mom. So I bet your mom probably did some really nasty crap to you while you are growing up , for you to treat women as some objects to be used. </p>
              <p>Did your mom tell you all women are evil except herself ? No one can love you more than mommy? Yah, its a conspiracy.  some mothers do that.</p>
