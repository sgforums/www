If you like her, you will wait, it is as simple as that.<br><br>Real love will still be there in time. You can always chat online and lim kpi together. All is not lost. Don't think about how much you'll miss her and how much you need her as you are in the present now so enjoy it. Enjoy the moments knowing that love does not mean sex.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It is a good thing that you have been for your friend whenever something happens (have you) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> . I can tell that you are a good friend and I am sure that she realizes that. Sometimes relationships are better in the long run if they are platonic but it could be possible that she can start to have feelings for you because she sees that you would treat her well. The best thing to do is to talk to her about it when she is alone and do not pressure her. Just tell her how you feel but also make sure you let her know that you are ok with the fact if she wants to just be friends. That will allow her to express herself more easier.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> I know that often times, love spurs from friendship. But also, romance can possibly spoil a friendship. I know that you may feel that way about her but I really think that you should talk to her and find out her feelings on the relationship. If the feeling is not mutual, I think disaster could be coming. But if both of you feel the same way and want to take your relationship a step further, go for it. However, I really think you should find out how SHE feels until you make any proclamations. Take note these should be done when she is no longer attached aight?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks all for helping me to think more rationally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>With all ur help and suggestions, I think its easier for me now to not cross that line (at least for this moment). I am 24 this year, and never had a gf in my life so far, so I'm still pretty green abt BGR stuffs... But I do know that a good potential r/ship stems from a good solid friendship. For this instance, I'm pretty happy the way things are going, so think I'll just let it be.<br><br>And yes, Master hit the nail on the head.. *kowtows*<br>You knew what was going inside my head. More often than not, its always this tot of "should i go out with an attached girl" .. u know as some guys would say "why place ur stakes on this one when there are others out there ?" ... I personally find she's a sensible lady, and a worthy good friend to keep. Thus, all i seek is her friendship at the very minimum.<br><br>No one can see the future I guess, so its all up to me to make myself a better person.. both in character and in career  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And btw, I tot my nick was kinda funny.. since i had a friend who often 'abused' that phrase.. haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Once again folks.. for all the advice and enlightenment you all have given me..
