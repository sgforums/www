What you need is time to heal and try to be in the company of friends. Also you can get a good friend to listen to your problems.<br><br>You can also vent your fustrations in the way you best want it... Maybe you can shout at the sea side? Or go arcade play those challenging games? Or have a good cry? Anything to make you better and DO NOT bottle up. It will hurt more than you want.<br><br>You can make new friends here if you like. Or go with some friends and meet other friends. Do not let one set back stop you and rob you of the joy you deserve.<br><br>Later you wait, got more suggestions and advices coming in.<br><br>Hooooo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!!!!</div>
