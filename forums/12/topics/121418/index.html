            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Five surprising reasons men are happy in a relationship</strong><br>by Bonnie Yuill<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Don't be fooled by the male ego. Men look for more in a relationship than an attractive women who will cook him a good meal and wash his clothes every once in a while. What he really needs is your admiration.</span><br><br><strong>He needs to communicate with you</strong><br>A lot of men need to be in a relationship more than women do. Surprising? Not really, when you think about it. Women usually have close relationships with their friends. They talk about health problems until they feel better. But men don't. As Helen Fielding's character, Bridget Jones, says, 'Women have emotions and men have football.' Men are competitive and so, in general, they rarely share their emotions or problems with each other, as they think it makes them look too weak. When he needs to open up and talk about his feelings, guess who he eventually shows his vulnerable side to? You!<br><br><strong>He wants to be your hero</strong><br>Knowing that he can make someone else happy makes him feel good inside, because he has the power to change things. And what bloke doesn't secretly want power of some sort? At least if he can't always be top dog at work, he can be a star at home. Instinctively, he aspires to be Spider-Man or Superman Â– to be your hero, to be able to make things right: to be appreciated, to be someone's knight in shining armour. So when you are disappointed or unhappy, he feels responsible. What matters is that you are happy and then he's got one less thing to worry about. Strange but true.<br><br><strong>He strives to make you happy</strong><br>The number one reason men leave relationships is because they feel as though they can't meet their partner's needs. This makes them feel inadequate, and it makes them feel as though there's no way their partner can feel respect for them. For women, communication seems to be the top priority in keeping the relationship going Â– but, quite honestly, men don't understand this constant need to talk about things over and over.<br><br>For men, the relationship is a success if they feel respected and if they make their partner happy. This is why a new conquest is exactly that Â– he feels as though he is in charge Â– he is once again someone's knight in shining armour.<br><br>If you resent him because you feel overworked and under-appreciated, stop doing so much Â– you are probably destroying your relationship! He doesn't want to feel responsible for you rushing around, worn into the carpet, and most men really don't notice whether the housework has been done or not. What they want is respect and appreciation. 'All we really want from women,' a (male) friend recently told me, 'is for you to smile at us.' (And probably one other thing, if he thought about it for longer than a millisecond.)<br><br><strong>Sex makes him feel loved</strong><br>Sex has the same effect on men as romance does on women. So the reverse is also true: no sex = no love, no approval, no acknowledgement. They get that same sad, unloved feeling that you get when you don't get flowers, your partner looks at other women or ignores you.<br><br>Sex has the same effect on men as romance does on women<br>You are his (secret) reason for living<br>He needs you because you inspire him to do better Â– he has someone to do things for, goals to reach, a reason to go out and conquer the world. What's the point of being disgustingly rich and powerful if there's no one to share it with? What he needs is the gift of you.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2004 handbag.com<br><br></div>
