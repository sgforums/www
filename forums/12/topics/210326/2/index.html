With strong interest in mass comm, I'm sure you will be able to succeed. Your result is excellent as well so you have a high chance of entering your desired course.<br><br>What matters now is your present, don't think too far ahead of entering uni even if that is a great ambition.

My A-level results allowed me 2 get into NTU, but it wasn't the course I want, so I chose MDIS, a private school that offered a degree in Mass Comms, awarded by the Okalahoma City University(ocu).

U skip the diploma stage at MDIS. I would recommend u to join this course, although i know the stigma of a private school is still there,especially since u are a 9 pointer. Because during the last few months before u finish ur degree course, u can fly to the US, and  go to OCU campus to study 3 modules in 3weeks. Things like TV producation and script-writing will be taught. I will be going next year, but already my classmates and me can't wait.<br><br>So think about it carefully.
