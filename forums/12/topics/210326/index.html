            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, I have a burning question to ask.<br><br>How do I move up from poly to university?<br><br>As in, what's the percentile I have to be in to stand a chance? Top 15%?<br><br>I am currently an O-level student. Exams are in November, and I have decided to aim for a specific course in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. However, I plan to continue with tertiary education after graduation from NP. My long-term goal is to study journalism and eventually be tied to a career in journalism, or public relations when I go out to the real world. That's the life plan I have in mind eight or ten years down the road for now.<br><br>I wish to study <strong>Mass Communications</strong> in Ngee Ann Poly, and yes, I have heard of how it is a massively tough course to get into and competition for degree places will be cut-throat. I realize that I will be competing with the cream de la creme of the poly cohorts when I enter that course. However, my dreams to become a journalist, print or otherwise, will always keep me on the right track.<br><br>My targeted L1R4 is 9 points. I am strong in English (one teacher says that my A1 for this subject is a mere formality but I can never be too sure) and my Combined Humanities, History Elective (I am a history and social studies freak, my favourite subject!). Principles of Accounts is a breeze. My concerns now are Mathematics and Mother Tounge. I have scored a B3 for June Mother Tounge 'O's with a higher distinction for Oral, so I have a fair chance of hitting A2 this time around. I am piss weak in my Maths, but I guess I can drag it up to B3 too come November as I have been steadily making ground in this damn subject.<br><br>L1R4 Target Breakdown :<br>English - <strong>A1</strong><br>C.Humanities - <strong>A1</strong><br>Mathematics - <strong>B3</strong><br>Principles of Accounts - <strong>A1</strong><br>Mother Tounge - <strong>B3/A2</strong><br><br>So yeah, 9 points.<br><br>Additionaly, I have scored an <strong>A1</strong> for CCA and have no conduct troubles (teacher never catch me smoking and groping girls' butts while in school before, haha I win) and can be confident that I will have a fairly decent testimonial written for me as I am a student councillor, blablabla.<br><br>So are my goals good enough? Would be great if I can get feedback from Mass Comm students here! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Why have I chosen the Poly route to Uni? Chiefly because I really desire to study Mass Comm as it will play on my greatest (actually ONLY) talent I possess : my command of the English language. Hand in hand is the thought of going through A-levels. I am bordering on the edge of suicide and mental breakdown just for going through O-levels, of which most of the subjects I really don't give a flying f*** about with the exception of Humanities.<br><br>O level cannot tahan how to stand Air level. Go JC confirm si liao lor.<br><br>Any pointers for a mass comm hopeful?<br><br>Regards,<br>iSpeak</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I have heard so far, entering Junior College is really extending your secondary school life. Four years of being in an incredibly strict secondary school with a staff desperate to chase autonomous status at all costs has turned it into a living nightmare for me.<br><br>I am not someone who can stand the lack of freedom. I hate constrictions placed on me. I am so used to doing whatever I want, that I find it hard to adjust to a school environment where they still treat you like a child only because they are anally result-oriented. I am not a spoilt child, my parents let me lead my own life because they know I have grown-up quite abit. I fear that Junior College will be a repeat of my secondary school life, only that the pressure to do well for A levels will be even greater. I have been to Polytechnic open-houses, and from what I observed, it is a much more relaxed atmosphere.<br><br>Of course, I'm not saying that poly isn't academically tough. I'm just talking about study environment. There is a lot less rigidity and more freedom. Independence is emphasized. You don't wanna turn up for a lecture? Fine. Your problem. I just send you a letter warning you. Choose the life you wish to lead and flunk or pass your modules on your own merits and personal drive, not because you are under the whips of teachers.<br><br>It's 7.26AM and it's kind of hard to express about the suffocation I feel at secondary school.<br><br>So yeah, in conclusion, here are three main points of why I want to pick poly.<br><br><strong>- A desire to study Mass Comm<br>(Eventually want to work in print media/journalism/writer someday. Or maybe a PR post in a company.)<br><br>- The Poly environment<br><br>- My strength in language</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During my time, it was the top 5 percentile, then it went up, they even threw mother tongue language out the window for jc grads.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by iSpeak:<br><strong>From what I have heard so far, entering Junior College is really extending your secondary school life. Four years of being in an incredibly strict secondary school with a staff desperate to chase autonomous status at all costs has turned it into a living nightmare for me.<br><br>I am not someone who can stand the lack of freedom. I hate constrictions placed on me. I am so used to doing whatever I want, that I find it hard to adjust to a school environment where they still treat you like a child only because they are anally result-oriented. I am not a spoilt child, my parents let me lead my own life because they know I have grown-up quite abit. I fear that Junior College will be a repeat of my secondary school life, only that the pressure to do well for A levels will be even greater. I have been to Polytechnic open-houses, and from what I observed, it is a much more relaxed atmosphere.<br><br>Of course, I'm not saying that poly isn't academically tough. I'm just talking about study environment. There is a lot less rigidity and more freedom. Independence is emphasized. You don't wanna turn up for a lecture? Fine. Your problem. I just send you a letter warning you. Choose the life you wish to lead and flunk or pass your modules on your own merits and personal drive, not because you are under the whips of teachers.<br><br>It's 7.26AM and it's kind of hard to express about the suffocation I feel at secondary school.<br><br>So yeah, in conclusion, here are three main points of why I want to pick poly.<br><br>[b]- A desire to study Mass Comm<br>(Eventually want to work in print media/journalism/writer someday. Or maybe a PR post in a company.)<br><br>- The Poly environment<br><br>- My strength in language</strong>[/b]</blockquote>Dear little brudder, the above are 95% of what I felt when I was in sec sch. It's only when u look back in perspective that u may regret. If u wanna get a degree eventually, why go poly? It's 3 years compared to JC's 2 years. And a JC's chance of entering Uni are way higher.<br><br>You don't sound to me like you wholly wana go NP because of mass comm. It's also sounds like u wana escape from regimental life and find freedom. That is very very unhealthy as you will sow what u reap later on.<br><br>My reasons for going poly in 1996 are<br><br>1)Sch is too restrictive! Wearing uniform and all that regimental stuff. I would rather wear clothes that I like and it's an expression of my freedom<br><br>2) JC sux! Studying science, F Maths and Chinese some more. Argh!! Business studies are more interesting<br><br>3) I have to report to JC everyday at 730am?!? Poly has more flexibility!<br><br>4) If I don't get good JC grades can can't enter Uni, will be stuck with a useless A'Levels but in poly, even if i don't do too well, I still get the Diploma<br><br>Oh well, to cut it short, in S'pore, majority of poly grads with only a diploma are doing jobs lower paid than that of grads.<br><br>I come from a not too bad sec sch, my peers are now doctors, army officers, lawyers, investment bankers, teachers....what do they have in common? A Uni degree. So my thoughts are....if u still wana go poly, make sure u get the best grades and upgrade to a Uni. But what if u don't make it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel nowadays it is really easy for poly students to enter uni. For my secondary batch of friends, those who went to JC only about 60% able to enter a local uni, some of them end up in SIM. Whereas for those who went to poly, most of them (90%) are in NUS or NTU.<br><br>But poly life is very relaxing, in order to do well you really need to discipline yourself.</div>
