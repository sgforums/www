Because from the way your situation has flowed into, that could turn out to be a possibility eventually.<br><br>You are indeed playing with fire when you addressed her flagrantly as 'dear'. Flippant words may be cheap, but reiterated message over a period of time strengthens a belief gradually. Now that your worst nightmare has escalates beyond your control, look closer - probably this 'nightmare' might be a real wish after all.<br><br>I do understand your astronomical void and emotional restlessness when your Significant Other is not around physically to tender those sensitive needs. But from certain angles, this is exactly what differentiates a great relationship from 'the others'.<br><br>An LDR (long distance relationship) is relative difficult. In fact, it is a fallacious promise for any relationship to succeed in LDR, challenging even for the best of love. Sure, some might just barely kept their breath above water, but looking at statistics, your kind of plight is THE most common reason why LDR fails.<br><br>Do note that I am not advocating civil and moral lessons on the necessity to be loyal at all cost because it's a matter of choice. You have your own needs and such subconscious absence might prove to be a little too much for you to bear.<br><br>Retrograde and remain alone for the time being. You probably need that sort of environment to introspect and decide what you want. It's better to face your feelings right now, then to play passive and wait until everything implodes into some love tragedy.<br><br>You mentioned that you lost your direction? Who knows?

She wants you.<br>Warning.....<br>It's either she really likes you, or she wants to enjoy the thrill of taking you away from someone else.....yes, women has egos too.<br>There are some girls that tends to go for attached guys. Because the thrill of "winning" is exhilarating. After they get em, they'd dump em.<br><br>If your heart tells you to fall in love with the local girl.<br>Please... breakoff with your gf. Make it a clean one.<br><br>It is better that she break off with you BEFORE she finds out you are unfaithful.<br><br>It is much more painful to know the breakoff is due to a 3rd party.<br><br>The question is, are you ready to let your gf go ?<br>Will you torment her with your indecision ?<br><br></div>
