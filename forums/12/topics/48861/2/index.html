After trying out for a few days,  he told me he it's not possible coz he cannot forget my past and he asked me if I hated him and if we can remain as friends. How can I hate him?

I believe this special someone is out there. I've had a Horrible past. I told my bf about it and he accepted me for who I am. And whatever's in the past, it's long gone. We've been together for almost a year now, and still going very strong, and he's even had a future planned for us.<br><br>He's out there, my dear. You'll find him someday.
