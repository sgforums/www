Absolutely nothing to do with this guy of yours. In my own personal opinon, never reveal your past to your bf/gf. Understand why? Because its NOT their right to know about it - rather, its a privileges. Telling them about your PAST will not bring benefits at all - the best you could bring is neutral effect (Know, know lor, like that lor, kind of thing), others: it actually de-valued your relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Being FRANK and keeping your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">own private space </span>is totally <strong>DIFFERENT ISSUES</strong>.

(Being through not much relationships in his life)<br><br>^cereal^ my words to you is that - you certainly could move on and seek for your own happiness, the true guy that looks not at the surface, but at the heart. This shouldn't discourage you - it should serve as a motivation to improve yourself - to show to that guy that he made such mistake in letting you go. Seriously speaking, even one day if he were to wake up and wants to accept you back - my stand is forget it man - who knows, when he is going through this mental crisis again and dump you using such excuses again? Past is something you can't change - but certainly you ain't condemn forever if you improve.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Seek for appreciation, the love for who you are and what you are.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Maybe you're one of those ppl who considered giving of oneself to the one whom you truly loved then with promises of eternity as being 'stupid', but not for my case.

Don't let such a minor thing get into your way if you truely love him. If we are stuck in the past then the police will be wearing shorts and Yishun will be under the opposition party.<br><br>And you mentioned he decides everything... then its high time u do more about it. Make decisions too. If you can't do it alone then discuss it with him. Show that you mean more then your past. Don't let him decide everything and lead you by the nose. Often ppl with strong character are also the ones that can leave their past and carry on their live. Do the same thing. Show him you are worth more then the "miserable past " he associate's with you. Show him you can do it. And finally... many people say that if cannot click then break. Don't be rash and think carefully 1st else if regret the same people's advise may not get him back for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
