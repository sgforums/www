            <div class='col-md body'>I have couple of tattoos over my body. 6 tattoos to be exact.Its all hidden when I am wearing clothes. Except for one on my wrist. Ok...most of the tattoos are not small ones. Its kinda big to be exact. I got all these 6 in just 8 months time.<br>Parents are supportive for what I am doing. (My dream is to be covered in tattoos)<br>Of cos, when I go to office I will long sleeve to minimise the chances of exposure and wearing a big watch to cover the one on my wrist.<br><br>I treat it as a kind of artform. But not so for many....they think I must be from some gangs or whatever shit. When I go swimming, all people would surely give me one kind of look as though I am from outter space.<br><br>I know more people have social stigma against tattooed folks than those who actually think its nothing. Even a close friend of mind keeps telling me to stop what I am doing. He said others think I am a gangster....so I asked him "You know me so well? You think I am one???" But his reply is...."its what others think about you!"<br>Anyway I don't really care. Please don't judge one by its skin!.....Although its getting better now adays but still alot of people would not approve such acts.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>unfortunately, it's human nature. before you blame others, let me ask you some simple questions, then you think about it... If you go to a particular place, and there are always shootings or robbers incidents in those areas, then naturally you'll try to avoid those places right? And then think about this, if you know that in certain districts, which might be quite true in the US, you get robbed alot by black people, then naturally when you see black people, somehow your subconscious will tell to be cautious around these black people right? While some people with tattoos are fine, but have you ever thought that there might be some other degrading action barbie ppl with tattoos that left a bad impression on others, then you should reflect and think about my earlier questions, because i believe if you truthfully answer those questions, you might understand why others react the way they do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is how society works, people are always using appearences to judge a person. But sometimes people aren't as bad as they think. Because people mostly like conformists because most of them are one too, so when you are a little diff from them they will see you in a bad way and might avoid you.<br><br>I think people with multiple tattoos are discriminated as most of them have a tough time finding a job when the employers know they have tattoos. And when they all out people tend to avoid them for fear that they are gangster or something. This is just how the world works maybe in singapore at least with this kind of conservative mindset.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm in the same boat as you man , though probably much younger .<br>I've also got a sort of dream of how i want my body to look and it pretty much involves being almost covered in tattoos except for certain areas. None of my tattoos are visible when i wear like school uniform or normal t-shirt /jeans .<br>I'd suggest tattooing your feet,  i recently took to that because i was running out of space on my body and i wanted to keep it for something special : )<br>it does hurt quite a bit , one of the more painful places u can get but its a really unique kind of pain la , quite shiok also .<br><br>anyway its true most singaporeans still look at people with tattoos in a really odd way , and they associate it with gangsterism , and like when i change in school people will start talking about oh hes got so many tattoos must be a gangster and none of my tattoos even remotely resemble anything gangster . And mind you im from a top school . If its really a passion like it is for me , then id say you shouldnt care what anyone in society thinks but just remember to never tattoo places like your neck as we've gotta be realistic , we should just try to hide our tattoos so we dont give people the OPPORTUNITY to be prejudiced against us .<br><br>I'd say within 20-30 years , when the youth of today become the adults , society is going to be very very different , and tattoos will become alot more acceptable . If you've read stuff from overseas , there are many professionals working in good jobs such as lawyers , bankers , execs etc with tattoos and some of them were recently featured .<br><br>check out this site bodymod.org also , its a pretty cool site to see other people's tattoos and share your own : ) oh and mind sharing what tattoos you have ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>stigma is a social phenomenon that has always existed.<br><br>if you want tatoos and you like it, then you have to accept the consequence of people thinking differently about you.<br><br>if you can accept the consequence( and most people cannot), then go ahead and do it. if you cannot accept people looking differently at you, then dun do tatoo in the first place. since u already have so many liao, the best is not to add some more to your body liao.<br><br>theoretically, and morally speaking there is nothing wrong with tatoo. However, economically speaking, and socially speaking, the world is a complex thing and people always thinking inaccurately about one another. you want to society to change? then you have got to wait. society evolves slowly.</div>
