            <div class='col-md body'>Darkie, I believe you are still studying right? Else how can you be thinking of getting a GF? The raging hormones in you and seeing other guys hold hands with their GFs, cuddling and laughter, makes you want to have one right?<br><br>I can tell you one thing, more than 90% of those couples you see have never thought of committing beyond marriage. They are basically like you, wanting to get a GF/BF just for the sake of it. Nothing else.<br><br>It is not easy to suppress the emotions and feelings in you right now. I've been there. Its a long road and a rough one at that. But I can tell you this: If you decide to get one and you REALLY got one, most likely you two will not be together till the end.<br><br>Take your time, know more people. Enjoy your youth and time. Have fun and at the same time, understand the friends around you more. Soon you will get more friends than you imagined. By then your circle of friends will be big enough to seek for a special someone for you.<br><br>BUT as long as you want a GF only, you will have more pain and sorrow awaiting you compared to what you feel now.</div>

Else how can you be thinking of getting a GF? The raging hormones in you and seeing other guys hold hands with their GFs, cuddling and laughter, makes you want to have one right?<br><br>I can tell you one thing, more than 90% of those couples you see have never thought of committing beyond marriage. They are basically like you, wanting to get a GF/BF just for the sake of it. Nothing else.<br><br>It is not easy to suppress the emotions and feelings in you right now. I've been there. Its a long road and a rough one at that. But I can tell you this: If you decide to get one and you REALLY got one, most likely you two will not be together till the end.<br><br>Take your time, know more people. Enjoy your youth and time. Have fun and at the same time, understand the friends around you more. Soon you will get more friends than you imagined. By then your circle of friends will be big enough to seek for a special someone for you.<br><br>BUT as long as you want a GF only, you will have more pain and sorrow awaiting you compared to what you feel now.</div></blockquote>yea...i feel i don't meet enough friends also... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Aiye...have also like that...don't have also like that...</div>
