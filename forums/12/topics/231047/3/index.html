Christianity is rather "tyranny" and brainwashing! Even my catholic friend told me christianity is brainwashing.  My other catholic friend told me the bible is outdated.  I was invited to church (christian) and attended service for a no of years.   I saw more of the ugly side of christians than the good side, and this is contradicting to the teaching of God.  Many christians don't practice love as God wants them to.  During church meetings they shouted, argue and quarreled with one another for differences and power, aiyo!<br><br>Christians consider those who don't worship the same God as them are to go to hell and many of them condemn non christians and their religions.   Hey, christians bear in mind not all christians go to heaven OK, so watch your words, actions, attitudes and thinking.<br><br></div>
