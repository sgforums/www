Just one question if you sense someone like andrew or I mean can be others/anybody else tries to be subtle to preach their religion on forum, will you ban them from posting?  Sometimes can be very subtle.  Why I said subtle is came across a link with website link's name like garfield, and when click on it is a religious website.   Think best to not preach here on forum.</div>
