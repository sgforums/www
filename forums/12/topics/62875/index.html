Its a vicious cycle - people who don't think about themselves of what they like/love, interest, what they excel, etc will forever remain in this way until something drastic take place.<br><br>You could start doing something that you like, EVEN if it has little practical meaning like mastering the art of folding Origami for example. When you excel in something regardless of what it is, self confidence will flow in. Once you are sure you are good in that thingy, restart this cycle with another interest/things. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You want relationship to work well? Like common sense told you - you have to get rid of this dark side in yourself. You mentioned in your other post, saying that you have positive friends, but you seldom communicate with others and so there are of no exception.<br><br>People who are bei guan have small social circle - because they don't feel a need to expand them and they don't feel too good about themselves to get to know people. Self confidence and attitude are highly related to the people you are with - a guy hanging out with the punks will behave like one. Similiarly, staying around positive people will bring about a change in you subconsciously. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Start communicating, even if people thinks that you are a weirdo. Learn to love yourself and take much time to read from books that could enlighten you and stay positive. Negative thinkings are your automatic thoughts currently, but its possible to change them.<br><br>P.S: Before you can walk a mile, you have to begin your first step. Trust me, when you have instill a change in you, you will not only see relationship differently, but the way you lead and feel about them will evolve and change. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
