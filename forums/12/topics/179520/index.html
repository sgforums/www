If I get into a r/s with someone, I would have to be able to imagine myself living forever with her, until both of us are old."</span><br><br>I was thinking...how can you be sure that your imagination is correct? How can you base what is going to happen in the future on your imagination? Nobody can predict what is going to happen...you can never tell whether she is the one for you by trying to predict what is going to happen next, the only way to tell is to actually try it out in real life.<br><br>So I dunno if this reason of yours is valid. Though it does sound very much like what one of my frens was thinking when he told me why he was reluctant to get involved with a girl whom he likes and also cares a lot for him.<br><br>The only valid reason is if you do not have any feeling for her. If you cannot see yourself being more than friends with her at the <span style="font-style: italic;">current</span> moment, then don't complicate things just by becoming her bf because you feel "pressurized" by her insistence. Love cannot be forced.<br><br>It has to come naturally.
