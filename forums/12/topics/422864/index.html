              <p>Hi all. I am in JC 2 this year and I am facing lots of pressure, some of which are self-imposed and some of which are from the college itself. In recent days, I find myself having lots and lots of difficulties trying to catch up with my work and revising for the tests (which happen so often I can't even decide whether to study for my test or do my assignments)</p>
              <p>Last week, I had a test to study for and I completed the assignments for the past week. But when I came home to do revision, I fell asleep after reading 1-2 pages and this happened for the entire week. I can't help falling asleep and I don't know why. Usually, I try to tahan but that week, it was really really unproductive. So I delayed the test and now I have MORE tests coming up and the previous week's work was further delayed. Sometimes I really want to end all this because the amount of work seems endless and I feel so strangled. I do the assignments, then there are more. When I study for the tests, but have no time to do the assignments. Whn I try to do the assignments to catch up in tutorial classes, but have to sacrifice studying for the tests and ended up getting bad grades for them. I had thoughts of getting retained when I was in JC1 but I got a strings of Bs in the promos so I did ok.</p>
              <p>Every time I step into the school, I feel so much pressure and the tutors will go,"If u can hand in your assignments by today, it means you have managed your time well." And for people like me who may have difficulties coping with the tests(which take place VIRTUALLY EVERY WEEK), I feel so discouraged by the fact that I still have to do the assignments, revise for tests, and to make it worse, re-read the notes because most of the time, I process things so slowly in lectures. But when I am at home, studying at my own pace, I start to enjoy the learning process more than in school, where things are so fast-paced and people so kiasu (typical of everyone in JC, so cant blame anyone).</p>
              <p>I used to enjoy learning a lot but ever since I got into JC, I am finding studying, revising a chore because time seems to fly. I have a phobia of the college itself and sometimes I wonder whether JC is still the thing for me or not (I did farely well for O level so I didnt give a second thoughts to applying for a JC). Now I am starting to think if I should go to a poly and trying to figure out if I am having such thoughts because of the pressure I have or whatsoever. I dont know, but failing so many tests sometimes make me so discouraged that I go home feeling all so tired.</p>
              <p>I once asked a friend what's the use of having so many tests so often when u have to really really find time to accomodate all the revision on the sidelines of homework, reading of notes, etc. Getting another bad grade just adds to your frustration. When I approached the tutor about my problems, they say I appear "OK" and "you are doing ok". I do look OK on the surface but deep down I am like a mess. I need advice on what I should do or whether I am sick of JC, or the inability to cope. Thanks for enduring this long windy post.</p>

              <p>JC is Jialat Course, but take it easy, many had gone thru, not only you, struggle for a yearthen, you get another said 3 years in Uni and the rest of your life, you can be better and free.</p>
              <p>SInce you are in JC, better do well to get into Uni, 'A' Level is nothing outside, worst than a diploma, if you are a gal, cannot make it to Uni, can come my place and work, for guy, go army first, then try those SIM or private Uni.</p>

              <p>dont panic</p>
              <p>arrange all your test prep and homework in proper chronological order.</p>
              <p>learning process is generally:</p>
              <p>lecture -&gt; self-study/notes taking -&gt; homework -&gt; test prep</p>
              <p>you change it around you get yourself into a mess.</p>
              <p><strong>what do you do if you find that you cant follow the order cos you dont have enough time?</strong></p>
              <p>dont panic</p>
              <p>prioritise based on what you can do best and well, and keep doing that FIRST</p>
              <p>that does not mean you can let the rest slack and CRASH</p>
              <p>you will have to sacrifice some time that you spend on other things until you can catch up.</p>
              <p>if you cannot catch up at all, you need a tuition teacher or personal coach. if you cannot afford or get friend to help you, then you have hit your limits. JC is not for you.</p>
              <p><strong>not for you:</strong></p>
              <p>for advanced learners, they already read all the books and lectures for this year, during last year's holidays.</p>

              <p>I really don't see whats the problem here. Students in polytechnics are also faced with time management, tests, exams, attachments, final year projects. Apart from that, the locals are working with foreign students of different age groups with the addition that some lecturers do not really teach very well in english(seriously). Thus people from poly will know that academic pursuits + interpersonal skills + time management are all crucial. Stop complaining and go study. If you fail A levels or do badly you're in deep shit. Girl still got chance to retake, if you're a guy then wait after army.</p>
              <p>Anyway, are you from top jc or neighbourhood kind?</p>

              <p>When I study, I study smart not 'hard'. I learn to pass exams by doing 10 years series. This method always works for me but it involved hard works and consistency. Studying hard is not always equal to good results but doing 10 years series consistency is equivalent to achieving great results.</p>

              <p>i understand how you feel too! take it easy k? </p>
              <p>the teachers definitely won't be easy on you because a levels are coming :) so you would just have to be self motivated, and don't be too demoralised because of your grades :) they are (sometimes) meant to make you feel bad and study harder.</p>

              <p>i'm not sure how things are, but anyways, if i'm not wrong, assignments and general class tests are not graded/have a low percentage in your final grades.</p>
              <p>so maybe your way of tackling school now could be to first try to understand the topics taught, build up on your basics, make sure your sec4, J2/J1 topics/concepts are solid and that you really understand them. figure out what's going on in class. get the concepts first.</p>
              <p>if not doing assignments will take 2 times the time it's supposed to take you cause you'll get stumped on every other question. (sort of like me doing math D: ) cause even though sacrificing both your tests and assignments to study the concepts may have you seeing no returns in the short run, but when you take your major exams you will have the comfort of saying, yes i've learnt this before and i'm clear of all the topics that i'm supposed to know.</p>
