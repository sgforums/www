            <div class='col-md body'>If you really like her and don't wish to give up this relatopnship simply. First ask yourself, will you accept her again IF she confessed about her fling to you. Will you be able to try trust her and treat like before? This is a big barrier for many guys who cant overcome this issue.<br><br>A relationship come together with open communication and mutual trust, not just by showering love and concern.<br><br>Be forward looking before you make any critical decision.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there..<br>I think it is best to have a heart to heart talk with her. You have unanswered questions. It will be better if she tells you how exactly she feels. At least you don't have to live your life in paranoia. If she still wanna love you, then ask her what is lacking in you. What do you need to improve on. Tell her what you want from her. If both of you can't agree with each other it only goes to show both of you are not really compatible so it is best to go separate ways.<br>Whether your gf is really cheating on you, that is not confirmed but she is definitely not acting normal. If you wanna salvaged your relationship, go have the talk. Be sincere about it. If you can't be bothered, what the hell are you waiting for? Cast another bait lor..</div>
