            <div class='col-md body'>related: Wait on or give-up?<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=122253<br><br>Hi, here's the story....<br><br>I (26yr-old) broke up with my 24yr-old ex about 2 mths ago but we remained friends and I tried to keep an amicable platonic relationship with her all this while till now. I initiated the break-up coz she could not reciprocate and she didn't feel emotionally connected to me. She wanted to part long time ago but claimed that she didn't know how to bring it up (which I tot is a lousy excuse, I think she really just wanted me as an insurance option till someone else better came along but anyway.....) so I did us both a favor and split.<br><br>Even though we split, I still held on to a tiny glimmer of hope through our weekly blading sessions at east coast every sunday. She doesn't skate well and very often I hold on to her hand and help her up when she fell - all of this really brought so many happy memories back. I guess till now I haven't been able to let go so easily because of our weekly activities. She does admit she recalls the good times too but tt's about all.<br><br>Just two days ago, I found out (through a 100% reliable source) that she's been going out with several of these 30-something yr-old men (married or not I don't know) one of whom (some wrinkly balding ang moh who needs facial reconstruction in fact) has been exchanging very intimate couple-equivalent communication with her, the kind you would not say to someone who was not ur gf or bf I asked her about whether she was seeing anyone else at the moment and she gave me very generic answers like - "oh I'm seeing a lot of guys now and all these guys know each other one". Basically she denied being attached, officially. She's actually going out with several "oldies" this I know for sure, but I strongly suspect she's going out with the ugly angmoh. (I'm not a model or hunk but being the fickle nutter that she begining to resemble, I guess she damn well deserves the downgrade)<br><br>She and I both know that she's lying blatantly and I just feel totally disgusted with how she can be such a wonderful actress. I think her real intention is to flirt with all these "oldies" but yet still be able to keep me interested enough (by going out with me and supposedly in her own words "maintain friendship")<br>to remain waiting in the wings as an insurance option just in case. Oh, I also think she's just asking me to go out sometimes when her "oldies" are not free for her.<br><br>I think she's playing with fire - again in her own words "having close relationships" with multiple oldies and leading all of them on. She enjoys getting chased coz I suppose she finds it all thrilling and fun with these oldies most likely paying for all if not most of the bills and sharing their "interesting life experiences and ""wisdom"" that comes from it" (which she says I don't have coz of my age and that my life is too smooth-sailing and problem-free and I'm unable to guide her as a mentor). (I think she's crazy by complaining that my life is problem-free. Its true that at this point in time I really do have no serious problems in my life except with her lies.)<br><br>The little bit of hope (of patching up) I had was real but has now all but vapourised. Anyway, I've had enough and I'm now truly disgusted at all her lies. I have nothing against older guys but with her naive and easily-excitable simple-mindedness which I know very well, she's just making herself easy meat without thinking of the consequences. I hate to say this about her because I once loved her very much but it dawns on me that she making herself a rather economically-inexpensive female canine by flirting with so many guys simultaneously. She even suggested that I could chase her too!! I absolutely abhor the thought of cheapening myself to being one of her "playguys", so I'm making a clean cut off her from today.<br><br>Anyway, my bone of contention here is that she's such a flithy liar.<br><br>If you were me, would you simply believe what she says - that she's not attached?<br><br>What do you think she's aiming to achieve by lying to me?</div>

I guess its just called "chao suay"..... Just had to encounter one of these screwed up girls to make a mess of my mental and emotional state. Her secret "unofficial" liasions with all her various older men which she so verhemently denies to me really hammers the f****** final nail into our r/s's coffin. Enough is enough. I used to be so confident of myself and strong too.......she just came and ripped me apart, I didn't have any ego or a backbone at all after that.  Never and never again will I allow myself to fall so vulnerable and head over heels for anyone else. If she's out for fun, I shall do too..... she can go to hell.....</div></blockquote>Relax dude.. She has already chosen who she wants to be. At least you can still make your CHOICE <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

Be a "good" boy, break off totally from the gal that just broken your heart.<br><br>2. Be a "bad" boy, will keep her as your sex pet as and when u needed to let off some of your heaty load. Will dump her only after u r sick of f***ing her anymore. Should have no hard feeling here as both parties are out to "screw" each other.<br><br>Enjoy it while u can or get her out of your life totally!!!<br><br>The choices are there, just select one and move on.<br><br>YH</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What u just hope is only a glimpse of it, hoping that there will be u-turning back she will come back to u, my wish is ur wish, however, according to ur descripition, it's very obivious the bonding bet the hearts no long there. It is only a 1 sided love with the possibly with no return. Love can be scracfice unconditioningly, u may think whether it is to the right person. U are not in any wrong however blinded by love, ur slight affection has cuased some jealousy whenever she with other guys. But since u end the r/s with her, u shld actually let go &amp; shld'nt tied her down, regardless whether wat she said is true or false. Let her be on ur own, &amp; most impt, u must be urself, be able to search for a new tree, rather than giving up the forest just for one. As u have said they already past happy memories, it worth to be remembered, not to be rekindled. Happy moment dun stay forever, they come &amp; goes, but most impt feeling may get less tastier but memories will stay. Shld let go ur feeling &amp; let urself explored openly, u will find the right one again.</div>
