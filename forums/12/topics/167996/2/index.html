You are being selfish! If you are uncertain about your feelings initially you shouldn't have propose to the girl who is your current wife. I really hope you can really think over it and realise who matters most to you, the one who is always besides you and supporting you all along.

You know the answer on who d you want to be with for the rest of your life.  No point being harsh on yourself as that will jeopardise your decision making process.  If you clearly do not love your wife, there's no point of the two of you stay together.   I would really suggest that you and your wife to see a relationship counsellor, if you really want to work on your relationship with your wife.<br><br>In the context of love, nobody could be accused of being too selfish, only irrational.  Only face it truthfully, then you will know which path you ought to take.</div>
