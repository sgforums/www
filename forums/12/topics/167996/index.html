You claimed that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">think</span> your feelings for this gal overshadowed those for your wife and the fact that you are still compromising to leave or stay by your wife, tells me that you don't know which gal you want yet. Marriage is a serious commitment, a covenant. Divorce is more troublesome to handle than break-up.<br><br>Perhaps, the following questions might shed some light into your situation.<br>Who comes first into your mind?<br>Do you have any idea of who means the most to you?<br>Ask yourself this question and answer it honestly.<br>"When you are happy, which gal would you want to share your happiness with?" The one you think of is someone you love.<br><br>Ask yourself another question and answer it honestly!<br>"When you are sad, which gal you want to share your burden with?"<br>The one you think of is also someone you love.<br><br>If you think of the same gal when you are happy sad, that's the most perfect.<br><br>But if you don't think of the same gal, I would advise you to chose the one you are willing to share your sadness with because in life, there are more sorrows than happiness. If you live your life happily, you can also enjoy it alone. In sadness, however, there are not many people willing to share your burden with you.<br><br>I hope the woman you think of, is your wife. Afterall, you didn't make the effort to stay in touch with the girl (neither did she) and in the end, you chose to marry your wife. It's something we should not live in regrets. I'll just take it that we are not destined to marry each other.<br><br>My mum once told me, to marry the man whom I cannot live without with, not whom I can live with.<br><br>Hope it helps.<br><br>Cheers!</span></div>

Chances are, you still love your wife, but somehow, your emotions are flowing all directions, which cease your ability to think, feel and understand.<br><br>And to think that you have lost your love for your wife to pursue what 'your heart seeks'... you will come to an understanding that in the end, your relationship with her will likely to fail because you realise that this woman isn't as perfect as you thought she would be when reality sinks in.

Your sense of responsibility stems from your values and upbringing. No one can answer that for you.<br><br><strong>Stop asking that question about responsibility. The moment when you declared your feelings to that new girl, you have already lost your sense of responsibility to your wife. </strong><br><br>A more important question right now is...<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">" Can I handle going against what the society demands. Society demands me to do something morally correct...can I ignore what the others will think about me?" </span></strong><br><br>If you really want to be with her, ask yourself how you are going to help her when she starts feeling all the pressure.<br><br>If you've made up your mind that she is the right one and you will do your best to help her along the way...my advice would be to take the risk<br><br><strong>The greatest risk in life is to not take any risk at all.</strong><br><br>Think about it.</div>

U are waiting for plp to justify ur feelings.. To give you the go ahead to choose your love rather than ur wife..<br><br>Whom to choose is not up to us to make the decison.. The decison lies in you. All we that we can do is to voice out our view.. Usually when we are blinded by this confusion, we are unable to see clearly for ourselves what we actually want..<br><br>What alot others had to say is true.. The grass is greener on the other side..<br><br>When 2 plp live tog everydae, there are bound to be alot of conflicts.. Be it how loving a couple may be.. Marriage is about commitment, to give and to take..<br><br>Wheneva there is conflicts.. And there happens to be a new source of love out there.. Most plp are tempted to try it out.. Doesn't it always happen with new love? In the beginning of each new r/s.. It is so called the Honey moon period.. Both partners are extremely sweet to each other.. Blinded by each other faults..<br><br>Onli when 2 plp start to get closer &amp; closer.. The love tat once blinded both are fading.. They starts to see each other faults..<br><br>Of coz when u mak a comparision.. The other party is bound to be beta in mani ways.. Why? Coz of the excitment of a new love.. And tat she is someone unattainable in the past.. It gives rise to the challenge.. And a boost to a guy's ego tat.. Hey.. She likes mi now!<br><br>It isn fair to both parties.. Your wife and your love.. Follow your heart.. Think and come to a decision.. Do you still love your wife? Who is it that u love more? For your love.. Is she reali the one that you love? Will you two be happy and that tis is reali the decision that you both want and won't regret?<br><br>I wish u all the best..</div>

Because you label her as your responsibility or "Will you encourage your children to cheat next time?" but I think these questions will be irrelevant because I am somewhat convinced that you'll choose your love.<br><br>It's Ok. Divorce cases are always on the rise. Adultery becomes a norm in this society. I have seen married man dating married woman in my office too. It became so common that noone raised their eyebrows anymore. So, I guess how society sees you is not much of a concern. What matters most to you now, I feel, is to find your true love and happiness (which we most likely can guess who will that be).<br><br>I am sure you know that courtship and living together is a totally different experience. I know of some couples who broke up after co-habitation and some who got married after that. Living together will reveal the little details of one another.<br><br>It's harder for girls to let go of relationships because we are more emotional. Just wondering if your love will throw away all emotional baggages of her previous marriage and sleep peacefully beside you, not thinking about him.<br><br>It's humans nature to look for greener pastures once their current situation seems boring,  uninteresting or dull. However, once they tasted the 'greener pastures', they may think the previous pastures are better. I was trying to say that we tend to take our partner for granted and not count our blessings.<br><br>It's a risk you're taking. Whatever your decision maybe, I sincerely hope you won't regret it in future. All of us want happiness.<br><br>Cheers!</span><br><br></blockquote></div>
