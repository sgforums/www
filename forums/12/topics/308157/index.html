              <p>just received a letter from a stupid company( i dun know should i say the name out). anyway this stupid company is my previous company that i worked in. asking mi to pay medical fees that i have used last year before i quit. i just discover something. my last day is 11.07.2007. meaning my resignation starts on 11.06.2007. One's month notice though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but the letter stating that i have to pay medical fees starting from 05.08.2007 to 06.06.2007. This is even before my one month notice lo. furthermore, the bill date is 16.02.2008, the due date is 17.02.2008 and you know something, there is this sentence that says:</p>
              <p><strong>If payment is not received by the due date as indicated in the bill, interest at 5.500% per annum will be imposed. </strong></p>
              <p>I just discovered on the envelope that this letter was mailed out only on the 18.02.2007. definitely the date would be overdue one wat. they are out to cheat me. When i quit and i collected my last two cheques, why is there no mention of this?</p>
              <p>the next course i took was to call my ex-colleague and inform of her the situation. She told me that this company has a reputation of doing this. They willl calculate the accounts and then if there is any loss, they will trace back and ask the ex-empolyee to pay for some ridiculous charges that was never mentioned before so that they can account to their department head.</p>
              <p>i mean if they really have any clause to prove that i have to pay for these, i will gladly pay without the interest. if they cannot prove to me, i will not pay a single cent. i mean i feel kind of cheated though. why do they not make any mention of this until like so months later? this is ridiculous though.</p>
              <p>the next course of action that i will take is to call the number indicated there and tell the person my stand on this matter.</p>
              <p>It's just ridiculous and stupid!</p>

              <p>but fight them in court will definitely cost money.  the sum is actually small though. they are a big corporAtion after all. think they know of this themselves and they dare the person in question to sue though.</p>
              <p>i mean like i thought that when a person quits the company, everything have to be caculated and settle already. but i never thought such a thing could happen though.</p>

              <p>just received a letter from a stupid company( i dun know should
              i say the name out). anyway this stupid company is my previous
              company that i worked in. asking mi to pay medical fees that i have
              used last year before i quit. i just discover something. my last
              day is 11.07.2007. meaning my resignation starts on 11.06.2007.
              One's month notice though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but the letter stating that i have to pay medical fees starting
              from 05.08.2007 to 06.06.2007. This is even before my one month
              notice lo. furthermore, the bill date is 16.02.2008, the due date
              is 17.02.2008 and you know something, there is this sentence that
              says:</p>
              <p><strong>If payment is not received by the due date as indicated
              in the bill, interest at 5.500% per annum will be
              imposed.</strong></p>
              <p>I just discovered on the envelope that this letter was mailed
              out only on the 18.02.2007. definitely the date would be overdue
              one wat. they are out to cheat me. When i quit and i collected my
              last two cheques, why is there no mention of this?</p>
              <p>the next course i took was to call my ex-colleague and inform of
              her the situation. She told me that this company has a reputation
              of doing this. They willl calculate the accounts and then if there
              is any loss, they will trace back and ask the ex-empolyee to pay
              for some ridiculous charges that was never mentioned before so that
              they can account to their department head.</p>
              <p>i mean if they really have any clause to prove that i have to
              pay for these, i will gladly pay without the interest. if they
              cannot prove to me, i will not pay a single cent. i mean i feel
              kind of cheated though. why do they not make any mention of this
              until like so months later? this is ridiculous though.</p>
              <p>the next course of action that i will take is to call the number
              indicated there and tell the person my stand on this matter.</p>
              <p>It's just ridiculous and stupid!</p>

              <p>actually very little only though. less than 50 bucks. i dun mind paying. i just dun like the fact that it was not pointed out earlier and that as if i dun want to pay for the debt (if indeed i have owned it) n also if i'm paying, i have to go down to their customer service centre specially just to pay off this debt. i have to take leave specially to go n pay off. i just tot that everything will be settled lo.</p>
