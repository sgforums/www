Her answer was 'no'. I want this thread to be a guide to all the guys here as not to make the same mistakes as me. I thought the courtship went flawlessly but I was wrong. I overlooked a very important factor.<br><br>Reasons?<br><br>She said that she still din noe me well enuff even though we knew each  other for close to a year. As in she din noe me well enough as a person to trust me. To her, I was always this mysterious guy whom she knew was caring and nice to her but she did not really find out my traits, good or bad thru our conversations. I was to blame. I was afraid of being labelled as a pest, those who chatted up gals every other day. So I made our conversations, online or real life, infrequent. I thought this would keep the feeling of mystery and that she would not be bored easily... Sometimes being too careful can kill bigger plans. She said that I wld hav been considered if i had made talked to her more.<br><br>Which brings into the picture another factor. There is another guy who also liked her since last year but he basically crapped to her alot. So he was in the game from the very start whereas I was always the mysterious shadow disappearing and reappearing in her life. And what really hurt was the fact that she told me jus noe that she had decided to giv tat guy a chance. In fact, they would be attached real soon.<br><br>I dun noe... Lost and forlorn I am... I should steer clear of her faculty for a while, I dun noe how I will feel seeing her hold hands with another guy. Its a terrible feeling.<br><br>But I asked her twice and that was it. I dun push. I am not a pushy guy. On no account does a gentleman force a gal to reply the way he wants. If I dun get it, so be it. It will hurt for me, but better me hurt than a friendship destroyed.<br><br>And to guys who think that simply because a gal has been accepting your gifts and smiles to you and such... Pls dun be mistaken... Alll gals are different... Each has her unique way of expressing her feelings. To her, my tokens were jus gifts of friendship. To think that a supposedly open minded person like me failed to read this. Ah, how one sided love blinds and conjures up beautiful mirages.<br><br>Yeah basically everything was perfect jus now. The beautiful evening sky, the brightly lit CBD area, the Esplanade waterfront... But all that was lost when her reply came.<br><br>Waht will I do? Well I will steer clear of relationships for a while, I need time to heal and feel human again, and most importantly I need to revaluate myself and figure out what went wrong. I will be a better person before I step into the love arena again.<br><br>Lat but not least, I would like to thank my friends who have been such a great help to me over the past few months...<br><br>1). FeowFeow - For ur mature and sensible advice, u hav always played the role of a big sister. I love ur gift ideas and thanks for recommending so many nice restaurants and cafes to me.<br><br>2). Mao x 2 - Especially last year, thanks for giving me advice thru PM.<br><br>3). Elektra - For always listening to my grouses. I miss the good old days of crapping<br><br>Plus PinkyGal76, LarrenV2003, DRX, Smudgey, Starpuppy, NekoRin and others... U guys are great... I love u ppl =)<br><br>In real life, I would like to thank Biquan, Melissa, Jookai, Jieying, Elektra, Rebecca, Aimei, Calvin, Ben and last but not least my jiu-gui buddy Jingyang<br>with all ur support and advices and ideas. Rest assured that I appreciate all of all of ur advice and help.<br></div></blockquote>hi Delta, im sorry for not being able to stay in contact wif u lately and have to learn about this here... time will heal u and im sure a good girl will come along soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i have had an ugly experience before and this incident really changed my perception of views about courtship. There was this girl i adore and i confessed to her. She stopped speaking to me after i confessed and 3 months later, came to tell me she doesnt like me. Can you imagine the kind of feeling to have waited for such a period of time? Anyway, things doesnt stop here. Continued to like her for another few months hoping that she will have a change of mind. Anyway those rejection words really shattered me especially when i waited for so long.  So because of this incident, i tend to give up easily when chasing girls, thinking that i might not be good enough for them or they are not interested in me...</div>
