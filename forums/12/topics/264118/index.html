When you are faced with life problems, you instinctively reach out for comfort and food as we all know can be comforting.<br><br>When you are hungry, you feel miserable and when food enters your mouth, you feel better immediately.<br><br>So when you feel stressed or miserable, you instinctively put something in your mouth (cig) to make yourself feel better (even though it is not hunger, it works!)<br><br>The human brain... haiz....<br><br>I would think that if you learn to be happy, contented and motivated in your life, you will have less of a need for cigs.<br><br>They other way of course is to find something to replace the cig when you feel stressed and miserable. Instead of taking out a smoke, you find someone that will let you hug until the stress and misery goes away.<br><br>hahahaha how to find some that will let you hug every time you feel stressed and miserable? That is why quiting is so difficult!<br><br>so... Get your "living" and "life" "act" together and find a replacement...<br><br>Unfortunately chewing gum and similar replacements do not have a kick like smoking cigs or hugging someone...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
