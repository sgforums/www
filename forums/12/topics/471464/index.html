            <div class='col-md body'><p>I know compared to people my problems are miniscule. But I had a girlfriend. She cheated on me and broke up with me a year ago for three months and we got back together after that. Things were going so great she practically lived with me. Suddenly she dropped 'you're too clingy and paranoid' on me. She told me she needed some time alone and I gave it to her. A day later when I was with her, I saw that she was talking sweet nothings with another guy. I loved her with all of my heart and took care of her and her family with everything I had. You guys don't know me and probably don't know what kind of a person I am. Im at least a 7 or 8 out of 10, I come from a good family, I'm not afraid to say it but I am funny, interesting and kind. But no matter how much effort I put in, i just get screwed over again and again. I need someone to help me through this tough times. I'm lost. Someone help me?</p></div>

              <p>qft. One man's meat is another man's poison. When time is right, have a heart to heart talk with her then take the next step from there. Maybe you two are just not meant to be. Just saying.</p>
