              <p>Bearie,</p>
              <p>This could also happen to guys, my ex gf was met somebody special to her when she was going out with me for 5 years, so she wanted to break up with me, said all sorts of nasty things at me, say I very poor, complain about my tardiness, say I don't know how to treat her nice and even say bad things about my family. Sometimes, we cannot generalise that guys do this kind of things, even some gals also do this kind of nasty thing. Same thing also happen to me, when she was going to marry, she wanted to make peace with me, call me up, but I didn't respond. BUt I have no regrets, it was for the best, what good use of meeting her anyway? She already ask for break up through the telephone and refuse to meet me.</p>
              <p>But happiness always find each of us in the end. I found my second gf, and she is not singaporean. Good thing, now I am more happier. So Bearie, you had a very sucky bf, he wanted to make peace and you were right to shit him back, serve him right. But now, is time to move on...find another new luv, learn to trust, open your heart and take risk.</p>
              <p>You see, me as a guy, when my ex hurt me like this, nobody cared, nobody bothered because it was a girl who did this to the guy. But you have support, because a guy did this to you. I had to go through the pain and recover myself. Always know this, there is always hope, so don't give up. Your ex bf don't deserve you, his new wife will suffer and shall soon see his true colors.</p>

              <p>ST, his ex and YY are just normal human being.</p>
              <p>Each one is allowed to chose his or her own path.</p>
              <p>ST is lucky to get YY as a new gf and wife. You can complain that ST is a bad guy I agree but at least he ended it rather then bluffing both gals.</p>
              <p>I have seen guys who had played 2 gals and dumping both.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His ex is not that lucky, she lost her bf and starts to hate all guys.</p>
              <p>I will not blame her for acting this way but I do recomand to her to let it go.</p>
              <p>I can feel the anger in her against guys but question is why did other guys did anything wrong to her? They are just normal people not  crazy people who will harm her.</p>
              <p>I too once was like her. I saw my ex sleeping with other guys which was hell for me but I chose to let it go as it is her choice. Is not easy at first, repeat  questions of what I did wrong keep floating in my head for months I keep torturing myself with self hurt. Hated all gals and wanted to keep away from them then 1 day I suddenly understand the truth.</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with me or my ex, is just her choice not mine, I did my best to love her with my heart but she did not feel that way. To really love someone is to let her go and decided to treat myself better and find someone better.   </p>
              <p>In the end I let her go and finally found a much better gal.</p>
              <p>Is up to the ex to decide her future, no one can force her to change her will or neither can I say her next bf will be better but at least if you truly love ST and herself is time to let it go and give herself a better life.</p>

              <p>guy is cruel to call back ex to demand a closure after mishandling breakup.</p>
              <p>just the luck of the ex to meet him.  take it as an experience.  maybe the next one will be better</p>
              <p>this is bad relationship management which is not uncommon because high EQ 
                  people are rare.  even in other aspects of life, you see how people 
                  get retrenched and treated poorly without any consideration of their 
                  feelings.  even managers and HR people suck in relationship management. it is painful and in some instances traumatic for the person who gets hurt.  we just have to make peace with it some how in order to move on.  it is for our own good.  don't let people who hurt you trap and make you miserable for life</p>

              <p><br>agreed .... ST ex-gf should be thankful that she didnt marry to ST and instead being bitter she should do start to move on, pamper herself, doll up and go party.</p>
              <p>being bitter abt a bad r/s dont bring u any good and when u realize that is time to move on you have wasted part of your youth grieving over things.</p>
              <p>tell ST ex-gf to be strong and move on, ST will just feel stronger if his ex- feel weak.</p>
