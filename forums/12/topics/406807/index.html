              <p>A guy, named ST working in the military research agency, who has been dating his gf for several months had a new female colleague at work. She was young, vivid, lively, bubbly and quite pretty and sociable. Being her mentor, the guy had the opportunities to work closely with her, and on some occasions, do OT.</p>
              <p>Within a month, ST started to drift away from his gf. He has been spending more time at work, and of course, with YY, sometimes having supper and long coversation with her after work. ST was attracted to YY and he feels that she is an very eligible and ideal lady for him. However, he is already attached. Soon, ST begin to see his gf in a poor light, picking on her, criticising her looks, and praising YY infront of her.</p>
              <p>Within weeks, ST was spending time away from his gf. He decided to break up with his gf so that he could be single and can woo YY. But his gf was heartbroken. In his attempt to dump his girlfriend (adruptly over the phone), he told her he never like her and was just desperate to find someone to be attached. He said he would never like her and asked her to find a man who truly loves her. He even commented that she is fat and unattractive to him, and he was just pretending to be a nice and dutiful bf to her. He dumped her over a phonecall, and did not make any attempt to meet her for a proper break-up or treat her respectfully. He scolded her over the phone and wanted a quick breakup. The girl was very hurted and tormented. She felt used and humiliated, that she was treated without much respect and sincerity. That the r/s was all but a ploy and that she was only a temporary gf to ST while he continues his search for his ideal gf.</p>
              <p>ST's ex girlfriend never hear from him again until months later, when ST called her out of the blue. ST called because he wanted a quick closure so that he can have the peace of mind and heart to start a brand-new happy r/s with YY. ST's ex girlfriend refused to speak to him and instead of offering his sincerest apologies, ST lambasted her and asked her to get a life and move on. ST made her feel even worse.</p>
              <p>It has been years and the ST's ex gf is still nursing over her emotional scars and feeling deeply hurted and humiliated. She doesnt believe in true love anymore and feels that she would never be treated sincerely and with respect. On the other hand, ST is enjoying his blossoming r/s with YY and is making quick plans for a marriage soon. All along, he has never feel guilty or remorseful for his action. He had never understand the real damage he has done to his ex-girlfriend but was happy he has made a firm decision to settle for YY instead. He never apologise. ST's ex girlfriend felt like an object, he never care for her feelings and dump her away like a junk, never taking into consideration her feelings and hurted her with awful and hurtful remarks to dump her.</p>
              <p>In case you wonder this is a fictional story, this is a true story.. ST might be your colleague. What do you tink of such a guy?</p>

              <p>Such a guy will never know what true love is. The ex shd really feel happy for herself because if this guy had remained, he would have been a hindrance in her quest for true love.</p>
              <p>Better to get hurt now than in married life later, with kids, property, car and all that. This hurt will only make the person stronger. It may take years to recover.....but as the saying goes: "Slowly but surely." She will get there.</p>

              would never like her and asked her to find a man who truly loves
              her. He even commented that she is fat and unattractive to him, and
              he was just pretending to be a nice and dutiful bf to her. He
              dumped her over a phonecall, and did not make any attempt to meet
              her for a proper break-up or treat her respectfully. He scolded her
              over the phone and wanted a quick breakup. The girl was very hurted
              and tormented. She felt used and humiliated, that she was treated
              without much respect and sincerity. That the r/s was all but a ploy
              and that she was only a temporary gf to ST while he continues his
              search for his ideal gf.</p>
              <p>ST's ex girlfriend never hear from him again until months later,
              when ST called her out of the blue. ST called because he wanted a
              quick closure so that he can have the peace of mind and heart to
              start a brand-new happy r/s with YY. ST's ex girlfriend refused to
              speak to him and instead of offering his sincerest apologies, ST
              lambasted her and asked her to get a life and move on. ST made her
              feel even worse.</p>
              <p>It has been years and the ST's ex gf is still nursing over her
              emotional scars and feeling deeply hurted and humiliated. She
              doesnt believe in true love anymore and feels that she would never
              be treated sincerely and with respect. On the other hand, ST is
              enjoying his blossoming r/s with YY and is making quick plans
              for a marriage soon. All along, he has never feel guilty or
              remorseful for his action. He had never understand the real damage
              he has done to his ex-girlfriend but was happy he has made a firm
              decision to settle for YY instead. He never apologise. ST's ex
              girlfriend felt like an object, he never care for her feelings and
              dump her away like a junk, never taking into consideration her
              feelings and hurted her with awful and hurtful remarks to dump
              her.</p>
              <p>In case you wonder this is a fictional story, this is a true
              story.. ST might be your colleague. What do you tink of such a
              guy?</p>

              <p>Of all the characters mentioned in his post, only 1 character is important to talk about, ie. the ST's ex-gf. She should not dwell on this r/s any longer and move on, to create the life she truly wants for her own happiness. The chain of events is a GOOD thing. It allowed her to know ST's true character, before their r/s progressed further.</p>
              <p>These few years is a crucial time for people to 'adjust' and balance their lives for the better. As far as relationships are concerned, people will naturally sway towards others of similar vibrational frequencies as them, by Law of Attraction. More positive people = higher vibrational frequencies. More negative people = lower vibrational frequencies.</p>
              <p>Married couples and attached couples especially will need to be aware of this, so that they can improve their 'inner selves' and resolve any conflicts well. Poor handling of such conflicts can lead to painful heartbreaks. For single persons, it's a good time, as it'll be easier for soul-mates (can be more than one) to appear in your lives. Use your heart and intuition to <strong>feel</strong> if people are your soul-mates. Don't continue to just use your eyes to see. Soul-mates are people in your soul groups, and have extremely similar vibrational frequencies, and so are naturally drawn to each other.</p>
              <p>Relationships between couples with very different vibrational frequencies will face a lot of difficulties and conflicts, as the difference in their mindsets and perception of life will become more and more pronounced in these few years. Relationships that are not based on unconditional love will be challenged to re-balance.</p>

              <p><br>So the girls would be better off in your company instead?</p>
              <p>How come I can read the sourish jealously in your posts and replies?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bad people are everywhere, you just haven't witnessed the girls who played with many guys' hearts.</p>
              <p>Actually such incidents happened to people is to allow them to learn how to cope, react and deal better in their future. Once they have found the way to solve it in their own ways, you can be sure that this kind of incidents will never happen again regardless which guys they are with in their future.</p>
              <p>Unlike Lions and Tigers, we are all born to be weak at birth. But because we have a bigger brain and strongest awareness than other stronger species, we know we have the ability to rule over all other species eventually, should we choose to do that. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
