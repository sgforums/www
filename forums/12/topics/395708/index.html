              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I just got to know this girl through 'picking-up'. i must admit i was sincere and her signal given initially was not negative at all. We msged abit and i helped her with some sch work online and she seems normal. but somehow in real life recently i notice that she start to avoid eye contact with me or even say hi, or purposely sit somewhere else in lecture and not her usual seat.</p>
              <p>Why is this happening? As mush as we got to know each and I want to say Hi and being friendly, somehow i believe she's trying to avoid me. But i notice one or twice she glance to look at me where im seating.</p>
              <p> Seriously i never did anything wrong to her. its weird, and why can't we hold a normal convo as friends in real life?</p>
              <p> before that i had some intention of adding her on msn. but judging on present state, i think i will not venture any further based on her negative signals.</p>
              <p>Does it mean she's doesn't have a good impression of me, or does she suspect i may lyk her and deliberately avoiding</p>
              <p>appreciate some opinions to this</p>
              <p>thanks</p>

              <p>lets put in straight - modern gals need no instruction to tell them who they desire to like or love...its in their bones to know who can give her the best security and instinctively...and her body language would have said it all...need we say it more? </p>
              <p>why do guys want to bother over women's minds? is it worth it? just ask them a simple question will do...if they have brothers who have the same relationship problem...how would they (if they have a human heart) advise their beloved and suffering brother under a stupid system like singapore that favours sluts? </p>
              <p>till now sluts fail to stand up for their own men or brothers but insisting and demanding more from them and such is the retribution back to their own  sons in the future...</p>
              <p>in short..brother boi ....sluts need not waste our brain cells which is better utilized on career advancement.....honey will be swooning like a flock of nuisance</p>
