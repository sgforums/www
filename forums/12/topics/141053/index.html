            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone is curious about things which are not seen everyday. Stuff like people fall down, people will crowd round to see, people quarrel a crowd will gather also. Its the culture in singapore which bought us up this way that we will somehow stare people with weird appreance or features, which is wad people call "kay poh"<br><br>In a relationship, you both are together because both of you have feelings for each other and wants to be with eachother all the time. Perhaps before both of you are together, you already know this kinda thing will happen yet you continue. Try to talk to your gf about this and tell her not to think too much about this. People have their mouth and they could say whatever they want, but at the end of the day, it only reflect how inconsiderate and disgustable attitude towards the society.<br><br>You cant grow shorter, she cant grow taller, tt's a fact no one can change. Treat it as a obstacle and try to overcome it. No one can help you, you have to overcome it with her yourself.</div>

But I wish to clarify that I don't mind at all. Because I am the one who initiate to start this relationship despite the fact that I know may meet with some obstacles regarding this height issue. My stance is very clear before and now. Height to me is no obstacle.<br><br>But the obstacle is the fact that seeing my gf hurt by those unruly comments, just break my heart. Stares, maybe I can still shield her. But hurtful words...stabs her heart. And seeing this, I just feel so much anger inside me towards those people.<br><br>Guess, I have to overcome it somehow.

Because I am the one who initiate to start this relationship despite the fact that I know may meet with some obstacles regarding this height issue. My stance is very clear before and now. Height to me is no obstacle.<br><br>But the obstacle is the fact that seeing my gf hurt by those unruly comments, just break my heart. Stares, maybe I can still shield her. But hurtful words...stabs her heart. And seeing this, I just feel so much anger inside me towards those people.<br><br>Guess, I have to overcome it somehow. Thanks. </div></blockquote>You need to have more communications with your gf. Talk about it, assure her. And if you can, joke about it?<br><br>Try to change your style of dress sense a bit so that you could look younger. Trust me on this one. Chances are.. It'll work....<br><br>Aunties... Uncles... Whatever... People often just have so much to say about each other... It's just a difference of whether you know it, or you don't....?<br><br>1. If you can, spend more time together away from the crowds..<br><br>2. Spend more time at places where couples are... Because they can understand that you're in love and shape and sizes don't matter...<br><br>3. Don't block her view from how people look at you all.. Instead, both of you can just look at each other and just smile it off.. In no time, you should both be getting used to it already...<br><br>4. Make more common friends together. Go out with them together and gain acceptance. In that way, it might just make your gf more comfortable with things...</div>

I love her deeply, but the problem is our height problems. You see, I am about 1.9m tall whereas she is about 1.6m. Now, for me, the height difference has never been any problems for me. I love her for whom she is. Even though she has some reservations about the height difference initially, I keep assuring her that it is of no issue at all. We have been going out for the past 6 months.<br><br>During these months, we have received stares from the people down the streets, obviously because of the height difference (and the fact that I look very mature, some have commented I look 30+ wheras she looks just her age). Many times, I have tried to camouflague her from this kind of discriminating 'stares'.<br><br>But two weeks ago, as we walked past a group of aunties, my gf heard one of them saying "Wah, this couple one so tall and the other so short..haha, like giant and the dwarf..and how come she is holding hands with this uncle?"<br><br>Obviously, my gf was so frustrated. I was angry too and wanted to confront them but calmed myself.<br><br>I mean..just because I am tall, just because I look more mature for my age, does that mean i have to be an uncle?? Just because we are of vast height difference, do people really have to hurt my gf so so much with all those senseless comments??<br><br>I know that if we love each other, we shouldnt be bothered by what people said as we live for ourselves. This is what we have been doing all this while. However, you simply can't ignore this fact nor escape the discriminating stares. No matter how hard we try to ignore these, it will hit you face on everyday.<br><br>Friends, sometimes I really lament on the society...but what can  we do? Think most probably nothing much..my heart pains when I see my gf's pain..<br><br></div></blockquote>hm... i think theres basically not much u can do with the society's opinion. Everyone have their views. I dun see the problem of tall and short as long as u love each other.<br><br>Just reassure ur gf and comfort her whenever shes feeling down. focus on love instead of height. As for the matured thing, i guess u can go for make over or dress differently.</div>
