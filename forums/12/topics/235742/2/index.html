Not those suka suka "I see you, I like you, I jio you, you ok, then become couple" jump into one and then all these things happen, then later start to blame this or that. Asking why cannot work or what.</div>

Izzit so you can have a GF? Or you want the feeling of loving and being loved? Or you wanna share your life with her?<br><br>When you know your reason for going into one, then the next thing you naturally will do is to get to know the gal well to see if she on the same page as you or not.</div>
