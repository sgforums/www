Y like this? Could anyone explain this to me?<br><br>My frenz didnt do anything wrong at all...y the gf out of the sudden no feelings..summore they hav been steading for nearly 2 yrs le...<br>Or iszit that the gals nowadays are inmature...nt understanding enuf?<br><br></div></blockquote>people come people go...<br><br>Not doing anything wrong doesn't mean the relationship will continue to bloom and sparkle fire as it is.. People do change over a period of time.. and there are many reasons out there for one to change...<br><br>She said that she has no feelings for him.. do you think this is just a sudden and impulsive decision by her?? i believe NO!<br><br>She might have tot it over a long period of time during her "so-called" projects.. and thinking of ways how to tell your guy friend about the breakup..<br><br>if one is determined to leave another.. there's no way that you can get her back.. things wont be the same again even if they were to get back together...<br><br>2 yrs for a relationship.. long not say very long.. short not say very short... but is the process of how this 2 yrs relationship is going thru..<br><br>some relationship can be as long as 5 years &amp; above and but in the end.. its still ended.. have you ever really thought of why it ended.. does it really matters of who left who first...??<br><br>your friend is jus a too NICE GUY! sometimes..a handsome.. nice.. charming.. pretty person.. doesn't confirm that he/she will have a lasting relationship or will be together forever that kind...<br><br>u may think that the girl is immature.. what about your friend?? u think he's mature enough??<br><br>This kind of issue is not up to us to decide whether he/she is being mature enough to handle such matters... Maturity doesn't goes with the age.. you see.. many adults who are much more older than u.. sometimes can't really handle your love issues well too.. So you think they are immature too??<br><br>people have different ways of handling their relationship problems.. some chooses to avoid.. some chooses to leave.. some chooses to stay and hope that things will change..<br><br>Stand by him when he needed you.. there's nothing you can do but just to lend a listening ear.. he has learnt his lesson.. this is bring him to the next level.. and hopefully he's enlightened by this..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
