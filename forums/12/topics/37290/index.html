            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=32092" rel="nofollow"><strong>I</strong></a><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>II</strong></span><br><br>The doorbell rang incessantly.<br><br>In my sleepy stupor, I mananged to put on a pair of boxers back to front before stumbling to the door to alleviate the offending party of their impatience.<br><br>"Hi Tim!" Her exuberance, however lively, failed to tickle any of my lulled senses.<br><br>"Chloe... er, good evening?" I was mildly irritated yet pleasantly surprised to see her.<br><br>"We're going to the party now. Why do you look like you're sleeping already?"<br><br>"Because I am!"<br><br>Fifteen minutes later, I was dragged out of the house because she grabbed my keys and threatened to drive herself there in my car if I didn't wanna come along. Best thing was, it wasn't a threat for I soon found myself shi[/i]ting my pants in the passenger seat. Usually I'm worried about how much it would cost me to repair my car should there be any mishap, but this time I wasn't. I was worried for my life! I muttered, "Next time you drive, please let me know. I'll tell my loved ones to stay away from the roads..." and was conveniently ignored.<br><br>She parked the car between two lots and tossed me the keys with a huge grin. I wasn't impressed at all. I got out of the passenger seat and wanted to re-park the car but she grabbed my arm and led me towards the crowd. I was livid. Jerking my arm away from her, I exclaimed, "Chloe, that was totally uncalled for. First, you storm into my place like the second coming, then you drive like a lunatic, then you park like a spastic, and now you wouldn't even let me park my car properly for you! And by the way, since when did I die and you made heir to my car?" I was sure I broke a blood vessel somewhere.<br><br>I had too sharp a tongue for my own good, but I was really upset with the whole situation, which included being rudely interrupted from my sleep. Why was I getting upset anyway. This is just so damn typical of her. I had forgotten, and the revival of this memory further infuriated me.<br><br>"I'm sorry." With that, she walked off toward the crowd, and I couldn't tell if she was angry, or sad. I would have been able to two years back, but not now.<br><br>I ran after her and pulled her back. "No, I'm not going to accept that. I want to know, right now, why you did that. What in this whole god-damn world compelled you to piss me off like no one else can?"<br><br>The last thing I was expecting was a tearful hug from her, and instincts commanded me to hug back. "I don't know bunny, maybe I just wanted to test if you are still the only person in this world that could love me just the way I am."<br><br>The peace I felt in her embrace nulled the booming sounds escaping the club, the giggles of passers-by and the blaring horn from the Subaru that we were blocking. I was so confused, for I knew that if anyone else in the world had put up the stunt she pulled before, I would have just left, and would probably never speak to them again. But here I was, feeling peace, of all things, to be holding someone that had betrayed me.<br><br>I led her back to the car gently, and grabbed a few sheets of Kleenex. "I'm really sorry," she continued sobbing, "I..."<br><br>I stood there silently.<br><br>"I just wanted to act as if I was still your little baby, that would be able to get away with anything. I don't know what came over me, bunny. I'm so sorry!" Thank goodness for my temperamental rhinitis, since that ensured a healthy stock of tissues in the car.<br><br>I wanted smack myself for feeling a deep desire to console her, to cheer her up, to protect her. I was fighting deep within myself, pride versus passion, resentment versus affection.<br><br>"Say something Tim!" Her face displayed a convoluted mix of fear, frustration and distress.<br><br>I hugged her, and closed my eyes. I felt her love, tainted with unfeigned, heartfelt regret. She felt mine too, enervated over time by pain. "Please forgive me. Please."<br><br>We stayed motionless for a long time. I was muted. I needed some time.</div>
