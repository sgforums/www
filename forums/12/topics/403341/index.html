              <p>here is my story.</p>
              <p>Many years ago ( 2002), i used to be in love with my poly schoolmate , lets call her Amy. I have hang ut with Amy a few times before and this Amy used to be an innocent gal . In fact i was the first guy she knew at the time. Things were normal and she had a good impression of me.. Then end of poly days, had to go to NS. Things went downhill</p>
              <p>Amy went to work while i am charging up the hill in Tekong with my rifle. During this time, Amy got exposed to outside world and has changed quite a lot to what we call materialistic woman. I was shocked , because i never ever thought that a gal like her will change so drastically to the opposite character. I didnt prepare for the worst and kept to myself too much thinking on how to just contact her in a positive scenario</p>
              <p>I knew this will come because the last few years, nothing been happening. I had a job but could not face AMY as she is a degree holder, and me just Poly cert.</p>
              <p>and this year, When i checked Amy's facebook, there were marriage photos of her , judging from the grand looking photos supposedly married to a well to do guy.</p>
              <p>I feel beaten and left for dead.  Now how do i face the world?</p>

              <p>Well that b|tch aint the right one for u. So what if u married her, she would make u spend lots of $$ on her every month. People always feel sad about not attaining a gal, but they dont think about what happens after that. Attaining something is easy, but maintaining it is another issue.</p>
              <p>TS, just move on. Take it as a good thing cos now u know that she is not interested in u. If she was she wouldn't have married that guy.</p>

              <p>There is so much pain in the world because Guys, when they meet a beautiful girl, will keep telling themselves "she's the special one. she's my one. i will spend the rest of my lives wooing her. i must marry her."<br><br>However, the brains of women are unfortunately not wired this way.</p>
              <p> a woman puts a man on a ladder in the first 10-20 mins of their encounter. , however, finding out out which ladder and how high  being puts on is hard though not impossible</p>
              <p>This ladder theory is not always correct though. it also depends on the woman and her character. Not all woman will want to go for rich handsome men. There will always be a handful who are not into such things</p>
              <p>Does tell us one thing  - NS is disruptive to our lives. I have heard many stories similar to TS one  and some gfs left guys because of NS issue</p>
              <p>Maybe TS would had a better chance if he went on to do uni along with her. At least She would have an impression of him and know about his ongoing plans to achieve in life..</p>

              <p><br>C'mon lah TS, a person still in school has not seen the world as it is yet, hence students being naive etc. It is only when one steps out from school into the world does one "grow up". She has grown in a direction you would not want. But it's her choice.....</p>
              <p>Move on..... she may have been a plum target but she won't be your only target.</p>
              <p>There's no necessity to hate her but you should count yourself lucky not being with her now that you know her shitty character.</p>
              <p>Who knows if you might meet someone better.....?</p>

              <p>or did they just hang out, talk some rubbish, share a few laughs?</p>
              <p>after that, he went to NS... he didn't even have the cajones to go ask her to be his girlfriend...</p>

              <p>What i mean is the natural order of love is being disrupted by NS.In other countries many people fall in love in high school. so the term "high school sweetheart". When leaving final year, ppl know their priorities in life...</p>
              <p>the period of our lives when ppl are least corrupt and innocent and a chance toknow the person as his/her real self. When Such a thing called NS come in. its disrupted. many of u here will agree with me, especially men and some ladies too..</p>

              <p>Society is also to be blamed. The current state of things in Singapore and how its being run also plays a huge part in marriage and birth rates, do u agree.</p>
              <p>How did the GCP phenomenon came about then?</p>
              <p>In the past as recent as in the 1990s, women did not think much about financial asset when choosing a guy, they chose according to their heart. But now, can the same thing be said?</p>
              <p>There has been research showing that females choose their partner according to the environment they are in. So blame the environment</p>
