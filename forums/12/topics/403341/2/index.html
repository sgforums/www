              <p>Society is also to be blamed. The current state of things in Singapore and how its being run also plays a huge part in marriage and birth rates, do u agree.</p>
              <p>How did the GCP phenomenon came about then?</p>
              <p>In the past as recent as in the 1990s, women did not think much about financial asset when choosing a guy, they chose according to their heart. But now, can the same thing be said?</p>
              <p>There has been research showing that females choose their partner according to the environment they are in. So blame the environment</p>

              <p>you can quote as many "studies" as you want, but if the TS can't be fucked to make the effort to go after her, he doesn't deserve her...</p>
              <p>and if she moves on after his total lack of activity to get her, she doesn't suddenly turn into a "materalistic girl".. she's just moving on with her life...</p>
              <p>TS just obsessing and rationalising over her is just sour grapes...</p>

              <p>here is my story.</p>
              <p>Many years ago ( 2002), i used to be in love with my poly
              schoolmate , lets call her Amy. I have hang ut with Amy a few times
              before and this Amy used to be an innocent gal . In fact i was the
              first guy she knew at the time. Things were normal and she had a
              good impression of me.. Then end of poly days, had to go to NS.
              Things went downhill</p>
              <p>Amy went to work while i am charging up the hill in Tekong with
              my rifle. During this time, Amy got exposed to outside world and
              has changed quite a lot to what we call materialistic woman. I was
              shocked , because i never ever thought that a gal like her will
              change so drastically to the opposite character. I didnt prepare
              for the worst and kept to myself too much thinking on how to just
              contact her in a positive scenario</p>
              <p>I knew this will come because the last few years, nothing been
              happening. I had a job but could not face AMY as she is a degree
              holder, and me just Poly cert.</p>

              <p>It is very common. </p>
              <p>Your ex-gf has gained maturity when she go out to work. Usually the poly relationship is taken to be a play game. And since you have not maintained contact and her  personality has changed, is sometime you cannot accept then so be it!. </p>
              <p>Since you have been delayed for 2 years. It does not mean that you will not get a degree cert later on. So the part of being inferior that she is a degree holder you being a poly holder does not exist at all </p>
              <p>She probably think, it is over between you two so she start a new. And since there is not much contact with her she also do not contact you loh. </p>

              good impression of me.. Then end of poly days, had to go to NS.
              Things went downhill</p>
              <p>Amy went to work while i am charging up the hill in Tekong with
              my rifle. During this time, Amy got exposed to outside world and
              has changed quite a lot to what we call materialistic woman. I was
              shocked , because i never ever thought that a gal like her will
              change so drastically to the opposite character. I didnt prepare
              for the worst and kept to myself too much thinking on how to just
              contact her in a positive scenario</p>

              <p>You were in love with her. But she wasn't in love with you. i hope she's in love with her husband not his wealth.</p>
              <p>Forget her and start approaching other girls. The world doesn't give a damn how you face them. Stop having self pity, you are not beaten and left for dead. Get over it and get on with your life.</p>
