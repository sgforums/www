This is a very saddening news for me to read.<br><br>However, I suggest you sit down with her and talk things over. But, PLEASE.. don't express your feelings out too much... why? Danger!! In that way, you make yourself sound like a Wuss trying to kiss her arse. Girls don't like guys to chase them around kissing their arse proving their weak side in front of them. Just go and find out what's the matter first.<br><br>I hereby wish you all the best of hope!<br><br>yours truly,<br>S.H.I.N.</div>

Initially when we were together, everything was like in honeymoon...treats mi well...wif respect and all. BUT as time goes by, she started to take me for granted...always venting her anger on mi.

No offence, but the only scenarios where I think a guy needs to "book" a girl in advance is when he's chasing her, or the guy is a customer in Geylang.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I still suggest him to trash it out with his gf. It may turn out that she doesnt mean to say what everyone interpreted it as but it may. So its still his decision what to do after trashing out with his gf.<br><br>The fact that pple like to interpret others action or words using their own standards is the basis for misunderstandings.</div>
