She's climbing all over your head and shitting on you and you're letting her do it. Forgive me for saying this, but does she have to be chio in order for you to like/love her? Like you said, it started off well, but now you're getting stepped upon like roadkill. She's being really selfish and possessive, are you sure she is not a he? Then again, do check if on the days she starts shouting at you, it's her time of the month.<br><br>My advice is that you break it off with her, there are so many other chio fishes out there in the ocean, this one is really not worth being degraded and disrespected over.<br><br>Oh and when you break up with her, make sure you do it in really loud in a public place or with her friends to embarass the hell out of her, perhaps then, she might think differently of you.
