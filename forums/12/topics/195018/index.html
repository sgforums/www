            <div class='col-md body'>You go ice-skating with your friends and girlfriend 1 day but you've never skated before and she has not skated in a long time. But at the rink, you slowly learn how to skate on your own without a friend's support even though you are still quite unstable and wobbly. She is still holding on to the railings at the sidelines and you offer to support her and bring her out to the open to skate with the rest. But she refuses and reply by saying that she would rather rely on her other friends than me, seeing how unstable I am.<br><br>Can this small example translate into your girlfriend not wanting to go through thick and thin with you in life? Does that mean she is not willing to take the risk and share your pain and joy? Does that mean her love for you is not strong enough that she is not willing to place her trust and possibly even her life in your hands?<br><br>All comments and opinions are open.</div>

It depends on her tone when she said that too. Is she stuck on this relationship with you? Or Is she unhappy with something about you?

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup a small incident can reveal alot about someone's personality &amp; his/her inherent trust towards u...<br><br>I can understd ur dismay over reaction.... have a better suggestion, y dun u go &amp; learn how to skate better, and u can then be in a better position to guide her.<br><br>A similar incident actually occured to me when i was a teenager 7-8 years ago.... a gal i liked was the reason i decided to learn ice-skating so i could hold her hands. I paid for a month long of beginner class &amp; started my hobby of ice-skating...<br><br>Althou i lost contact with her soon after &amp; never got to hold her hands, but i mastered a sport in the process. And this skill will still come in handy as i hope for the day where i can hold the hands of the one i love &amp; skate freely ...<br><br>Good luck to u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
