              <p>I have a problem with my weight. Well the years, my waist have increased from 29 to 36 inch. I still weight 85kg. I feel very uncomfortable when I sit in the crowded MRT because of my bulging tummy. I also have a problem getting dates. Do women like fatboy like me? Is physical appearance important?</p>

              <p>4) Go to Orthodopedic doctor, confirm not slip disc but ligament tear. Doctor prescribe anti inflammation drugs. Taken for 3 months after that doctor advice not to take anymore because of side effect (can cause stomach ulcer)</p>
              <p>5) Doctor give patches, can sleep at night but very expensive, one patch with 6 satchet cost SGD8. But still got injury and pain.</p>
              <p>6) Go to physiotherapist, suggest back and leg stretches. Do for 4 months, but no result, even worse, aggravate back pain.</p>
              <p>7) Try to fast and cut back on carbo but when working feel very sleepy and tired. Tempted to eat more.</p>
              <p>8) Try to go for 10km run. Run 2km, die oledi. No breath left. Back pain like hell.</p>
              <p>9) Try to play beach football, show off in front of girls. But panting like hell, then suffer back pain for another 3 weeks, cannot walk after that.</p>
              <p>10) Try to ask for dating. Cannot hit first base, is it because I am fat?</p>

              <p>(y) ahh! aqua jogging - used it while i was nursing a knee injury..</p>
              <p>very beneficial, helps you works up a sweat (it's really quite an intense workout) - when you get back to land, you will then feel the strain and the tightness which is normal. </p>
              <p>It helps you tones your body too... </p>
              <p>It works on the basis of 2 pressures (water and air) thus getting your heart to pump like it's exercising while you are jogging/running</p>
              <p>for a shallow pool, it will be harder on the knees, still less straneous than running.</p>
              <p>for running in a deeper pool, you would need a flotation belt and shoes (optional)</p>

              <p>fasting wont help u lose weight, instead the body just clings on to the fat stubbornly while what u lose will be water and muscle [dangerous]</p>
              <p>u should continue having carbs [complex ones like fruits, vegetables (including potato, but no fried stuff), millet] simple/refined carbs like white bread, white rice, sugar and so on promote fat storage and should be minimised, and have more protein intake [esp soy protein] in place of simple carbs, works better that way.</p>
              <p>increase water intake daily to 'handle' the food that goes into your body, given TS's weight he should be drinking 4.25L [bodymass/2 * 100] daily.. even if fats were lost, try to keep intake to at least 4L [can include supplemental teas, but not beverages like coffee, tea, soft drinks, sugar-rich drinks and such].</p>
              <p>exercise wise, i believe kenneth has elaborated on what u can do.</p>
              <p>if u really find counting calories a chore, try your best to stick to natural foods, avoid processed stuff and fat-rich/oily/fried stuff and consume more of fruits/veges/lean protein. having a range of vitamins and such is important besides taking in energy sources, namely carbo, protein, fat. last but not least, take everything in moderation. u will see the result.. u can try herbalife too, it really helps u provided u follow the instructions and advice given.</p>

              <p><br>no lah, if you are rich, you can have any girl, but no real love, only money minded gal, it is all up to you, want to be rich or slim, fat and rich also die earlier, slim and poor somehow, tend to live longer, take your pick.</p>
              <p>Running is like this, first, run 10 lamposts, then go sauna to warm down the muscle, if not tomorrow, very pain, after 2 day rest, go for 12 lampost, then everyday run, from 12 lampost slowly to 50 lampost...once your reach 50 lampost, go weight yourself, if you still remain fat, most likely it will be your diet. Do not cut down on meat, just cut down on your sugar intake, it takes exercises and a discipline mouth of yours to slim down ya</p>
