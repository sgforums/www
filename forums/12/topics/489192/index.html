              <p>hanging out during weekends is a thing of the yesteryears, when people have nothing to do at home, too bored that they need to go out</p>

              <p>who need friends mannn...i rather stay comfortably at home rather than go out and squeeze with the crowd and risk catching some contagious disease</p>
              <p>but singapore tv shows variety are really limited, so limited channels, unlike when u go overseas there are 100 over channels in the hotels tv</p>

              <p>it's ok if you are happy about this. </p>
              <p>of course i still do advise that you reach out to some hobbies that requires some form of human interaction. it's overall healthier both mentally and physically when you go outside and meet new people. progress at a gradual pace and feel free to go home back and do your solitary activities at any point of time you feel uncomfortable.</p>
              <p>i used to be like this but i learnt to socialise with new people and it is more enriching than i thought.</p>
              <p> </p>

              I guess this is growing up? We don't see our friends as often anymore because everyone has their own lives to get on with.
              
              I am comfortable at home lazing around too :-) but yeah I'm sure you can just call up a few friends to meet up for a quick meal or drink. Social interaction is important so don't cope yourself at home too much!!

              <p>You are an introvert and that is normal for introverts.</p>
              <p>Introverts are special. They love having friends but they are easily overwhelmed by other's emotion. Hence, they resort to forums and socmeds. They can have friends without any physical activities associated, hence they feel more comfortable this way without being overwhelmed by the many emotions. It is also easy to escape from conflicts. After all, introverts recover their energy by enjoying private time.</p>
              <p>They hate conflicts, and deep inside they realise physical activities with others might cause conflicts, therefore they avoid it. As a result, they might not talk much during physical encounter, but if they chat with the same person through text, forum or chat, they are very talkative, much to their friend's amazement.</p>
              <p>But being an introvert does not equal to having no real friends.</p>
              <p>Being an introvert = having few friends with a very deep bond.</p>
              <p>Introverts choose their friend selectively, including their loved one. Not just any person can be considered as a friend by introvert, and likewise not any good looking person can make them fall in love.</p>
              <p>They also rank their friends, 1st rank, 2nd rank, 3rd ranks. And they enjoy being with the 1st ranks the most and would sacrifice their time for the 1st ranks. And they do not need to be alone to recover their energy, being together with the 1st ranks also recovers their energy.</p>
              <p>I think you just haven't found your 1st ranks. It is hard to find. It is our (introvert's) gift, we might hard to find a good friend, but once we found it, it will be lifetime.</p>
              <p>Even when you hang out with someone every day, you might never think of that person as a best friend or 1st rank. But someone who rarely meets you can be your 1st rank if you feel compatible with him/her. You don't need to have similarities, you don't know the reason but you want to be his/her friend, and usually the others would feel the same towards you. (another gift).</p>
              <p>Once you find your 1st rank, you will go as far as sacrificing the last episode of your anime to be with your 1st ranks.</p>
              <p>Btw, your life is not bad by being alone if you enjoy it. Try to read this book:  <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quiet: The power of introverts in the world that can't stop talking - Susan Caine </strong></span></em>you;ll begin to understand :)</p>
