            <div class='col-md body'>I didn't want to post this because I know some of my classmates come to Sgforums too. But I really need to let it out so here goes...<br><br>Remember that Kendo guy? I dun understand why he just can't let it go. Its already been almost 5 weeks since that incident and he still not happy like that.<br><br>Firstly, he's been talking about me to the others. Talking good or bad I dunno. But confirm is bad lah. One of classmate told me that and I even heard it myself. That day, I heard something like "I feel like slapping him you know!"<br><br>Okay next, there was one day, I was walking with the class. I usually avoid walking with the class as an introvert and because of that guy. I was joking and laming loudly with the others infront. And guess what, that guy was signalling to another guy in the class by punching his palm.<br><br>Next, about 3 weeks ago we were in class. We were asked to go to the whiteboard to write our answers. In the end, all the answers wrong except mine. Then that guy like not happy like that, face black black, even protest to the teacher. Luckily one of friends shouted out "CORRECT LAH!" The teacher also agreed correct.<br><br>Today, we in class again. We were asked to show our answers on OHP. Then I showed mine. Then mine copied from the net what so the words very PRO mah...so the teacher ask me issit get from somewhere de, I say yes. Then at the background I heard that guy saying "See told you he copy one." Nevermind, I smiled, its not easy to make me angry you see.<br><br>Then his turn to present, after presenting, the teacher say his one, one of them out of point. then said another one got mistake, ask who can spot.<br><br>Then I told the teacher Grammar mistake and even told the teacher where. Actually got 2 mistake one lah but I say one nia... His face so black liao...<br><br>He is those very serious people lor. I know even before that incident he already identify me as very nonsentical person lor because I keep talking rubbish lor. Before the incident, I heard him say before, "What he says is like spam to my ears." I also never angry lor. Then on the day the incident happened, before it happened, he was siting on the floor on a corner revising or something, his stick was there, I walked past and he said "Dun touch my stick." I also never comment lor, like I want to touch meh... I wasn't even going to.<br><br>Dun understand what he wants lor, cannot except me to feel remorse all the time or wat wat, confirm act like nothing happen mah. If its about the honour of his stick then I feel he is doing more harm to his own honour lor. I never even badmouth him lor, at the most I say he petty nia... Its a fact. I can treat as nothing happen but he like so affected by that incident like that.<br><br>I think there's more then meets the eye, what do you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you ask me again, I think the kendo guy has achieved one thing.  He has got your attention.  And he's got so much of it, you're here telling us about it.  You get what I mean?  You're the one who's obsessed with him.<br><br>Just ignore him, everything you're gonna do, he will just pop up somewhere.  Before you sleep at night, he will be the last thing to cross your mind.  Everytime you take a shower, you're wondering how to get back at him no matter how you tell us you're not.  He's in your subconcious.  Game over, he wins.</div>
