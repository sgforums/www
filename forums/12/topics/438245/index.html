              See, I am stucked somewhat between my love life and my career and my family... I am attached already but recently got some girls keep sending me mushy stuff and I accepted one of them as my gf (so now I become two timer - but no physical and don't intend to - and yah she's pretty since got other guys after her)
              
              Problem is my career still sucky (haven't reach my goals yet so r/s is a distraction, not to mention having more than 1 r/s is a disaster especially if someone found out)... Then I need to take care of my family, spend time with them... and then my other gf... I scared I will end up hurting somebody but I keep telling them to go for other guys if they want (even to my gf of coz i genna scolded by her)
              
              Personally I just want to lock up myself and don't go out and then concentrate on doing my work - yes i am workaholic and that compounded problems since i am more interested in work than girls at the moment... once i reach my goals than i would go into r/s otherwise no peace because i can go dating and for example have more than 10 calls from clients... i feel better in r/s when nobody disturb... and no i cannot stop clients from contacting me since it's a family biz and i dun wanna destroy the reputation.
              
              i want to break up but also don't want to hurt them and want to remain platonic friends. Any idea how to ask them to be just friends? And no, I never have sex with them and seriously I don't intend to. Last time even in a room with naked girl but i also never have sex ... it sounds gay for a guy to turn down sex, but whatever... 
              
              If it was you, will you choose family? career? r/s? Assuming your family wasn't nice to you before, so it wasn't a close family, just a normal type of family with quarrels and stuff. Obviously if it's a close family, i will choose family first... but since not close, then it's a close call between the 3...

              <p>You have a clear objective of what you want. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> Not many people are able to think clearly. Personally bring them out for dinner, and discuss this nicely and explain that you are putting your career as priority. If they love you, they will stick with you for as long as you accomplish your objective. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>Career and Relationship can mutually complement each other, you just need to find the right way. It seems like the current relationship with your girlfriend is stopping you reaching your goals. I would say... tell your girlfriend about this and ask her to be more understanding. For guys, career is very important.</p>

              <p>IMHO - priority right now would be to sort out my r/s. If you continue the way you are, both of them will end up hurt (isn't this like the show on Channel 8?!).</p>
              <p>I think the ultimate balance between r/s, career and family comes down to priorities. Yes, the ideal situation would be all 3, but the fact is that when some issues arise, one has to prioritise. This varies from person to person and situations.</p>
              <p>As mentioned, discuss your career commitments with your partner to avoid misunderstandings. Try and spend time with family too......perhaps doing stuff with your gf and family at the same time if that is possible.</p>

              Well, I do have a preferred option but being the rationale person, the reason I post wasn't to get someone to support my option in fact I don't think I stated my preferred option. I do want to know what are the possible arguments for and against in my choices and some smart people here may provide something i never thought of. It's like wanting to buy for example an iPhone and then came here to start a thread accordingly on the iPhone, only to realize that iPhone sucks bigtime and hence lucky not to follow with that purchase. 
              
              The objective of the thread wasn't really to get instructions from strangers to do certain things, but more of understanding better my options and making a wiser choice in the process.
              
              I am sure people thought of something I never thought of and I think even with IQ 150, there will be people who are smarter in terms of EQ and SQ to learn from? EQ is emotional quotient and SQ is social quotient.
              
              I am afraid to hurt girls feelings, seeing them cry etc. Yet, I scared to lose the r/s maybe i am feeling insecure? alot of things going through my mind so i dunno what to do. i'm still laying down my options maybe there is a perfect solution to everything. I see guys having mistress is very common nowadays? I mean my friends all playboy... not that i have to follow their footsteps... one of them even have like 6 girlfriends and he keep bragging to me until the friendship gone coz i dun enjoy the way he toy with girls feelings...

              <p>don't worry about having to give a reason for your post/thread.</p>
              <p>if what u say about not wanting to hurt others is true, then you ought to know what you're doing. If u chose to do something against your own values just so that u can keep up with your friends, then be prepared that others will not see the same reasoning.</p>
