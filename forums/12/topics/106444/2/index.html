If we don't see you as fat in the first place, how does becoming thinner makes you more attractive to us?

Anyway usually only skinny guys have a waist of 28-29 so girl with waist of 26-27 still ok what.</div>

I feel those are the main reasons why people overeat and put on weight. Your stomach only realize its full after some time(abt 20mins) so try to drag the mealtime abit if you can. And eat until you don't feel hungry don't just blindly stuff yourself(especially during buffets). I take a wide varieties of food during buffets but in small portion and I only take another helping if I am certain I can finish it. Personally I hate feeling bloated and I rather take my time to enjoy my food.</div>
