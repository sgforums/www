AhhHhH~~~~!!!<br><br>Beauty salons .. i dont think they are open for guys .. and guys dont patronize them too ..<br><br>So i keep looking for ways to trim it down .. so i learnt that ..<br>The CONFIRM + GUARANTEE + CHOP ,  Sure WORK method to lose all those fat one go ... is to... CUT THEM OUT !!<br><br>Take them outta yr body once &amp; for all !!<br><br>&amp; here is where liposuction &amp; abdominoplasty comes in ..<br><br>I think these methods u SURE will have results .. since u are taking the fats out of you ..<br><br>Only thing is they are very expensive ...  few thousand dollars for the surgery fee . But i think if u go to a beauty salon u will spend maybe thousand plus dollars and achieve only minor results ..<br><br>I rather spend a bit more to achieve major ones lo . Bad thing about it is .. u will have some scarring .<br><br>No weight loss programs can guarantee results forever la .. But i think taking all yr fat away at one go .. it sure will take hell long for them to regenerate again .<br><br>And i found out that if u go to do these surgical procedures in countries like Thailand , the costs will be much cheaper than doing it in Singapore .<br><br>I know girls wont like scarring la .. but if u have tried every available way to slim down and still cant .. This can prove to be a last resort &amp; desperate measure lo .<br><br>And i want to try it out too .. But i need to save up $$ . Pls hope for me that i save enough and can get rid of this spare tyre for good . Like that i can have more confidence to fit in clothes , and be more comfortable with my friends &amp; gf lo .<br><br></div>

You can either steam or boil your meals(home made) that's already good for you.<br><br>If you are hungry at night or in between lunch or dinner, try to eat fruits eg. apple, oranges, bananas that will do.  If you go out for an outing, you can also bring along some healthy snacks or sandwiches for yourself rather than starving yourself the whole day and if you starve yourself all the time, this might affect your daily health and the way you perform at work too.<br><br>It's the way we eat affect our way of thinking and affect our performance in the office etc.  So be careful of what you eat, always focus on fruits and vegies and a well balance diet.<br><br>Well you have to start now try to eat something healthy during your meals..<br>OK enough of this I hope my tips help you alot, have a healthy lifestyle day.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't really like the idea of eating pills to get slim down. Cos probably there will be side-effects. Like the slim 10 case... eat till she suffered from liver problem. It's like risking life to slim down. So I suggest u to try out some practical ways like jogging, standing up straight at all times(tummy in chest out), eat lesser for dinner, lesser junk food, or go on a diet. Diet means eat less, not skip meals. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> But I have this friend of mine who drinks this particular slimming tea, she slims down her TUMMY after sometime. I asked her if she has any side effects like feeling thristy or having migrain or something, she said no. So maybe u can try out slimming tea. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Confusion,<br><br>In order to lose body weight, u must take in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lesser calories than the total calories that ur body nid daily</span>....... but i think it should not b lesser than 1500 calories for it to remain healthy....... Try eating less cabo such as rice and eat more vegs n fruits...... Drinking water oso helps to keep u full...... On the whole to keep a healthy diet, u should oso try to avoid fried n oily food n take more boiled n steamed food instead......<br><br>However, diet alone is not an advisable way to keep ur waistline at bay...... u mus couple it with exercise which thankfully, u r already doing a lot of it........ Overall, aerobic exercises such as running and skipping helps u lose weight by raising ur metabolism for the day...... There's no such thing such as spot-reduction...... such as losing ur tummy only...... u can only try to lose ur overall weight n hopefully reduce ur waistline too..........<br><br>N never never sleep after taking a heavy meal........ it cause the tummy to form........ ay i was too ignorant when young....... n now hav a hard time losing it..........<br><br>Dun believe in the slimming pills.... they r not natural products....... Who noes wat might happen if u take them? Surely, u dun wan a repeat of the Slim 10 incident? Choy.......<br><br>So do try to lose weight naturally....... Ur perservance will do the trick...... Wish u all the best in ur attempt to keep a perfect waistline ok? Cheers</div>

But HOR they will know how to comment on their respective pals that...this and that gal looks fat!<br>Seriously, I don't think they know how a gal look like with a 30 inch waist. Basically they will look like (thinking a celebrity) ...maybe like Irene (Rosie in Phua Chu Kang?) or somewhere near that!<br><br>Yah...to some an acceptable is about 26 inche.<br>I know the feeling at the waist line that you had. I used to be like that in Sec school...aout 27-29 inches. Plus the tummy factor.<br><br>*groan*. How I wish I was back to the figure that I had (w/o much tummy) 4 yrs back!!!! I don't think I can ever reach that anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone has different metabolism rate.<br>Some have very high and some have very low.<br>Some can eat the same amt as their fren but they still put on weight (there was a documentary shown few yrs back on this).<br><br>It's just cutting calories intake. You must first know what's ur metabolism is. Don't ask mi how to find that out cos I don't. That's why I am stil the same as I am.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  Though I complain non-stop that I am putting on weight and have a tummy --&gt; which is true...cny is a bad season...put on 2kg+ and can't lose it at all...that 2kg goes only to the tummy!!!!<br><br>So...find that out.<br><br>Dieting don't help 100%. U need to do some exercise such as simple crunches, side sit-ups (this helps in the curvature of the waist and hips), etc.<br>Best of luck!</div>
