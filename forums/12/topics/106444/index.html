I can't stand girls who are obssessed with losing weight just to look good. Believe me, once you get into the trap of losing weight, it's hard to break out of the vicious cycle. No matter how much weight you lose, you'll keep thinking that it's not enough.<br><br>One of my men lost nearly 30 kg during BMT and its aftermath. Yet he keeps insisting that he's fat (his BMI is 21.5...... perfectly normal) and keeps burning his meagre NSF pay on those stupid diet pills endorsed by those bimbotic MediaCorp stars (flame me all you want..... I'll still utterly condemn those bloody pills and the people who endorse them).<br><br>Anyway, you yourself said that your friends are ok with your appearance. So what's the problem?!?!?!<br><br>What's your height and weight? Do tell us so that we can give a more well-informed piece of advice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, seriously. I don't see a problem.<br><br>If you look good to your friends, and you feel that you're still fat... Its all in the mind girl. After all, you don't expose your waist to everyone right? (Unless of course, you're one of those who wear exposing shirts and all).<br><br>In fact, there's this stupid belief in many girls i've talked to, that they're fat. Its really ridiculous, because they do not, and are definately not fat. They then try to waste lots of $$ trying to slim down, when there's nothing to!<br><br>Besides, men aren't looking for perfectly thin women, some fats in the right places are good.<br><br>Just know that if you've tried your best, and it still doesn't work, and its not a problem to anyone but yourself, you should probably move on~!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sit ups alone don't help in reducing fats. you have to do exercises like jogging, swimming, brisk-walking for at least half an hour.<br>Also, as much as you do situps, don't forget to exercise your back to balance out. A strong back will improve posture. Sometimes the tummy is because of the slouch you have. Stand up straight and maybe the 'tummy' will disappear.<br><br>Sucking in also helps strengthen the traverse muscles. Traverse muscles are core muscles which is also vital for good posture.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey... i used to be really fat, but i lost 16 kg in 3 months.... haha<br><br>blame track n field training<br><br>anyway, just go running/swimming more often to raise your metabolism (one misconception is that running BURNS off lots of calories, meaning you can pig out. that's false, a 3km run would burn around 300 calories, equivalent to a bowl of maggee mee, which isn't really worht the effort.) however, aerobic exercise helps you raise your metabolism, meaning that even after working out, you burn more calories while at rest.<br><br>diet- never skip breakfast. try to eat less for dinner, and never snack or have supper after 8pm. the idea being, u eat earlier in the day, your body burns it off while you go around doing your thing. eat too close to the night, all the energy released by the food is unused while you sleep, and gets stored as fat.<br><br>personal reccommendation- pick up a sport. running after a ball is more exciting than just running aimlessly, thus is less mentally demanding. in fact, you might even find it enjoyable if you are sporty.</div>

I don't see a problem.<br><br>If you look good to your friends, and you feel that you're still fat... Its all in the mind girl. After all, you don't expose your waist to everyone right? (Unless of course, you're one of those who wear exposing shirts and all).<br><br>In fact, there's this stupid belief in many girls i've talked to, that they're fat. Its really ridiculous, because they do not, and are definately not fat. They then try to waste lots of $$ trying to slim down, when there's nothing to!<br><br>Besides, men aren't looking for perfectly thin women, some fats in the right places are good.<br><br>Just know that if you've tried your best, and it still doesn't work, and its not a problem to anyone but yourself, you should probably move on~!</div></blockquote>no no no... i dun wanna look thin... i just wan to look a bit more proportionate? dunno if tt's thw eord.. but u noe wad i mean...</div>

I can't stand girls who are obssessed with losing weight just to look good. Believe me, once you get into the trap of losing weight, it's hard to break out of the vicious cycle. No matter how much weight you lose, you'll keep thinking that it's not enough.<br><br>One of my men lost nearly 30 kg during BMT and its aftermath. Yet he keeps insisting that he's fat (his BMI is 21.5...... perfectly normal) and keeps burning his meagre NSF pay on those stupid diet pills endorsed by those bimbotic MediaCorp stars (flame me all you want..... I'll still utterly condemn those bloody pills and the people who endorse them).<br><br>Anyway, you yourself said that your friends are ok with your appearance. So what's the problem?!?!?!<br><br>What's your height and weight?
