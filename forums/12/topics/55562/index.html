            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shutthehellup:</div><div class="quote_body">but this involves a marriage certificate..</div></blockquote>Oh ok! When you are married, your passion for each other doesn't end here... although a lot of people tend to do that. Its actually the beginning because you will be seeing, living, eating etc. together for the rest of your life. How you keep that passion even after marriage is up to both parties. If the passion dies out then will you get a divorce, will you just stick together and flirt around or just stick together and stay faithful? I believe that even when the passion has die out... either party can make the move like doing things when they still in the courtship days. Example, dress young and do what you both did when you were young or try something new to spice up your life. Being in marriage is not just about learning to live and be together, bringing up a child or being a parent... its more about how much you both love and feel for each other.</div>
