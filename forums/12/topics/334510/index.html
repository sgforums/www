              <p>Hi</p>
              <p><br>I logged into my friend's email yesterday cos i was waiting for my classes to end and I really so bo liao went to login and see 4 of his mails.</p>
              <p>He knows abt it cos he can trace whose ip logs in to his account and he confronted me but i denied. but i feel really bad and confess to him.</p>
              <p><br>now he's mad at me and he just treats me as a friend, no longer best friend.</p>
              <p>i'm regretful and really sorry and i dun mean any harm. i tried apologising but it's no use cos he's not going to budge. he's as stubborn as a cow like me</p>
              <p>so what should i do? forget abt patching back and taking this as a lesson? or try my best to show me my sincerity, if so how?</p>
              <p>will appreciate if some kind and helpful advice is given. :(</p>
              <p>I really don't know what words to say except sorry.. so bud, if u're reading this.. sorry abt it i know my mistake alrdy.</p>

              <p>why in the world would U want to read mails that arent even addressed to U?</p>
              <p>if its school email...I dont think there would be that many emails that are sent to him but not sent to U...ie...official emails...</p>
              <p>if its personal email....then U are just kpo.</p>
              <p>and yes...U are considered to have hacked into his account....even though he might have given U his password in the 1st place.</p>

              <p>while I agree that what U have said has some merit...I do think that each of us are entitled to our privacy...friends or otherwise.</p>

              <p>He, who doesnt agree with U, is not fit to be ur best friend?</p>
              <p>TS screwed up...each one of us has a limit somewhere....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS owe his friend an apology...and if the friend doesnt reciprocrate...its also his choice because his privacy has been invaded.Then there is nothing TS can do but to move on...hopefully time will help to blow things over.</p>
