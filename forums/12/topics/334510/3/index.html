              <p>Back in the ancient era in one particular country, the person
              who betrayed his BEST Friend would be so ashamed that he would
              slice his abdominal with a knife and his BEST Friend would do him
              the HONOUR of chopping off the person's head from behind.</p>
              <p>But since a GUY has two HEADS, you get to choose which HEAD you
              want your BEST Friend to chop it off for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>he punish you and you will feel better OR keep quite and let you suffer in silence ..  which is more deadly ...  ?  If I were to be him, I will let you guessing for a longer time so your punishment is longer than to say I am angry with you and start scolding you and everything is over ...  it so short and an easy way out for you ... think about it...  be patience now and be good...      no need to thank me la. ...  just share share experience ...</p>
