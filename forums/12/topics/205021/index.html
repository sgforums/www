She may have caused the drift btw her and her beau.<br>But i think the guy has a part to play as well.<br>Sockhwa U must have your good points too. otherwise ur ex- bf wouldn't make U his gf in the first place.<br>Relationships are like that. Rosy at first. Very accomodating towards each other. Making promises like staying with each other forever no matter what.. Blah blah...<br><br>When reality hit U hard at the back, people could hardly remember what they promised during their honeymoon period, there isn't any "bao rong" nor empathy for their partners. There isn't any "Jian Chi Dao Di" spirit to be seen.<br><br>If ur ex- bf really love U, why didn't he give U a second chance? Why didn't he tell U about how he feels about U upfront earlier to solve the obstacle btw U and him? Why did he let it slip liddat and not communicate about it with U?<br>My point is the guy also didn't do his best to save the relationship. He also contributed to the fall of the relationship.<br><br>I think if he truly loves U as what he made U think he did.<br>He would have realised @ The crucial time, it is time for him to carry out his promise that is to preserve the relationship no matter what it takes.</div>

That's why human should never learn the question and answer way - they should be taught to say I love you whenever possible and whenever the situation arises. If you eliminate the questioning part - what's there to fan about?<br><br>But that's ideally.<br><br>There are so many ways to let someone know that we love them. Telling is indeed the cheapest of all (and there is a difference between telling someone right from the heart and being flippant) - that's why, like our Marketing Mix, in love, all of us have this comprehensive mix of affection in our own ways to make known to someone that he/she is special and important to us. Being told that we are loved is not always verbal - it could be non-verbal and you feel them in your soul so strongly that words become superfluous.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Love? It's kind of complicated, kid -<br>But I'll tell you this.<br>The second you're willing<br>To make yourself miserable<br>To make someone else happy -<br>That's love right there."<br><br>" Is that why I eat all my vegetables<br>When my mother tells me to?" </span><br><br>If you want to measure how deep a love someone has for another is when that person dies and you see the amount of sorrow that fills him/her. We must recognise that although some people appeared nonchalant - but ultimately, we are still humans. My dad is a non-romantic, non-affectionate guy - but there was once when something happened to my mum, his concern is all over.<br><br>This is love to my dad... in his own ways.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>P.S: My suggestion for you is to watch the movie 'Click' - you will have a better picture of what I want to say.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
