Rosy at first. Very accomodating towards each other. Making promises like staying with each other forever no matter what.. Blah blah...<br><br>When reality hit U hard at the back, people could hardly remember what they promised during their honeymoon period, there isn't any "bao rong" nor empathy for their partners. There isn't any "Jian Chi Dao Di" spirit to be seen.<br><br>If ur ex- bf really love U, why didn't he give U a second chance? Why didn't he tell U about how he feels about U upfront earlier to solve the obstacle btw U and him? Why did he let it slip liddat and not communicate about it with U?<br>My point is the guy also didn't do his best to save the relationship. He also contributed to the fall of the relationship.<br><br>I think if he truly loves U as what he made U think he did.<br>He would have realised @ The crucial time, it is time for him to carry out his promise that is to preserve the relationship no matter what it takes. </div></blockquote>Hmm.</div>

I really don know all e while he is thinking of this.. Bearing with my temper and unreasonable.. He look very happy when he is with me.. If he had to told me, i will surely changed.. I really don know... It Is my fault.. I should be more understanding towards his feeling.. But now he is together another girl after we broke up less than one week.. is because he changed heart that y he broke with me? i really don know.. I love him alot, and we been together 4 one and half years already and all e memories we shared, he k give up so easily.. i always hope i am e heartless one and not him.. at least i wont be so sad.. I know this is not totally his fault.. I got my fault too .. If i got e chance to get back with him, i will treat him very good.. let him be most fortunate guy in e world.. BUt is this possible? Nope.. What is gone is already gone.. Maybe if he and me still have fate or maybe he still love me, we will get back ba.. I really don know wat my life will be.. I hate to feel sad and miserable..
