            <div class='col-md body'>If u really love him.. it's good to continue, but to really love him that means u r wif him not becoz u dun haf company. that is u really like him... Even if u do, I dun think it's a good idea that u allow him to do anything, coz someday things may juz get out of hand. FOr instance, he may juz want to haf sex, and has been pursuading u from time to time, but u on ur part as his gf, gives in to him. and that's it.... Though u can say that u can easily deny it, but when actual situation comes, it's a different thing...<br><br>But if u r juz staying becoz u got no company, pls let go, though it gonna hurt. and u maybe even more lonely... But it's for the better.. GO out wif ur frens.. or do sth that will him off the mind.. soon u will forget him...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

And I don't think u should blief a guy so easily.  If u really think u should leave him, do so.  If u really wanna b in a relationship. u must b commited and both parties should try to understand each other more b4 anything else, ok, *WINK*<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

Or do you want to just be used as a sex slave ? If you feel like you're being used, no sense of security being with him, no sense of love, and he just feels horny everytime you two meet, i think it's time you serious thought it out, and maybe have a discussion with him soon enough.<br><br>------------------<br>The night is near and dawn is coming...
