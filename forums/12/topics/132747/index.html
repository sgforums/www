If it goes away..good. if it stays, too bad, will have to live with it. Right now, my head is exploding.. what will my gf think? sigh.. how to handle..?</div></blockquote>u should see if u can get her involved in dressing you up. Girls sometimes actually like the idea of being able to be in control and dominate her man. It is kinky play and can be a bit of a turn on for them to see the guy they know so well in a totally new light.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it could be some fetish...and this is not the best place to solicit for advise as it is a matter of personal choice and preference. it would even seem  condescending to say this is right/wrong, black or white. unless you are here to reinforce certain preconceptions others have about cross dressers. these decisions, as with many other decisions; e.g. taking drugs, shoplifting, having sex, slap a stranger, or those things that allure one with danger yet excitement, are not so much about a 'dare' to take the first step to do something, and subsequently, because of that decision, to determine your ultimate choice. it is a more complicated process and the self-doubt and evaluation stages are continuous. So, you could positively reinforce such behaviour by dressing up and hanging around bugis street and you get all the admiration you wished. Or to negatively 'shame' yourself by doing so in a different venue where you know you know you would likely be humiliated/beaten up. then again, these external experiments may not present the best solutions to suppress your internal desires. so, you are just worried about how you present yourself to society and the community, then you should weigh your priorities. but who knows, time changes, adn with the setting up of the IR, the garbement may one day set up some simon cabaret and their 1-stop shopping &amp; sexual reassignment/modification medical HQ here to rival bangkok and be the best in batam and jb.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Harisu:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all,<br><br>I am a guy and I have a problem. In fact, I always have this fantasy of wanting to dress up as a school girl. When I see how the school girls are being cared and pampered by their parents in the streets, my desire grown stronger. Is there anything wrong with me? Am I a crossdresser? Have been tempted to go the uniform retailer to get a CHIJ or MGS uniform.. to dress up and fantasized being cared for.. really confused. pls help..</div></blockquote></div>
