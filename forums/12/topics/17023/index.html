If she does, she will crawl back 2U &amp; cherish U more!<br><br>A PEST is always detesting or unwelcomed!

            <div class='col-md body'>U gotta show her tt as her bf, u can share her problems and be at her side no matter what. Perhaps u have to really talk to her one day, tell her how u are feeling, and tell her tt as her bf, u could help her with her problems.<br><br>I agree tt u may find our her problems frm her friends, but i think as her bf, u shld still ask her abt it urself. At least in this way, she knoes tt u care for her.<br><br>Hope tt helps...</div>
