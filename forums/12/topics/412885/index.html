              <p>My Problem :-</p>
              <p>ok u see. I really really LOVE anime. U can call me an otaku i wouldn't mind since we all here behind screen haha bleh ;p. And i love my friends too which is my school friends and my other friends. But the worst part of it is that none of my friends are into anime as well as i do. They do watch from time to time but not fanatic about it. And yes im fanatic about it. After an outing together with my friends, i would go home and the first thing in my mind is anime so i just turn on my PC and watch it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This really starting to bothers me. I NEED someone to talk to about all these anime and stuff. I want to share out all my hobbies but i've been keeping secrets from my friends that i'm an otaku myself. Once they found out, it will be really embarrassing for me and i wont show my face infront of them again. I love anime as well as my friends. I know they dont like otakus because they got talk to me before regarding that. I know how singaporeans look down on otakus. It's really making me sad and ashamed. So i've been keeping my secrets about being an otaku ever since EVEN my own family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U guys see, i really indeed help here. I can't stay quiet forever. I'm good at socializing, i am. Just those casual talks/clubbing/humor/lan and stuff together with my friends is really fun but none of those are my type of "excitement". I need someone that understands me so we can share out each other but i do not have any of them. please help me. What should i do?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and yup, im an otaku because i have LOADS of mangas and erm.......toys of animes haha.</p>

              <p>S yo don;t love anime at all. you just found a hobby that you can show off only. a hobby that youcan chat and show how much you like and know and watch about some anime and manga. i also lie some alot when i was a teenager and during NS. however i don;t find it bore with my friends then since not all t=of them like it, and only one or two i can chat on that. but that's cool. alone i still enjoyed anime back then, and i don;t see why i can't enjoy it on my own and have to pipe it all up so that i can let the wolrd know what i liked.</p>
              <p>people with such problem usually need to identify themselves, exu=hibitionist. if you cannot handle it i suggets you quickly drop anime before it becomes an addict. you say yourslef you are good in solcialising. go out and make even more friend snad winden your sircle more.</p>
              <p>from what i see before you become toomuch of an exhibitionist it sbetter to pull out before you hurt even more people, people who don;t really like it or are just a neutral party in such hobbies and pastimes.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Haha i'm an otaku too. Downloaded alot of anime but haven't watch them yet. Dying to watch Gundam 00 and many others. I kinda understand how you feel about anime la. Here and there i browse anime shop. Thought about cosplaying too. Sort of a try it once in my life at least that kind of experience. But nobody keen on trying. Oh well it fun but don't let it take over your life is what i think. </p></div>

              <p>little girl. it's time to extend your circle of friends. Don't just keep your fanatics in singapore. there are many people in the world out there who share the same interest as you. Join anime forums, meet friends from other countries, especially maybe those from Japan. </p>
              <p>I know of friends who are power rangers(super sentai) and kamen rider(masked rider)fanatics. At the name of those you'll probably laugh at them. But people in Japan watch these shows from young till now, an adult. </p>
              <p>And not only that. There's anime festival in Singapore. You'll probably know that already, but it shows that there are people like you as well, with the same interest.</p>

              <p>cosplay fest long over about 3months ago. But you can still look forward to the next one. Only managed to find the FB link. </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=114686871875352&amp;index=1">http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=114686871875352&amp;index=1</a></p>
              <p>And if you have the time, go down to china square located in the middle of clarke quay and chinatown. LOTS of anime shops with all the toy collections, etc. But limited to basement floors only i think. </p>

              <p>so love anime must show off lah? you join those companies also be careful. lots of them not really in to anime ones. or rather too young to handle some atrractions. like i wrote from young i also like some jcomic stuff and anime and manga. but maybe that time not lik now with communciations so advance and easy i love the art moderately. i don;t know if i cannot control what a freak i will be now. its easy to read tons of anime and comics and watch many animes. and i can tell you the people love them all. i mena can you love them all. the stopry all the same ones. and they twisted the traditions of samurai and ninjas and the true japan spirit. not to mention the skimpy clothings and some weird behaviours. ther are also lots of photogrpahers there only to network, some are snipers, hentai upskirters, some cosplayers are show off exhibitionist. some to get some photos to 'beef' up their portfolio, cos very costly and difficult to get one people in sophisticated costumer snd snap it and put inside they port. laojiao lj 'photogrpahers' actually are guys with cameras with try every means to put donw any other 'photographers' they feel thread, cosplayers makeuse of photgraphers with gears if they don;t shoot them they will engage others new GWCs. a some cosplyers really cannot get attention in life so when they doll up nice nice lots of cameras and flash they feel revitalised, attention they can never get when in their true self. some are forumers keyboard warriors only. onlt a few nunch of them are worthy friends, and this bunch of them 'worthy friends' can sometimes be very dificault to define. . many backstbbers, stalkers, idle talkers blah blah. some just join in b=ian jia only. i view from a corner its an endless vicious cycle of a silly bunch of people, and the event organizers are the last one to laugh to the banks. you just have to be careful. if you can find sgforums, you can easy find such sites with goggle.</p>
