              <p>Simple, we all are humans, and humans like new stuffs, new house, new cars, new laptop, new environment as in tour, new clothing as in fashion, but as for partners, we can only have one and find it difficult to change, cos humans, unlike non living things, got feeling and all those emotions. Therefore, the result is that changing bf or gf is a hard and painful process, someone will get hurt or even killed, so people resort to cheating resulting in unfaithfulness and all sort of funny relationship. Cheating is simply built on us, all of us cheat to survive, some may cheat more, some less. And if you dun cheat, you are simply a nerd or good for nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And frankly, without cheating, you get no gf or bf for the rest of your life. I have to cheat my bf too, sometime i go disco, i have to tell him i go temple, otherwise he may not take it and that end our relationship.</p>

              <p>monogamy is a responsibility which many ppl cannot afford.. they do not realise that a relationship is just like a job, an assignment, a piece of homework.. u have to be responsible, u have to put in ur best, in order for it to work out..</p>
              <p>those who cheat, do so becoz they are bored, becoz they want, like what angel7030 said, a change.. they do not want to stick to their old 'job', their old 'assignment', they don't want to be doing homework all the way, they want to run out to the playground and have fun before coming home to slp..</p>
              <p>here's a quote from a movie i watched, where the bad guy is trying to teach the good guy to fool ard.. he said, "life is like golf, if u cant be playing the same hole for all ur life' &lt;-- pun intended.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>y men cheat..cuz they love families. as in they love creating many families with different females. they like novelty. think back how you first put your arms around a gal in an intimate way. how the first kiss was shared. and then, you start think how it will be with another gal and another and another..</p>
              <p>y gals cheat...another male happen to feel their void when their current male is not around.</p>
              <p>as the buddhist wisdom says, se ji shi kong, kong ji shi se..when you feel empty, you feel horny..horny when you are empty...</p>

              <p>Try not to twist any religion to explain your logic.</p>
              <p>In buddhist, "se4" does not mean lust. Buddism does not condone lust and acts agaist oneself or others. "se4" in the context of the heart sutra means the human state. It is explaining that life is transient and empty. </p>
              <p>On the topic of cheating, I was approached to cheat a number of times as well. There's lots who cheat and even people who look the guai guai one also cheat. So don't judge the book by its cover. These people who cheat will always have an excuse, however lame just to cheat. Then they will tell you everyone's doing it (even when its not true), so you are not hip to not join in and tempt you. Have you not heard, when people are low class and shameless, they think everyone is as low class and shameless as them? Everyone has moral standards that's different from ours, and its their life, its their choice.</p>
              <p>Stand your ground, cause cheating really hurts you and the other person. Remember the Sun Screen Song: Don't be erckless with other people's heart. Don't let others be reckless with yours.  There's no point to waste our short lifetime here with these kinds of meaningless relationships and painful acts and become progressively unhappy and bitter about life, love and people.  If you believe in karma, what goes round, comes round.</p>

              <p>Hi, I have come across a lot of cheating cases or people suspecting that they have been cheated in my blog <a href="http://www.aluvguru.blogspot.com">www.aluvguru.blogspot.com</a> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many reasons why people cheat on their relationship;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) For excitement</p>
              <p>2) Can't decide what they want</p>
              <p>3) Can't control their emotions and feelings</p>
              <p>4) Think they can handle both sides and enjoy the benefits of having 2 gf or bf </p>
              <p>5) No sense of responsibility and commitment</p>
              <p>6) Tired of their present relationship</p>
              <p>7) When 1 party is away for work or studies</p>
              <p>8) Enjoy the feeling of being loved or admired by another person</p>
              <p>9) Didn't know it's cheating until things get too far</p>
              <p>10) Not satisfy by present partner in terms of sex, money, care and concern etc. </p>

              <p>The thrill of the cheat. The thrill of getting it on with someone else's hot wife. That is the ultimate thrill already. Knowing u are able to attract another's wife. But the consequences.. can be.. fatal. lol</p>
              <p>*learns from his mistakes* i dun dare liaw.</p>
              <p>But i try not to cheat on my gf. But sometimes being honest lppl.. cheat also lppl. Damned if u do.. damned if u dont. I suppose thats what it is to be in a relationship, the uncertainty. Knowing all = boring.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Why even bother analyzing possibilities? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I say go out and discover people individually
              - instead of allow yourself to be subjected to preconceive notion of what would
              constitute a cheating behavior. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Love reasoning and Love behavior is completely
              mutually exclusive. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Some fellow might bitch about their other
              half the whole day, but still not will cheat on him/her ultimately – while others
              might portray a loving figure, as he/she screw or get screwed <span> </span>by another behind the scene. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There are hundreds of dimensions to the cause
              of cheating – attributing to a single possibility might not even be near to the
              real situation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Don’t think about Love – learn it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">P.S: Although I won’t edit it, but please don’t
              come advertise your own blog site to boost readership. </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>

              <p>Thanks for all your contributions so far. I have also learnt
              that singaporean youths aren't as stupid or as immature as some
              adult like to say, all of us definitely know how to be serious when
              it comes to serious stuffs.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the reason why I posted this thread is because of pain.
              I have got a friend who is a guy, he loves his girlfriend alot and
              refuses to ask for sex from her, they have been together for almost
              3 years, his gf is very good looking and to prove he truly love
              her, he refuses to have sex with her and practise self-control to
              prove not to others, but to the girl herself that he likes her not
              for her physical looks.</p>
              <p>Eventually, the girl convinced him that she truly believes in
              him and that he should stop depriving himself of his needs (a guy
              will always have his needs no matter what, the biological clock is
              designed to constantly reproduce to avoid dying out of our race)
              and they finally did it. All was well.</p>
              <p>Then eventually, he found out that she was screwing other guys
              behind his back, and he confronted her. All she did was justify and
              make it sound like it was no big deal, and that if he couldnt take
              it, it wasnt her problem.</p>
              <p>I could honestly feel the pain when he told me this story.
              Thankfully, he is a man, he moved on. If it happens to me, I dont
              think I would be as strong as him.</p>
              <p>IMO, its true that we as human beings love variety, we have our
              own fetishes and such but the whole point of being loyal and
              faithful is to control ourselves from these. If we do such a thing,
              and justify by giving reasons as stated by some of you above, then
              thats not being faithful already, and when you are not faithful, no
              point justifying anymore.</p>
              <p>What you guys think?</p>

              <p>I am not that young.  Well, your friend met a bad incident with a lousy person. Hope he is not hung up over that girl and that he deserves a better girl.  As said before, people will come out with whatever reasons that suit them to explain for their behaviour, especially where its hurtful.  But you are deciding for your own life, whether you want to be faithful or not. No one can tell you what you should think. I know people who cheat and lost their job. I also know people who cheat and nothig happened to them. But ultimately, I know that whatever goes around, will always without a doubt, comes around. Maybe not immediately, but eventually.  It is unwise to see thing just from one case, it also is not good to hold extreme views. If being faithful is not useful. Then love, marriage, hope and everything in this world is also useless. They are not true, will never be and everything is just a lie. Where then does it end?</p>

              <p>Your friend and her just do not belong to the same group lor... It is lucky that your friend found out about these and move on before things get complicated.</p>
              <p>The incident that you mention is quite common. But to me, it gets even more disgusting if as time passed, girl wants to settle down due to age and decide to be faithful and loyal. Then she wants to find a guy tat is faithful and loyal too or expects her guy to be faithful and loyal too... Not because of she thinks that what she does is wrong in the past or she loves him but because she thinks that it is just time for her to reach to the next stage of life.</p>
