            <div class='col-md body'>There is no point carrying on a relationship when the fire has died. The damage is already done, and you have to search your heart to find out whether you truly love her or not right now. Don't take your time because as each day passes you will deteriorate. Relationships are meant to be between two people that nurture each other. What I see in your situation is a growing, unhealthy and tiresome relationship that leaves you with insomnia instead of a good night's rest. Weigh the pros and cons and decide for yourself. Sometimes what hurts the heart will soothe the head, aka the truth may hurt your heart but at least you know its true. Also what soothes the heart will hurt the head, which is currently what you're experiencing. Time will take care of your loneliness if you're willing to take care of yourself first. All the best, mate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mmmm... personally, relationships that end with break ups then u patch up again but during the in-between she is with another guys is just a bit too much for me. During that in-between loads of stuff happens if u know what i mean. Maybe she is a jumper .. but only you will know.  Take time think about it and see what others in AA has to say for you ya.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
