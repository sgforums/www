Not likely.<br><br>Your situation has two possibility:<br><br>I) Reversal psychology. Sometimes, we wanted something so badly, we do the opposite. To people with care, we scold thim (for their own good), though it seemed really hostile.<br><br>II) You don't miss her - you simply missed having to love someone. Love has this fault - it make us too sheltered. To feel that we can't walk alone anymore. We are like our own pampered child - the minute our object of affection is gone, we questioned ourselves: so what's next. We long for the 'usual', but what makes you think that the 'radical' isn't good for us? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
