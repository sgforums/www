Though I had known of her disturbing past I didn't mind and tried my best to help her change in hope of her being a better person. Not for me but for herself =D but on christmas eve I tried to contact her to wish her a simple merry x'mas but I couldn't so i sent her a sweet sms to wish her. However when I finally got to talk to her on the phone on christmas day, she told me she got attached? ok that was fine. But when I asked who, she said that it was a guy who she knew from work for less than a week *that was one time when i was out with her and this guy keep msging her like all the mushy stuff though he has only known her for a day. I sorta knew his intentions and warned her* well she said that she has spend the night at the guy's house. Whao that really tore my heart into pieces and I felt really sad. I don't know why and how because it was the first time i felt this way. I felt so betrayed and painful as I thought she changed and became a better person. I still refuse to believe it and it's really dragging my emotional side down, as in it's reall sad to see someone so special being tricked like that thinking that it is true love. REally hurts. I really hope she changes =]  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>She's in love, what's wrong with you?</div>
