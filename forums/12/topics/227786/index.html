            <div class='col-md body'>Hey bros/sis, I wrong in not too long ago about my problem with this girl haha and on christmas I finally found out her true colours. Though I had known of her disturbing past I didn't mind and tried my best to help her change in hope of her being a better person. Not for me but for herself =D but on christmas eve I tried to contact her to wish her a simple merry x'mas but I couldn't so i sent her a sweet sms to wish her. However when I finally got to talk to her on the phone on christmas day, she told me she got attached? ok that was fine. But when I asked who, she said that it was a guy who she knew from work for less than a week *that was one time when i was out with her and this guy keep msging her like all the mushy stuff though he has only known her for a day. I sorta knew his intentions and warned her* well she said that she has spend the night at the guy's house. Whao that really tore my heart into pieces and I felt really sad. I don't know why and how because it was the first time i felt this way. I felt so betrayed and painful as I thought she changed and became a better person. I still refuse to believe it and it's really dragging my emotional side down, as in it's reall sad to see someone so special being tricked like that thinking that it is true love. REally hurts. I really hope she changes =]  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

It is really hard to read in this manner. Do some paragraphing at the very least.<br><br>2nd thing: You want to help her become a better person right?

How long have you been trying to change her?<br><br>4th thing: You do know that attempting to change a person's mindset takes a long time.

            <div class='col-md body'>i can understand how u r feeling. when u fall in love with a rotten person who has the capacity to be good, but choose to turn to the "dark side" and ignore u....its painful.<br><br>Painful not because of "betrayal" or love lost. But because of severe disappointment. You probably have hopes of changing that person and ending up together with her.<br><br>But we can't force love nor change. If the person wants a decadant lifestyle so be it. The thing to do is to move on and wait for the next one. Its hard yes, but time heals all wounds. Soon the pain from disappointment will become routine once u get used to it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>holy cow, was stumped at first, coz your post seem similar to what I've experienced. The "her bad past" and the "cant get her on christmas eve and sent her a sweet message thing" but luckily, mine still going strong.<br><br>well thats not the point, the point is that we men just cannot devote yourself too much into the time when we are chasing a girl, you know what i'm saying. Like in your situation, you should play along and flirt with her, instead of being so serious when there's nothng on yet.<br><br>Now look, she's not gonna last long with that guy, trust me, knowing him for only 1 day and getting attached to him, definitely for either his money or his look. If your personality is better, she will realise it. Just make sure if you did get back together with her, or with other women in the future, do not be so serious. Flirt hard with them, and pull back when you think you are getting too serious.<br><br>Think about it, when we flirt with girls and they get hooked up with us easily, we definitely will get the idea of them being a "easy" woman right? The same thing is applied to how a girl thinks. If you get too serious, she would also think you are too "easy" thus not cherishing anything. Flirting and being romantic are the things that actually keeps a relationship going strong, not anything else you are thinking, you know what I'm saying.<br><br>Hope this post gets into your head <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
