But to no avail, I did not manage to get through any phone interview as I had problems pronouncing numerous words even though I had no problems with written English.<br><br>Â·	What can I do stop as it had affecting my life? Stay or Leave?<br><br>Personally, I think you should STAY. On the economy sense, jobs are limited... On a personal stand, perhaps this is my STYLE... But I personally believe that having to give up on oneself is one of the most lousy way of picking an alternative... If you can ask yourself should you LEAVE or STAY, you probably have a CHOICE... And since you consider the faults mainly not to be on your part and you've performed more than expected out of your job, giving up now and quitting now to me is just LETTING YOURSELF DOWN... After all you've done..? Personally, I don't think you deserve this... And if anybody else THINKS that you deserves to LEAVE then they'll have to PROVE THEIR POINT?<br><br><strong><br>Â·	I had try to say No but sometimes but it give perception of being unhelpful and somehow being left out how?</strong><br><br>You can't possibly satisfy everybody. And the LAST person you should disappoint is probably yourself...? I used to be somehow like you... But being a nice guy won't make everybody else less of an as[/i]shole... In fact, you'll probably encourage them... So for everybody's good and YOUR OWN good... As long as you're not an as[/i]shole and is CLEAR to your conscience you should understand that you're no Mr Perfect?<br><br>Work is work and job is job. Yes, no doubt you're working for the company but so is everybody else... Don't let people take advantage of everything... Though I've recently come to understand that since I spend a great deal of time at work, I've better learn to make it more enjoyable and have to recognise it as a vital part of my life... So your job has probably becomes a merge between work and life.... Depends on HOW you balance it, and also depends on your principle in Life to decide on how you'll handle things...?<br><br><strong><br>Â·	Also being helpful can also lead to be busybody?</strong><br><br>Yes. It's a matter of perception. Again this is your principle and management. For me it'll varies according to situation and people... Some people would appreciate it while others don't....<br><br><strong><br>Â·	It had taken a toll on my health but I like what I am doing and like working in the company. Should I move on or stay?</strong><br><br>I still think you should stay. If you think it's affecting your health, DO SOMETHING about your HEALTH... I can't guarantee that your job is gonna stick with you for the rest of your life, but your health..? The last time you'll be seeing it is probably the day that you die? So LEARN to take care of yourself....<br><br><strong><br>Â·	My effort is not recognized when I try to fulfill the service level agreement to the users but in the end being taken advantage.</strong><br><br>Care to elaborate on this? Actually, sometime ago I was kinda facing the same dilemma as you? I was STABBED so BADLY at work and whatever I do is not appreciated just because how what people say behind my back... At 1st it did bother me... I had many thoughts... One of them is whether I should just leave as I see no prospect in this kinda environment... And its somehow affecting my personal mentality... I'm a guy who wanna PERFORM and CONTRIBUTE... But the environment's disappointing.... I had wish to leave and go somewhere where I can PERFORM.... But in the end I STAYED....<br><br>Whatever people had said about me I don't think I've done anything to deserve quitting on my job and myself... And I believe the backstabber would be VERY PLEASED with my decision... NOPE.. I'm not gonna make things so very easy for such people... I've decided to STAY and just do my job... No matter how I'm framed and bonus got affected... I remained unshifted... Today, I find myself a much happier man... As I don't have to bother about what they do behind my back whereas they constantly have to think of things to backstab you... Poor things... Thank goodness i'm not one of them...?<br><br><strong><br>Â·	Two years working with someone that is stubborn and also working even on medical leave as it is a day to day operation not a urgency.<br></strong></div></blockquote><strong>This is what I think you should do? 1st of all, WEIGH yourself... Are you a VALUABLE person in your company? Can they easily replace you with someone else for your job? If they CAN'T, you're on slight advantage.... It's probably a MUTUAL relationship...<br><br>As for your colleague, make it CLEAR to her as to what kinda job system you're both working on... If she FAIL to cover you while you're on MC, DON'T expect the SAME in return... Of course it can vary on a case to case basis... And if everybody else thinks something's wrong with that? There're probably something VERY WRONG with them.... You can even have the 'system' printed out and pasted somewhere so that everybody else knows what's going on too...? Certainly meets the requirement of ISO?</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Its not easy to say "no" but u have done well in achieving that. Now what you must do is to say it in an appropriate way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>When saying no, do say it in a courteous way no matter what excuses you come out with.<br><br>Eg. When on MC and someone call you. Inform that person that you are sorry that you are not feeling well and unable to recall anything at the moment. Then recommend him/her your backup's contact for assistance.<br><br>Eg2. At work, when someone approach you with help. you can say that you were really like to help but am not familiar with it as it is not within your role to handle it. Then recommend someone else who might resolve the problem.<br><br>Saying a straight no will definately put you in a bad spot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Do stay for another 1/2 yr. Hopefully by then you are in a better spot or the market is much better outside.<br><br>Anyway, if u face such problem in your current company... It is likely you get the same issue other places. The important thing is to solve it and not to run away from it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Hope this help. Take care and good luck !!</div>
