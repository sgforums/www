            <div class='col-md body'>Many people have realized by now that each of us have an ugly side that we try desperately to keep hidden, yet it comes out ever so often. Lets all post our ugly sides, what we think resulted in it, what we do when it happens, and what we are planning to do about it, to show that we are conscious of it, and are going to improve ourselves.<br><br>Let me start:<br><br>I turn ugly when I start losing too much. Recently, I played some football on the ps2 with my friends, I know IÂ’m not good at it, but it was just for fun. When I started losing 4-0, my face turned black, I simply couldnÂ’t help it. My friend noticed it and pointed it out to me, but there was nothing I could do. The black face simply wouldnÂ’t go away. I felt so mad, mad at myself for not able to control my feelings, mad at losing, mad at everything.<br><br>I think the source of it relates back to my childhood, where I was good at chess then, and kept winning. Now that I donÂ’t play chess anymore, perhaps the sense of victory is no longer there, and it becomes unbalanced.<br><br>A year ago it would be worse, but I think IÂ’ve mellowed down somewhat, until that soccer game just recently. IÂ’m hoping to paint this ugly side of me, to make it pretty, but it may not work.<br><br>I donÂ’t even know how to make it disappear, except maybe to laugh out loud at my losses, but thatÂ’s me.<br><br>How about you guys?
