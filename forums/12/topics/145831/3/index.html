            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is: don't believe the bad press about ITE.<br><br>The general public seems to have a negative viewpoint of ITE - nothing much you can do about that. You can, however, show them just how wrong they are about ITE. If they want to think badly about ITE, let them be.... if you believe that going there will help you to succeed in life, then you should go for it. In the end, you should go for whatever option in life that makes you happy.<br><br>Just remember... success can take many forms. It does only entail a high-level paper qualification. One of my friends dropped out of JC after failing her JC 1 Promo exams. People expected her to drop 'out of sight, out of mind'. In the end, she became an actress, and is now a rising star on the Malay channel. She also got married, and now lives happily with her husband in her own home.....<br><br>..... And here I am, stuck in my dingy little room, ranting in sgforums.com while waiting for my second year to start this Monday.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello!<br><br>I'm currently a JC1 student. Just want to tell you about my friend.<br><br>She was from N(A), and studied that extra year to take her O's. Now she's in a JC. She got tops in her class for GP (!) , but she's struggling a little with her maths cos she didn't take a maths. Chem is also hard. Econs she seems okay with. She's hired a tutor to help her. I believe that she'll go to university.<br><br>Ultimately, your choice will depend on how hard you are willing to work.</div>
