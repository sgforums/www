            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I hope my advice can encourage you to a certain extent. ITE cert let you learn the skill and knowledge that equipe you for the job or career that you want in future. Don't think too far, work for your future and as you acquire the necessary skills, you will have more options and opportunities. Even if you have a good job, continue to pursue your higher education. I take each step at a time to acquire a stable and  secure job. Learn from those who gone through the long way to achieve his or her dreams. Don't ever look down on ITE cert. They do open doors to job opportunities as well as higher education.</div>

Now u work part-time only big fudge meh? I dun even need to work and I got money. So wat if my parents as long as we are one big family. I also no need to use stepping stone to go poly. As for wat chicken feet for 2nd year? Aiyo of cos la, u already spent yr brains cells in the ITE now come poly still have to waste a little more barin cells. Pple only need to one time waste brain cells. And wat stupid cannot afford Poly?
