If you think so,you might want to do some self-thinking<br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote>You can, i'm sure, reason why the society labels it as bad, Have you seen many ITE students come out with a bright future?? Have you seen anyone from ITE earning just enough for their family? Have you seen ITE Students holding managerial persitions?? To put it in a nut shell, the society generalizes on these stuff, although the society might not be right but, that's the image the school is creating, or rather showing to the whole of singapore.... Although one bad doesn't make all bad, but, the society sees it as true and all you need is just afew black sheeps to make the rest the same...<br>For me i guess it's also good that you dislike your class, like that, you can empower yourself to focus on your goal, keep telling yourself: "work hard and get out of this place" when you have too many friends, you tend to slack, cause friendship like all other relationships demands your time and concern...</div>

I do see many graduate coming out of ITE doing better then those who do well in O level.  Don't think that they are from ITE mean they are doom.  Everyday got different mind and character.  They are a lot of people who excel in poly.  DOn't believe you can go and ask. Does that mean that when you fall, you cannot get up already?  Road is chosen by you, wherever you want to go somewhere, the decision is made upon you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello people... i'm a jc student here in sg.. i hope u all wouldnt str8away hav the mindset that i am here to blast ITE students.. have a neutral viewpoint towards my post.<br><br>in this thread, i see users using terms such as "many ITE graduates do well" or even "i heard of ONE ITE graduate who went to ....". how many is many? numbers have to be stated. ONE? one out of how many students that certain year? thus, numbers play a crucial part.<br><br>jc students are the creme de la creme. they are the top 20% of the sg education system each year. this grp of students are needed to spearhead the country into further progress. they are the ones who would make the crucial decisions. say, in the government, they make the decisions extensively frm buying the F-15 for the airforce to giving out the baby bonus.<br><br>i do know of some students who did well but went on to a polytechnic. it's a personal choice seriously. he who goes to study in a university would work later, but earn more. he who studies in a poly would work early, earn less. this statement is based on the starting pays of Uni grads and poly grads released by universities and polys. no pure assumptions are made.<br><br>so, what about ITE students? they are needed in the high-labour industries where skills are of utmost importance. these industries are headed by the JC and poly students. these ITE students earn less but are knowledgeable with the know-hows of machineries.<br><br>say, ur car requires a mechanic. would u want an ITE graduate to service it or a Uni graduate? the former charges $500 whereas the latter charges $1500.<br><br>in any country, everyone is needed. frm the minister to the cleaner. each plays an important role in the country. i hope each of you sees this. if everyone wants to be smart, who would do the lower-end job? there are already 100 000 foreign workers in sg being domestic maids and construction workers and even nurses.<br><br>the mindset of singaporeans is that ITE is bad. the fact is, this is understandable. say you are a parent who is concerned abt ur child's education. would you encourage ur child gg to an ITE when sg is all abt paper chase? i'm caught in this. i'm tired of studying, honestly. but what can i do? to be affluent in sg, u need the papers and a job wiv a substantial pay. thus, the only way parents deter their children frm entering an ITE is that they sorta "brainwash" their children to think that ITEs are bad. this is a vicious cycle. frm the parents to their children, and when these children become parents, their children agn is "brainwashed".<br><br>thus, there isnt anything wrong wiv being in an ITE. preference is the keyword here.</div>
