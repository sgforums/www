            <div class='col-md body'>DO something that you like, no point getting opinions from others. If somehow one takes longer route to success, does it really matters ? Me myself am from Sec 4 NT, proceeded on to NITEC and now pursuing my Higher NITEC in IT.<br><br>Some of my friends went to some polys to study just for the sake of "Oh it's poly, as long as i get in and whatever course i got.. i will take it." They're struggling now because they enrolled into some courses which doesn't link with their NITEC's programme. So it doesn't matter which route you take, just make yaself feeling in love with the course. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Am now getting my H.Nitec Cert and at the same time, getting some A+ cert in IT privately. I'm only 19 this year and i'm working in Singapore Tourism Board.. studying the course privately too and am earning ard 2.5k mthly just by working part time.<br><br>So don't say ITE shucks.

            <div class='col-md body'>My father is an ITE teacher ( i'm not going to say which one...) and I had classmates from ITE in my poly class, so i'm going to put in my two cents worth ...<br><br>during my days at SP, there were a few classmates from ITE, and they have consistently topped the class .... and "A" was a bad grade for them ! .... they regularly got distinctions for the exams, (which is more than what i can say about my own grades ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) ... all of them are doing pretty well now .... including one that ended up in NUS mechanical engineering i think (infact, all of them more than qualified for university ... ) what i noticed about them, (and i suppose lots of poly students would notice the same of their ex-ITE classmates too) is that they are damm good with their practical work, and are very very hard-working (whether it's a result of having served their NS, i'm not sure ...)<br><br>having said that ... it's time to offer my father's take on this, my father has taught at ITE (and the former JVI) for many years now, and he takes great pride when his former students come up to him in the streets to greet him, he takes two extreme views of the place that he teaches in, invariably of course, there are people there who are dedicated to their studies, and, after a slight stumble at their O's or N's, made good at ITE and went on to poly and university .... his favourite anecdote was meeting a student of his at some tech update course at NTU and running into a former student of his there ... as the lecturer of the course ! ... so you see, " ITE doesn't stand for it's the end !" (my father's words) frankly, i think it doesn't matter where you go, but what you do there that matters ......<br><br>But on the other hand ... i'm often worried about my father teaching there ... as he's often told me stories about trouble making students that got him so angry that i'm afraid of his health ... I'm currently studying overseas right now, and when i returned home for a short summer break in may, he told me of the time earlier this year when he nearly fainted, and almost decided to quit; apparently, a few boys decided to cluster their tables together to talk while he was teaching class ... one of them just glanced up and casually said "Fxxx you" to his face when he asked them to return to their places ..... a colleague of his who's a principal at another ITE campus took out early retirement in despair because students were smoking right in front of him ....<br><br>I suppose my father's take is this, there are good students and bad students in every school, but he'll have to admit that there are more "bad" (as in behaviour, not studies) students than good ones in ITE, just make sure you're one of those "good" students, and go to ITE to study further and not to waste your time; i suppose ITE would be as good an option as any place else ...<br><br>(i've looked through some of the course work that my father prepares for his class and i must say i'm quite impressed by the quality of the cirriculum, it's definitely more hands on and practical than some of the poly stuff ... which i feel is sometimes too academic, and geared towards maximium credit excemptions in university later on ... And if anyone of you guys out there think ITE courses are easy and you can shut your eyes and coast through, think again ! ... not sure which course was it for but once i saw my father  preparing ppt slides on laplace transforms !!! ..... )<br><br></div>
