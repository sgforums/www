              <p>Yea....but that may work in the past when women were mostly housewife who can stay at home full-time........so of course naturally they would handle more housework......</p>
              <p>Nowadays most (younger) women are actually working and they work full-time.....no difference than the men......</p>
              <p>So imagine if the traditional gender role still persists when the situation is actually already changing......imagine if the guy expects the woman to handle cleaning, cooking, etc, while the woman actually is just as tired as the man....This can cause problems and unhappiness......</p>

              Very well said but i believe this issue can still be resolved if the lady wants to. My mum used to knock off work at 7+ and reaches home only at 8 plus. But she'll still cook for us as long as we are willing to wait till 9pm to eat dinner.
              
              I still tink that younger generations of females(or perhaps those i personally know) refuses/cant cook.Common excuses like troublesome or the "i dun like to wash plates and cookery are usually given" What appears scary about sg females are their pragmatic persue of monetary gains i tink. But even though they cant/do not like to cook, they can still do housework though. 
              
              But i believe that things like these shouldn't be labelled as"girls need mothers to teach them how to cook/do housework" because things like these are to be shared b/w the guy and the girl. Work+housework+cooking can be exhausting so best way to go about it is to share the load.Thats probably something for the TS to tink about?

              <p>I dont think its a big issue whether a girl can do housework anot. I dont think its a must these days and most guys wont mind one. As long as the lady is a good girl at heart, guys will appreciate her for sure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But what actually puts guys off are the unrealistic demands and stuck up attitudes of many singaporean women. A lot of singaporean women tend to have the mentality to ask &amp; think of what can the guy do for me, rather than what can I do for my guy.</p>

              yea true that it is unrealistic to expect the female to bear the entire burden, but we should at the very very least expect them to at least be able to bear so burden, meaning i feel they do not have to do everything but at least know how to do something.While it is not right that we make them work+housework+cook and many more. But it is also not right if they tell us say cannot cook, dunno housework blah blah. Though i honestly do not tink that there's alot of such girls.
              
              As for xiaogougou: i totally agree with you. What turns us off are the unrealistic expectations and demands of the girl on the guy. Their unreasonable interpretation of whats gentlemen and whats ungentlemen is to me basically an unfair judgement on guys.But well, the creation of this thread is to a certain extent unfair to the ladies as well.
