              <p>Re: SG girls</p>
              <p>I beg to differ, to the male Singaporeans in this forum. Many Singaporean women and girls, especially teenagers too, CAN and WILL cook,<strong> if asked properly</strong> or if it's because of their duty to their family. I have been cooking alternately with my mum and sometimes dad too, ever since Lower Sec sch days, ever since we all learnt home economics, for my then grandma (she suffered from Parkinson's Disease ---- a miracle, she survived 12 years, died from pneumonia) cos she's my <em>most beloved person in the whole wide world. </em>I still remember how my grandma hid the cane in the nook and cranny between the gaps of the bedrooom wardrobe from my mum when she wanted to cane my younger brother and I. Even my younger brother, now 27 years of age (I turn 29 this Nov), knows how to cook to survive and even made a chocolate milo-like ice-cream before years back when he was in Lower Secondary. :)</p>
              <p>And we're all lacto-vegetarians since 1993, now mostly organic vegans. Optimistic teachings of culinary art ought to be passed down from our grandparents' and parents' generations --- that's why there are SO many cookbooks stocked in Popular bookstore, Big Bookshop etc.</p>
              <p>To those SG girls out there who're "spoilt" and don't know how to even cook a simple "rice, 2 dishes n 1 soup" for loved ones, I say, BUCK UP!!!</p>

              <p>If they don't see $$ very big, they would hv just married their own countrymen instead of offering themself out as mail-order-brides. It's just that if you compare their standards &amp; wants to SG, due to the disparity in living standards, it seems much less.</p>

              <p>Re: SG girls</p>
              <p>I beg to differ, to the male Singaporeans in this forum. Many Singaporean women and girls, especially teenagers too, CAN and WILL cook, <strong>if asked properly</strong> or if it's because of their duty to their family. I have been cooking alternately with my mum and sometimes dad too, ever since Lower Sec sch days, ever since we all learnt home economics, for my then grandma (she suffered from Parkinson's Disease ---- a miracle, she survived 12 years, died from pneumonia) cos she's my <em>most beloved person in the whole wide world.</em> I still remember how my grandma hid the cane in the nook and cranny between the gaps of the bedrooom wardrobe from my mum when she wanted to cane my younger brother and I. Even my younger brother, now 27 years of age (I turn 29 this Nov), knows how to cook to survive and even made a chocolate milo-like ice-cream before years back when he was in Lower Secondary. :)</p>
              <p>And we're all lacto-vegetarians since 1993, now mostly organic vegans. Optimistic teachings of culinary art ought to be passed down from our grandparents' and parents' generations --- that's why there are SO many cookbooks stocked in Popular bookstore, Big Bookshop etc.</p>
              <p>To those SG girls out there who're "spoilt" and don't know how to even cook a simple "rice, 2 dishes n 1 soup" for loved ones, I say, BUCK UP!!!</p>

However, if you look at it from another angle, we are actually less manipulative. Doesn’t help on the attitude that most SG girls are independent and able to stand on their own feet too and know their rights that they neglect to make their guy feel wanted. </span></p>

              <p><br>Society and the way the citizens behavor is shaped by the policymakers here, and that is the govt. So, whenever the govt said, why there is less marriage, less birthrates, or less people willing to take up lower job and rather be jobless, they are actually asking themselves. But sadly, they did not know it, their policies is what shape the society today, they should be asking themselves, what to do? not why like this and like that kind of act good but shit brain</p>
