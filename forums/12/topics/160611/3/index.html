Sometimes they do am able to read your mind on how you felt. But naturally they get a bit too carry away with things around her (eg. friends..blah blah blah)<br><br>But let me ask you again, what is it about her that you fell in love with in the first place? Is it not her kindness and helpfullness towards the people around her (which includes yourself)?<br><br>As for her going out with guys friends and blah blah blah (especially a particular person) you just gotta learn to trust her more. I'm not saying she should be trusted but then again why is a person called a criminal when he never commits a crime? You can't put a sentence on a person until he/she is found guilty of felony.<br><br>As for her to forget your dates and remember others, just let it be bah or take the first move to ask her and her friends out for activities instead of just you two. My gf, like yours, love to be around friends alot and sometime I do feel that I'm depriving her of her life to go out with me alone although she never really do admit it. And please be informed that I only get to see her once or twice a year cause we are in different country and I don't travel to Malaysia so often and she seldoms come in too. So meet up time is very precious but then it's just her to love to be with friends especially if I meet up with her in KL where most of her friends are there and she's currently back to stay in her hometown in Trengganu which is 5hrs drive away from KL.<br><br>As much as I wanted to spend quality time with her alone in KL, I know she wants to meet up with some of her good friends there too as she doesnt' have much chance to drive to KL to meet them. So why should I be selfish? I have my life and my needs and she got her life and her needs. Just give and take on both sides. It doesn't cost you a flesh to give in right? I don't see it as giving in either but more like being understanding.<br><br>Pal, for your information, I'm a pisces and I'm sure I'm more sensitive than you but I still try to cope with my situation with my gf. Just try lah, to each of it's own. I can't force you to be like me either cause you are not me. But no harm trying. If in the end you still think it's too hard on you, then the final decision still lies with you. Have a good talk with her how you feel. It's really ok if you two did talk about it before. Won't kill you to say it again and again right? I know it can be quite tiring but it's worth it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

By the way, don't you always find something that is quite true in horoscope whenever you read it?<br><br>While I respect individuals' choices in their belief systems, I personally wouldn't advocate the reliance on horoscopes. Maybe I am a Man of Science, or rather, Man of Social Sciences, specifically.<br><br>For ReliverX, what you are feeling is normal, and it is easy to hear people telling you to give your partner personal space, be tolerant, etc, etc, etc... For me, I believe it's just a matter of differences in personalities and character, and the most important thing to do is to <strong>communicate effectively</strong> with her. Talk with her.<br><br>However, there is the possibility that both of you are just not meant to be together due to differences in your personalities and expectations. However, as both of you as well as the relationship mature, you may just get to realise that things would work out fine eventually as your love for each other grows deeper and deeper and both of you start thinking for each other more and more. Remember: Loving is giving.. <strong>True </strong>love is wanting your loved one to be happy, not you yourself to be happy and satisfied.<br><br>At the same time, you must keep your options open. Anyway, you are still young. And precisely because both of you are young, there is a possibility that either or both of you just cannot seem to be able to find the right way to love.<br><br>Lastly, just be assured that there's nothing wrong with you. Just enjoy the relationship and learn as it grows..<br><br></div>

True that there are girls who are like what you mention but don't sink the whole boat just because of one woman. A man's heart has not much diff with a woman's heart. You need some respect from them and they demand the same from you. What gives you the right to demand first?<br><br>I rather learn to trust, to respect and to love them first before I dare to say I've done what I could to deserve some respect and love from them. I do admit that after putting in so much and they still betray my trust in them then is no longer my fault that they strayed. I'll feel sad, but sadness will eventually go away but not guilt.
