Somehow.. You're one who doesn't believe in horoscopes..?<br><br>Nonetheless...<br><br>You're the more dominant type in a relationship. Likes to be in control.

Doesn't necessarily means that she's a flirt, but just the nature ability to be one... 'Overly friendly' with guys which is something you have little tolerance for....<br><br>I would GUESS you're somehow ATTRACTED to her SOFT and FEMINE SIDE...

Some couples can be REAL COMPATIBLE... While others might be totally 'contradicting'... But ultimately, it's really how they see things and how they handle it...?<br><br>As much as your gf loves to go against your way and go out with guys... She really should be enjoying the concern and attention you're giving to her because of all that.. As long as you don't overdo things, she should be 'cool' with it... And as long as you don't really irritates her, she shouldn't give you 'bigger problems'... My GUESS is you should have already tasted 'bigger problems' before from her and understand clearly what I'm trying to say.... The INTERESTING PART in your relationship is that IF you couldn't be bother with her going out with other guys, that could give you some problems with her to...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Hence, what I'm trying to say here is to REGULATE...<br><br>There's a REBEL NATURE in HER... She LOVES the way you're trying to CONTROL and YET YOU CAN'T... She loves the way she can 'overthrow' your DOMINANT NATURE.... It's a way of her telling you "she's really in control"...

Some couples can be REAL COMPATIBLE... While others might be totally 'contradicting'... But ultimately, it's really how they see things and how they handle it...?<br><br>As much as your gf loves to go against your way and go out with guys... She really should be enjoying the concern and attention you're giving to her because of all that.. As long as you don't overdo things, she should be 'cool' with it... And as long as you don't really irritates her, she shouldn't give you 'bigger problems'... My GUESS is you should have already tasted 'bigger problems' before from her and understand clearly what I'm trying to say.... The INTERESTING PART in your relationship is that IF you couldn't be bother with her going out with other guys, that could give you some problems with her to...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Hence, what I'm trying to say here is to REGULATE...<br><br>There's a REBEL NATURE in HER... She LOVES the way you're trying to CONTROL and YET YOU CAN'T... She loves the way she can 'overthrow' your DOMINANT NATURE.... It's a way of her telling you "she's really in control"... If you really care for the relationship, just keep the whole thing IN BALANCE...</div></blockquote>Hmm...<br>I think I more on the offensive side, because I'm quite sensitive to words.<br>Besides, she doesn't know those words could made me think this way.<br>She tells me she's not interested in other guys, just going out with them wasn't anything but as a friend. This i understood. But i never told her that i didn't like her going out with other guys.<br><br>I don't think she's rebelling. She doesn't understand the relationship well because its still early and young. She's not that experiance relationships and i expect too much.<br><br>Just worried. Because, she's a soft and kind person,I was afraid of things to happen to her. thanks Devil.<br>For the explanation and enlightenment.<br></div>
