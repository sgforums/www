If you are then I don't think you'll make these kind of comments.<br><br>[quote]<strong>You are a man. A women have to give and take into what you want. Of course the man does too unless you are sure that she's interested into you. </strong>Correction. In a relationship, both parties have to give and take and not just the woman have to give and take into what the man wants. Bear in mind again, while you are choose people. People are considering if you are worth choosing too. To make it more harsh, if I'm the girl you are going after, for sure I won't choose you cause you ain't the best and not even near it. At least not after what I read from your post.<br><br><blockquote><strong>You deserve someone better. In my humble opinion, your girlfriend doesn't fit into my standards. I would just tell her straight in the face I want out this relationship out. </strong></blockquote>I pray you'll never find a gf cause I don't want any woman to be a victim of MCP. But then again I do doubt that you'll ever find a gf. If you happen to be attached, I bet that girl is just a dumb bimbo or a hardcore fetish who needs some wanking to moan.<br><br><blockquote><strong>You are acting like a girl in this relationship.</strong></blockquote>If he's a girl in that r/s then you probably are the only man with the brain in the wrong head.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Women are smart creatures. Smart enough to cover their doings. I know.<br>You tell me she's inexperienced in a relationship, don't give excuses.<br>I bet you suffer and end up being dumped first I can forsee in this relationship.</strong></blockquote>Yah..if the gf is with you, I'm sure you'll suffer and end up being dump. But then again I don't think you'll ever have the chance of being dump cause you are seeking the perfect woman which never exist.<br><br><blockquote><strong>When a women don't tell you who and which guy she's going with, something is fishy.<br>Firstly, you as her other half, have the right to know who she's hanging out with and where.</strong></blockquote>It's never always the case. Maybe towards you yes because you are too narrow minded and everytime she goes out with someone you'll act like a pig and start snorting. Who will want to tell you who they go out with? And please bear in mind, we do have the right to know who they are going out with but they reserve the right not to tell us too. Just relax and learn to trust them. If they wanna stray, there's nothing you can do to stop them. But learning to trust your partners will in turn gain their trust on you if they really do love you.<br><br><blockquote><strong>And of course you get edgy and attempt to get answers from her, then you will come across insecure in needy in this relationship.

I don't even dare to say I'm honest with my gf but at least I know she don't have to worry that I'll stray out.<br><br><blockquote><strong>What I'm telling you is to be a man.

In my opinion after reading both your post, I think you sound more like a loser or a badly wounded person injured by your ex-gf. God bless your ex as she found freedom after losing you.<br></strong></div>
