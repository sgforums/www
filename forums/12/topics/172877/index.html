Yeah, but I understand that sometimes it gets too hard and we have to exchange money for happiness.  The decision will be yours alone, I guess.....because only you will know how you feel.<br><br>As far as I know, this is a very unfair and unusual contract.  In the future, please be careful when signing any long-term commitment or financial contracts.  Just remember that in most cases, you're not obliged to sign it there and then.  You can bring the contract back to ask for the opinions of your family and friends first.<br><br></div>
