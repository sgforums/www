            <div class='col-md body'>People will always grow from experiences. Its whether they learn it as a lesson or take it as something bad happening to them n continue to transform them into anger n frustration and stray themselves from the right path.<br><br>Every mistake we make , every bad decision , wrong and hurtful situation is always a result of our own actions and also inactions of another.<br><br>I totally understand what T.S means. We will never know whether the bad experiences , the bad incidents that never shouldve have happened , happened to us... and why. But it happened. N from that it may have shaped our character and opened our eyes.Some go downhill from there , some learn from it and try to climb back up with the burden of fear,anger and frustration weighting on their back There are many instances , where we all experience a different experiences in life. Maybe not the same but similiar , but how we handled the situations may differ and the result is what we are today.<br><br>The memories will always haunt us. But its the ability of the person to learn from it and change for the better. He himself will chose the path he has chosen and through every action he makes he can feel and know the end result , and with every path chosen he can either correct the sail or continue on with self destruction.<br><br>but seriously , i have always asked myself that question. That is one of the questions i ask myself every day when people ask about bad experiences in life. Am i a better person after what transpired years ago ? I can say yes.. and until today i have regretted the actions and decisions i have made upon myself and others. The marks i left on others and the repercussions of those actions on me today.Did i do what i had to do right ? even though it was wrong , but based on the situation and the state of mind , i thought it was the best possible course. What would i be like if i have never experienced all those events and painful lesson ? I will never know, but i know i am who i am today.</div>

N from that it may have shaped our character and opened our eyes.Some go downhill from there , some learn from it and try to climb back up with the burden of fear,anger and frustration weighting on their back There are many instances , where we all experience a different experiences in life. Maybe not the same but similiar , but how we handled the situations may differ and the result is what we are today.<br><br>The memories will always haunt us. But its the ability of the person to learn from it and change for the better. He himself will chose the path he has chosen and through every action he makes he can feel and know the end result , and with every path chosen he can either correct the sail or continue on with self destruction.<br><br>but seriously , i have always asked myself that question. That is one of the questions i ask myself every day when people ask about bad experiences in life. Am i a better person after what transpired years ago ? I can say yes.. and until today i have regretted the actions and decisions i have made upon myself and others. The marks i left on others and the repercussions of those actions on me today.Did i do what i had to do right ? even though it was wrong , but based on the situation and the state of mind , i thought it was the best possible course. What would i be like if i have never experienced all those events and painful lesson ? I will never know, but i know i am who i am today.</div></blockquote>bravo.. I agree.. the most impt thing is to learn from what happened...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Atheist?  I am not asking you to turn to God.  What started me rolling when I was enrolled into NS.  I only became a Christian 1 yr after NS. NS has changed a lot of me inside out and I learn to be more confident and I my so call self doubt, low esteem started to disappear as I progress.  Christian only made sense to what things are ahppening and becoming meaningful to me.<br><br>Anybody too, can experience this but all only just need a spur of moment to change things around just like mine as I was drifting along and NS came so early for me as I drag or was trying to avoid getting in then.. .. How wrong I was...</div>
