              <p>Hi all</p>
              <p>I'm writing on behalf of my fiance. We really need advice right now cause we are clueless on what to do.</p>
              <p>So the story goes like this. Please bear with me.</p>
              <p>My fiance and his ex boss together with some of his colleagues went overseas for an assignment. And they got bored one day so they decided to hang out and play this stupid guessing game and whoever got it wrong will have to pay 1 month salary and vice versa. My fiance 'lost' 4 times so the boss said he won't claim it from him since they are just playing.</p>
              <p>But when back in SG he asked him to sign an IOU and blindly my fiance did. He was new with the company at that point so he signed it (yes I know its stupid). His boss even said he won't asked from it but that defeat the purpose of signing it right?</p>
              <p>And so my fiance left the company and this boss of his actually asked him to pay $7,654.00 to him and actually send him a lawyer letter. And in that lawyer letter it state that it was a FRIENDLY LOAN by his boss.</p>
              <p>So you think is it worth it to engage a lawyer? We are getting married in 5 months and really can't afford if alot of money is involved and furthermore how sure are we to win the case. If we lost we have to pay their legal fees too.</p>
              <p>The only losing part for us that my fiance signed the IOU. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>
              <p>But if we pay its like we pay for nothing since we do not use the $$$ at all.</p>
              <p>Please advice. Thanks.</p>
              </div>

              <p>First rule - never gamble on what you cannot afford. <br><br>I will seek legal advice - as the IOU may have its fault - as friendly loan - but  he never pass money to your finance .  Just like bank loan - you can sign the loan stuff but if the bank did not pass the $ to you - it is voided - the transaction did not happen.<br><br>Next it sound like a con - that the boss and colleague set him up.</p>
              <p>Well let them hound all they want - stand fast and don't pay.  what can they do - go small claim court ? Let see how they justified.</p>

              <p><br>what Bio-hawk say make sense !!!</p>
              <p>A person lost 1 time = dumb -  4 times ? are you sure you want to marry such a man. <br>Sign a contract ?</p>
              <p>Go see a lawyer.  Frankly there is some hidden things your other 1/2 did not tell you. <br>I think a lawyer can advice better on if there is any case.  and if - possible he can represent you all for a part of the sum settlement.</p>

              <p>it much depends on what constitute as a loan, a gambling debt, or a gift...no evidence of transaction and was held as a friendly loan...through "guessing game"....</p>
              <p>no doubt IOU could essentially be forceful in the court of law, but not as powerful as that of promissory note which is very legally binding with terms or demands of payment within specified timeframe....</p>
              <p>it is contestable in which the circumstances that led you to sign the IOU and the contents of which may constitute as a promissory note if it fulfils all elements of a negotiable instrument or bill of exchange act...</p>
              <p>Also, from your admission, is the "game" lawful? There are also specified gaming laws i.e. Gaming Act in Singapore and a guessing game may well not be lawful and reversing it as a "friendly loan" which could be construed as an ill intentioned ploy...it is still contestable if you could gather witnesses...all but to engage a lawyer to fight it...</p>
              <p>your chance is still 50-50....just my view...</p>

              <p>Hey all.. Thanks for the reply.</p>
              <p>Hahaha he's not a gambler lah. 4 years plus I'm with him he never gambled. I don't know why suddenly that day he abit gong one. I already blast at him for his stupidity so that aside I know I really need to be there for him at this point of time. I think maybe he thinks since he is new to the company at that point of time he never really thought its gonna get this serious since its just a stupid game.</p>
              <p>I think its been a month already and their lawyer just sent us a letter to ask us to pay up within 7 days or they will take lagal action or something like that.</p>
              <p>He actually make a police report so I have read it so can't be he is lying right? And I also saw the messages given by their accountant too. But the thing is, he is not given a copy of the IOU so I do not know what's in their content but he says the IOU just state that he needs to pay the $7K.</p>
              <p>And we also went to make an appointment with the legal clinic but our appointment is on 3rd October so we're afraid in between the time their lawyer will send another letter.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>I find your's fiance's account strange. why would anyone sign an IOU, if its a joke?</p>
              <p>Its like me asking you "Hey, would you sign this blank cheque for me? its just for fun." No person of normal intellect would do that.</p>
              <p>And i believe in law of average. Your fiance's ex-boss couldn't be winning all the time. So did the boss sign any IOU for anyone else?</p>
              <p>And since your fiance seems to be the only one holding IOUs, I think its quite fishy. I believe that he is hiding something from you.</p>
              <p>And to the other forumers. There is nothing illegal about the boss's actions.</p>
              <p>The illegal moneylender's act only applies to people who loan out money for profit, in the form of interest. IOUs are legally enforcible if it is an interest free loan.</p>
              <p>So, TS, please do go dig out all the details from your fiance, before you self-pawn yourself in court.</p>

              Please find out what really happened from your boyfriend's former colleagues. They have no reason to lie to you. 
              
              You have to decide what you want to do next when you find out the truth. No one is perfect. Forgive and forget if you think he is a good man and deserve another chance.
