              <p>Hi all</p>
              <p>I'm writing on behalf of my fiance. We really need advice right now cause we are clueless on what to do.</p>
              <p>So the story goes like this. Please bear with me.</p>
              <p>My fiance and his ex boss together with some of his colleagues went overseas for an assignment. And they got bored one day so they decided to hang out and play this stupid guessing game and whoever got it wrong will have to pay 1 month salary and vice versa. My fiance 'lost' 4 times so the boss said he won't claim it from him since they are just playing.</p>
              <p>But when back in SG he asked him to sign an IOU and blindly my fiance did. He was new with the company at that point so he signed it (yes I know its stupid). His boss even said he won't asked from it but that defeat the purpose of signing it right?</p>
              <p>And so my fiance left the company and this boss of his actually asked him to pay $7,654.00 to him and actually send him a lawyer letter. And in that lawyer letter it state that it was a FRIENDLY LOAN by his boss.</p>
              <p>So you think is it worth it to engage a lawyer? We are getting married in 5 months and really can't afford if alot of money is involved and furthermore how sure are we to win the case. If we lost we have to pay their legal fees too.</p>
              <p>The only losing part for us that my fiance signed the IOU. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>
              <p>But if we pay its like we pay for nothing since we do not use the $$$ at all.</p>
              <p>Please advice. Thanks.</p>

              Before you decide what to do next. 
              Please ask yourself the following questions:
              How and when you come to know about this matter?
              After receiving the letter?
              Is it logical for a company boss to cheat your fiance?
              Did your fiance tell you the full story?
              
              Please ask your fiance to do credit bureau screening to determine whether he is in debt.
              If he is in debt, how he get into such situation? Addicted to gambling?
              
              Please find out more before your next course of action.
              
              Not to worry. Your fiance will not become a bankrupt for owing someone 7K. It is not logical for a company boss to settle this matter in court as the amount is not great enough for him to do so.

              <p>Hey all.. Thanks for the reply.</p>
              <p>Hahaha he's not a gambler lah. 4 years plus I'm with him he never gambled. I don't know why suddenly that day he abit gong one. I already blast at him for his stupidity so that aside I know I really need to be there for him at this point of time. I think maybe he thinks since he is new to the company at that point of time he never really thought its gonna get this serious since its just a stupid game.</p>
              <p>I think its been a month already and their lawyer just sent us a letter to ask us to pay up within 7 days or they will take lagal action or something like that.</p>
              <p>He actually make a police report so I have read it so can't be he is lying right? And I also saw the messages given by their accountant too. But the thing is, he is not given a copy of the IOU so I do not know what's in their content but he says the IOU just state that he needs to pay the $7K.</p>
              <p>And we also went to make an appointment with the legal clinic but our appointment is on 3rd October so we're afraid in between the time their lawyer will send another letter.</p>

              <p>Just ignore the lawyers' letter. If it really come to the crunch, and the case go to court, which imo will not happen, it can be proven that it is just a game. The IOU isn also part of the game. Some more it is an unfair game,  as the one month salary of the players is not equal.</p>
              <p>Don't do or say any more things until 3 Oct.</p>
              <p>The cause of all this problem is ... stupidity, and I believe the judge will know, if it ever comes before him.</p>

              <p>Cause he has this thing call RESPECT for people. And FYI, his salary is not even less than 2k. They calculate using the 'official' salary and not as a whole.</p>
              <p>And we're not even eligible for the legal aid as we owned a car, bike and a pending house. So I guess if this matter is really handed over to the court we have to either engage a lawyer or defend ourselves. But as you all know lawyers aren't cheap. That's what has been bugging us.</p>

              A lawyer letter will cost the boss a couple of hundred dollars. He is unlikely to spend 7K on lawyer to recover 7K from your fiance. And more importantly he may not win the case.
              
              I think he is unhappy because your fiance had left his company. He send him letter to release his unhappiness. More so to make your fiance worry. So if you are worried, you are falling into his trap. Just ignore him. Be happy. By the way trained lawyers are helping out the MP during the meet the people session. You can approach your MP for assistance if you cannot wait till 3 Oct. The outcome will help you to decide who you should vote for in 2006.

              <p>So even if they have black and white IOU doesn't mean can anyhow go court one is it?</p>
              <p>And why do you think 'he may not win the case'?</p>
              <p>I thought of that too. Maybe he is unhappy when he resigned. Asked to pay this and that.</p>
              <p>And its just my fiances' luck that he have to work almost 24/7 with them and this is what they repays him.</p>

              <p>keep the lawyer letters and dont pay a single cent.</p>
              <p>yes, approach your mp for help.</p>
              <p>you can ask your hubby that it is just a game, verbally spoken right? no black and white agreement right? so, your hubby shouldnt pay a single cent.</p>
              <p>for iou, ignore it.</p>
              <p>probably that ex boss wanted to con some money from your hubby.</p>
              <p>oh ya, maybe report the case to the police. have a statement and reference number from the police report to support the case.</p>

              <p>As for the free advice from the MPS, I didn't know it existed. I would be discerning if they say they can't give a clear answer on your case.</p>
              <p>Firstly, you're not a paying client, they don't owe any professional duty to you. Who want to give advice that might cause you to suffer loss?</p>
              <p>Secondly, who would want to hire a top class lawyer to dish out free advice to peasants?</p>
              <p>Just relax.</p>

              <p>But then it's extremely retarded of your fiance to ratify it with an IOU, else under the influence of alcohol would have been a good defence. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>They were hanging out at coffee bistro when they played that game so I guess no alcohol was involved? And he doesn't drink too. :)</p>
              <p>The police give us a list to go for help at the subordinate court, which we did, hence we're awaiting for 3rd October for the legal advice.</p>
