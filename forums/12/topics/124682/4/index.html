            <div class='col-md body'>color ghost u are really damn right. Don really need to worry about wat pple think of u. Actually, in actual and real fact in yr current situation, they are not even thinking about u. I am not out here to insult u, but it is the truth. I am a very proud person, not in the sense of showing off, but it is my character that i have lots of pride. I used to be the same as u, not daring to make mistakes at all (not going to elaborate cuz i'm the same). But i slowly got to learn that i was, and u ARE TOO SENSITIVE!!<br><br>But let me tell u, u have of the ingredients to become one of the most successful people there would ever exist. Ok tat sounded a bit over the hill, but bottom line is, u dont noe how high ur potential is yet, juz why u always low confidence. So i'm here to tell u. Being serious most of the time is not yr fault. Come on, think positively. It is one of the factors pple would look up to u, that is when u do gain confedence.<br><br>And how do u gain confidence? Go around with a smile on yr face, give a simple morning when u see pple u noe. A smile can release homornes into yr brain so u wont feel so nervous. Of cuz u r going to tell me u wont dare cuz pple will feel why u suddenly behaving like tat. So, try that on friends whom u noe and they noe u. No matter how small the number, they r still good enough.. How many bloody friends do u need? A full table of hundred? Stop living in LALa land. A few close ones are enough. Note: Please i beg u at least sit with yr class during breaks even if u dont like to. If still cannot talk den neminds, juz sit there. Try to join any conversation if possible. If they go huh den please juz explain again. FUCK care them, juz stare straight into their eyes when u talking, trust me, will gain confidence one.<br><br>It takes time, i noe. Don worry, juz carry on plugging away. Of cuz, a new environment helps, but make the most of wat u have. U r a fighter my friend, u really r, i have not read that u feel like giving up, and i noe u wont. Tat again is a charateristic of a leader. A good one in fact. With yr experience, u would sympathise with minorities, yr seriousness would carry yr team through any circumstances. Exert yrself on conversations, of cuz only if u got anything good to say. If u don feel comfortable, den leave the conversation lor.<br><br>I am an introvert too, but not an anti social. Be wild with yr group of friends, have they forsaken u or have u done so yrself in situation? Maybe yr talents lie somewhere else. A normal person does not mean someone who talks non stop. These may actually be pple who feel so insecure tat if they don talk they feel pple don like them. We are humans, made differently my friend. If u do not love yrself in the first place, don expect others to love u. Put this in mind, be brave and hit everything which comes head on. Sori if u dont understand some things i said cuz my essay writing skills not very good. These are the principles i have always lived by since i decided to forced myself not to be so sensitive. And these are my achievements: I'm not arrogant, juz letting u noe it can be done, there are many better than me but i consider myself lucky cuz of my late development: I am a student councillor, a secretary who is better than the president in my other cca cuz i joined late, i am a part time councellor for my school mates and have a healthy rapport with my teachers too. But i always remember the people who are quiet, value their opinions.<br><br>From what i have written please forgive if i sounded too big headed, i juz want u to noe that watever happens to u, many go through worse and comes out alive and kicking. I'm not very to the point here cuz of bad phrasing, i apologise. But if u can trust me to bring u through this crisis of yours, juz leave me a personal message. Believe tat there r pple around who will not leave u juz because they r uncomfortable, there may be other reasons. Will be waiting to hear from u</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by I_Need_U:</div><div class="quote_body">color ghost u are really damn right. .....</div></blockquote>Thanks, personally I been through that phase, and I realised that if you want to be accepted, it has to start from within.  The moment I finished secondary school I decided to adopt this new strategy.  It worked brilliantly.  And to top it off, I was almost to the point of anti-social as a child, with parents never understanding my exasperated outbursts, my extreme fear of socialising....it was a lonely path so to speak.  I made a resolution that I wanted to be successful in life, I have to, and will need to, mingle.  I did it.  I believe so can anyone.  I'm no elitest or anyone with great credentials.</div>

But then I realised one thing, the moment you try too hard to impress and always wanted to leave a good impression, or you try very hard not to embarass yourself, things always turn out SHIT. Gals shake their head at me and guys thinks I am a jerk.<br><br>But 8 years ago things changed, and I like to share it.<br><br>I realised I have to be natural, talked around something which happened recently to stay connected and kept conversation short when meeting people, unless you are teaching something. I studied popular ppl in my circle of friends and learn about hand gestures and appropriate physical contact too. Be quick to admit genuine mistakes you have said wrongly &amp; done wrongly. People know you never fight just to 'save face'.<br><br>Another thing. Mix with big company (but not hang out &amp; waste time) with lots of people and you will learn lots of socialising skills.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HeyÂ…. U r exactly e same like me! Its called social phobia, if I aint wrong. I am always afraid n feel that pple r looking at meÂ….. n I get extremely nervous n anxious around pple n always have fast increased heart beatsÂ…Â…. It got so worse that I cant even write in lectures n eat around with peopleÂ…Â… school, everyday was a nightmare<br><br>Dun worry I believe social phobia can b curedÂ….. for mi, I think e best way is medication combined with self- help therapiesÂ…. Pls do not be stigmatized by the thought of seeking help from a psychratistÂ….. Social phobia is a medical condition such like diabetes n heart diseaseÂ…Â… it caused by the chemical inbalances in the brainÂ….. n usually strikes at late teenage or early adulthoodÂ…Â…Â…<br><br>U do not have to let pple know tt u r gonna c a psychriatist if u mindÂ…Â…. Mayb u should drop by to c e school counselor to tok about ur social phobia problem n she will arrange for contacts to c docs at nuh or imhÂ…Â… dun worry the pple r friendly n u will be glad to take of such a first step to seek for their helpÂ…Â….<br><br>One thing, to correct of ur misconception on medicationÂ…Â….. its not addictive like drugs such as nicotineÂ…. Where the hell did u read tt from? If in doubt, always ask e doc instead of jumping into conclusions from books ok? U have to b patient abt e meditcation though, its effects will settle gradually over monthsÂ…Â… but believe mi, it will make those anxious moments easier to handleÂ…Â…<br><br>Be brave! Take the first step and u will b let into a world less of anxieties n negative thoughtsÂ…. Be strong in ur journey, do not despairÂ….. Take steps slowly one at a time n I believe u will succeed!<br></div>

While you're feeling better, just GO AHEAD and MEET PEOPLE....<br><br>Once you're getting the hang of it, can try clearing off the drugs and be ON YOUR OWN....<br><br>And don't have any PHOBIA about getting OFF the drugs...<br><br>Ultimately, the drugs is suppose to just give you a good 'kick off'... How things go from there is very much ON YOUR OWN... It's just like a certification for studies... Get the JOB, then it's really depending on HOW YOU PERFORM?<br><br>While you're feeling good or better on the drugs, don't RELY ON IT TOTALLY and think that things are just fine now... WORK ON IT... TAKE ADVANTAGE of the mental condition the drugs has landed you IN... You're quite right about one thing... IF you RELY on the DRUGS alone to WORK THE MIRACLE for you, sooner or later, you might be no difference from a drug addict... Addictive or not is really up to individual's mentality (reliance on the feeling and condition the drugs can give and how they manage the dosage...)...<br><br>Disturbed mind -- (after drugs therapy)--&gt; Stablised and chemically 'balanced' brain (on drugs) ----&gt; As time goes on, requirement on dosage to maintain condition gets higher -- (self-therapy and mentality conditioning)--&gt; Once the brain has reached a level of 'self-substained' and 'balanced' brain chemicals, get off the drugs and let the brain works on its own....<br><br><strong>Points to note 'post-therapy'.</strong> Always try to maintain a lower stress level and constantly 'therapy' yourself if possible at a more relaxing pace. Understand that stress and such are just PART of lives. And SOMETIMES you just don't wish to meet people. Doesn't mean that your therapy is a failure or your condition has comes back to haunt you. The deeper you fall back into such 'delusioned beliefs', the deeper you set yourself back into depression and isolation...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Brain chemicals become imbalanced again...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your condition is not the worst lar, there are people who suffer worst then you.<br><br>Once I was small, girls will run away from the sight of me cos I was too big and look like a Gaint. At least in your life your friends just shun you, but in my life, girls really run away.<br><br>you know how it feels? You can only see and hope for someone to accept you.<br><br>I finally learn the right way for people to accept me for what I am, is to start helping people. If you cannot talk to people is ok, just help them silently. slowly and surely it will open up a new hope for people to accept.<br><br>The first steps may be hard on you but if you never give up hope , you will be like me now I got so many  friends that I cannot cope. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Life is short, you will never go when you will go. Start slow, talk to a few friends first. Hey we are here talking to you rite? we are your friends too.
