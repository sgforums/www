            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Congenial,<br><br>I gather u're still a student, then? : )  From wat u sez'd abt ur parents' reaction, it's probable tt it's Not tt they're uncomfy ard u, but they rgd ur situation as a case of teen angst.  Some parents try to deal wif it head on, some take a passive stance, some dunno wat to do @ all.  Ur parents may fall into the latter category.<br><br>As difficult as ur situation may be now, it may be a case of teen angst, &amp; this, I haf a similar life story to share.  There was an ex-schoolmate of mine.  She was kinda like u, in tt she made few frens.  To others, she appeared aloof, horrid, mean, acid-tongued &amp; sarcastic (I'm Not sez'g u r!!!  Juz tt the situation is like urs).  Deep inside tho, she was desperate to be accepted &amp; liked.  She wanted to belong to a grp of frens, to noe tt she is liked.<br><br>I remained in touch wif her till I started working (then lost touch wif her, cosh of our bz schedules *sighz*).  To date, I'm still Not sure wat really changed her, but she became a much happier person, more confident, more outgoing, etc.  When I spoke to her abt the positive change, she told me, "HAHA, I guess age has made a difference!"<br><br>So take heart.  It cld be a case of teen angst, which, along wif ur self-consciousness, will probably pass.  There will come a time when u go, "Wat the heck, I'll juz go out &amp; make frens"!  U'll never noe : )  Meantime, try to remain positive : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Congenial:</div><div class="quote_body">thanx for the warm words you people..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>a lot of times i just stay in the room with the PC.<br><br>i cant even talk to my parents, even they themselves feel uncomfortable around me.<br><br>i just cant talk to them. they think im a normal kid whos going thru that typical hormonal changes.<br><br>but they donnoe that the pain inside is really unbearable.<br><br>i just lock myself in the room sometimes, if things get unbearable. its not just extemely shy, i think its more painful than that.<br><br>i have told people about it, and no one seems to understand, even my good friend. hes the only one that accepts me for who i am, thus our lasting friendship.<br><br>a lot people, when they see people like me, yah, they say they would help, but when after meeting and knowing me, they would just leave me alone in the lurch, enjoying themselves with their friends.<br><br>then they will message u "im sure ull get better"<br></div></blockquote></div>

They base their opinions on looks, behaviour and often, with the young crowd, what their peers think. I can only ask you to start trying <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">not</span></strong> to let their lack of understanding of you affect your reason for living. If these people don't even bother to get to know you before they judge you, are they worth even your consideration of their opinions?<br><br>If you are quiet and shy by nature, it's possible for others to perceive you as "stuck up". It's really difficult, if you are very introverted, to open yourself to others rightaway, I can understand that.  There are many unkind people in this world, but there are really nice ones too.  Keep trying, step by step. Try to sit with classmates everyday at the canteen instead of sitting alone, even if you feel they are looking at you strangely.  It gets easier as the days go by and it allows your classmates to get to know you alittle at a time.<br><br>If you aren't sure what to do for projects, try asking the group leader, for a start, "I really want to help but I'm not sure what to do.  I'd really appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction?" Something along those lines.  If you face a problem doing your bit of the project, ask someone, "I've done this (tell them what you've done or what research you've come up with). I'm not sure if it's right. Could I just get your opinion on this?" Chances are you'll get the help you need. Do your best to ignore the looks you're getting.<br><br>To some, other people's opinions of them matter alot. Popular kids or those who have no problem mixing with the "in crowds" can be the most cruel of the lot. But these are also the ones who will have the most difficulty understanding the more quiet and shy ones amongst them bec they have never been put in that position. You have a friend, your religion and you have your family. That's really great. Other friends will come along gradually. If not in school, then as you go along in life. For me, for instance, it's not the quantity of people whom I know or how popular I am. It's the <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">quality</span></strong> of the company I choose to keep and the crowd of friends, however small, whom I know I can trust, confide in and rely on.  What's the point of having a huge book of friends who are only superficial?<br><br>Hang on in there, ok? Try talking to a counsellor, if you have one in school. It helps.</div>

Go for the counselling, even though just the thought of it sickens you. If you've been struggling for a very long time to work it out on your own, there isn't any improvement and you're depressed, you <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">need</span></strong> help from a professional. You've already been putting yourself out there, that alone shows you're a fighter, view the counsellor as just another step you need to take.  This may be the very thing that's going to help you. And if it is, isn't it worth the sweat, nervousness and worry? Don't back out now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HIHI! I was like you too. I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO FRIENDS FOR YEARS UNTIL one day when I forced myself to open up to others. Yup, and I still get gittery at times.<br><br>Try to relax and not think tha much. Do you have any interest or hobbies? maybe you can join the clubs or your cca..you can start by being around people more and like, make small talk to them...ask if they have eaten and stuff. then slowly you will get less nervous around ppl. Or you can try to mix with people younger than you. Cuz you are older, so i guess the nervousness and tension is less?<br><br>I started by nixing around ppl younger than me too. It made me less jittery.</div>
