            <div class='col-md body'>You remind me of me.<br><br>Back when I was in Sec 3, my introvertness + my psuedo-Brit accent (due to my mixed parentage) ensured that a large proportion of my class hated me. They thought I was a snob at the least and an anti-social at the worst. Needless to say, I slipped into a general depression for a long time. It didn't help that I was also estranged with my father (still am, somewhat) and had financial problems to the extent that I often skipped lunch and people thought that I was anorexic (which further aggravated what others thought of me).<br><br>Finally I decided to wake up my ideas and come out of my shell. It took a long time, but eventually others came to accept me for who I am.<br><br>I know it's not easy to want to ask for help. It's perfectly understandable to have apprehension with regards to seeking for help.... you wonder what people may say about you, and you wonder if it's really an honourable thing to do instead of just trying to work things out by yourself.<br><br>Still, sometimes, you do need help. And it takes courage to recognise that you need help and actively seek it. After a close friend of mine took his own life I once again slipped into depression. It was so bad that I couldn't sleep well, eat well, and my health went downhill.<br><br>Yet I resisted seeking help for weeks until I finally decided to talk to a counsellor. She didn't solve my problems and bring him back to life, but I felt a lot better just letting it all out. I'm sure the same ought to apply to you. What's more, no one needs to know about it - only you and the counsellor knows that you sought counselling.<br><br>I'm sure your school ought to have some counselling resources or something. Talk to your lecturers.. they ought to refer you to the relevant people.<br><br>And lastly, I'm glad you are not thinking about suicide. Please don't take your own life.... It's a long way down to nothing at all. I still have my friend's soul weighing down on my conscience... I don't think I can handle two.<br><br>Good luck - do take good care of yourself.</div>
