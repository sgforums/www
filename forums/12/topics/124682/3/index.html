            <div class='col-md body'>I am thinking, the reason that you are shy, is because you are worried at how ppl look at you. Maybe, in your mind, thats why, whenever you tried to initiate conversation, or others who tried to talk to you, you juz clamed up, afraid that you will say the wrong words, or ppl may get the wrong idea abt you. Its this kind of nervous in you, that makes the ppl around you sensing it, and it, in turn makes them uncomfortable to talk to you. And, you feel it too...<br>This is like a vicious cycle.<br>Maybe, first of all, you have to try to be a bit thick-skinned. Say anything that comes into your mind. Don't be afraid that ppl will laugh at you, or make fun of you. Worse come to worse, juz have a good laugh after that. Look around you, and you will realise that those ppl who are popular with frens, are those who do not mind being laugh at, or being ridiculed at.<br>You can do it also. You just have to overcome that emotional barrier.<br>Look, you are doing a great job here. We are all speaking to you. If you do not want to speak to a counsellor, I would suggest, once you got to know us better, we can organise an outing with you. As we know your problem, we are in a better situation to help you open up and teach you how to get around with ppl. How's that?

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh dear...my heart goes out to you.<br><br>Keep in mind that other ppl are also just as nervous as you are when they first meet you.<br><br>I've got a not-so-nice but foolproof advice :<br><br>When you meet a person, look for his/her flaws-be it physically or in his or her mannerisms. Once you've spotted a flaw,aha! Trust me, your self-esteem will be upped a little. Then keep in mind that the person you met also has flaws and shortcomings- just like you ( and the rest of the world!) when you communicate with them.<br><br>The logic is : Why are you so fearful of others when you know that EVERYBODY in this world has flaws....? So you may not look like Brad Pitt but the person you met may not have a gd sense of dressing, has bad teeth, horrible nails, etc etc. The point is to bear in mind that everyone else is as flawed as you are. Hence, you don't have to be so self-conscious all the time.<br><br>The only thing we can do is minimise the amount of flaws we have by constantly improving ourselves. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that congenial should not worry too much about that. Do not let ppl bring you down when they know you are weak in a certain aspect. In this cruel and harsh society, there are bound to be ppl (even though they are married and with a family, things they do outside of their home, spouse and children are no better than the immatured kid next door!) who cover their own flaws by being thick skinned and pushing the blame to others.<br><br>If you are a student i suggest concentrating on your studies. If you encounter difficulty in your school work, dun take it too hard. try your best and even if you scored border line or fail a certain subject, do not lose heart. Try to complete your education and get a certification no matter how tough the social circle may be. You dun have to impress others and show off in the crowd. What you can really do need not be justified by your peers.<br><br>When you step into the working adult life, there will be many others who will sense your weakness in this areas and exploit it to their advantage. Do not make way or slacken else such ppl will use your weakness to achieve their own ends.<br><br>You dun have to be full of friends to be happy, and like what you have said you have go 1 friend whom you can confide to - and one is never too little when it comes to trust.<br><br>Cheer up and so what if you cannot socialise? It is not the end of the world. try to make up for this short fall by polishing up your character, skills, knowledge annd physical health. One can be a sociable party but when things go down and wrong, it is the toughest and strongest who survive.<br><br>You live for your own life...and that is all the reason you need to stay alife until death takes you. Stay happy and funcky  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

My heart goes to you.<br><br>As spoken about the vicious cycle, that is THE reason that lived inside people's thoughts you have interacted.<br><br>The reflection of how people react to us is when we mimic certain behavioral pattern from our personality that causes this impression they have on us. People stick 'to their own kind' for similarity comfort because we are so used to ourselves, when we exude our personality, we attract those that are relatively similar to us.<br><br>You must realise that analysizing and knowing your own plight is not sufficient enough to change ANYTHING.<br><br>Topic like yours spring up occasionally; people with social phobia, extreme shyness, etc - truth is, they speak well in the virtual world, but fail to bring this expertise outside the internet. See, you could construct your own thoughts into words here. Probably because you took your time to construct them and in real life, you wouldn't enjoy such luxury of having to pick the correct words... backspace... save and load... etc.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You DO have the ability to speak what you want.<br><br>However, your mind is jam-pack because you overly analyzes your speech before you speak. Too much consideration, both mental and emotional, and created this deadly clog that gradually grew into a social tumour.<br><br>You are like a survivor of a shipwreck, currently living on an island, desire to leave and return back to civilization. But everytime you build your raft and leave the shoreline, the minute the waves gets strong - you throw yourself into the sea and swim back, while you can, to avoid being drown, for you fear that you probably couldn't if it gets too far into the sea.<br><br>My advice is simple: in the first place, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what DO you have to lose?</strong> </span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>You have virtually no friends; so basically you can attempt ANYTHING and you still wouldn't lose anything. Nothing lose nothing = nothing.<br><br>Your overly consideration this... consideration that... is undesirable. You have your own fear, no doubt - REMOVE THAT and began afresh. Learn to make friends through the heart and not through your own version psychic means of compatiabiliy.<br><br><strong>Change your course, if the things you always do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't</span> work.</strong><br><br>P.S: Do you want to have your raft bring you back to civilization ulimately? IT WILL BE TOUGH... GOD PROMISE YOU THIS. But God also gave you an innate courage to handle challenges. You have it, just that you didn't realise how much you can achieve with it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If you are going to die in the island eventually, you might as well attempt to sail out.</strong></span><br><br>Just do it. Don't just analyzise. Do something about it. Began your first step by seeking professional help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Congenial,<br><br>I'm not sure if what I said would be of any help, but there is ample reason why people think you are arrogant.  The very fact that you could not allow yourself to sound "silly" made you withdrawn from conversation.  It stemed from low self esteem, but on the opposite spectrum, it also mean that your pride is so high that you cannot allow yourself to make a mistake.  That is to say, you judge yourself too highly, and you failed to meet your personal expectations.  Not that I am out to insult you or to be harsh, but that is precisely why you appear arrogant to others.  You don't feel it because it was not your intention, but a subconsciousness of others is, "whats wrong with you?  why cant you just relax abit...."<br><br>But much as we all tend to think ourselves lowly and that to the extent our very person intruding on their lives is consider a fault.<br><br>Do you feel that if you said something silly, and after they are unsure what you're driving at, giving you the HUH look, you felt very bad, and hope that never happened, and that alone is enough to desuade you from speaking to them because of past bad expereinces?<br><br>The good news is - all of us experience that...the difference is, most people get over it more quickly than you.  You are very introspective (this is actually a gift and common among introverts) but what you need to know is, whilst you can reflect your actions, tis time not to past harsh judgements.<br><br>as humans, we are allow the right ot make mistake.  and that saying the wrong thing and getting people uncomfortable isnt a big deal.  and if you gain that level of confidence...suddenly everyone just wanna talk to you.<br><br>One last thing...I was autistic once....and after many years of struggling...I overcome that anxiety and speak to people....it still affects me, but i do not show it...and things seemed to change...most friends viewed me as an extrovert....although i'm not really so.<br><br>ur right on one thing...alot comes from yourself.  maybe its too awkward to start with your current friends.  talk to new people.  if you're the one initiating stuff the feeling is very good.  that shows u'd got more guts then them.  so far few people shun me when i speak to strangers.  i used to think people will think im mad...but now i felt it doesnt matter what they think...what matters more is how i feel.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Congenial:</div><div class="quote_body">yeah, i think i should be confident. but after resaerch, i found 100% of people suffering from this phobia has 0 confidence and almost 100% suffer from depression due to their disability.<br><br>its really hard to be confident, and no, i cant tell my parents abt it, cos the last time i told they said i was just shy, ill get thru it, damn, i was pissed.<br><br>knowing my condition now, its a medical condition, i know i can seek help, and i am going to go thru it alone, without any support from family friends etc, what do they know, they can oni advise etc, but they dont know how it feels inside, so i think i have to rise up alone, its me who decides the changes.<br><br>but of course its damn hard, u take 2 steps forward, oni to realise that u fall back 3 steps and thats super demoralizing and that always leads to my depression and giving up.<br><br>the panick attacks, anxiety, sweating in front of people are mentally draining, especially if u force urself to relaxed whatsoever etc, and its taking a toll on my life.<br><br>friends and teachers always see me skip class, coming to class late, and they will jus gimme a smirk, yeah a smirk, and i know what that means..<br><br>i relaly believe in this world there are many good souls. given my condition, there are still people who invited me to their ktv outings. and that time i went. i was with my other good friend. although i cannot converse with him much, i feel quite comfortable with him.<br><br>then they asked me to sing..i sang but after that i felt guilty, and super embarrassed cos i thought i had made afool out of myself. then we went to chill out.<br><br>then there is this gal who asked me y i was so quiet. damn, i could not answer, and she, again gave me a smirk as in "y the heck u talk so fast and ur like a snobbish idiot"<br><br>then we went back home, and to my shock, i was going the same way with another gal in the mrt.<br><br>she also did not tlak to me, and in the mrt u shld see how my muscles got tensed and in the end didnt talkto her. she said bye after that. i felt guilty. i knew i shld have done better.<br><br>its damn hard to control that negative thinking patterns. i know if i were to go to GP, they would gimme some drugs, but mind u, these drugs are like cocaine or weed, u get addicted, u get relased, and to quit it, u have to go cold turkey! arrgh..<br><br>therapy i am not too sure. i know how many therapies i go, its only up to me to force myselfto change, therapies wont help if u cant bring urself forward to change..</div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
