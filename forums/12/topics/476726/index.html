              <p>Its my first post over at SgForums and I don't normally let anyone I know, know about the problems I face, let alone the many strangers that come on to this section of the forums but I'm forced to post this up here because I have noone else to turn to.</p>
              <p>I've recently completed my 'A' Level examinations and Tekong is calling me on the 12th of December. I thought that the end of my A's would be the end of my worries, for now at least, until I enrol into a University. However I've recently found out that my mother, who is the breadwinner of the family(my mum is divorced and I am her only child), has been taking out loans, huge loans, amounting to, so far, $15000. Now she has to pay it back monthly and it takes up a very significant portion of her income and doesn't have much left for herself, let alone me. </p>
              <p>All I want to know is that is it possible for an undergraduate to fend for his own without the financial backing of his family? I plan to save up whatever meager allowance that National Service provides towards my University expenses, say, 300 dollars a month? That would mean I would have approximately $7200 to spread out over 4 years. What are the resources available to me to help me cope with the finances during my course in University?</p>
              <p>I'm really scared for my own future, but my mum does not seem to mind being in deep financial debt and thinks that her stable income of  $2000 per month would be enough to eventually cover the debt she incurred. She's 56 right now. I honestly do not know how much time she has left.</p>
              <p>If anyone could help, please reply. I really need concrete advice right now.</p>

              <p>To alleviate your family's household expenses, you can apply
              these.<br> <br> <strong>Financial Assistance Term Grants</strong><br> For needy NSF whose families encounter financial hardship as a
              result of their enlistment into the SAF<br> <br> <strong>Welfare Financial Assistance Grant/Loan</strong><br> Assistance provided to active servicemen who are in a financial
              predicament beyond their control eg. theft, fine, medical bills,
              spouse retrenchment. Assistance takes the following form:<br> <br> Grant: (a) CO Contingency Grant (b) Welfare Grant<br> Loan: Welfare Loan<br> <br> For full detail, please refer to welfare circular 3-39.<br> For Term Financial Assistance enquiries please call 6373 1150; 6363
              1161<br> For other Welfare Financial Assistance enquiries please call 6373
              3338; 6373 3336<br> <br> <strong>The SAF Finance Clinic</strong><br> The Finance Clinic is set up with the aim to assist servicemen who
              are financially distressed. Servicemen in financial distress must
              come forward and they must go through the formal channel of
              declaration before assistance can be rendered. The SFC aims to
              provide debt management to distressed servicemen, so as to mitigate
              their situation from deterioriating into an indebtedness cycle.
              Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS) had been engaged to assess and
              structure the debt management plan. Servicemen who does not meet
              the CCS criteria will be referred back to SFC for other forms of
              help e.g. through welfare grant or loan.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SAF Financial
              Assistance Schemes to NSFs</strong></span><br> <br> <strong>Should you and your family face financial hardship, you can
              apply for financial assistance. The quantum of financial assistance
              is the difference between your family’s minimum subsistence level
              and monthly income. It’s best to talk to your officer on how to
              apply for this scheme upon enlistment.</strong><br> <br> Before his National Service (NS) enlistment, Private (PTE) Max
              Al-Fyan Yew bin Abdul Hafiz Yew drew a stable income of about $700
              a month working in sales and was the breadwinner in his family.
              Hence, he was understandably worried when he learnt that his
              monthly NS allowance would be half of what he used to earn.<br> <br> Fortunately, with the intercession of his superiors in the SAF, the
              SAF Personnel Services Centre (SAFPSC) was able to help him through
              SAF Financial Assistance Schemes. Said the supply assistant of
              Supply Hub East: "I’m thankful for the extra $600 that I receive
              every month on top of my regular NS allowance as it has greatly
              contributed to the payment of my family’s bills."<br> <br> 1st Warrant Officer (1WO) Kng Ter Sern, Officer-in-Charge Asset
              Management Team, Pasir Ris Camp, went one step further by following
              up on PTE Yew’s case when his initial Term Financial Assistance
              Scheme expired. Said 1WO Kng: "Caring for our soldiers is one of
              the SAF core values...when Max’s initial financial assistance
              scheme ended in December last year, I conducted a house visit and
              recommended that he receive further financial help from the
              SAF."<br> <br> PTE Yew is just one of many examples of how the welfare schemes
              administered by the SAFPSC have benefitted around 65,000 in-service
              personnel of the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the SAF, as well
              as Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen).<br> <br> "The SAFPSC’s primary role is to strategise and design welfare
              structures in order to support the SAF’s philosophy on welfare...
              We believe in the virtues of commitment and engagement, and to
              achieve that, we are concerned with the well-being of personnel and
              their families," said Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) (NS) Koa Boon Teck,
              Head of SAFPSC.<br> <br> As secretariat to the SAF Welfare Council, the SAFPSC introduces,
              implements and reviews the proposed welfare schemes and services.
              Its welfare efforts cover five broad areas: health care, work-life
              balance, finance, vacations and insurance.<br> <br> On the SAFPSC's latest efforts in improving welfare support, LTC
              (NS) Koa said: "We want to move away from the mental model of
              welfare as a reactive element, where people subscribe to welfare
              only when they are in need..we felt that there was an impetus to
              changing the image of welfare."<br> <br> Here are some of the latest welfare initiatives spearheaded by the
              SAF Welfare Council and the SAFPSC:<br> <br> <strong>SAF Central Welfare Fund Bursary Awards</strong><br> 2nd Warrant Officer (2WO) Tanusha Tan of Headquarters 9th Division,
              whose 19-year-old daughter, Natasha, received the Bursary Award at
              the polytechnic level worth $1,200 last year, remembers her
              daughter being ecstatic at receiving the notification of her
              successful application.<br> <br> "It was a very good morale booster for Natasha, and it will surely
              further encourage her to do well," added 2WO Tan.<br> <br> Starting from February this year, the award, which is given to the
              children of MINDEF/SAF personnel to recognise their academic
              excellence up to the local degree level, now has a qualifying
              family income cap of $4,000 levied on each level of study, compared
              to the previous staggered qualifying income caps across all levels
              of study. In addition, the quantum awarded for all levels of study,
              less the junior colleges, polytechnics and local universities, has
              been increased.<br> <br> <strong>SAF holidays/ vacation spots</strong><br> The SAF Seaview Resort, Bintan Lagoon Resort &amp; Golf Club, as
              well as the Joondalup Bungalows in Perth, Australia, are examples
              of resorts which recently underwent their first major revamp to
              ensure the highest levels of modernity and aesthetic appeal for
              holiday-makers.<br> <br> More exciting locations have also been added to the stable of SAF
              vacation spots, including the Amara Sanctuary Sentosa, Ascott Kuala
              Lumpur and Club Bali. This means that active servicemen and NSmen
              can enjoy relaxing stays at a wider array of resorts, at exclusive
              prices of up to 60 percent below published rates.<br> <br> In addition, a new travel portal will soon be introduced to allow
              MINDEF/SAF personnel and NSmen greater flexibility, choice and cost
              savings when booking rooms, airfares, car rental and even travel
              insurance when they go on vacations. Named Free Independent Travel,
              the interactive and user-friendly one-stop portal will be launched
              tentatively on 1 Apr.</p>
              <p><strong>SAF Group Term Life (GTL) Insurance
              Scheme</strong><br> From 1 Jan 09 onwards, the scheme automatically covers
              newly-recruited MINDEF/SAF personnel for $100,000, and now has a
              maximum coverage of up to $600,000, unless they choose to opt out.
              Spouses and dependants are included in the coverage, which extends
              beyond the serviceman’s stay in MINDEF/SAF. NSmen are also eligible
              for the competitively-priced scheme.<br> <br> More information can be obtained via the Aviva-SAF Insurance
              Infoline at 68278000.<br> <br> <strong>SAF Financial Assistance Schemes</strong><br> <em>Last September, monetary lifelines such as the Term Financial
              Assistance Scheme, which aims to alleviate the financial stresses
              of servicemen, were improved. This scheme, which helps needy NSFs,
              had its period of assistance extended from six months till the
              serviceman's Operationally Ready Date but subjected to review after
              12 months. A term financial loan scheme was also launched for needy
              servicemen.</em><br> <br> <strong>100% subsidy for Defensive Riding Course
              (DRC)</strong><br> As of 1 Oct 09, the DRC, which is designed specifically for
              MINDEF/SAF personnel, became fully subsidised. Held at the
              Singapore Safety Driving Centre (SSDC) located in Woodlands, the
              half-day course aims to encourage road safety among those who
              regularly commute to work or perform despatch duties by
              motorcycle.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><br> *Applications for most of the welfare schemes can be found on the
              Integrated Welfare Applications and Disbursement System (iWADS) on
              the MINDEF/SAF intranet. All queries should be directed to the
              SAFPSC. Their numbers can be found via the iWADS. </em></span></p>

              <p>It is possible to fund your local uni education without those aid schemes:</p>
              <p>1. Save your NS pay.</p>
              <p>2. Work part-time as you study. Tuition is a typical choice.</p>
              <p>3. Take a bank loan: it can cover up to 90% of the fees when you study. So you pay the 10% using your earnings.</p>

              <p>Another most common financial assistance in Singapore is through government's bodies 's scholarship, especially if you are 'A' star or merit student and if you plan to study in overseas. However it is always come with an 6 years bond contract with the companies/organization you apply for which depend on whether you want to sacrifice your 6 year freedom.</p>
