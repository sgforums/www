              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>OK, today is april fools' day but my demise is definitely not a joke.</p>
              <p>I was called in by my manager &amp; the first thing he told me that the job is nt suitable for me. (I am in sales/office). He even added on to tell me that I shld resign &amp; find another job.</p>
              <p>I was pretty shocked by this sudden announcement. Actually, before this, I requested to him to change job scope &amp; even hinted the HR I wanted to resign last month, so I started sending out resumes but because it took a week or two to fulfil my resignation period so I gave up &amp; decided to give a try on my job again.</p>
              <p>So I tried &amp; ya, this announcement came..wow. &amp; best thing, is that they hired the person already &amp; I wasn't even known until today to pass on my duties. And also, I told him if I do not want to resign, he can still ask the HR where shld I be allocate to.</p>
              <p>*Sigh* I am taking my O levels AGAIN (yes, I took it 3 times previously but I didn't turn up for it) But this time, the O levels is all full subjects. But I need the job to upkeep my pocket money so this thing is a blow to me in someway..I mean, I wasn't prepared but wow..my dad would hit my to death if he ever finds out I was gotten rid of.</p>
              <p>But even if I dun resign, I dun even know what job scope are they giving it to me. Another thing is that, I lack the confidence to find another job as I am a natural slurrer &amp; I got scared slightly.</p>
              <p>Tell me what shld I do before I fall into depression</p>
