              <div>I had ported over my line from M1 to Starhub last month knowing that my contract ends on Sept 11 from M1. But this month I was shocked when I received my bill from M1. They charged me $800 for early termination penalty. I called them many times and spoke to the M1 manager for the waiver of the $800 penalty. I explained to them that I really thought my contract ends in Sept 11. I remembered I called the CCO to check with them regarding when is my contract ending and even went to the website to check for my mobile contract ends.</div>
              <div>I think it could also be a misunderstanding as during the past few months, I have called M1 to check for the end of contract of my mobile broadband contract expiry month.</div>
              <div>I explained to the M1 Manager if I know my contract haven't end why would I port over my line to other service provider if I only left 3 months contract to go with in Dec (Which they inform me that Dec my contracts end). When I port over my line to Starhub, Starhub did not conduct a check on their side too when they help me to port my line from M1. Whether my contract ends or not and M1 did not call me too to inform me that my contract haven't end and if I terminate it I will have to bear the penalty of $800. I feel this is a bit dark and a really bad advantage for the consumer. </div>
              <div>$800 is not a small amount and I don't understand why both M1 and Starhub did not even bother to call to inform me about this issue. As a consumer and paying for their service, I really expect at least to have a warning first before they charged me this sum of amount. Yet, they keep mentioned the contract that I signed on the Iphone contract and refusing to even appeal for my $800 penalty. The M1 manager also agreed that it might be a misunderstanding but they are still unable to waive the amount and suggested me to call Starhub to make a request for them to buy over the contract. (meaning Starhub will bear my $800 penalty fees to M1. I called 1633 to speak to the CCO and explained to her my current situation. She put me on hold for a few times and indirectly like I am speaking to the Starhub manager. The Starhub manager provided me the suggestion to M1 to open a new line or contract to me and sign until Dec 11 (where M1 told me my contract ends) to continue till my contract ends. He mentioned it's a win-win-win situation for everyone. I was happy with the proposed solution as I think it's very fair to everyone. So I called back to M1 manager and told him what the Starhub manager had suggested the solution. The M1 manager replied and said that he is unable to do that. I felt that he do not even want to try appealing for me in the first place and pushing me to call Starhub.</div>
              <div>During the conversation, The M1 manager told me that their staff will normally call the other service provider to confirm that their contract is confirmed over before they allow the customer to port over their line to M1. Why is Starhub didn't do their part to protect the customer interest and allowed my line to port over when my contract is not up with M1. The amount is also not pro-rated!! It's only 3 more months to go and if I have to continue the M1 contract will only be a $100 plus Hp bill. Why would I want to terminate the contract or port over at this time?</div>
              <div>Previously, I have 3 lines with M1( 1 Iphone line and 2 Mobile Broadband line), the 3G network and reception are so bad and that's why when my contract up, I immediately want to port over my line to another operator. Why would I change to other operator if I can enjoy 25% off from M1. When I ported over to Starhub, I did not receive any benefit for porting over except for their consistent and a much better phone reception plus 3G network. Anyone would agree with me that M1 mobile service over these few years,their services and standard have deteriorated and even recently being popular in the newspaper over the fake contract issue. I felt that M1 have already lost their realibility and credibility with the consumers. I am deeply disappointed.</div>
              <div>Can anyone advise me what can I do in my current situation? I am losing my patience and I felt stressed up over this matter.</div>

              <p>its tough. M1 can maintain that as per contract you did break it.</p>
              <p>best way is for starhub to bear the cost. maybe you can sign a longer contract with starhub so they can recover the cost from your usage</p>

              <p>you probably signed the contract before IDA passed the law for gradated contracts last year. but then again fireice brought up a good point, do you have a copy of the contract you signed in 09?</p>
              <p>iphones are considered luxury phones, think aston martin compared to a sony ericsson (toyota or kia) in the mobile phone market. you can't compare it to normal sets manufactured for the mass market. naturally when companies sell a product at a subsidised rate, having that agreement terminated will warrant a penalty charge ba. they are making a loss and you on the other hand, sign up a new line with another company, thereby taking up another iphone. if history repeats itself, you gonna go over to singtel?</p>
              <p>surely businesses must have practices to safe guard themselves against such cases or potential fraudulent cases. or they'd be issuing out iphones and having consumers terminate their contracts without bat of an eyelid. maybe you can take this as a lesson learned. next time read before signing and always keep a copy of any contract you sign before accidents like this happen again. perhaps you can negotiate further with them, sometimes 3rd try is the charm. no harm asking again. </p>

              <p>the service provider wont be checking. the CSO should have verbally ask you when you port over to Starhub and you have signed on the form/contract for port over as well. So starhub wont go and help you to pay S$800 to M1? and M1 usually wont waive off this early contract termination fee, cos if they waive off one, then everyone will start doing the same by using same reason....</p>

              <p>The thing is I didn't do a print screen when I check the contract end date in the website. It's a misunderstanding and when I port over my line, I really thought that my contract is up in Sept 11. So M1 and Starhub did not check my accounts statement or background and port over my line successfully. My point is should the consumer be inform in the first place before they port over the line if the contract on the other hand is not up.  To charge $800 sum of amount is not small and I think it is reasonable to inform me about the situation which I am not fully aware of.</p>
              <p>E.g. I go to apply for a loan or credit card, they bank will check your finanical background and supporting documents or even engage a 3rd party to check on you before they can issue you with a loan or credit card and the credit limit to you.</p>
              <p>There should be extra steps and measure to protect the company and consumer's interest. In any case, I just want a fair resolution to resolve this issue between me and the company.   </p>

              <p>there isnt any function in the M1 website for you to check contract end date.. there is only function for you to check whether you can upgrade (i.e after 11 months or 20 months). so you must have mistaken that your contract end on Sept 2011 when it mention that you can recontract from sept 2011....  so u have no case at all.. best is go talk to M1, and tell them you willing to pay for 4 months subscription and close case... talk to another manager..</p>

              <p>BTW, it is your fault, you sign the contract, it is your
              responsibilities and you bear the consequences if you break it. M1
              didn't terminate your line when there is a contract withstanding.
              If they did, aren't you going to make them pay something or going
              to the media to "expose" unless they make some compensation to
              you.</p>
              <p>This is a fair deal. Today mess only you yourself to blame.</p>

              <p>if you're certain a staff assured you over the phone there'd be no penalty charges, and if they actually recorded the calls, why not ask to be given an audio file to clarify this? if they erred, you have room for negotiation.</p>
              <p>like niceguy_123 said, ultimately, they're not obliged to render a discount on $800. i think. afterall you signed your sweet name on paper. everything else is moot. i think being polite when asking helps, if you play it nasty with them, there's no reason why they should show any kindness. especially when you're taking the business to a competitor. i don't know about m1 but the greenies are always helpful and apologetic when i correct them on their bills and overcharging. it gets done very quickly. </p>
              <p>we need to take extra steps to protect ourselves as a consumers in these times. these big companies won't be doing it for the little man, fine prints always serve to protect their interests so welcome to the world. when sign something, read the fine prints and cover the bases. when pay for something always know what we're paying for. ask for more details and ask many questions.  </p>
