If she goes out on dates with you frequently, it should means u stand some chance. After a few dates, confess to her that you have likings for her.<br><br>Just one advice, don't rush into things.<br></div>

You can still wait for her if you want. But do not get involve in third party relationship. If one day she broke off with his bf, then only should u court her. Meanwhile you should look for others.<br><br>There will be others here who will advise you to hang on or go ahead and court her. But I can assure you that getting into 3 party relationship is never easy. In the end at least one party will get hurt.<br><br>Seriously I doubt she feels for you. Alot of times, girls who are close to guys just wanted someone of the opp. sex to hear them and give them opinion.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>She just wanted you to be her close frens thats all.<br><br>Sorry for pouring the cold water...

If you want her to be happy then pls remain as only a "fd" to her. Don create any chance for her to have doubts bout her current bf. How to tell her you love her? Don't. You yourself have mentioned she has a bf now and you wan her to be happy. So the advise here is to steer clear of their relationship.<br><br>You may think I'm cruel but you wanted her to be happy. So I reckon you don wan her to suffer any agony. If you want to noe her longer jus keep in contact will do lor. Then she won't forget you as a fd.</div>
