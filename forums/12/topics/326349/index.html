              <p>Recently, we had a big fight. He used $200+ to buy gameboy for his niece on her birthday. He had no money to pay for his medical checkup and tests. I had to loan him $500 and yet he used he can buy the gameboy! Another thing I am angry is that he only celebrates his family members' birthday. He will go for a meal with the family &amp; buy presents for them. But as his gf for more than 5 yrs, he oni sms to wish me happy birthday. I really dun understand y different treatment between his family &amp; me.</p>

              <p>I duno whether u r in agony becos ur bf is havin kidney disease or he doesnt treasure u more than his family.</p>
              <p>If it's the former, does it matter anymore tat who does he treasure more since he is oready in such a state?  It shld probably be his family who wll b takin care of him if his illness is gettin serious whereas u, are onli his gf - no sense of security for him when he's sick.</p>
              <p>If it's the latter, i think u shld somehow ask urself y r u even his gf for 5 years when obviously ur bf's main problem rite now is his illness &amp; his family is naturally the one whom he shld care abt..(<em>refer to above statement</em>)</p>
