              <p>Players may be male or female. It would do us good to recognize them early before we invest too much of ourselves in a relationship.</p>

              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><strong>My own interpretation of a player is this:</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Players are essentially people who’s <strong>not been very forthcoming</strong> about the partners they are involved with, yet try to <strong>make you think</strong> that you are the <strong>only one</strong> they <strong>like and care for</strong>. They are <strong>generally dating simultaneously</strong> but are <strong>evasive</strong> about their multi-dating when asked. They <strong>try not to give you direct answers</strong> in regards to their current “conquest” (that is, current number of other partners they are seeing). </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Players come from <strong>all walks of life</strong>. They may be lawyers, teachers, waiters, service staff downright to any other occupation (or even not holding a job at all). They do not have to look pretty or handsome in order to fit the bill. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Some of them are sweet, charming, giving, generous, and look like a great catch from the outside.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"> They may even have a good reputation at work and be known as a goody goody person to his/her buddies and colleagues. <strong>They are just not serious in love.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">So what are the traits that make them a player?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;    ">They are out to play your heart. They will not tell you that directly of course, so they will paint a very beautiful picture that will capture you because <strong>they know what the opposite sex desires in a partner</strong>. If you confront them they will feign innocent. They try not to lie blatantly but instead, <strong>subtly mislead</strong> you so that they can justify to themselves that they are not liars after all. They <strong>take advantage of your kindness</strong> and play the role of good person when they are actually subtly manipulating your heart. The better players are the ones who do not go after you directly but <strong>cause you to throw yourself directly at them</strong> through their story telling.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">The only way to recognize them is to <strong>be alert to any sign that seems contradictory</strong> to what they say. They <strong>may</strong> also <strong>display symptoms of The Enigma</strong> as found in this thread. <a href="/forums/1225/topics/310652">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1225/topics/310652</a> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Remember that <strong>a player can be a female or a male.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Be more <strong>alert </strong>to pick out signs of their inconsistencies. Do not confront them direct unless you have concrete evidence that they are lying, else they will play the “hurt puppy” to cajole you into submitting to them again. If needed be, stay far far away from them and cut off all contact to get yourself out of the fire.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 6pt 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">A man or woman that hooks up with many different persons but commits to none and in that process ends up hurting some of those involved. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 6pt 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">A man who seduces to make them think that they are the love of their life. Once the she falls for him, he casually asks her out on a date. When describing the date to her he will make it sound very romantic. E.g. picnic on a beach, dinner and a movie, etc. The woman will meet the man and soon find out plans have changed. For some reason the man wants to stay at home. Since the woman likes the man so much she will not think twice about it. She will soon find out that the man only wants to be sexually with her and couldn't give a damn about her, her life, or her personality. But the woman will give into the man, feeling that being physical will make their relationship stronger. When, in reality, the man has no intention of even talking to the woman after that night! The sad thing is that women who gets played usually goes back to the man, thinking, hoping, that there will be a relationship soon to come. But players are just complete assholes. They're manipulating and the only "feelings" they have are in the pants. AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!! </span></p>

They then act caring yet eventually create other romantic involvements with other males/females. They typically lie quite often, not only about their other relationships, but about themselves, their daily lives, and false promises. Their behavior can be linked to their actual love for one that does not love them equally. </span></p>

              <p>No matter how good a player he or she is there are always telltale signs but more often then not lots of people who are so in love with love refuse to acknowledge those signs. Some even hope against hope in silent that that player eventually will only come to love them solely only even after finding out that they were being played out or two timed.</p>
              <p>For example, he or she will do almost anything together with you like all lovers in courtship do except bringing you back to meet his or her family or giving out his house phone number. And whenever you suggest  going to his or her house they will be evasive about it and come up with lots of excuse to deter you from going. That is one big telltale sign as he or she is afraid the family's member might accidentally said something wrong.</p>
              <p>Yeah, one of our office girl kanna. The girl found out his house number and give a surprise call. The mother answered the phone. The mother thought it was the other girl that the son brought back the week before and started a conversation. LOL from there all hell broke lose. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png"></p>
              <p>This is oni one of the example of telltale sign. So do look out for them. It might just save you from getting punked.</p>

              of a player is this:</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">So what are the traits that
              make them a player?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">They are out
              to play your heart. They will not tell you that directly of course,
              so they will paint a very beautiful picture that will capture you
              because <strong>they know what the opposite sex desires in a
              partner</strong>. If you confront them they will feign innocent.
              They try not to lie blatantly but instead, <strong>subtly
              mislead</strong> you so that they can justify to themselves that
              they are not liars after all. They <strong>take advantage of your
              kindness</strong> and play the role of good person when they are
              actually subtly manipulating your heart. The better players are the
              ones who do not go after you directly but <strong>cause you to
              throw yourself directly at them</strong> through their story
              telling.</span></p>

              <p><br>Actually, the <strong>players</strong> i'm trying to highlight here, are the people female/male who purposely withold information about their dating status.

It's like a vicious cycle of the vampire. Innocent people get bitten and then they go on to bite the other innocent. The only way to stop this is to arm yourself with knowledge.</p>
              <p>And sometimes the most ingenious players get outwitted in their own games by other players too. i dunno what you call it, karma?</p>
