            <div class='col-md body'>FB, as John Lennon said, life is what happens to you when you're busy making other plans.<br><br>There's two angles to that statement.  First, you're seeing the end result and maybe you're trying to plan your way towards it.  Well and good, but don't get too caught up in the plan - life has a funny way of saying "I think not".  Case in point: I never figured out I'd be with someone like my girlfriend, but she's the best thing that's ever happened to me.<br><br>The second thing is that most people seem to forget that they're supposed to be enjoying the ride instead of worrying about the destination.  Worry is interest paid on a problem that hasn't occurred yet - don't waste your time and energy on it.  stay in the here and now - that's how you enjoy the ride.  Besides, do you reckon you'd be more attractive to the ladies if you were having a good time or if you were moping?  Even worse, when you mope, you tend to make yourself invisible - it becomes a vicious cycle.</div>
