Why do I do all that? So that I can earn my own money without having to depend on my parents. I want to be financially independent I guess.

NORMAL is good for most people who doesn't have anymore ambitions/dreams in their lives, their ambitions/dreams ended when they got married and had children and they thought that this is the kind of correct and ONLY lifestyle which they SHOULD be living till they die.<br><br>Little and rarely we see Singaporeans as an explorer or daredevil in reality. The truth is that we're all afraid to take risk and embrace uncertaincies in life. Most would choose the safe side of life and live out their glorious life in their safety vault/shell. Can't blame them for behaving this way cos we were brought up as an endangered species and in terms of figures/numbers, Singaporeans are indeed the minority species of human as compared to the rest of the world.<br><br>Oops...time's up for me to get back into my force-field reinforced DeathStar. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Do you also know that the government also said that our economy is doing well and our unemployment rate is decreasing? Ermm...should I believe that too? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Do you as a person really believed what other people commented based on some biased charts or graphs which that person had drawn? The fellow didn't even lived long enough among us as our fellow Singaporeans to cough out a credible research.<br><br>How credible do you think we'll make if we go and do some research on our foreign neighbours/countries? Do you think they'll believe our research that easily based on what we've done? &lt;- They will only if the results of our research commends/compliments them. People like good news...they always does, and nobody likes criticism.<br><br>Anyway I've quoted this from your favourite Geert Hofstede about his uncertaincies standard and how he rated them and what he meant.<br><br><strong>Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI) focuses on the level of tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity within the society - i.e. unstructured situations. A High Uncertainty Avoidance ranking indicates the country has a low tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity. This creates a rule-oriented society that institutes laws, rules, regulations, and controls in order to reduce the amount of uncertainty. A Low Uncertainty Avoidance ranking indicates the country has less concern about ambiguity and uncertainty and has more tolerance for a variety of opinions. This is reflected in a society that is less rule-oriented, more readily accepts change, and takes more and greater risks.</strong><br><br>So how can we possibly score an 8 on this? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I'm glad my brain is still functioning and thinking rationally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
