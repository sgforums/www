Instead she chose to avoid, but accept your gifts gracefully.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>My advice would be: to force it out of her. Pretending all that thingy would only dragged it further. She is obviously playing mind games with you. Seriously speaking and sorry for my bluntness: she may not even fancy you - as what I had said before (if she did, she would have already accepted you), furthermore you jio her not only once, but three times! and all she did was to pretend and avoid.<br><br>One word of caution: Are you *sure* this is the sort of girl you are looking for?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
