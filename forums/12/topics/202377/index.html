            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone<br><br>What I am going to share with you is something that is bothering me recently.  I am not asking for trouble here but I really do not know where to turn to.  I cannot share this with my friend.  As you read on, you will see what I mean.<br><br>I am happily married to the nicest guy who holds a stable job, is loving and caring.  Other than working, he spends all this time with me and tries to do things for me and with me.  He is all that any woman will want to marry.  I am glad and I know I am lucky and blessed.<br><br>But in recent weeks, I am bugged with this thought.  The thought of having a fling outside.  Yes, in  the past, I used to have many boyfriends and I changed boyfriends like nobody's business.  All my friends had a hard time remembering who I was going out with.<br><br>It sounds fun and crazy and it was indeed fun to have new guys every now and then.  But soon I realised that I did not like this kind of lifestyle.  It just wasn't me.  I decided that I was after all still very much conservative and I longed to settled down with somebody stable and loving.<br><br>Soon I met my husband.  He is not the romantic kind that will surprise me with roses and presents.  He is the homely kind that likes to stay at home with family to have dinner and watch TV.  This is the perfect kind of husband -- the stay-at-home kind of man.  He even helps out with housechores and groceries.<br><br>Everything, except sex life, is perfect after we got married.  Due to the nature of his work, he is highly stressed and doesn't perform much in bed.  Even when we were newly wed, we didn't make love more than once a week.<br><br>Recently, as mentioned earlier I have been thinking about having an affair outside.  I don't think it has to do with my low sex life with my husband, or rather, I don't really know either.<br><br>When this thought first came to me, it was not so much of having sex with other men.  I didn't think of having one night stand or something.  But rather, I was more into having a fling, a short time relationship.  I suddenly miss  infatuation.  I miss the strong emotion that I used to have when seeing new guys.<br><br>I have been married for a short while only, definitely less than 7 years.  So this shouldn't be a 7 years itch kind of symptom.  It is bugging me and I dare not share with any of my friends, even the girls.  Because the whole world think that I have a perfect husband and they will scream my head off for sharing this with them, instead of helping.<br><br>I hope to hear some advice here or find out where I can get helped.<br><br>Thank you for your time reading this.</div>

Yes he wants one too.  As a conventional man, he wants more than just one.  But his refusal to be checked by the doctor is hindering this plan and I am getting frustrated.<br><br>I am very concerned whether the problem, the thought that I have has something to do with me psychologically.  I am very worried that I am a nympho or what.<br><br>If it is the problem is not having a child, then it should not be so complicated.</div>

The answer is quite simple. People do not cheat because they're pigs, sows, %^*%$es, or dogs. It all comes down to two basic drives: the physical sexual drive and the emotional need.<br><br>People usually cheat because there is a conflict between their physical and emotional desires. By accepting and understanding these shortcomings -- instead of ignoring them -- we can hopefully work harder to make sure that our partners are satisfied enough to resist any instinctual sexual urge.'<br><br>Cheers</div></blockquote>Hey very nice writeup.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I dont think its because of the men or the sex - but that when you meet someone new, like you described, the type of tension, chemistry, excitement, fascination is something you will NEVER get again with a regular partner. And it IS exciting, the thrill of the chase. Sure women get turned on physically, but I think its the MENTAL foreplay that is far more powerful when it comes to women.<br><br>Especially if and when your own relationship suddenly feels routine (as many people above had said)... the desire to feel desired (it doesnt matter by who), attractive and the TENSION!... becomes very .. uhh strong.<br><br>It is psychological more than physical - I reckon. Do you have any hobbies that really interest or absorb you? How about sports? Perhaps you need to find a way to satiate that desire to feel confident, and excitement, without straying. More romance would ur hubby would help ba. I also suggest you talk to your hubby sincerely about feeling 'routine' and how both of you can work together to keep the rship feeling special. Take a course together or something?<br><br></div>

Yup, it's good so i thought should share with you guys.<br><br>Question: if the guy is too boring, will it lead to the girl to cheat?<br>MC's answer: If her desire to cheat is greater than her love towards her guy. She will. No amount of justification will satisfy the desire.<br>At this modern era, more likely yes. But it depends case by case basis.<br><br>The article applies to both gender.<br><br>Cheers</div>
