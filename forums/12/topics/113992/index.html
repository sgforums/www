            <div class='col-md body'>wah seems like the minor problem probably opened a can of worms. one thing happend tonite led to something happening last week, last month and 6 years ago...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  something like that?<br><br>not that i'm trying to pour water over u, but i guess a gentle warning/reminder to all couples out there, sometimes it's better to sit down and kao beh to each other EARLY in the piece, dun sweep them under the carpet...<br><br>okz anyway, honestly there's two situations i can think of. one is that she's being rash, becos as u stated and i assume, it is a small problem that created it all. so hopefully she'll come round and realise she was a bit too emotional.<br><br>the other situation is that she's been holding this back for AGES, and she's just decided to stop trying, or too tired to go on. OR, something outside of ur reln gave her the courage or impetus to do wat she wouldn't normally do (initiate break up). this isn't to put any thoughts in your head, just listing down the possibilities.<br><br>all that said, if it's irrecoverable, then dun waste time, becos happiness can lie elsewhere. dun make the same mistake, and you and a future partner can be even happier together, dun lose heart!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
