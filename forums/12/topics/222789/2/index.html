Im talking about guys who make excuses for their girl because they are in love with her.<br><br>Im not generalising. Yes, not all girls are the same but it doesn't mean they will not think the same. It always all boils down to how much she care for you. That's what Im saying. I mean, think about it, while she may have trouble in her finances, what does your relationship with her has got to do with this problem, if she truly loved you at all? At the end of the day, it is always about how much she care/love for you.<br><br>doko</div>

Because her family financial situation is not good, she needs to work, to help out in the family. She feels that she would have no time for a relationship.<br><br>However, she did say to use this separation to rethink about our relationship. We have a lot of differences; different interests, and stuff like that.<br><br>When I went to her house to pass her birthday gift to her (we broke up three days before her birthday), she seemed to be rather glad to see me. That's how I feel, at least.<br><br>But after prom tonight, perhaps she's tired, but she seems to detest my presence. I offered to wait with her while her brother comes, but she said, "nevermind".

We are not exposed to the chaotic vibes of society and havenÂ’t gained mastery of our emotions - we are easily wounded... raw damage.<br><br>Reality sinks in when we lead those relationship - contrary to mass belief, the core elements of leading the relationship is about the same, be it at sixteen or thirty six. Personality conflicts strike in any incompatible relationship and sometimes, it's not just about having the desire to work on the indifferences, at times, it may seemed that we have no viable manner to resolve it and people usually do not know how to convey such a feeling/situation to the other party.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The family financial plight is but a euphemist for incompatibility break up. </strong></span>When we are young, we do not even understand our own feelings (some people never do for their entire life) and when we come across those seemingly complex emotions, we do not know how to handle nor translate them into words. The easiest way to achieve the desired result is to employ another reason that will produce the same result - and in your case, it's the family burden on her.<br><br>If we were to shift our perception a little; if she is having such a hard time, shouldn't she be needing more emotional support instead of removing whatever source of support she originally has? (Of course, unless this relationship is terribly intense, it makes sense to remove you as you become her source of emotional burden and does not contribute as a form of support).<br><br>Sometimes, when we discover that somebody isn't quite the somebody we are looking for gradually... (worst if there isn't any major flaw in him/her), we may either make use of some irrelevant excuses or remain put with the relationship for meaningless reason.<br><br>You may like to allow a period of time to pass before you decide on your route to undertake. I believe that could do you well to ease the current confusion, and you could also uncovered more on the actual REASON why she opt to leave the relationship with the passing of time when you do some communication later on - because I reckon that it's likely the phenomenon written in my second-third paragraph.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by binarynwitz:</div><div class="quote_body">I just broke up with my girlfriend, who we've been together for about 1.5 years.<br><br>Her reason for the breakup is because she has too much responsibilities. Because her family financial situation is not good, she needs to work, to help out in the family. She feels that she would have no time for a relationship.<br><br>However, she did say to use this separation to rethink about our relationship. We have a lot of differences; different interests, and stuff like that.</div></blockquote>Two things to deduce from this two points.<br><br>1)She is insecure about you and this relationship right from the start. What does she mean that she would have no time for a relationhip? So what if she needs to work or help out in the family? She still needs to eat lunch/dinner/breakfast, and go to and fro from work right? Surely these times she can spend it with you right? By saying she has no time for a relationship, she's just saying that she thinks both you and her will not stay long together just because she's working. Obviously, she doesn't think that you will be willing to spend other extra time with her.<br><br>2)Use the separation to rethink about relationship = she has spend some time thinking, and that she thinks you are not right for her. She wants you to realise this, but doesn't want to tell u straight to the face. The prom night incident is just a indication. Forget about the birthday incident, who won't be happy to receive gifts? If she still love you, she won't have be cold to you during prom night. By acting cold, she wants you out of her life.<br><br>That's what I think man. Either you can really go and look for a new gf, or heed her suggestion, and give her time. Let her approach you, do not call/sms her first, or else she will find u irritating. Good luck bro</div>
