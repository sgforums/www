            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, maybe you should give her some space and try not to pursue her so much these days. Remain as friends for now. Strictly friends.<br><br>You are still young and have a long way to maturity and in becoming responsible for your own life. So make use of this time in your youth to do something more meaningful and enriching. Relationships can wait till you are over 21. That's the age when you can think and rationalize better as a young adult.<br><br>Let her be what she wants herself to be. It's her life. And since (I presume) she's of the same age as you or younger, she too has lots to learn and a long way to go. And girls mature faster than guys. Her character will keep on changing during this period of her teenage years.<br><br>So I suggest that you take this break up strongly, courageously and move on. Don't ever look back. Learn to prioritize your goals and objective. A man should have an objective in life. What do you want to do? What do you want to achieve in future? Start thinking now and work towards it. Currently, you can only work towards your future goals through your studies.<br><br>All the best! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

This happens when after the 'O' levels, when there is supposed to be a lot of time? Haha...<br><br>Of course your heart tells you to move on but your heart is always not helping you. Every time she smile at you, you assume got chance. Like that, every girl smile at me means got chance huh?<br><br>If you don't want to follow what your brain tells you, which is to be rational, then by all means, go ahead and beg her to patch up. Just be prepared to get hurt. You can believe all you can she is the ONE for you, even if you force her and her heart is not willing to be with you, you think there will be any mutual happiness? Nah~ The more important question is: Are you the ONE for her?<br><br>A lot of bad things must have happened before this breakup, right?<br><br>doko</div>

Let me elaborate.<br><br>TS.<br>I am not sure about this, but the girl, as you said, is facing some money issues. Thus, she might think that she could be of a burden to you. MIGHT. That is why she backed off in the relationship and leave you.  Also, you said that she would be working alot during the holidays. Maybe since you 2 are in a school relationship, the amount of time spent together would be cut drastically.  Maybe she is afraid that this would affect the relationship alot, and she rather to end it now then later.<br><br>Both of you are still young. And from your post, I am thinking that you are still a very rational and mature kid while your girl (ex) is pretty hardworking too. She would work so much just to help the family.<br><br>I am not sure if you love her. I hope you do and not cling on because you have grown too dependent on her.
