            <div class='col-md body'>Please take the blog comments and use it against them. But my suggestion is for a matured person, don't take the matter too far and ruin a child's future. Most religions preach forgiveness and patience, and I guess they all said those same thing for some good reasons. Maybe you should do something but not to the extend of really hurting anyone. An eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind. Plus, it's always a nice feeling to know that you actually have managed to forgive someone else who don't or might not deserves it.</div>

              <p>While I'm just a third party reading  wat TS had said, I do not know what actually happened. A parent naturally wants to protect her child, the child naturally wants to protect herself or perhaps even "get back" at the other classmate, etc. Naturally, individuals'  stories may not be free from bias-ness. </p>
              <p>However I would be against blowing up the matter to MOE.</p>
              <p>It's through these small cases that further tightens the already tied hands of school discipline.</p>

              <p>Its your child so she means the world to you but... have some perspective.</p>
              <p>Its just a small incident of 2 young girls having a silly teenager hormonally fuelled girl fight - if every parent who read of their kid being called names onlinem complain to school and MOE, waa.. MOE would need to establish a complain bureau instead of focusing on actually planning an education.</p>
              <p>And while I am not condoning the slapping, there might be a reason why your daughter did not demo the 'tapping' to DM. It doesn't need to be painful tapping to be irritating - if someone keeps tapping me non stop just to get my attention,  I'll be pissed too.</p>
              <p>Point is to teach your girl to be above the bullying - instead of teaching her how to bully back.</p>
