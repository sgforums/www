            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes it helps to channel your focus in one single direction. IMHO, the best channel will be work/career. You're only 30. Channel your energy into building a career and provide well for your loved ones. One of my biggest regret in life is not being able to provide much for my old man while he was still alive.<br><br>You still have your father so spend more time with him. As you become older, the world somehow becomes less forgiving and people around you begin to distance as they build their own lives. Friends and even siblings couple up and get married, they move forward with their own goalsÂ… this is part and parcel of life.<br><br>It is very normal to experience bouts of sadness especially with whatÂ’s going on in your family. It feels as though life is moving forward in languid aimlessness. At least right now you have a reason to hang on and be tough, for your father. Lives come and go in passing. Passing of loved ones is never easy. It takes years for emotional chapters to close. IÂ’m still getting nightmares.<br><br>As for secrets, you can always tell it to a stranger or tell it to a tree or something. No history that hasnÂ’t already been made by others. Raped by elder brothers at age 10, abused by uncles at 8 are few of the secrets IÂ’ve heard in my circle. These friends are pushing on and moving on. What hideous past can you possibly have?<br><br>I donÂ’t have much advice except to treasure every moment and live for every moment to the best you can. No doubt fleeting, moments lead to a future. Because you are only 30, possibilities tomorrow should spur you on. Grace is the ability to accept changes in your life. When youÂ’ve endured the worst, everything else becomes a stroll in the park. And that is when you learn to adapt and trudge on for your own goals or passion.<br><br>Good luck and take care soldier.<br></div>
