            <div class='col-md body'>be careful of guys. lots tell me to be their mistress and never reveal they are married for years after I known them. I always make it a point to ask and know what and who I am dealing with and I don't want all the b!tchy crowd to wag their tongues and claim I got something cause I slept around. To guys, everything they do can become a ego boost and the whole purpose is to make themselves feel good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>be professional at work. Flirting with any guy at work discredit you as a professional person.  Once tongues wag, you can forget about your future. I don't have that problem with married men nor do I flirt with them, they flirt with me and never get any response.  I am just tired of being asked to be some guy's mistress just cause they have money.</div>
