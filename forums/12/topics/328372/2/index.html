              <p>You like to contradict yourself. You say that you have good prospects because you believe SMU 50% before graduate got job waiting for them etc etc, so pray tell, what makes you think that you can in that 50% and not in the OTHER 50%?</p>
              <p>You also contradict yourself. You say you want revenue. I say you have exactly no idea of basic business or econs. What is Revenue? I think the term you are looking for is Profit. Because Profit = Revenue - Cost. So you can have very high revenue, but if you have even higher costs, = negative profit = loss. So if you cannot use basic economic terms, and you want to be a Boss?</p>
              <p>But i digress. You yourself say that you join SMU because there is a what, 1 in 2 chances you will be headhunted. Let me ask you, when you want to be headhunted, is that no different from hoping to get an income as an employee? If you want to earn profit, then is there a need to give a damn about being headhunted because why bother to be an employEE if you are an employER? Successful businessmen don't come exclusively from SMU. They come from all walks of life, all educational qualifications. Your hopes (want Revenue ie Profit instead of Income) does not depend on what university you graduated from.</p>
              <p>But I guess that's why only 50% of SMU students are headhunted before graduation instead of say, 100%.</p>

              <p>BTW: I didn't mention nor declare in the thread nor any post that I got a good prospect. (Again, if you got proof - quote it..else..Zip Up!!)</p>
              <p>Don't use your own interpretation of my post and use it to rebute me.</p>
              <p>This is a forum afterall, and I'm trying my best to be kind and polite, but since you don't give face..I would not restain myself neither to such a post like YOURS!!</p>
              <p>As for the part being head-hunted..GET THIS FACT CLEAR AND IMPRINTED INTO YOUR HEAD!!</p>
              <p>Why people are being headhunted is due to their performances and positive testimonials.</p>
              <p>To be honest. The 1st Batch of SMU grads being head-hunted was as high as 80% for your information. When I say 50%, i'm just being modest, and it's up to each individual student's performance. (which was featured in the news thus it got my high recogniton)</p>
              <p>That doesn't means that when you get admitted into SMU, you have 50% chance of being headhunted. NoBODY will headhunt you unless you proof your own worth.</p>
              <p>With regards to my last line - that's my personally point and the path that I'm gonna take. If you don't understand - AGAIN PLEASE CLARIFY/ ASK.</p>
              <p>Revenue VS Income - Read up more Self-Improvement Books and find out the difference..Smart Alex!!</p>
              <p>BEAR IN YOUR MIND THAT THIS IS A FORUM - FREE FOR ALL, I'm not ANSWERABLE TO YOU. For God Seek!!

              <p>Not I join hor..</p>
              <p>Since which thread and post DID I MENTION I'm in SMU.</p>
              <p>If there's no PROOF!! SHUT UP!!</p>
              <p>(Sorry for my harsh tone and being too straight-forward. but it
              just disgust me that people don't really read carefully and try to
              understand the contents first before making an opinion.)</p>
              <p>BTW: I didn't mention nor declare in the thread nor any post
              that I got a good prospect. (Again, if you got proof - quote
              it..else..Zip Up!!)</p>
              <p>Don't use your own interpretation of my post and use it to
              rebute me.</p>
              <p>This is a forum afterall, and I'm trying my best to be kind and
              polite, but since you don't give face..I would not restain myself
              neither to such a post like YOURS!!</p>
              <p>As for the part being head-hunted..GET THIS FACT CLEAR AND
              IMPRINTED INTO YOUR HEAD!!</p>
              <p>Why people are being headhunted is due to their performances and
              positive testimonials.</p>
              <p>To be honest. The 1st Batch of SMU grads being head-hunted was
              as high as 80% for your information. When I say 50%, i'm just being
              modest, and it's up to each individual student's performance.
              (which was featured in the news thus it got my high recogniton)</p>
              <p>That doesn't means that when you get admitted into SMU, you have
              50% chance of being headhunted. NoBODY will headhunt you unless you
              proof your own worth.</p>
              <p>With regards to my last line - that's my personally point and
              the path that I'm gonna take. If you don't understand - AGAIN
              PLEASE CLARIFY/ ASK.</p>
              <p>Revenue VS Income - Read up more Self-Improvement Books and find
              out the difference..Smart Alex!!</p>
              <p>BEAR IN YOUR MIND THAT THIS IS A FORUM - FREE FOR ALL, I'm not

              the reason that I just want to make sure everybody understands it,
              if anybody don't understand just ask.. but don't throw words into

              <p>LOL.. I seriously LOL @ U.. You by your own admission that being headhunted is because of individual performance, so does it matter whether the student is from SMU/NTU/NUS? No??? So you die die want to go to SMU even if your future depends on your personal abilities regadless of educational instutition? So now you change your story and say that SMU originally 80% then now 50%? Wow, the standard really dropped really fast huh.</p>
              <p>Self-help books?? This one is LOL-ED even more. You get your information from self help books? I wonder how many successful businessmen achieve what they have because of self-help books. If you think reading rich dad poor dad will make you a millionaire.. well.. all the best. As for the proper definition of Revenue and Income, the definition was not cooked up by me, please look into any Economics textbook, any, and you will be able to get the definition, because people get qualification for Economics, but nope sorry, unfortunately, currently there's no Degree Qualification for Self Improvement.</p>
              <p>Like you mentioned, this is a forum after all, I am free to make my own intepretations and similarly, you are free to refute them. Well yes, assume makes an ass out of u and me but you cannot discount the fact that well, some people actually do like being an ass? Behind the screen, everyone is internet hero huh, can say many many things but in real life? Like you ownself said, this is a forum, free for all, you are not answerable to me, but from your posting and your reaction, well it certaintly shows how much you want to "answer" me.</p>
              <p>Remember, behind forum nickname, behind the internet, everyone can be a Keyboard Warrior!</p>

              <p>I know how come your idea of recognition and ranking is different from mine already..</p>

              <p>more than 50% of the students are already being head-hunted by various companies even before they graduated..</p>
              <p>that's the prospective i'm looking at..</p>
              <p>rather than the educational ranking whereby NUS is no 8 and NTU is around no 20 in world ranking from a news article which i've read last yr. correct me if i'm wrong..</p>
