              </span></p><p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I am a 25 y/o female.</p>
              <p>Recently, I went back to school to purse a degree.</p>
              <p>The problem is I feel SO ALONE in my school.</p>
              <p>I am currently studying in SIM.</p>
              <p>Most of my classmates are ard 18 - 23. ( Ladies I mean)</p>
              <p>Most of them joined the course together and so, they formed group. It is so difficult to break into ANY of the group and become one of them.</p>
              <p>My main problem is I am STUCK in a NEGATIVE group of BITCHES. <br>Well, they are young and each one of us are being brough up differently and different thoughts.</p>
              <p>They seems to be interested in hooking up rich guys and compare branded stuffs.</p>
              <p>I tried to make a conversation like ''latest movies reviews, music, tv drama'' but it seems they are not interested.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My problem came when one of the girls was being rude to me.<br>She sat next to me, and act like pissed off and made ''indirectly comments'' abt me to the other classamate who was sitting next to me. I was sitting in the middle.</p>
              <p>I pretend I didnt heard it. I choose to ignore because I feel I only have to see their faces twice a week for about 2 years and they are not part of my life.</p>
              <p>End of the day, I am still ME. I still have outside friends who love me for being me, I have family, I am healthy.</p>
              <p>But it seems I cant get over it because I feel l was being builled.</p>
              <p>I feel that I should stand up for myself when the 'girl' was making the 'indirectly comments'.</p>
              <p>But on the other hand, if I confront her, others may think I m petty and ''xiao ti da zui''</p>
              <p>Maybe is because I been away school for so long, I have forgotten how "fake ppl " can b.</p>
              <p>It doesnt get to my daily life, but it surely gets me not looking forward to sch</p>

              <p>Imho the older kids usually have lesser problems in school. Because of age and working experience, they are considered cooler, more knowledgeable, thus they earn respect more easily from classmates and they get to lounge around the lecturers. Hey these girls should be the ones feeling insecure in your company, hahaha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But fuck them yah. They grading your work no? They paying for your studies no?</p>
              <p>Dear your problem is small problem. Easy situation because these girls are not going to affect your rice bowl. When these girls have nothing to do with your ricebowl or your performance as an individual, the last thing you should do is just ignore these bitches. I say diss them.</p>
              <p>In your case, silence is not golden. It's already affecting your physical and mental well being in school, so do something god speed before it escalates.</p>
              <p>In reality, this kind of people have a very poor self-image, a total lack of people skills and very limited world views, so don't bother making conversation anymore. Why bother getting into their good books? What you need are very simple come back lines. They won't stop these bitches, but they will increase your confidence and discourage them from going further.</p>
              <p>For example, if they say, "You want to know what's the problem? There is one. We don't like you."</p>
              <p>You say: "That's not a problem."</p>
              <p>If they say, "Wah lao <em>somebody</em> seriously have no dress sense."</p>
              <p>You say, "You feeling special because of that?"</p>
              <p>You get the drift. You already know what they are like, practice your come back lines.</p>
              <p>Lastly, try to cement friendships with lecturers. They are the ones grading your work and the better ones, have real advise to give. You go girl!</p>
              <p>PS: When you do start dissing them, must have self control. Don't go overboard because dissing them and watching them flip can easily get addictive.</p>

              <p>Oh well. You should always get your priorities straight. You are going to school to earn a degree, not friends. But hey it's only for 2 years and you are not meeting everyday, unlike work, so why try so hard to get into their group if it makes you feel uneasy?</p>
              <p>The majority of people i know studying in SIM wants to excel and group projects do play a part in their overall grade. If you have good grades, it wouldn't be hard to find a group that wants you if you are willing to work.</p>
              <p>If these people doesn't know any social manners and proper etiquette, it's their problem. Why bother telling them the right thing when you are not related to them? Let these be the job of their family and those rich guys they want to be with.</p>
              <p>Don't confront and make a scene. If you really can't stand it, i suggest you move and sit away from them. Even if in the middle of a class. But never show your anger, it shows you are vulnerable to their actions.</p>

              <p>Hmm i see soleachip has suggested a more aggresive stance to handle that situation of yours. But oh well, how you want to handle the situation depends on which you feel more comfortable with.</p>

              <p>I'd say pay no mind to these kids.</p>
              <p>Soleachip got it entirely right when she said that older kids in school usually have lesser problems; they're often looked up upon as big brothers/sisters and usually mix well with the other age groups.</p>
              <p>If TS is not getting that kind of rapport/respect, I'd kinda suspect that TS might be a li'l too introvert (if not reluctant), thus she got stuck in such undesirable situation. </p>
              <p>TS should try to socialize a tad more, and use whatever age advantage you have to befriend others, subsequently, move on to another group of friends. I'm not inciting you to look at this as a popularity show, your focus should be on your degree; but what worrying is that your current predicament might affect your group work. Working with people you can hardly tolerate is quite unbearable, I understand.</p>
              <p>Do yourself a favor, the next time when you walk into class, instead of heading straight to your usual group of bitches (pardon me!), move around a li'l and get friendly with people. You could start by flashing a smile and just saying hi, whatever you're comfortable with. Just don't appear to try too hard.</p>

              <p>Contrary to popular belief, it's perfectly fine to be an introvert. What should matter is that you should not be excessively concerned about your level of social presence or lack thereof. While you may see it as a having fewer people to talk to, it also allows you to be less tied down by peer pressure and more free to think about real things that matter to this one life you get to live.</p>
              <p>Don't be too bothered with the current mainstream notion that being 'anti-social' is a bad thing, when at a very fundamental level, opinions do not equate to knowledge. And don't get dragged into other subcultures in an effort to conform and give in to a merely-perceived social vacuum, like that of the bimbos you mentioned. Remember, being an introvert can mean less airtime and more braintime.</p>
