BUt i jus told him to carry on and stuff.<br><br>Last friday he is still quite happy because of the good progress of their friendship.<br><br>Who knows today he came to sch and said he didnt want to woo this gal anymore and he said he have target for another gal.<br><br>He showed me the ring he is wearing bearing the name of the gal he intends to woo. He showed me her phone num too.<br><br>I find this really weird, how can someone jus change target easily and especially when he is already good progress with the gal he fond of?<br><br>And he is not the sort of flirt guy/<br><br>He looked at my phone and saw the wallpaper of teh gal he used to woo.<br>Ok my bad i shouldn't have done it.

Sometimes he will jus daydream.<br><br>When he saw my phone he asked me a question "Hey do u really like her?"<br>Yup i admitted. THen he jus told me to go for it and even use my phone to msg her. Sort of like helping me.<br><br>I admit, i am really intersted in this gal and i am sure he is still liking her too.<br><br>And he is pushing it to me and i can't push it to him anymore since he prolly lie abt that he like another gal, there is no excuse to push it back to him anymore.<br><br>I really wanna msg this gal but i'm jus afraid that if we 2 progress on, my friend might b sad and stuff.<br><br>So the prob is,<br><br>Go for it ?<br><br>Or not? </span></div>
