            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to share my experience with you people out there and ALSO, at the same time seek for any VALUABLE ADVICE(s).... Would like to know if there're anyone out there with similar experience as me...? This is MY STORY...<br><br>I'd just applied for M1 mobile service (1+1 plan) about a few months back... The ceiling for my plan is around $20 per month UNLESS I exceed 300 SMS or the free talktime given to me.... Personally, I try to limit my SMS messages and ONLY use the phone for short talks OCCASIONALLY.... I DON'T use my HP for chatting... Even so HARDLY.... &lt;- Limit my chat time to OFF PEAK hours in the night... AND I've done that before in the past... IN FACT, find that I don't do that as often as in the past.....<br><br>After a few months of M1 subscription, my phone price hit a $30+ in one of the later months (I chat with HP at night ONE of the nights...) My LAST MONTH's bill went up to a STUNTING RISE of $70+ indicating that I have EXCESSIVE use of TALKTIME... &lt;- Which OBVIOUSLY I didn't.... I called up the M1 customer service and they said they cannot release the phone call details UNLESS I pay a sum of $15 (I know about this already..). Upon my PERSISTENT questioning, they revealed that one of the longest call I made was 1 hour.... One thing I simply couldn't understand is that HOW can a 1 hour phone call COST me SO MUCH in EXCESSIVE...? 1. I'm SURE that I don't make long hour call during PEAK hours.... 2. I don't make MANY long hour calls... My QUESTION is... HOW MANY 1 hour calls would it take me to hit the $70+ target..??? DOESN'T MAKE SENSE...? Upon hearing my explanation, the customer service officer immediately EXPLAINED that it could be the fact that the voice mails that people left me cost me that SUM... But from what I know I've ONLY received 1 long voice mail which is DEFINITELY less than an hour long... (For the 'lost people' information, when your HP is DIVERTED eitther to your voice mail OR to another number, the time taken for the caller to hang up on that service or number is STILL charged under your BILL...) The next thing you know, I CANCELLED off my voicemail service... Though still VERY SUSPICIOUS of how the LUM SUM of billing (&gt; 2x my normal phone bill...) come about... I'd decided to monitor my HP usage....<br><br>THIS MONTH... GREAT... My phone bill came in with a $60+.... With 900++ SMS messages!!! ~1000 a month!!! WAH... I whole day in the office working where got so FREE to SMS &gt; 30 SMS a day without fail..??! GREAT... Now I'm REALLY BEGINNING to SUSPECT... Issit because of the fact that I'd told the M1 Customer Service Officers that I don't talk on the phone often but use more SMS instead that why the SUDDEN change..?? ~Sigh..~ Actually I thought of just paying the $70+ and forget about it... BUT this is EXAGGERATING man.....<br><br>My CURRENT PLAN is to WRITE in and ASK them to REVISE their BILLING CAREFULLY. In all case, I have NO INTENTION of paying them the RIDICULUS COST..... And wondering if anyone have SIMILAR EXPERIENCE or heard of so...? Are there any BETTER suggestions out there...? Worse come to worst I would just CHANGE a subscriber lor....<br><br>ANOTHER THING which also happened around the same period of time BEFORE my billing went up I think..? I'd actually JOINED a certain PHONE CLUB I came across from the internet.... But the PROBLEM is I don't seems to be able to use ANY of their facilities after registering with them...? I wonder if it could be a COINCIDENCE but I SUSPECT a possibility of a FRAUD PLAY too with such phone clubs... I mean afterall, the technology is really advancing fast with the hackers NOT very far behind... Be careful of such clubs too just in case ok..? I'm not very certain now too.. Though I've questioned the Customer Service Officer of the chances that my SIM No. would be 'pirated' by other users and they QUICKLY denied it (I guess of course they would do just that...?)...<br>Oh well.. Just hope things don't get ANY WORSE than this..?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm... what kind of phone club... c'mon you can be honest with us.  But seriously, i think you kena conned when you join the phone club.<br><br>Don't think M1 will take any responsibility, if so then only on a good will basis because any fraud arising will be due to one's personal action or gullibility... maybe too strong a word but i think it's best to settle this sharp and sweet!</div>

The bill has run up to hundreds which is really impossible for the both of them. Moreover, the cousin never bring the HP to school, so couldn't be he/she to use the sms to thousands...<br><br>Sometimes really wonder the sms bill is true or not...no one can determine...unless u really track ur msg 1 by 1...<br><br>Further clarification of the phone club u joined, Devil, is needed....doesn't sounds good or promising..hmm....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1st of all, to clarify the CLUB thingy... It's actually an internet phone club thing which prmoises you FREE SMS lah... After registering it as a member, I realise that I can never actually activate my account to do any SMS sending through the so-called internet facilities.... Hmm... Still come to think of it, I would like to think of the 2 incidents as NOT connected.... 1st reason being that, whoever just manage to get my HP number through the internet without doing anything much further MUST be really TOO GOOD.... 2nd reason being that like 'Gif' had mentioned.... From my understanding of the situation from the people around me.... I'm NOT the ONLY person with such 'LOUSY billings'......</div>
