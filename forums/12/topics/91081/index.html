            <div class='col-md body'>I am just wondering if I am too sensitive. I have this roomie, she has been my roomie for two years now but recently I sense that she has sort of change. Like last time she used to be humble about her achievement and stuff, but now I feel like she sort of look down on me. Like some of you might know about my disastrous job interviews...she is like the opposite of me. She will just need to attend the interview and then straight away get the job already. No need to even wait for reply. One thing is she is so damn pretty so maybe that's the cause also la. Another thing is she is so smart, every sem also get straight As.<br><br>Then she will complain one whole night about getting a job...and I will be like...hallo? She is the one who wants to apply for al those jobs. And she never think about how I would feel when she goes on and on about how many jobs she has when she knows fully well how badly I fare in most interviews. And when I told her the only job I can get is with the dining hall, she laughed and asked if I am sure I wanted such a job. And then she would say her job would make her resume looks real good because she is a computer lab technician la, she is a librarian la and a tutor also.<br><br>I dunno how to deal with her anymore. We used to be really close together but now I just get irritated with her everytime she brought this kinda topic up.  I have a feeling I might sort of 'explode' one day and then I would really argue with her and that wouldn't be nice since we have to stay together for at least another year. Anyone got any ideas how to deal with this?<br><br>i.c.y</div>

We used to be really close together but now I just get irritated with her everytime she brought this kinda topic up.  I have a feeling I might sort of 'explode' one day and then I would really argue with her and that wouldn't be nice since we have to stay together for at least another year. Anyone got any ideas how to deal with this?<br><br>i.c.y</div></blockquote>If you think that you're mature enough to handle a straight conversation with her to make things better and she's mature enough to have it with, then by all means do so.. Though personally, I don't a good chance of that happening...<br><br>Otherwise, you should allow conflicts with her by either minimising unneccesary conversations or even words that would trigger the other party off.. By doing such, both parties would usually have nothing to gain in the end... And it's cumulative... You say one thing, she say another... Both parties would have a part to play in the 'snowball flame'...<br><br>About moving out as suggested by other forumite.. I would only recommend and think of that as a last resort if things are really that bad.. Personally, I don't think you're really worst of things yet to push you for that option...<br><br>No matter how a person has changed or not change... You'll have to accept the fact that some people DO change... And understand that nobody's perfect... Sometimes a person's nasty side though might exist... But would take quite some 'triggering off' to see it... Go THINK about it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I have this roomie, she has been my roomie for two years now but recently I sense that she has sort of change. Like last time she used to be humble about her achievement and stuff, but now I feel like she sort of look down on me. Like some of you might know about my disastrous job interviews...she is like the opposite of me. She will just need to attend the interview and then straight away get the job already. No need to even wait for reply. One thing is she is so damn pretty so maybe that's the cause also la. Another thing is she is so smart, every sem also get straight As.<br><br>Then she will complain one whole night about getting a job...and I will be like...hallo? She is the one who wants to apply for al those jobs. And she never think about how I would feel when she goes on and on about how many jobs she has when she knows fully well how badly I fare in most interviews. And when I told her the only job I can get is with the dining hall, she laughed and asked if I am sure I wanted such a job. And then she would say her job would make her resume looks real good because she is a computer lab technician la, she is a librarian la and a tutor also.<br><br>I dunno how to deal with her anymore.

You see, as stated, both of you used to be close. The thing is.....you are starting to realise that she has excelled in areas which you think you are not comparable to her...e.g. looks, grades, interview techniques e.t.c. Well as time goes on..and these thoughts accumulates...you tend to start to become sensitive and 'angry' within yourself. You start to think why....why cant you be as good as her in those areas??<br><br>Well...and when the above reaches its peak..you will start to be very sensitive...to whatever that person says......even though the words the person said doesnt really mean to 'hurt' you or 'show-off' to you...In the first place, this person MAY HAVE NEVER intend to hurt you from her action/words in anyway.<br><br>Thus what you should do is: Have a heart-to-heart talk with her. Do not be embarassed to tell her what you think....and ask her how she managed to excel in those areas. If she is your good friend, she will share it with you. And dont forget...you have other areas which may be better than her. So, treat each other as sisters, and reach a win-win situation. This is just a common misunderstanding.</span> </strong></div>
