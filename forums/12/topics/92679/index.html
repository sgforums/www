Of cos is a good feeling that when someone you loved said "I Love you" but again.. mean it when you say.. and oso.. not too many of a times..<br><br>How long have you been together?? You seems rather young to me.. She might be uncertain of this r/s.. Don't think she feel secure too.. when she's with you.. if not if one person is satisfied.. i dun find any reasons that she would say she's confused.. or contradict herself in this r/s..<br><br>Loving someone doesn't mean you have to have her.. If you both really aint suitable for each other.. then why not learn to let go.. maybe both will be much happier.. Looking at cute guys doesn't imply that she dun love you.. This is a very very naive thinking.. How can you deduce a person whether she loves you anot by this way?? Oh! Does it mean when you look at girls.. you dun love her?? Silly!! You really need to learn alot..<br><br>To know whether both really love each other.. that's no teaching to it i guess.. this might be a test for both of you.. see whether you do know how to overcome such problems... dun let her feel that with or without you around.. it doesn't matter.. learn to open to each other and talk.. COmmunication is important in any r/s..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Is there supposed to be a really good feeling when someone says she loves u or not...<br><br>Cuz she now say she v confused cuz she noes she likes me but cannot confirm if she loves me. I mean it can also be a friend kind of love tat she feels for me. den maybe its juz that she wants to feel secure and likes somebody to talk to only.<br><br>According to her will feel something in the heart when i tell she tat i love her.. which she says she don feel. Will these things slowly develop or does this mean that our liking for ieach other is actually unreal. Also when she looks at other cute guys does it mean tat she does not love me or is itjust natural.<br><br>Help me can?? Really wnt to find out if we really love each other</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The perfect love?<br><br>A perfect love is when you can love your imperfect partner perfectly.<br><br>There is not way she can expect a relationship without hurt as a basis of a perfect love. With love; comes intimacy; comes emotional closeness; come friction; come reality. If she is not willing to be ease with you and herself emotionally, there is no way love could enter completely and mould her. Fear is one factor that hinders people from having fulfilling relationship.<br><br>Like? Love? Why does the confusion comes in NOW? Shouldn't it be solved before a relationship is born? This question your situations before you two got together and whether the risk/doubt/etc at the point of time is brewing now. Unless you are telling me that you have led a relationship for quite some time and she felt routine and dead. Then it would be for love or duty scenario.<br><br>What kind of help do you need from US to let you understand if you two loved each other? It makes zero sense.<br><br>P.S: Maybe you can explain MORE about your situations from day zero of your relationship, how you met, become together, past crisis, etc? I believe it will help you to understand better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
