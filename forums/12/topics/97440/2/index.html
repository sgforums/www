And oso not right of you to step into this relationship without her ending the previous one first.. Ming and anna has been together for 1 year.. Consider long not long.. consider short not short.. over these 1 year.. Ming has loved her so much.. If this guy is so good.. then what's the reason of Anna's leaving?? Have you ever wonder?? Did she ever tell you that is becos ming is too good for her.. that she's not worthy of him?? Or becos of your appearance that she finds out that she no longer lover Ming??<br><br>You both dated out without even settling the current problems and jus shun it aside.. You think is fair to MIng?? Yes, you both may be truely in love with each other..but do oso consider ming's feelings.. His love for her is so deep.. ANd now you both are hurting him so much.. Love cannot be forced.. Everyone knows.. Anna's mum that side.. Leave it first.. Firstly, what you have to do is the three of you have to come out and talk about the situation happening now..<br><br>Anna is two-timing.. if she really loves you.. then end the r/s with ming.. though we know that ming will be deeply hurt.. but then again.. if she continue to two-time.. it will hurt not one.. but all three of you... You got to ask Anna who does she love.. She couldn;t decide back then is becos.. she's afraid of losing you and yet hurting ming.. But then again.. she has to make one choice.. Get all 3 out to talk.. ok.. Make it clear to everyone what's happening..<br><br>As for the mum.. She's afraid that Anna is two-timing.. and in the end she will lose both.. Then again.. Ask Anna to reaaure her mum that she will settle the problem between her and ming.. Anna should let her mum know how she feels towards you.. and the reasons why she wants to end the relationship with ming.. Tell her mum that this concerns Anna's happiness.. Let her choose the guy she wants.. She's big enough.. Yes, ming can be very caring and thoughtfull.. blah blah.. Be confidence and be true that you can do that too.. This is a promise made to her and to her mum.. You must remember this..<br><br>Slowly talked to her mum.. Ask Anna bring you home one day for dinner or wat.. and intro you to her mum.. Make sure you are true about yourself.. Let her know that you can take care of Anna too..<br><br>You ask why does you have to consider other people.. is not neccesary though.. for your case.. is not considering.. is to settle the current situation that's why people who are involved in this.. are being pulled in.. Firstly is ming.. end it fast if she really want to.. Don't drag too long!!! Secondly is her mum.. Mummy always afraid that their daughter might find someone bad or wat.. that's why they so kan cheong.. and would prefer her to stick to the previous bf.. instead of new one.. another thing is that they know this guy so well liao.. This is way you have to prove to them that you too can do it..<br><br>AFter all these.. is the world of you both liao..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I jus wan you both to solve the problems.. don't hurt anyone further.. this includes all three...<br><br>You mean her mum thinks that what she did was wrong that she shouldn't hurt ming?? Well... she has to talk to her mum about this.. about the relationship with ming.. and the present one that is with you.. her mum must know that love cannot forced... This ain't the past where parents decide on who their child should married to.. Now is a different generation.. many have their own ways to do things.. and to love someone they loved and loved them too..<br><br>Tell her mum.. that if she insisted on 2 person who are not truely in love and forced them to be together will they both be happy ever?? Will they be able to give each other happiness...?? Many of the parents will compare themselves as a role model.. "See me and your dad also like that.. Feelings can developed over the years.." This is becos.. most of them havent even met each other b4.. is only on the date of marriage then they know who their partners are.. But now.. people will go for courtship.. if they know they arent suitable for each other.. why not try to let go.. this is the what you can give.. let them find their real happiness..<br><br>Holding on to someone whose heart no longer with you.. is so selfish.. Loving someone need not have to be with that someone..As long as he/she is happy.. you'll be glad too.. Anna must let her mum understands this.. Must learn to let go..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
