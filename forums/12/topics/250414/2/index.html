As you mentioned, that guy is a flirt and probably have hurt your wife and there is still a love/hate feeling for that guy. As for what has happened between them I do not know but please note that all is in the past and it does not matter anymore. If she is sensible enough, she should build her future with you.<br><br>The guy has been reasonable by trying to stay away from your wife.<br><br>I understand working and studying part-time is not easy as I am still going through it and this may be the reason why your wife chooses you because of your determination to do well and succeed in life.

For a girl by the age 28-30 (if she is not married), she would probably gone through a few serious relationships and breakups. By then if the next available guy comes along and gives the least heartache, she might agree to settle down with him....and usually this effect is coupled with the persistence of the guy even though she might not like him from the start.
