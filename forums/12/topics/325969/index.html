              <p>Ive known this girl for 2 1\2 years or more...I started to develop feelings for her after i learnt about her...her charm, goodwill, personality, how she loves studying and dancing, and how much her family is dear to her, and wishes to support them in time to come...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We've always just messaged and msn'd, rarely called her. Maybe because when i think of calling her up, the only thing left is my heart to explode. I've always wondered why is it so hard for me to talk to her on the phone. Not the same with other 'girl-friends' tho. Ive told her abt my intrest in here 3 times, but all her replies were 'its not the right time, she doesnt knows when or shes really buzy with life(with her dip and her hectic dance schedules). She also has mentioned its not that she doesnt like me, its just bout the timing. So yeah..ive havent told her for the 4th time(been nearly a year since i hinted her the last time), but maybe it would be my last coz her studies are gonna finish soon, and probably might be the right time. If she stills doesnt approves of a relationship between us, i guess i should move on. But i swear it'll be so hard. All this two years plus, ive related her on so many things in my life. (Eg, like when i was in BMT, i always said to myself, whatever hardship i suffered in army is all for her, aspirations to become a successful guy in life to support her all my life and of course much many more, just listed the ones that came to my mind a few secs ago). The only 2 people that knows abt how i feel is my best friend, and one of her best friend. They told me to take it in my stride and all they could do was to wish me best of course. Great motivation but not enough if i get the jelly feet often when i talk or meet her. (How do i confess my love to her face to face like that!?) </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We've met a couple of times, most of it sending her back home. The more recent ones was this year, when ive met her just a measly 3 times but i'd say the most meaningful ones. The first one was when we went to zouk together around early feb...everything went awesome, way beyond then how i expected that night to me...i was like let loose that night(probably coz she was with me). My friends were like, 'what happened to you last night, you were crazy!'. She said the same thing and said i was rather cool tho. Usually i find clubbing boring actually. That was the only time i really enjoyed clubbing i guess. After that night it was back to square one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Second time was arnd late april or early may. Nothing much, just met her and sent her back home safely. But it was meeting after so long, so i really didnt take notice of anything else then to just meeting her. If there was any chance to meet her i'd jump at it, but theres very little i must say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The most recent one was a forthnight ago, where she agreed to watch movie with me(like after so long we've known each other). So we went to watch hellboy2, played the arcade and chilled out at coffeebean. I could see she avoided eye contact with me and was rather shy. Likewise i was the same aswell. So, yeah we were just catching up and she was sharing some random stuff.</p>
              <p>While we were at coffeebean. She suddenly asked me when i was gonna be commited to a partner. I was rather stunned for a momment. But i replied 'When <strong>she</strong>'s ready'. She knows who i meant, and she was like so shy bout it. When i asked how about her? She said after my studies or graduation which was like just a few weeks away...Is she hinting something? Maybe its my pursuit of her which moved her? I maybe wrong, maybe that could be just a casual question eh? Im just a very hopeful individual yet sometimes a failure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While i was sending her back home, she told me, rather softly, 'we're great friends'. I was like, what?. She said 'we're great friends', while looking away somewhere. I was like 'oh'. and i was telling to myself, 'great friends for now just i hope'. See, how hopeful i am?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The past sunday she told me shes havin a high fever. So i messaged her that you should see a doctor and all those get well soon and how you feel in the morning and good night messages. No reply. Totally. I called her last night, but her sister said she had slept. So yeah, i waited till this morning hoping that she would reply, and she did at 9.58am. 'You called? im fine now. On my way to school :]'.</p>
              <p>Wellll, Ok. She replied. But why didnt you reply me at all to my countless messages sent to her? Weak? i dont think so, messaging doesnt take much effort. She could still contact her bestie bout her mc. Why not me?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really cant understand her at all...Just when i thought our relationship was getting a step ahead, and it goes 2 step backwards. So how do i go about telling her bout her reclusiveness for the past week? or can any girl out there tell me, what shes thinking about? and what are my chances?</p>

              <p>it make no point saying all out here. even with the best "love doctor" in the world, it wont help much. the only thing to do, is just to confess your love to her, and see whether a relationship will work out not. if she doesnt feel anything for you, don be sad. instead, be glad for the bravey you had to ever said " iloveyou " to her. to ever love a person, or the meaning of loving a person, ( in my personally views, no offence to any individuals ) is to see her wearing that sweety smile everyday. being happy is all what it matters. love aint talking about procession you gonna have on that girl.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for my case,</p>
              <p>my girl, being together for 2 years le. but many things just simply cock up. i would proudly say, it's not my fault if this relationship were to fail to carry at any point of time. i had tried my best to give my best and everything to her le. she may not be the best looking girl in this world. but she's the one i ever love the most throughout my life. she's surely not the type of girl i hope to have as my wife in future. but i just hope and pray, she will, one day, indeed, change for me =) i ask for little, just a simple relationship, to enjoy the sweetest level of LOVE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>bro, just to share with you my thinkings. im sorry if i had offended anyone reading this post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LOVE is not to gain procession of that girl. but just to see that smile on her face everyday, will delights you in million ways.</p>

              <p>Similarly, I'd told her before 3 times.</p>
              <p>She told me we couldn't be anything more than friends. Heartbroken, yes. But accept it an take it in your stride. Tell yourself it's her loss.</p>

              <p> Will the TS do all it takes to melt the fair lady's heart?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>It's all about familiar places that significant events have happened.</p>
              <p>Step 1: Bring her back to that same ol Coffeebean.</p>
              <p>Step 2: Since they watched the movie Hellboy2, he needs to play that Barry Manilow song featured in the movie.  In case, you don't know it, the song's entitled Can't Smile Without You.  Play it on an ipod or phone and let her listen to it.</p>
              <p>Step 3: It's all in the eyes and hands.  TS needs to look his fair lady in her eyes once the song is over and hold, you guessed it ...  her hands.  Make sure both hands are holding the lady's one hand on the table.  Be careful not to spill the latte. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Step 4: TS needs to decide what he needs to say to her.  This I don't think I should teach  otherwise this post will be like 10 pages long.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>as for the girl, ur too anxious alrdy, coz u like her n wanna confirm whether she is the one, so u keep thinking alot...esp if u haf alot of free time, ull keep thinking abt it n start imagining stuff...the fact is theres nothing much u can do for now, u haf to wait for the time to come to see what is gonna b ur next step...</p>

              <p>Ok, on tuesday evening a girl called me, asking me if i got time for a survey on BGR(Boy-Girl-Relationship).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, since i had time, why not?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C-Caller</p>
              <p>M-Me ;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The questions:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C: Whats your name?</p>
              <p>M: ------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C: What are you doing and where are you currently?</p>
              <p>M: Army, and in camp.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C: Are you single or attached?<br>M: Single.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C: Have you ever been in a relationship before?</p>
              <p>M: No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C: Do you have a girl you fancy?</p>
              <p>M: Yes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C: Have you been courting her, and how long if so?</p>
              <p>M: Yes i do have a girl i fancy, ive knowned her from secondary school, but only contacted her after we graduated and its been nearly 2.5 years since ive been goin after her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(Laughter in the background)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C: Whats your favourite food?</p>
              <p>M: Slight pause(Sensed something fishy coz why would a survey on BGR suddenly included questions bout food).., Who are you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'She' put down the phone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was like..ok, whats her motive of this prank and more importantly, who was that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So i messaged that number(Yes, its a hp number -.-), 'Who are you?'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reply was, 'The line has been cut off due to too many calls received. Thank you for your time :)'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And i replied, 'Im not a fool as you think miss, who are you, whats your purpose with that survey? If you dont wanna tell, its ok, i can give your number to the intelligence department in my camp to track (Just some shiz i made up, lol =p).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And after a few minutes, 'SHE'(My love) called...., i was like, why would she call me all of a sudden...</p>
              <p>Then she explained that it was her on the phone earlier and that it was just a mere prank and even asked why i was so serious bout it and stuff..i was shocked. I told her that i knew it was a prank, its just that i didnt know who it was and just curious to know who was it..thats about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was kinda embaressed, but in a way happy too, because at least she knows that i was honest with my answers and she probably knew who was it as well...obviously.</p>

              <p>She's most probably interested in you.</p>

              <p>And, you did wrong le lar. You should have just played along... Don't be so serious. It'll bore the other person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me, i think that why she would give you the  BGR relationship survey is most probably is cos she's interested in you. She's just being playful. ;D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember to play along if she decides to play with you <strong>again</strong>. (ps: which i think that she'll think twice before doing that next time). Unless the prank requires you to reveal something personal to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry if i'm too straightforward.</p>

              <p>To me, i think that why she would give you the  BGR relationship survey is most probably is cos she's interested in you. She's just being playful. ;D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember to play along if she decides to play with you <strong>again</strong>. (ps: which i think that she'll think twice before doing that next time). Unless the prank requires you to reveal something personal to you.</p>

              <p>Sorry if i'm too straightforward.</p>

              <p>Oh, and recently she asked me when i'll be out of camp..i was like 'HOLYSHIMOLYyy!'(haha just kidding', told her that i'd be out on weekend for this week at least). That was the first time she ever asked that..i still feel that i shouldnt get my hopes high just yet as well...well thats about it, the asking was there, but the plans weren't. Waitin'........</p>
