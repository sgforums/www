            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Galtwenty,<br><br>I suppose deep down in us, everybody misses the good old days when we were young &amp; didn't have a care.  I do miss those old days too, when I didn't have to worry about $ &amp; I was still innocent about what work life was really like.  Friends &amp; I used to think about what we'd do, what ambitions we have, etc.  How I laugh at it now, &amp; I smile whenever my young nephew voices his thoughts, because that was how I used to be...<br><br>However, although I miss the old days, I don't wish to turn back the clock.  The lessons I've learnt &amp; the hurdles I've crossed made me what I am today.  I know what to do when the going gets tough, etc.  It's better than staying stagnant at a level which isn't very much.<br><br>A young girl I'm mentoring brings back sweet memories of when I was like her, fresh, innocent, etc.  But she's struggling, &amp; I well remember her struggles.  I don't want to be in that position again.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by GaLtwenty:</div><div class="quote_body">Feeling nostalgic now....<br><br>Had no worries at the time....Miss the good days</div></blockquote></div>

"looking back wistfully is fine but the thing is not to get depressed wondering where it all disappeared to..." I 26 this yr too and I really miss my primary school days. No pressure but all day just play soccer. Sometime i really wish i will never grow up, but this is what my life has to be, grow and adapt. To me now, although I miss the good old days, but what is important is also cherish the moment now and look forward to the future.
