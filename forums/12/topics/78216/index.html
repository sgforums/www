            <div class='col-md body'>I dont know if this is worth trying:<br><br>Drink fresh or raw potato juice, which is believed to control the further spread of cancer cells.<br><br>Mash fresh potatoes to pulp and continuously every day drink one to two glasses of potato juice derived from this pulp. This will mainly cure cancer, but recovery cases from liver disease, diabetes, gastric ulcer, kidney disease, heart disease, hypertension, lumbago, and sore shoulders have also been reported. (so it claims)<br><br>A link: http://www.whatmedicine.co.uk/articlesJuiceTherapy.htm<br><br>My parents are drinking potato juice to reduce their hypertension. I suppose that since it is natural juice, it may give significant health benefits.<br><br>But of course, the scienctific aspects of drinking this potato juice is not really clear. I know of this from a booklet which advocate the drinking of potato juice. There are testimonials by several Japanese patients that have attributed their recovery from illness to potato juice. I do take what they claim inside the booklet with a pinch of salt, as I also have my doubts if potato juice can cure so many illnesses as claimed above, but again I also see no harm in drinking something that is natural.<br><br>But of course, one should read more into this before starting anything at all. But I certainly hope your friend will recover, using whatever means possible.</div>
