              <p>perhaps martial arts isnt for u......even if u learnt it................it would take a longer time for u to be a warrior.most girls dont get frightened when they kick .</p>
              <p>anyway if u cant kick well or jump well...u could also benefit like having a slimmer female body which is often in the case of girls in martial arts.</p>

              <p>you just jump and kick only. think it in this way, if your classmates can do it, you can do it too. You are not weak, in fact better them, just do it. </p>
              <p>if you do martial art, to get twist ankle, broken bones, aching... is normal. </p>
              <p>I have taken a 100% a full round house kick from some1 recently, and now it still hurts. So if I scare, then I should play chess instead loh. </p>

              <p>Its all ur mentality....If you think u can do it means u can....(Dun think of ridiculous things though).Give yourself an excuse.Or boast to yourself.Like ''fall down and sprain my ankle?Lol joke only stupid fools will sprain their ankles''.And if unfortunately,you sprain your ankle,bear with the pain and continue with the jump and kicks.I know it isn't easy bearing with the pain but for me when im in pain,ill get very angry and continue doing the things im do with brute force lol </p>
              <p>The brute force way im using is kinda good for the martial art course you're doing XD</p>

              <p>do u know why u fear ?</p>
              <p>generally, fear can either be real or baseless.  if the fear is real, try to pinpoint what could be the cause of the fear.  take precaution or manage it to eliminate the cause so that the fear will be removed. </p>
              <p>if the fear is baseless, this is mostly due to our imagination or lack of knowledge.  in this case, talk to your coach or seniors and let them help you understand.  find out how best you can do to protect yourself.  take small steps in conquering your fear. </p>
              <p>just to give an example - before jumping off 10 storeys, jump off 1st storey first, then 2nd storey, ... progressively.  build up your confidence and gauge how far you can go and how much your body can take.</p>
              <p>seek out martial arts community (forum) where there will be more people who can give you advice.</p>
              <p>hope it helps.</p>

              <p>Keep practicing. If you fall down, you think what had gone wrong, issit your footwork issue? They should also got teach how to breakfall.</p>
              <p>I dunno if courages and bravery is the same meaning&gt; Some of this gotta come with age, and experiance with life..</p>
              <p>If you fall, no need scare embarressment, keep doing until you get it right, everytime do it better, good timing to kick is essential, practise make perfect.Adjust ur timing, angle, distance, speed.</p>
              <p>Maybe the type of martial arts you learn&gt; to you fall down is no good, but to some,is a false move in order to go for the kill.</p>
              <p>Most martial arts teach "stand-up" fighting, they dun really teach "ground" fighting and are for "points system" during tornement.In real life, do you think one will not fall down?</p>
              <p>Example: Muay thai teach you knee the ribs due to many restrictions. If me, i knee my opponent's private parts. Aikido tell you go in, twist the hand, make ur emeny fall, if me, i grap the hand (do 180 degree turn), put his elbow above my shouder, i break his arm.<br><br>I have friends that are instructors in martial arts, but what they teach during class are not what they use in real life, reason being&gt; In real pratical world, is use the easiest,fastest,most lethal way to KO ur opponent.</p>
              <p>Many will teach how to excute a technic, but never show/teach how or what to do in order for you to let you opponent to give you the chance to use that technic.</p>
              <p>During tornement or real fight is timing issue, reaction, practice &amp; practice.<br>An example: Last year, got a competition, is Muay Thai VS TKD in singapore.<br>TKD is black belt 4 Dan(iirc),36 yrs old instructor, 76kg. <br>Muay thai opponent only learn 6 months, age 27, 72kg.</p>
              <p>TKD guy use double turn back thrust of right leg, Muay thai guy avoid.(Timing)<br>TKD guy jump up, come down, fast 180 degrees turn to left leg kick, Muay thai guy avoid.(Reaction)<br>TKD guy again jump up, mid air turn right leg kick, Muay Thai guy bend down then do a high sweep kick.TKD guy fall flat on face(Timing, Reaction + practice).</p>
              <p>Another SG chinese guy (heard he learn 5 years shang shou).<br>Facing a TKD brown belt guy (Indian).(Tis guy practice hard, good conditioning)<br>This TKD guy is a clever guy, use brain to fight.Chinese guy charge in&gt; Indian guy act fall down, but he back thrust using heel kick the chines guy chin, Chines guy KO.<br>(Timing, practice)</p>
              <p>Learn martial arts is only learn the style, to really use it is HAVE to practice.<br>In real world, is using brain &amp; how to use the fastest leathal way to KO opponent.</p>
              <p>Read up books on variouse martial arts, you will notice some technic from martial arts A is use to counter martial arts B.</p>
              <p> EDITED: I dunno how to teach you to be couragous, but if you want to do it, you can do it, Its in your mind, you have to overcome yourself first. If then you can do it, keep on practicing. You will be a gem in no time.</p>
              <p>To be good in martial arts is just hard work &amp; practice. If learn liao but dun practice, in your mind you know all technic, but when using it , it will not be swift &amp; effective.</p>
              <p>Maybe, you can try  jump lower + kick, slowely higher+kick.<br>Just like a forumer had said, progressively...slowely slowely. Dun rush yourself.Tell yourself you can do it.</p>

              <p>Hi, recently I took up martial arts and need to train to jump and kick.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem is, I am scared of falling down or twist my ankle.</p>
              <p>Despite this, I really have the interest to learn and hope to do a nice jump and kick. But I just am too timid and also scared of embarressment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am afraid my this condition is 'want to learn but scared to learn syndrome'. Then if I give up just because I am 'scared to do it', I know I will regret why I didn't go for it when I am still young and start regretting when I am old liow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How can I be courageous?</p>
