In this case, if you think that being unfriendly is not gracious...then you're wrong. And you're not man enough if you don't stand your ground against this kind of nonsense act, but never direct your anger towards your girlfriend...just that irritating guy.<br><br>I must implore you to trust your girlfriend at all times...even when sometime coincidences can make it seems like she's betraying you. (I hate those coincidences that are constantly testing everyone)<br><br>Your girlfriend chose to be with you and not anyone else, so she deserves your trust at all times...trust her ok? She'll know how to 'siam' any advances and not get herself into any deadlock situations with that guy.<br><br>By right, she is not supposed to be messing/mingling with any other guys accordingly to a guy's point of view. But by left, she's not married to you yet...so she's still available to all guys if they are able to worm their ways into her soft-heart. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Come on....girls also desire romance and lots of love at any point of time. So if you're boring and static as gravity, don't expect her to be a nun for you. And that's why we get breakups, cos the guys don't keep up to their promises. For example, "You said you love me?...So is that all to your love towards me?" something like this will definitely pop up in the girl's mind eventually. So if you don't want her to think of this, do something about it and defy gravity. Love is constant...but relationship shouldn't be constant...it should be spontaneous and like a roller-coaster ride. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ask yourself, is that guy doing something that you should be doing for your girlfriend? If that is so, then you should do something about it before you girlfriend realise how boring her life has been ever since entering into a relationship with you.<br><br>Maintaining a relationship has so much more heavier responsibilities compared to keeping a promise. So if you truely love your girlfriend, let that desire reaches her everytime both of you are together.<br><br>Lead the way in the race of love and leave the rest of the competition behind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
