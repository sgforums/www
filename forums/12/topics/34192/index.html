Like wat her parents say, maybe she said it in spurt of anger. Likewise in many relationships, there are its ups and downs. Not many things in a relationship can be solved amicably. She is ur fiancee and most likely, there wun be any platonic relationship. Things will go your way if u ask me.<br><br>I just wish all the best to you and take it slowly.

            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place, she told you that she doesn't love you anymore. Could it be that she's having some personal problems like having alot of stress and pressure at work, you didn't shower her with enough care and concern or love, you didn't spend enough time with her? Or she might have found someone who love her more?<br><br>yah, as what you have said, she gave you a Firm NO, and she could said that in a fit of anger, or maybe she's really stress.. Maybe you might want to sit down and have a heart to heart talk and ask her why she's feeling this way about your attitude. And what kind of attitude does she not like about you?<br><br>and as what you have said, when you are sick, she still concerns about you, that means, she still loves you and is showering you with some care and concern to you. did you show her care when she's sick?<br><br>Since you are bringing her to her favourite place, remember to make her happy, make her enjoy every minute of happiness with you..<br><br>Hope that after your holiday, everything turns out well..</div>

Have you ever wonder why is the *real* reason behind her claims?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>One Factor which could be the reason why she made her claims, (my deduction since you never state certain points)<br><br>Correct me if I am wrong: Plans of marriage is draggy since both of you are engaged for five years (which means together for more than five years inclusive of BGR) and now recently you may bring up the subject of marriage, or somehow certain situation could make her feel that marriage between the both of you is drawing near.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So what has it got to do with her claims?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>One criticial problem and issue about being engaged and living together is the dragging this title far too long without marriage. Psychologically proven - people are less willing to settle down for a marriage because one thing: If when you are engaged and lived together, you enjoy some good aspect of a marriage (like sexual activity with *license*, etc) without the burden of marriage (Kids, financial, a REAL couple responsibilities, etc).<br><br>She said that she is now treating you as a friend, etc, yet caring for you, etc - this only prove one thing and I am 90% sure of this: She is now doubting that the characteristic found in you - is it really the ones she is seeking? The one who will be walking with her together till death do you people apart?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are a good man - there is no serious fault that can be found in you, but in relations, regardless of marriage, engaged or BGR, it either goes up or down. Furthermore you stated that affection is not there, although you love her, it certainly is not going up. You loved her but you don't show it - it is like you save up your money without the intention to spend it - saving it just for the sake of saving it. You *DON'T* have to show to the whole world, but just to her, many a times its good - provided its not too late.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>My advice is this:<br><br>She is confused - you have to take lead.<br>She is confused - you have to prove and show that you are the only one that she needs this lifetime.<br>She is confused because time has clouded her vision in this relationship.<br><br>*Correct me If I am wrong* - this your relation going routine? If you suspect it is, do something about it.<br><br>When the both of you go overseas for the trip. Firstly don't put your hope too high (everything is fated; Zacken's signature... lol). Then, when speaking to her, not speak about whether she wants this relation or not, etc - this is PRESSURING her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You tactics has to be SHOW not tell. During this period, try to revive talks about old times when you people come together. The good times and bad times. Now this is the time, if you haven't, to ask the inner aspect between the both of you - why did she chose you? Whats her view about Love? Etc... etc...<br><br>You have to TOUCHED her... because you don't have all the time in the world to do so. Not immediate propose or what... but as in the time spent together its something really meaningful and you have to SAY that even you don't tell her I love you everyday, you do care. SHE HAS TO HEAR from your MOUTH. One key element to take notice: you also have to share your own views if she kept silent - if you bare your hearts to people, people will bare their hearts to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I am not asking you to be romantic - I am asking you to be sincere and to be the loving you when it comes to her. She is temporary confused - and if led properly, she will return.<br><br>P.S: In case if complication occurs, or when the situational factors changed, or when you have succeed. Send me a pte msg or post it here. I will get to you as fast as I could.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

You are working hard so that she can have a good life later when she marries you - I understand and know that love has grew responsibility in you, which made you strive and work hard. But till the point where you neglect her... whats the use when in the end she may left you, leaving you to those money, etc... so by working so hard, does it even matter? I am so gald you realise this point - nothing is better than acknowledging the fault within oneself and attempt to work it out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I was so right - she was pressurized by some factor into marriage, which means that the points I made in my essay before is basically what she is going through. She is hesistating because she is thinking 'Now we live together and I am leading such a life... imagine if we were to get married...' kind of thoughts. It has never been a problem to you whether you want to get married or what - it lies with her. Of course, you would get married if she agrees - financially you are very stable, relationship gone long enough to settle down, etc. For her? I bet with 90% confidence that before she sleep or whenever she is alone - this negative thought will pop out. It accumulates within her and when her mum pressurized her to get married - the catalysis - she suddenly blow the news to you saying that her love is just friendship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>2 years - is a long period of time that you have neglect her. Maybe to her, it could be longer. To revive your relation, I have already made my statement in my prior post. The thing is that you have to *LET* her realise that when she eventually married you - she will NEVER regret it.<br><br>I could sense very strong emotional vibes coming from you - all these statement you posted it here, people here can only advice and encourage - the main thing is that the main actress in your story has to know all that. Tell her... share with her... this view... this plan you already have... tell her that now things are more stable financially - you will give all your available time to her. You compromise and try to work things out - she also have to try to give you a chance.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Heres a tip: You have been concentrated so much on the financial aspect of this relation. Now is the time to focus on the emotional and spiritual aspect of your relation. If you know she wants to move back to Singapore - perhaps you could make it a surprise to her one day, saying that you people would be moving back to Singapore, etc. They will definitely say 'aiya nevermind lar, don't be so troublesome, etc.' but when you do it for their sake willingly - they will be smiling in their heart. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Always try to understand her viewpoint on how she percieve love, relation and related issues. Woman, generally (99%), when you are able to make them speak their hearts out to you, their real thoughts, etc - they tend to be closer to you. Move on this way.<br><br>Last point: Always move gradually and steadily - you can't afford to screw up this time. Don't pressure... induce and lead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
