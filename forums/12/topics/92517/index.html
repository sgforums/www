Afterall, parents are not going to be with you until the day you die. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

All they do is advise. I guess my parents are easy.<br><br>Anyway, sometimes parents being of a different generation have different concepts on what the ideal guy/girl is. eg. Girl must do housework etc etc. Fortunately for me, all of my bfs parents are all very open-minded and modern in thinking because if not I think I'm going to have lots of clashes with them, being extremely strong-headed myself and I don't believe in the so called 'role of a woman' in their generations context.<br><br>I guess its not only dependent on your or your parents but on the person you are dating as well, because one party will have to 'give in' and amend that fault that your parents dislike, or convince them somehow that whatever first impression they have of him/her was a mistake.<br><br>Anyway I think it is most essential on why the parents don't approve of the person you are dating. Anyway, I will weigh their reasons if it is valid or not, and also on my partner's willingness to please them or change. However, do keep in mind that yr happiness is at stake here. I will never sacrifice my own happiness just because my parents don't like my partner's face.<br><br></div>

I know of 1 case whereby both side parents want their kids to stay with they so naturally there is a fallout among the parents. The kids are currently 30s, at this rate they might have to wait until either side parent kick the bucket before they can tie their knots. Personally I hope my parents will know beter than to get in my way for love cos while I always try to be a good son, I will properly choose love over them.</div>
