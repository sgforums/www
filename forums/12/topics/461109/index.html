              <p>Im wondering if anyone here knows anybody who got married just for the sake of getting a flat of their own?</p>
              <p>Singles must wait till 35yrs and can only buy resale flats with high COV. And BTOs are for couples. Do you have any friends who married a friend of the opposite sex just for this? Maybe they want their own space or have family problems so thats why they need a flat. They apply BTO with a so called husband or wife as they cat afford to pay COV for resale flats.</p>
              <p>Its like 2 friends (guy &amp; gal) with mutual agreement to stay together but strictly platonic so as to have their own home and privacy.</p>
