At your age, marriage would probably seemed like an urban legend, somewhat distant and unimaginable. Even if you do see certain pictures of it, I am sure you are not anywhere near its vicinity.<br><br>You are losing passion and in the process, discover repelling flaws of your partner. And thoughts of giving up flash across your mind at times.<br><br>Speak. Communicate. Make Mistake. Learn.<br><br>It would probably be too fantasy to say that you would end up with her for the rest of your life. Don't focus and worry too much about making the 'right choice' when the right choice will only surface when the wrong choice is being triggered.
