              <p>i am a girl from a secondary school and i feel like i am being emotionally bullied by this boy in my class. he is known to be one of the more "popular", "high profile" boys in the school and he gets his way all the time. He is extremely obnoxious and controlling and if something or someone is not to his liking, he will flare up and scream like a mad dog at that person, and i really literally mean SCREAM. recently, i had a conflict with this boy and maybe it was a misunderstanding but it wasnt really a big thing, just a few sentences exchanged and he screamed at me. I decided to shut up because i knew it was useless arguing with such people because they simply never learn and my friends and i had quickly apologised for mentioning the thing that made him pissed off. he finally decided to shut up. however, that was not the end of it. he continued whispering to his gang of dog buddies in the class who (obviously) sticks to him in fear of being screamed at or outcasted about me and made faces and made mocking remarks right in front of my face. when i have to go up and do presentations, he makes faces at me and whispers to his friends loudly. and the conflict happened just a day ago so i know thats not the end of his antics.</p>
              <p>this is not the first time he has done something like that to someone as my friend happened to be a victim as well a few years ago. he screamed at her outside the classroom until students in other classes came out to see the commotion. he even wanted to hit her, but was stopped in time by the class leader. he does this to both girls and boys and when he doesnt like someone, he will threaten that person like how he threatened my friend to making the whole level of students hate her. </p>
              <p>he also dislikes my other classmate and as a result, we both now feel this dread of coming to school and seeing his face. and no, i do not want to confront him or talk to him because he is just not going to listen and he will just scream and shout like a maniac. i have been ignoring his hurtful gestures since the incident had happened. what is the proper way to deal with this?</p>

              <p>It could be a genuine ADHD issue. Even though our MOE-NIE educators have experienced in teaching, many still unable to pick up ADHD student effectively. Identifying ADHD student is not about just attending a module of lesson, it's about interacting with many types of students for a period of time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of our educator are not able to identify ADHD students. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"> Only allied educators or counsollers have the necessary expertise and knowledge.</p>
