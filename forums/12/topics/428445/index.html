              <p>i am a girl from a secondary school and i feel like i am being emotionally bullied by this boy in my class. he is known to be one of the more "popular", "high profile" boys in the school and he gets his way all the time. He is extremely obnoxious and controlling and if something or someone is not to his liking, he will flare up and scream like a mad dog at that person, and i really literally mean SCREAM. recently, i had a conflict with this boy and maybe it was a misunderstanding but it wasnt really a big thing, just a few sentences exchanged and he screamed at me. I decided to shut up because i knew it was useless arguing with such people because they simply never learn and my friends and i had quickly apologised for mentioning the thing that made him pissed off. he finally decided to shut up. however, that was not the end of it. he continued whispering to his gang of dog buddies in the class who (obviously) sticks to him in fear of being screamed at or outcasted about me and made faces and made mocking remarks right in front of my face. when i have to go up and do presentations, he makes faces at me and whispers to his friends loudly. and the conflict happened just a day ago so i know thats not the end of his antics.</p>
              <p>this is not the first time he has done something like that to someone as my friend happened to be a victim as well a few years ago. he screamed at her outside the classroom until students in other classes came out to see the commotion. he even wanted to hit her, but was stopped in time by the class leader. he does this to both girls and boys and when he doesnt like someone, he will threaten that person like how he threatened my friend to making the whole level of students hate her. </p>
              <p>he also dislikes my other classmate and as a result, we both now feel this dread of coming to school and seeing his face. and no, i do not want to confront him or talk to him because he is just not going to listen and he will just scream and shout like a maniac. i have been ignoring his hurtful gestures since the incident had happened. what is the proper way to deal with this?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>either u can go straight up to principal or the discipline master, or i wld suggest u to go louder than him. The more u ignore him, the more he tinks he gets his way. So either u show to him that u wont be bullied that easily, or u get external help. To me loud noise fuckers go down damn easily when they meet ppl they know it is not easy to mess with. Probably become a shrewed woman for once might be good to. If u happen to be in my school i guess that person probably will get into some serious prob.</div>

              <p>Report him to the principal if your teacher is scared. What kind of an educator is your teacher? lol It's a joke if he allows a student to walk all over him/her.</p>
              <p>After all, it's done in the working world all the time. Someone gives you shit? Email his direct boss and cc the boss's boss. Or better still, email the boss's boss and cc the direct boss. Simple.</p>

              <p>actually i wouldnt mind informing the DM if things get out of hand but since there's a possibility that he would stop picking on me if i ignored him, then i believe giving him some time won't really hurt. </p>
              <p>Well, i hate to say this but he is affecting my mood when i am in school. however, im not really alone because there are classmates who think that he's a dog as well and encourage me to just let the matter pass. And i do dread stepping into the classroom and seeing his disgusting face, and i know im not the only one because he dislikes other girls in the class as well.</p>
