              MY "STEP BROTHER"</strong> . He have his own house own family and

              <p> </p>
              <p>It's extremely clearcut that he didn't leave anything for them
              in his will, either that or, he transferred the assets to his other
              step son before his death.</p>

              <p>TS story is choppy.. Too many missing pieces like VK says.</p>
              <p>I doubt TS even knows exactly what is going on in his family saga right now. He can't even tell us if there is indeed a Will or not. Cannot confirm anything.</p>
              <p>And yah.. we understand the "assertiveness" coming from a confused 16 year old. Right. Hail mother Mary !</p>
              <p>And there's so many pieces that doesn;t gel.. first his Step brother is older than him.. and he donno the difference between a step brother and a half brother.</p>
              <p>Now if the step brother is his father's biological child.. then that means TS mother is not his first wife.</p>
              <p>Then ofcors.. we wonder why would his father give away his assets to his first child that he abandoned ???</p>
              <p>You ever consider these missing possibilities ???</p>

              <p>You still haven't answered me regarding you going to a lawyer exerting property rights on a real estate when no such rights exist. Seriously, if you own a property, you lease it out to a tenant, the tenant owes you rent and refuses to move. When you go to a lawyer to get your tenant evicted. Isn't the lawyer going to ask you for documentation regarding the ownership of that property? Maybe the law in US is different, you can just walk into any attorney's office and get a lawyer to write an eviction letter without showing any ownership. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Witnessing how men can be such irresponsible bastards.</p>
              <p>If a woman gets a lawyer letter from her spouse to evict the family from their home.. the first thing I would do is divorce the asshole.. and seek protection from Women's charter.</p>
              <p>But since TS's father is already dead.. they can seek protection from the intestate succession lah..</p>
              <p>Do you treat your spouse as a tenant ? Dude.. are you ok ? LOL...</p>
              <p>Sure the landlord tenant act serves well to distinguish the rights of landlords vs tenants.</p>
              <p>But in TS case.. is TS's mom and his father a Tenant/landlord relationship ? You crazy or what.</p>

              <p><br>So your Women's Charter has more to do with your case, with your would be unfaithful spouse rather than the issue at hand? I do wish you be more focused and be less of a scatter brain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In case you don't have the intelligence to comprehend, the issue of tenant and landlord was to explain the concept of "property rights", as with what the step brother is doing to them now. I hope this is simple enough for you to understand. This is about property rights and not familial relationships! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Not my fault that ya have a one track mind. But it's ok.. I forgive you.</p>
              <p>Before TS finds out who actually do get what.. what property rights are you talking about ?</p>
              <p>So if your father go marry another wife.. then that family comes and claim your home after your father died.. that one is property rights har ? No hor.</p>
              <p>I tell you lah...that's how men mess up their family. Because everyone will want to stake a claim on whatever they want.. UNTIL TS has verified that the step brother does indeed has the property rights.. TS really shouldn't have moved out.</p>
              <p>Got document to prove ? If don't have , if I am TS.. I'd tell the step brother to fark off. Gettit ?</p>
