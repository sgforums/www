              <p>Dude.. ok.. you are my morning muse.</p>
              <p>First.. if the dad is married to that step mother.. upon death.. everyone will assume that the decease's estate pass on to the surviving spouse.</p>
              <p>In the event of death.. the step brother thinks that everything his step father owns belongs to HIS family now. ESpecially if there is NO WILL.</p>
              <p>That is a very common mistake many made.</p>
              <p>So I ask TS to find out if indeed there is or isn't a Will.</p>
              <p>If there be no Will.. then the intestate succession comes into play.</p>
              <p>And if there be a Will.. TS and his sister can contest to be included. (not too familiar how).</p>
              <p>And 00King00 also mentioned there's the Family Provision act to prevent unfair distribution to protect families from being abandoned like TS's. ( not sure if it can apply to TS case given the lack of legal marriage issue of his mother).</p>
              <p>NOW you gettit ????</p>

              <p><strong>The one who said in another thread that higher expenses is good for Singaporeans, because it puts more money in their pocket. But when probe further she is dumbfounded.</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Seriously, one should not let emotions get in the way of analysing facts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was explaining things in context, if you really can't accept the cold facts, not much I can do. You can think maybe it's this, maybe it's that, building your case on air is not solid foundation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I asked TS how long he has stayed in the house, but apparently he is no longer interested in other recourse.</p>

              <p>To detract from the topic, let's recall what L.Lawliet79 said:</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">My reply:</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What logic is that?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your salary being driven down by competing foreign talents from PRC, India and Philippines and your cost of living is going up.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Less salary and higher expenses, you sure you will have more money to visit other countries? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you are a common worker, you might not even have sufficient money for retirement, you will need to work till you kick the bucket. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>

              <p>Advice to TS, don't think you can do much on the grounds of intestate succession, but if you have lived in the house for more than 12 years rent free, perhaps there is a case for you. Suggest you get legal counsel and not get half-assed replies (me included) here.</p>

              <p>I suggest you act on this fast , before your relatives squandered all the assets away.</p>
              <p>Family inheritance battles are never pretty, but your case is not unique, there's actually many out there with the same problem. Men who has children from different mothers.</p>

              <p>You were young at 13 , so don't be too hard on yourself. And obviously your stepbrother took advantage of your ignorance to use it against you.</p>
              <p>But it is not too late to start learning how to protect yourself and your love ones. We all learn and that's how we grow stronger.</p>

              <p>Sia suay ? Sorry hor.. it is his step brother then sia suay ok ?</p>
              <p>Step brother not even the man's biological son.. got the cheek to kick the real son out, all because his own mother go sleep with a man who is not even his own father.</p>
              <p>Next time your mother go sleep with another man ... then when he die hor.. you can makan all his assets lor. Then go tell that man's own children they very siah suay to claim what rightfully is theirs lah !</p>
              <p>Obviously you don't even understand what I am saying lah.. why don't you go talk to your parents and learn instead of coming here with your diarrhea mouth ?</p>
              <p>You cannot differentiate black and white .. all you know is say mean things. Very shiok hor ? You seriously need some loving.. come I gib you.</p>
              <p>Fortunately , karma don't affect people as brainless as you lah. But it's ok. We forgive you.. because you are Hello Kitty. OK ? Good,</p>
