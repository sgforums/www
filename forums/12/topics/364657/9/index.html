              <p>Based on moral grounds, I don't think TS should fight for the
              inheritance of his dad, since his dad already disown the mom and
              him. Like HK put it, it's very thick skin to fight for something
              that doesn't belong to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But based on monetary grounds like how jojobeach thinks, then go
              sue your parents for every dime and penny, even if they disown
              you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>For me, it's not about the insults, people can say all they want, but it's more about what is morally right and wrong. If say the dad really did leave TS the house, but the step brother cheated him out of the house, then I say by all means take him to court, but it's not the same here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have seen too many families disintegrate because of inheritance issues, but this is not related to TS because he is not on close terms with his father and step brother.</p>
