              <p>I even Kana sued by my elder brother " step brother" cause i sprayed his eye with a oil spray to stop him from entering my house to cut the water supply when i was still 13.</p>
              <p>The judge force me to apolgise to him.i apolgised to him because i cant afford to go court again due to money</p>
              <p>Now he dead and he didnt left anything for my mum that she deserve .</p>

              <p>Tat's y sometimes its unfair if ur rich u can hire all e lawyers in the world and bend it to their will. As for e less richer/poor sit there wipe up all e mess. </p>
              <p>Have backbone and stand up straight find a good job work get $$ get a sm 2-3 rm or rent a flat for you n ur ma. Go to HDB or something.</p>
              <p>As for ur case i'm nt sure if u can get bak ur hse unless u can proved that your ma is e one or only her has been paying all e bills and loans if there is for _____ yrs. And only you both been living there. Then if that's the case you can go knock on the lawyer firms see which kind soul would like to take up your case for free. If all e loans is nt paid by your ma then theres nuttin you can do.</p>
              <p>Like wat u said e hse is nt under your ma name so its very hard.</p>
              <p>Good Luck</p>

              <p>Haizzz, what come around goes around. Those evils will get what they deserve.</p>
              <p>Actually, although the will is made and currently if you think that your mom is badly abused and deserve something nice, I think you can get a lawyer, there might be chances that you can get the house.</p>
              <p>Your mom had a certificate of marriage and thus automatically inhertate the bank account money if they had a joint account, that something you got as bonus right?</p>
              <p>Show the lawyer or judge that your mom if treated very unfairly when your dad is alive and give CONCRETE evidence on how your mom is being abused by ur dad and prove to the judge why ur stepbrother should not have any chances of getting what your dad left and ur mom deserve sth for example when ur dad is alive, she pays all the loans, bills for ur dad etc.</p>
              <p>Judges look at things from all different angles so dun worry even if there is a will made. Cause ur mom can file for a divorce when ur dad is alive. If she had a divorce, she will get some $ from ur dad, <em>there are laws protecting women</em>.</p>
              <p>Lastly and most importantly u NEED to prove that at the time your dad made the will, his emotion is UNSTABLE. Meaning he is angry with you or ur mom. Cause i assume u are 13 and your dad and mom had a 13 years or more relationship surely there is something precious between them.</p>
              <p>If you had the above evidence, your chances of winning against or step brother is extremely high but bear in mind, only proceed with the case if you had concrete evidence and confident cause if you lose, u might even have to forked out some $.</p>
              <p>I hope this help</p>

              <p>I am sorry to say, but there is nothing that you can do to get back the house, since your step-brother has obtained the house legally in terms of the law.</p>
              <p>Honestly speaking, even if your stepbrother were to die, the house still would not be inherited by your family. It would go to his wife instead.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you will want to ask your sister to apply for uni trust fund aid, as your family is truly in a dilemma now.</p>
              <p>Another important factor now is how old are you? If you are already out of army, then perhaps it is time for you to get a job to support the family. If you are still studying, the best thing you could do is to work harder and earn the scholarship award.</p>
