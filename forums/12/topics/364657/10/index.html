              <p>But of course if TS wants to try, he is welcome to. But it won't
              be as easy as he thinks...like what I said, old wounds would be
              opened and some not very nice things will be said and insults would
              be galore...</p>
              <p>Money is always the root of all evil...I hate all this kinda
              inheritance quarrel. I rather wash my hands off it and lead a
              simple but peaceful life. The other side, if they want to laugh at
              me, they can do as much as they want as long as I am contented with
              what I have.</p>

              <p>Your parents case is different from TS's case, like I mentioned.. your parents are no longer a DEPENDENT of your grandparents..but TS and family IS.</p>
              <p>You cannot swipe your fear in a broad stroke onto TS's case.</p>
              <p>The time lapse between the execution and claim.. priority of beneficiaries/dependents....rights under the intestacy act..financial needs of the contestant... and if there is a no-contest clause... . etc etc.. all these plays very important roles in the success rates of your parent's claim.</p>
              <p>So, every case is unique and has it own merits and demerits. That is why a trial judge needs to hear each and every case during court time.</p>
              <p>IF every asset distribution case is the same.. then no need go lawyer liao.. just file paper application with multiple choice questions.</p>
              <p>Like I said.. the legal counsel will inform TS what are his chances. So let's just hope he gets good news OK ? Good.</p>
