              <p>i would suggest that you go to a more intelligent forum where the readers are adults or serious users hang around.. Just read the comments here and you'll understand what i mean.</p>
              <p>Here is for light topics, not so serious ones..since here, there's no rule implemented to stop clones or spamming..so nobody really cares..all here is only gossips, complaints and the list goes on etc..</p>
              <p>This forums is popular for the complaints etc..just look at the frequency of reporters highlighting the threads of sgforums..</p>

              <p>Ok so all these happens when you were 13. How old are you now ?</p>
              <p>regarding your "step brother" suing you.. how long ago was that ? And did you go to court for the battery charge ?</p>
              <p>Your step brother is ...not biologicaly linked to you correct ? Because a half brother is . So I'm a little confused.</p>
              <p>And your father.. is legally married to the other woman (mother of your "step/half" brother) ?</p>
              <p>Is there any proof that your step family has inherited the home ? Is there a transfer of deed/title ? Or was it a hostile takeover that has no legal basis ( sole purpose is to establish residency )</p>
              <p>If your father's name is in your birth cert. You can contest the will ( assuming there is one). If there is no will and the court had to Distribute the estate via Intestacy.. you do stand a chance.</p>

              <p>According to TS.. the step brother came to TS house and try to cut off the water supply.</p>
              <p>So in actual fact.. TS could have sued the Step brother instead, and TS act of spraying the oil coulda be argued as self defence.</p>
              <p>I suppose TS was taken advantage of due to his lack of legal knowlege and got intimidated to leave the house.</p>
              <p>If everything happend too long ago.. he loses his chances of winning the case.</p>
              <p>So it is best he try to bring the inheritance case to court as soon as possible.. the longer he drag.. the worst his chances.</p>
              <p>I would recommend he go get some legal aid and talk to a qualified family lawyer.</p>
              <p>But VK you are correct.</p>
              <p>The Step brother suing is irrelevant to the inheritance of his father's asset. It is a different case altogether.</p>

              <p>Umm.. VK.. i think you are forgetting one most important thing here.</p>
              <p>TS is the father's biological son and his father's name is on his birthcert. Even if the name is not on the birthcert.. he can still establish paternity links by doing a paternity test.</p>
              <p>And the eviction occurs AFTER his father died. If he is still alive TS would still be living in the same house.</p>
              <p>In other words.. his father has allowed his son(TS) to stay on his property irregardless TS mother is not the legal owner of the house.</p>
              <p>Even if the mother has not been paying for the house.. his father has allowed them to establish residency there.. SINCE the birth of his SON (TS).</p>
              <p>The fact that TS step family did not inform TS of his father's death is obvious they do not want TS the son to try to claim inheritance by keeping them in the dark. However, that does not negate the rights of TS to his father's inheritance.</p>
              <p>I do not remember inheritance claim comes with a statute of limitation. So it is best TS seek a professional lawyer to square this away.</p>
              <p>But as a LEGAL son of his father.. he does have a right to his inheritance. But I doubt that TS even saw his father's documented will as he is intimidated by his stepbrother.</p>
              <p>If TS is forcefully evicted by his step brother.. TS's lawyer can file and injunction on to stop his stepbrother from taking over the house. That is why it is important to know when the eviction happen and if the Step brother actually has legal rights to occupy the house.</p>
              <p>The will can be contested as long as TS is the legal son.</p>

              <p>Singaporean lawyers also one kind lah.. like to send lawyer letters to intimidate innocents to get their way... no sense of ethics one.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">I think a lot of people here are confused, because legal title doesn't always mean a whole lot. If you can establish that either your mother contributed to the purchase price of the house or any subsequent mortgage payments then a resulting trust arises in her favor, likewise if u could establish a contribution plus an intention to share the property then a constructive trust arises in her favor. Either way she obtains a beneficial interest in the property that exists regardless of the legal title. However only those payments that directly relate to the purchase price will suffice and normal cooking and cleaning will not.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">A will merely transfers your share in the property to someone else, but u cannot transfer what you do not have. This is probably a primary thing, though I'm sure if there was a divorce or so on there must be something relating to the matrimonial home, though I am not sure as to the laws of singapore. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Lastly even to evict squatters you cannot do it by force, generally u would need a court order and then accompanied by police or a court official.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">All in all, I am not familiar with the laws of singapore but these are general common law principles and so it is best to consult a lawyer.</p>

              <p>If his sister knows they gave up the fight for the sake of her uni tuition when they actually do stand a chance. Do you think she can sleep at night and go to uni happily ?</p>
