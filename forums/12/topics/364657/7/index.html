              <p>Pride in your case is merely a self-consolation.</p>
              <p>Indeed I have seen one of my old classmate's family go through
              inheritance battle. But he wasn't the victim.. he was the bullying
              rich family. I've seen how he ridicules the "other" family and
              calls them grotto dwellers or mobile trash. So yes.. they take
              <strong>pride</strong> bringing the poor family down.</p>
              <p>Fortunately.. US laws provides that the Will estates/assets can
              only be distributed AFTER paying off child support and alimony
              payments and other debts. So it wasn't like the poor family was
              forced into destitution.</p>
              <p>With the portion of inheritance alloted to the poor half
              brother.. that kid puts himself through top Uni and now a high
              flyer. THAT is deserving of pride.</p>
              <p>You want TS to meekly turn around like a mouse.. and suffer in
              silence...like that is..your version of pride ah ?</p>
              <p>Because possibilites only happens after trying.</p>
              <p>After the storm there will be peace. But it seems .. many are
              afraid of a storm.</p>
              <p>Anyway.. TS's case is hardly a storm lah.</p>
              <p>Just that I am very surprised how many forumers are discouraging
              TS from seeking redress. It is very appalling to me.</p>

              <p>Unless you can provide a route for them to seek redress which will incur no cost at all, then you can list out your advice here. Otherwise I see no point in keep urging him to seek redress when there is no practical solution given on how he can do that.</p>

              <p>Child support usually is a no brainer case.</p>
              <p>If TS drags and try again by the time he is of legal age..his chance will probably be next to nothing.</p>

So in the eyes of law it might be hard to fight for something that doesn't legally belong to you. Of course TS can try but he has to be prepared for the legal suit to fail and has some more concrete plans for the future instead.</p>

              <p>Because if i am not mistaken, no will, inheritence goes to next of kin.</p>
              <p>Just
              get some proof of your claims dude. Get some free legal aid man. They
              can direct u to where u need to go and what u need to do. If there is such a thing in Singapore. lol</p>
              <p>Thats
              one of the problems with extra maritial affairs or split family with
              own ther children.. damn! Thats why everything must be black and white.
              So when suddenly KO , people wont be fighting over your treasures.
              çˆ¸çˆ¸è¯´çš„å¯¹ã€‚Haiz.. lock me out .. only if i marry. Diu ma hai ah!</p>
              <p>But anyways la, there are plenty of cases with similiar circumstances and from there u can roughly know how your case is going to go from there. Confirm got some principles that is similiar, unless TS case on some particular point of law needs to be looked at in more detail.</p>
              <p>But the law of inheritance can be pretty brutal. So good luck dude.</p>

              <p>Umm.. you know ah.. I wish you would go read from the beginning, so you get an accurate picture hor... sibeh tiring repeating leh.</p>
              <p>His mother is a second spouse if recognised under common law marriage. Lived together for more than 13 years.</p>
              <p>His father's first wife .. died before he met TS's mother. So TS mother is not a mistress .. perhaps a woman his father co-habited with and have 2 children.</p>
              <p>TS has his father's name on his birthcert.. so he is a LEGAL son. TS is NOT a illegitimate son lah !! Wah lau eh.....</p>
              <p>Under US laws.. common law marriage applies to a couple who cohabs for more than 7 years... but I not sure if this is recognise in Singapore or not.</p>
              <p>It is NOT about who deserves the house.. TS don't have to fight solely for the house. (Goodnesss)......it is about ensuring children and spouse of the deceased are provided for lah !!!</p>

              <p>His mother is a second spouse if recognised under common law
              marriage. Lived together for more than 13 years.</p>
              <p>His father's first wife .. died before he met TS's mother. So TS
              mother is not a mistress .. perhaps a woman his father co-habited
              with and have 2 children.</p>
              <p>TS has his father's name on his birthcert.. so he is a LEGAL
              son. TS is NOT a illegitimate son lah !! Wah lau eh.....</p>
              <p>Under US laws.. common law marriage applies to a couple who
              cohabs for more than 7 years... but I not sure if this is recognise
              in Singapore or not.</p>

              <p>I am not saying that what your father has done is right, and I agree that yes, he should rot in hell.</p>
              <p>There are too many loopholes in your story and these might be what has caused the misunderstanding among so many forumites here. If you can just state it clearly, I think you will have less assumptions and the people here will be able to help you better.</p>
              <p>Is your mother ever married to your father? By married, I mean, do they even have a marriage cert with both their names on it? If according to what you have said here, your mother is your father's first wife, and after that your father went on to have an affair with another woman...is that correct? But from what jojobeach has said earlier to me, it seems that your mother is the second "spouse" who is not legally married to your father, but just cohabited with him for a long period of time. So what is the true story here?</p>
              <p>If you can't even take what I have said above, I would suggest you don't fight for the inheritance. Truth is, you and your mother (provided she is not legally married to your father) will be called names I have mentioned above, and may be called worse, if you want to bring this matter to court and fight for what has been given to others. You can't shield your mother from this; she is at the heart of everything. So if you all decide to go ahead and fight for it, all I can say is to stay strong.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If you hate his guts and want him dead, what gives him the right to take his father's money? This is atypical to a US marriage, where the wife in a divorce proceedings sues the ex-husband for half his wealth, it's like the wife marries the husband for money, just like our parn (the $30k wife).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go read my post again and try you best to understand. <strong>I said maintenance order also difficult because the assets has been distributed already.</strong> (If TS has just cause, then he could have filed an application for maintenance order during probate and admin, if it's been distributed already to say 5 different folks, who should TS take action against.) Maybe he should sue the step brother for maintenance order. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Apparently you have comprehension and hate management issues. Seems like everybody who disagrees with you will be cursed and insulted. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>You take a $20k loan from the bank, renege on the payments, the bank gets their lawyers to write you a letter of demand and you call their bluff. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Letter of demands are the first step in the legal process before the plaintiff can submit a writ of summons. The reason why some folks choose to leave the claim at the letter of demand is because the cost of going to courts is too prohibitive and the chance of recovering the damages is low.</p>

              admin, if it's been distributed already to say 5 different folks,
