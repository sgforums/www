              <p>Are you the family judge who decide what is his or not his ? Mai geh kiang lah.</p>
              <p>Humans got sense of shame correct lor.. but you so shameless .. who are you to teach other people about shame ?</p>
              <p>You jealous TS will get inheritance but you don't issit ?</p>
              <p>I tell u lah..no point you being such a mean spirit. If u need to be mean to a person seeking help just to feel good about yourself.. u are obviously the one needing some psychological help.</p>
              <p> The father already dead liao.. who has his money .. is meaningless to a deadn man alredy.</p>
              <p>I leally donno why you keep insisting TS should be the idiot and not take action.</p>
              <p>If TS don't do anything.. the only person that's gonna be laughing all the way to the bank are the step family.</p>
              <p>Instead of encouraging TS to fight for his family. You are telling TS to be "kam gong kia" , sit there and suck thumb.</p>
              <p>You want to be stupid and let people walk all over you because of your so called " Pride". Well .. good for you.. now not everyone needs to follow in your footstep.</p>

              <p>i ish also dont support TS go fight the legal suit given the money and the resources  TS and mother are having now unless they are able to get legal aid for free  but do u think there are totally free one? more over they are currently at the disadventage end.</p>
              <p>in peace u are able to channel your money and resources into building and saving whereas after a few years down the road u are able to enjoy the fruits that u plant.</p>
              <p>channeling all your resources into a legal fight and your chances of winning  is not that high might be a wastage because u are fighting with someone that are on the more adventages side and more resources then u.</p>
              <p>i think let TS mother have some peace so that she is able to bring the 2 children finish thier education and enjoy a retirement life will be better.</p>
              <p>maybe TS can stop schooling to  help up the mother to bring the sister through university 1st then sister will support TS back to finish his cooking study is another way out.</p>

              <p>TS, don't let these nay sayers discourage you.</p>
              <p>They are not the one living your life.</p>

              <p>End of day.. its your mother paying the bills.. these forumers will not offer you a dime to help your family's expenses. Nor will they be the one to offer a job for your sister and you in your career or opportunities.</p>
              <p>If you suffer because of your inaction.. they will ask you to suck thumb.</p>

              <p>In my own views,</p>
              <p>I wonder why ppl like to post family related</p>
              <p>problems here?</p>
              <p>Family issues are best to settle among ownselves</p>
              <p>I suggest TS to call up local  family hotlines and speak</p>
              <p>to those who are well trained to give u better advice .</p>
              <p>It is rather funny when those who have not went throught</p>
              <p>what you are going now and giving u advises</p>
              <p>It might be wrong or right.</p>

              <p>Yea but the father has already passed away...very little can be done now unless the father has made provision for the mother and the son while he was still alive. But I doubt so.</p>
              <p>And as you said, inheritance battle can turn really ugly indeed. Why not just let go of this matter and threadstarter should think about how to earn enough to support both himself and his mother then? I rather take steps back and not fight for some money and end up with sleepless nights and causing more grief for my mother, if I were threadstarter. Because it is inevitable that once the inheritance battle ensues, old woulds would be opened and would never be able to heal properly...</p>

              <p>Pride in your case is merely a self-consolation.</p>
              <p>Indeed I have seen one of my old classmate's family go through inheritance battle. But he wasn't the victim.. he was the bullying rich family. I've seen how he ridicules the "other" family and calls them grotto dwellers or mobile trash. So yes.. they take <strong>pride </strong>bringing the poor family down.</p>
              <p>Fortunately.. US laws provides that the Will estates/assets can only be distributed AFTER paying off child support and alimony payments and other debts. So it wasn't like the poor family was forced into destitution.</p>
              <p>With the portion of inheritance alloted to the poor half brother.. that kid puts himself through top Uni and now a high flyer. THAT is deserving of pride.</p>
              <p>You want TS to meekly turn around like a mouse.. and suffer in silence...like that is..your version of pride ah ?</p>
              <p>Because possibilites only happens after trying.</p>
              <p>After the storm there will be peace. But it seems .. many are afraid of a storm.</p>
              <p>Anyway.. TS's case is hardly a storm lah.</p>
              <p>Just that I am very surprised how many forumers are discouraging TS from seeking redress. It is very appalling to me.</p>
