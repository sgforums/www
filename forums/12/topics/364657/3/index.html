              <p>I don't know how effective it is but.. it's a place to start.</p>
              <p>Click on this ...<a href="http://app.minlaw.gov.sg/lab/default.asp?r=2.">Singapore Legal Aid Bureau</a></p>
              <p>Please read through the eligibility part.</p>
              <p>I have a suspicion your father died without a will.. that is why your step brother had to forcibly remove you and your family from the house.</p>
              <p>If your step brother is not the biological son and the woman is not legally married to your father.. he has absolutely NO rights to the house you lived in for 13 years.</p>
              <p>If I remember correctly.. you are only 16. So your father only left you 3 years ago.</p>
              <p>I think your step brother is bullying you and your family.</p>
              <p>If your father died without a will , then you have to read the <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=1967-REVED-146&amp;doctitle=INTESTATE+SUCCESSION+ACT&amp;date=latest&amp;method=whole">Intestate Succession Act</a>. Which you and your sister the childrens have valid claims on his assets and possibly your mother too.</p>
              <p>So you really need to find out if your father does leave a Will. There should be a Grant of Probate and the Orginal Will filed with the court  (as the documents becomes public once the Grant of Probate (executing rights) is issued) so you or your lawyer should have access to it for verification.</p>
              <p>If he does have a Will and you and your family are not listed as beneficiaries.. look out for a no-contest clause.. and ask your lawyer if that is enforceable in your case.</p>
              <p>Educate yourself so you don't get trampled on any longer.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Times;">I think a
              lot of people here are confused, because legal title doesn't always
              mean a whole lot. If you can establish that either your mother
              contributed to the purchase price of the house or any subsequent
              mortgage payments then a resulting trust arises in her favor,
              likewise if u could establish a contribution plus an intention to
              share the property then a constructive trust arises in her favor.
              Either way she obtains a beneficial interest in the property that
              exists regardless of the legal title. However only those payments
              that directly relate to the purchase price will suffice and normal
              cooking and cleaning will not.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">A will merely transfers your share in the property to someone else,
              but u cannot transfer what you do not have. This is probably a
              primary thing, though I'm sure if there was a divorce or so on
              there must be something relating to the matrimonial home, though I
              am not sure as to the laws of singapore. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Lastly even to evict squatters you cannot do it by force, generally
              u would need a court order and then accompanied by police or a
              court official.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">All in all, I am not familiar with the laws of singapore but these
              are general common law principles and so it is best to consult a
              lawyer.</p>

              <p>TS, having legal title doesn't necessarily mean that the house belongs to your deceased father totally.

              <p>I don't know how effective it is but.. it's a place to start.</p>
              <p>Click on this ...<a rel="nofollow" href="http://app.minlaw.gov.sg/lab/default.asp?r=2.">Singapore Legal Aid Bureau</a></p>
              <p>Please read through the eligibility part.</p>
              <p>I have a suspicion your father died without a will.. that is why your step brother had to forcibly remove you and your family from the house.</p>
              <p>If your step brother is not the biological son and the woman is not legally married to your father.. he has absolutely NO rights to the house you lived in for 13 years.</p>
              <p>If I remember correctly.. you are only 16. So your father only left you 3 years ago.</p>
              <p>I think your step brother is bullying you and your family.</p>
              <p>If your father died without a will , then you have to read the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=1967-REVED-146&amp;amp;doctitle=INTESTATE+SUCCESSION+ACT&amp;amp;date=latest&amp;amp;method=whole">Intestate Succession Act</a>. Which you and your sister the childrens have valid claims on his assets and possibly your mother too.</p>
              <p>So you really need to find out if your father does leave a Will. There should be a Grant of Probate and the Orginal Will filed with the court  (as the documents becomes public once the Grant of Probate (executing rights) is issued) so you or your lawyer should have access to it for verification.</p>
              <p>If he does have a Will and you and your family are not listed as beneficiaries.. look out for a no-contest clause.. and ask your lawyer if that is enforceable in your case.</p>
              <p>Educate yourself so you don't get trampled on any longer.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>Do you understand the meaning of intestate?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do, go read the first post by TS again. I attached below for your benefit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Even the house that i stayed from the time i was born he didnt even put our name. My mum didnt have much education and work so much in her life when with him And <strong>NOW he GAVE THE HOUSE TO MY "STEP BROTHER"</strong> . He have his own house own family and he earns quite a lot."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your understanding of TS situation is ramshackled, TS already said that the house was given to his step-brother, either before his death or in his will.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the house was given to his step brother before his death. How the hell are you going to contest it? The house no longer belongs to his father's estate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the house was allocated in his will. How will Intestate Succession Act come into play? He died with a will.</p>

              <p>Also extremely clear from TS first post. I quote.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Now he dead and <strong>he didnt left anything for my mum that she deserve</strong> .</p>
              <p>Even the house that i stayed from the time i was born he didnt even put our name. My mum didnt have much education and work so much in her life when with him <strong>And NOW he GAVE THE HOUSE TO MY "STEP BROTHER"</strong> . He have his own house own family and he earns quite a lot. "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's extremely clearcut that he didn't leave anything for them in his will, either that or, he transferred the assets to his other step son before his death.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How hard is it for you to comprehend the above statement?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe this maybe that.........there is no maybe here, he stated clearly in his first post.</p>

              <p>Dude.. ok.. you are my morning muse.</p>
              <p>First.. if the dad is married to that step mother.. upon death.. everyone will assume that the decease's estate pass on to the surviving spouse.</p>
              <p>In the event of death.. the step brother thinks that everything his step father owns belongs to HIS family now. ESpecially if there is NO WILL.</p>
              <p>That is a very common mistake many made.</p>
              <p>So I ask TS to find out if indeed there is or isn't a Will.</p>
              <p>If there be no Will.. then the intestate succession comes into play.</p>
              <p>And if there be a Will.. TS and his sister can contest to be included. (not too familiar how).</p>
              <p>And 00King00 also mentioned there's the Family Provision act to prevent unfair distribution to protect families from being abandoned like TS's. ( not sure if it can apply to TS case given the lack of legal marriage issue of his mother).</p>
              <p>NOW you gettit ????</p>
