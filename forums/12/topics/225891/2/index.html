            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I don't see how life's meaningless just because you're discouraged from working.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>No disrespect, but there were two things I was certainly in no hurry to pursue when I was your age - jobs and relationships - as I felt these are things I've got the rest of my life for. Looking back almost 10 years on and I still wouldn't think I'd have done anything differently if I were given the chance to do it all over again.<br><br>In a way, finding a job just to earn that extra bob might not be too productive as well(I mean given your background, it's not like you need the money desperately anyway). Like what some have suggested, you should really make the most of the holidays by finding something meaningful to do(even if it's just to chill out, it's perfectly fine - you wouldn't know what school holidays actually feel like once you start working!) - be it volunteering, picking up a new course or just playing. (I miss my teenage years!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ) Moreover, if you think the current hols is long, wait till you're done with your A levels...<br><br>That said, if you're really keen on a job, it might be worthwhile to try and get some internship in a field where you might want to pursue a career in the future(ie.maybe you could try interning with a dental clinic/law firm if you plan to be a dentist/lawyer to get a first hand look of what they do). I'm sure this will be more productive than just finding any random job to kill time which you do not really enjoy .</div>

As China Students in NTU, NUS all are scoring Aces in both English and Chinese Languages winning over Singaporeans. So we have to buck up.<br><br>The language that i see a future in is either Japanese/Korean language. Coz if they are the developed countries, they are facing problems which Singapore are facing years ahead of us, so if we can learn from them, than we will be pathing our way to prepare for the harsh society ahead of us.<br><br>If you are considering French, think again. Coz in Swiss, the country is divided into 4 different languages- French, German, Italian, 1 other language which I've forgotten. The people in Swiss knows english, so we have no problems communicating with them. But for Japanese and Korean, we can't communicate so have to learn.<br><br>This is my own perspective.<br><br>Think and decide for yourself which language you want to learn.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
