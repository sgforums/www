            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Adele (i'm assuming thats your name).<br>Dont worry, i guess we've all gone through the "what's the meaning of life" cum "i wish i knew what i'm here for" phase, but everyone gets through it.<br><br>"working" doesnt help you find peace of mind. It just distracts you from thinking about the more important things (like what you REALLY want to do when you're done with school/uni, what your life plans will be). I'm not saying its time for you to think about it, i'm just saying it's normal to be unsure.<br><br>All this time on your hands is a great opportunity to go explore what your strengths are. I think i was in a much worst position than you were when i was your age. I got kicked out of Cat.High then ACS(Br) and was basically not doing a thing until i found photography. It took me a long while to find it - 4 years in fact , but i love what i do now.<br><br>Well hope i was a little bit of help. Cheer up, we all go through it so you're not alone. =)<br><br>*Edit*<br><br>Whoops just read a post about you wanting to do Fashion Design. I've got a couple of friends who are really interested in that. I've gotten my friend a job (low paying though) with my Aunt Tina Tan Leo (You'd know her if you were in the singapore fashion scene).  She's been telling him to keep sketching ideas that come to his head whenever possible. Just an idea though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got an idea . Why not save the money your dad gives you and do abit of trading/investment/term deposit stuff with your savings? Learn how the stock market goes and the banks etc. Make more money for a rainy day/when you want to open your own shop etc - you can use that money you made instead of asking daddy dearest.<br><br>If I were at your age and was as lucky as you are , I might have tried that.</div>
