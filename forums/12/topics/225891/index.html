            <div class='col-md body'>I'm 16.<br><br>Having my post-O'level holidays now; not working.<br><br>I come from a family of 5- 2 older bros and I'm the youngest girl. Sometimes I think things come too easily for me. It's like, I want what, I get what.<br><br>I don't need a job 'cos my Dad isn't keen on the idea. Last year I tried to get a job but he said "I'll pay you double of what you'll be getting there".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>The thing is... Whenever I see my friends working (most of them are), I feel quite useless. I mean, they have that ability to earn their own $ and don't have to depend on parents, and most of them come from families that aren't as blessed, and maybe facing financial difficulties, but they are still able to overcome all this, including the stress etc! And me? I'm their age, good family/environment/no problems but I feel like I'm not as capable as them.<br><br>Sometimes I wonder what's the meaning of life. It's like so pointless. I feel like the people around me have something to live for. They wake up in the morning and have to work/go for a meeting/plan a presentation etc. But me? I wake up in the morning, sit up on my bed and think, "What should I do today?" Shopping? Did that yesterday. Go for some fine dining? Did that yesterday too (you get what I mean).<br><br>All these was fun at first but as the days pass the novelty of it all wears off. I feel like a sloth, I lack the drive.<br><br>What are my goals...<br><br>My ambitions...<br><br>I feel rather useless...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
