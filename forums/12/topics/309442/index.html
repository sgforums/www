              <p>I'm currently in a relationship and lately, i've been feeling emotionally drained inside. I see my girlfriend everyday but i don't really get sick of her, i actually enjoy seeing her daily as i miss her alot when she isn't with me.</p>
              <p>Due to her school work, recently she has become very irate. She would blow up at me for nothing and sometimes, i feel like i'm her punching bag. I admit, i'm not a boyfriend who gives her alot of freedom, but i'm very sure that i try to meet her every demand. I fetch her from school everyday so that she has someone to share her day's events with...</p>
              <p>We're arguing almost everyday, and 80% of the time, i'm the one giving in and apologising to her, trying to make things right. Whenever she stomps away from me in the heat of an argument, i feel really hurt as she doesn't even turn her head to see if i'm behind.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, i try to do what she does, not looking back and walking away. But i found myself unable to do it. No matter if it was her fault or mine, i would always want her to be on good terms with me and therefore, would always make it a point to make things better.</p>
              <p>If i were to judge myself, in my own opinion, i would think that i'm the softer party in this relationship. I can't bear to see us arguing but sadly, i feel that she can be very hard-hearted at times.</p>
              <p>It's confusing to me, as i feel that she really loves me. When we are on good terms and she is happy, she would make me promise her that we'll never argue again. But in the end, another argument would sprout out.</p>
              <p>We've had countless arguments on the phone, when we're outside. The thing i disliked the most, is that sometimes she'll say "whatever...".</p>
              <p>I still love my girlfriend, and i'm emotionally drained. The thought of breaking up is unthinkable as i can't imagine myself to be without her. She has told me before that she can't live without me too. I've been together with her for almost 8 months already.</p>
              <p>To whoever is reading this, if you had been in my situation in your life, would you care to share your opinion and resolve? Much thanks to anyone who helps.</p>

              <p>I see the problem.</p>
              <p>Your girlfriend has already requested something from you, but you still fail to deliver.</p>
              <p>No wonder she is frustrated.</p>
              <p>80% argument is very high. That means you disagreed with her 80% of the time. It shows how INCOMPATIBLE both of you think. 80% !!!!!</p>
              <p>You claim that you try to meet her demands. But are you REALLY meeting HER demand ? Or do you believe/think yourself that you are meeting her demand ? Two very different thing altogether. OK ?</p>
              <p>Pretty soon, either of you will run out of steam and want to bail.</p>
              <p>First you need to figure out , WHY an argument start.</p>
              <p>Second you need to figure out , HOW to AVOID an argument.</p>
              <p>Third, you need to understand PREVENTIVE is better than DAMAGE CONTROL.</p>
              <p>Fourth.. you need to LEARN how to VALIDATE your woman. Especially when you think she's not being rational.</p>
              <p>Fifth ....When a woman is IRATE, she's NOT interested in YOUR reasoning. Get this very very clear. Too many men make this common mistake, and they scratch their head after the damage is done. TIMING IS EVERYTHING !</p>
              <p>Ask yourself this , HOW often do you actually AGREE with your girlfriend ?</p>
              <p>When a woman uses "whatever".. its's her way of INDIRECTLY DISAGREEING with you because she KNOWS you are TOO STUBBORN to listen/agree with her views/opinion anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck. And.... YOU CAN DO IT.</p>

              <p>From what you've described, it seems that you've always been compromising in the relationship, i.e. giving in to her most of the time.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/love.png" alt="love.png"> should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEVER</span> be a compromise.</p>
              <p>A <strong>high</strong> rate of argument could signal:<br>- incompatibility in character;  and/or<br>- a lack of understanding of each other;  and/or<br>- an unwillingness to work for the good of the relationship.</p>
              <p>Was it due to some innate differences (views/opinions/beliefs) that those arguments arose? Did those conflicts come about because both of you see things differently? These are some hard questions you got to ask yourself.</p>
              <p>Perhaps one good step is to be frank to her about the emotions you're feeling in the relationship. Does she know of the inner struggles that you've been having all this while? Have you asked her about her feelings whenever an argument comes about? Have you so-called 'put yourself in her shoes'? Coming clean is the shortest way of removing the barbed fences that lay in this relationship.</p>
              <p>Once you've known each other's true feelings, the next step would be to come to an agreement that both of you will work to grow the relationship stronger. However, if she's one who keeps pointing the finger outwards and saying, "It's all your fault", then perhaps it's time to re-examine the entire relationship. Are you still willing to continue the walk down the road together, knowing well that such conflicts are bound to occur again and again?</p>
              <p>When two persons get into a relationship, it doesn't mean that the world should start spinning around each other. Both partners should still maintain their independence, i.e. she should still have her own social life, while you should still have yours. It's just that both of you have undertaken a higher committment to each other.</p>
              <p>Give her some breathing space. Meeting all the time doesn't mean the relationship will be better. (I lost my 1st gf this way cos I didn't give her enough freedom.)</p>
              <p>Again I quote, <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/love.png" alt="love.png"> should never be a compromise, losing your own sanity in the process, but to grow and flourish in character, in each other's <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/love.png" alt="love.png">.</p>
              <p>My 2 cents. Hope it helps.</p>

              <p>I see the problem.</p>
              <p>Your girlfriend has already requested something from you, but you still fail to deliver.</p>
              <p>No wonder she is frustrated.</p>
              <p>80% argument is very high. That means you disagreed with her 80% of the time. It shows how UNCOMPARABLE both of you think. 80% !!!!!</p>
              <p>You claim that you try to meet her demands. But are you REALLY meeting HER demand ? Or do you believe/think yourself that you are meeting her demand ? Two very different thing altogether. OK ?</p>
              <p>Pretty soon, either of you will run out of steam and want to bail.</p>
              <p>First you need to figure out , WHY an argument start.</p>
              <p>Second you need to figure out , HOW to AVOID an argument.</p>
              <p>Third, you need to understand PREVENTIVE is better than DAMAGE CONTROL.</p>
              <p>Fourth.. you need to LEARN how to VALIDATE your woman. Especially when you think she's not being rational.</p>
              <p>Fifth ....When a woman is IRATE, she's NOT interested in YOUR reasoning. Get this very very clear. Too many men make this common mistake, and they scratch their head after the damage is done. TIMING IS EVERYTHING !</p>
              <p>Ask yourself this , HOW often do you actually AGREE with your girlfriend ?</p>
              <p>When a woman uses "whatever".. its's her way of INDIRECTLY DISAGREEING with you because she KNOWS you are TOO STUBBORN to listen/agree with her views/opinion anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck. And.... YOU CAN DO IT.</p>

              <p>I'm currently in a relationship and lately, i've been feeling
              emotionally drained inside. I see my girlfriend everyday but i
              don't really get sick of her, i actually enjoy seeing her daily as
              i miss her alot when she isn't with me.</p>
              <p>Due to her school work, recently she has become very irate. She
              would blow up at me for nothing and sometimes, i feel like i'm her
              punching bag. I admit, i'm not a boyfriend who gives her alot of
              freedom, but i'm very sure that i try to meet her every demand. I
              fetch her from school everyday so that she has someone to share her
              day's events with...</p>
              <p>We're arguing almost everyday, and 80% of the time, i'm the one
              giving in and apologising to her, trying to make things right.
              Whenever she stomps away from me in the heat of an argument, i feel
              really hurt as she doesn't even turn her head to see if i'm
              behind.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, i try to do what she does, not looking back and
              walking away. But i found myself unable to do it. No matter if it
              was her fault or mine, i would always want her to be on good terms
              with me and therefore, would always make it a point to make things
              better.</p>
              <p>If i were to judge myself, in my own opinion, i would think that
              i'm the softer party in this relationship. I can't bear to see us
              arguing but sadly, i feel that she can be very hard-hearted at
              times.</p>
              <p>It's confusing to me, as i feel that she really loves me. When
              we are on good terms and she is happy, she would make me promise
              her that we'll never argue again. But in the end, another argument
              would sprout out.</p>
              <p>We've had countless arguments on the phone, when we're outside.
              The thing i disliked the most, is that sometimes she'll say
              "whatever...".</p>
              <p>I still love my girlfriend, and i'm emotionally drained. The
              thought of breaking up is unthinkable as i can't imagine myself to
              be without her. She has told me before that she can't live without
              me too. I've been together with her for almost 8 months
              already.</p>
              <p>To whoever is reading this, if you had been in my situation in
              your life, would you care to share your opinion and resolve? Much
              thanks to anyone who helps.</p>

              are we leading 'certain' relationship we never understand. Well, that's because
              you are trying to examine a problem within the structure of the relationship,
              when the root of it all lies with the self.</p>
              <p>You have so much insecurity in you that could probably ping flood me out;
              you admitted that you are domineering and exercise control in her daily life -
              therefore, it's not really surprising to see frequent quarrels in your
              relationship because your insecurity is gnawing the life out of your Love.</p>

              what you think is good for the relationship is merely a product of your
              unevolved perception. If your relationship suffers and not benefit from your
              definition of what Love is to you, then you might have to review the entire
              relationship from scratch again.</p>

              extend of lowering your dignity, is because you are afraid that one day she
              might just turn around and walk away forever. Your fear of leading life without
              her presence coerced you to accept any odds, regardless of how ridiculous or
              unreasonable it seemed.</p>
              <p>Your behaviors are driven by fear, much less motivated by love.</p>
              <p>The paradox in Love: the more you fear you will lose her, the more damage
              you will unconsciously deal to the relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
