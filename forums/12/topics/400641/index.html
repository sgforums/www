              <p>Why cant you think for yourself ? How did she treat you ? How are we suppose to immagine everything out by just some words. How old are your kids ? Is she the type that will abuse your kids after marriage ?</p>
              <p>If you really love her, then give her a name. Dont play with people's feelings</p>

              <p>well, my hunch is she came from a desa in Indonesia? Will there be a possibility that when she has been singaporeanised and finds that you don't have education nor money and then despise you?</p>

              <p>Does she knows you are not rich ? Are you living in a 3 bedroom HDB ?</p>
              <p>Does she knows you expects her to take care of your children ?</p>
              <p>With a  degree, will she wants to get a job in Singapore. If she does, how will she take care of your young one ?</p>
              <p>Does she has intention to have a child of her own ?</p>
              <p>Will she need to send financial support to her own family back in Indonesia ?</p>
              <p>So many questions.. I hope you already have the answers to them.</p>
              <p>Not forgetting that some women can be rather flaky. Changing our minds is not unusually usual.</p>
              <p>While you may think you are getting a free nanny. She may think otherwise. These kind of conflict is best avoided else it may turn your peaceful family upside down.</p>

              <p><br>Do you really believe it when a girl told you she loves you when she only know you for 3 months?</p>
              <p>No matter how well she treat you or your kids, bare in mind that it's only for a short duration of time (3mths++) and let me tell you, it doesnt prove anything yet.</p>

              Chances are she is after your citizenship.......
              
              So what if she's got a good education (what kind?)+ a good job if these are in Indo when there's no political stability/security. These can easily come to naught.........
              
              But after she marries you, she can get to live in SG legitimately. Tough it out a few years get PR. Then tough it out another few years, get citizenship liao...........
              
              This view is of course from a most cynical perspective as I don't know you and your "target" personally. There could be the motivation of love for all you know.......
              
              You. my friend, are still the best judge.............All da best!

              <p>Intuitively it is an uphill climb and sooner than u know it will wear her out and u too; and most of all <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">three months</span></strong> to clinch a marriage - aiyah - no-go!</p>
              <p>Love - sorry - u dont love and nor does she. Most likely it is the mutual benefit scheme type lah - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">means to an end</span></strong>. She is a means to your end and vice versa. As to what the ends are - u self-honestly can guess lah. On her part - self-honestly she would know.</p>
              <p>Good education, employment prospects are not guaranteed and never cast in stone.</p>

              <p>Give yourself some time. Loving someone should be unconditional. Despite your education or financial background, it's alright for someone to love you. </p>
              <p>How about yourself? Do you love her the same way she loves you?</p>
              <p>If you both love each other, there's no harm in waiting for a better time to marry.</p>
              <p>All the best!!</p>
