When u keep mum about it, it does not mean you lie to her also. So, better don't tell her unless she ask you. I've experienced such cases and was stupid to tell the truth. Girls like to hear something nice but not the truth.</div>

Yeah sometimes want to be honest also hard to decide it sure will backfire to guys mostly...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  . Why she asked on this is bcos she was curious due to my performance.<br><br>Hmmmm i wonder got any girls can give more opinion on this??? Can u really accept the truth after u hear the answer....??? Based on your exp if possible... PM if u want,</div>
