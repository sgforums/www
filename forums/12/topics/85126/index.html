            <div class='col-md body'>My bf is in a terrible state now.<br><br>The whole story involves both my bf's parents, his sister &amp; brother-in-law and his eldest niece (Sister's daughter).<br><br>His niece is well-known as a very notorious girl. She is merely K2 but the things she did was very "unexpectable"<br><br>Since the day she's born, she cries very easily,  and almost everyday, so her niece stay with my bf's parents n him. 2 years later, my bf's sister gave birth to another younger sister.<br><br>Well, so my bf's sister took care of the younger one and the elder niece remains with my bf's parents.<br><br>Okie it is the fact that every grandparents dote on their grandchild, so the elder niece is been very pampered by her grandparents(aka my bf's parents). She can have everything she wants. but 1 thing is lacking, attention from her parents.<br><br>Although she's young but she can understand very well that she wants attention from her parents, and her parents dotes more on the younger one, so the elder niece become very notorious.<br><br>How notorious? Other than being mischievious, she even being given the 'authority' of talking back and scolding the elders. She can be violent and even fight with the younger sister.<br><br>my bf dotes on her alot despite her notorious being. he wanted her to be gd, so he always try to control her and try to change this elder niece to a betta child. Times when the kids deserve punishment such as canning, my bf will be told to be the "punshier" while his parents and both his sister and brother-in-law be the rescuer.<br><br>Yesterday night, my bf's father brought 1 of the kids down to my bf's cousin. So the elder got to know it, without notice, she left the house alone. My bf shouted her to go back home, but she didn;t heck care less and do things her own way.<br><br>My bf was so worried. How can 1 K2 kid just leave the house liddat and the rest were gambling away then to keep look of the leaving girl?!<br><br>Lucky my bf got the girl back, and give her a caning session.<br><br>But this matter was brought down by his parents and both his sister and bro-in-law and even blamed him for lecturing the girl..<br><br>haiz.. he feels very bad and angry for the blame.<br><br>I even msg her sister the actual scenerio, but the reply was,<br><br>"i never say he cannot beat her, i know she is naughty n not obedient, but he shouldn't beat so hard"<br><br>But the beating was not hard except for some marks of canes..<br><br>Whats should I do next? How should I comfort him?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So how terrible is he feeling right now? Hmm....well, think he is old enough to get over this kind of scolding from his parents.<br><br>Well...next time ask him never to apply any physical punishment on the elder niece. Ask your bf to tame that elder niece by making her laugh a lot, then that elder niece will listen and behave obediently to your bf.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YA... It's NOT his child what.. Why he bother so much? If I were him. I would ASKED the child what kinda person she wants to be in tthe FUTURE. Make her DECISION NOW. Might be a little too much for K2.. But that's that...<br><br>If things didn't change from there? DUMP the child BACK to the parents.. GIVE BOTH your SISTER and BROTHER-IN-LAW a GOOD SCOLDING and LECTURING... The child CAN'T THINK, but they SHOULD...<br><br>Exercising physical punishment could only get himself into TROUBLE... AVOID that AT ALL COST...<br><br>Tell the parents the CHILD'S FUTURE is IN THEIR HANDS... WHAT THEY GONNA DO ABOUT IT?<br><br>UNDERSTAND that you CAN'T change some 'FATE'.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think consoling him will only make him feel worse. Try to get him to do other activities with you, have a happy day together...accompany/allow him to do something that he want but you don't like. Little things like this is often much more helpful than just words itself.<br><br>But he is a guy, so he must overcome it by himself. You can only cheer him up.</div>
