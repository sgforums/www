Does she feels inferior whenever she's with you? Is she concerned about your social status and being with her makes you look bad in front of anybody?

            <div class='col-md body'>you sure she lies about EVERYTHING??? maybe you just didn't TRUST her on everything she said.... mind you, hesitating to answer questions is NOT, i repeat, is NOT a sign that she is about to lie. maybe you're too sensitive??? think about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is exactly what you must do in your life, and especially with women. They must always know how far they can go. For example, if my girlfriend flakes on me, of course I will be pissed off, but I will show her that I am angry , and will calmly state that this time was the last she ever did it. For everything that she does that I do not like, I tell her she can do it only 3 times: the first time, the last time and never again!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by brownie6222:</div><div class="quote_body">hey all,<br><br>I have started the observation method and so far she still lies..<br><br>well..she doesnt lie exactly about everything..but esp on her personal stuff, she would..which pisses me off bigtime..end of the day, how to know a person if she's so comfortable about lying or hiding the truth..which ever you called it..<br><br>I may be sensitive but there was a reason for it as i found out she lied about some stuff and from then the trust is broken and i scrutinize everything from then..<br><br>this is something so damn new...never had a person who hides so much..</div></blockquote></div>
