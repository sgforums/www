That was meant for brownie6222 and not you.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>"So she has to lie about something she does not want anyone to know lah, correct? So are you saying she has to be respected when she tell lies? Duh."<br><br>I mean respect her if she dun want to tell.  If she lies, then ask yourself why she did that.  Coz she dun want to let you know?  If she die die dun want to let you know and you force her for an answer, most probably she will lie, isn't it?   So who is not respecting who?  She has the right not to tell.<br><br>"What if the lie is: she is married with two kids and the spare tyre, er, I mean new boyfriend has no clue about it? Should she be respected in this sense?"<br><br>I would say she kept it from you and not lie to you.  You get it?<br><br>Would you not respect a person because of her past?  I dun think it's a shame to be a single mum.  If the guy cannot accept it, then that's his problem coz it's a fact that she is a single mum.  It's up to him to accept it or not.<br><br>You really contradict yourself.  If you mean married with kids but got a bf, and that makes the bf a third party, then that's extra-marital affair.  Then she is at fault.  But if u mean she is a single mum with kids, probably not married before or due to a divorce , then that's a different story.  Did she lie?  she merely kept it from you.  If you found out the truth and confront her, yet she said that the kids are her newphews or whatever relatives, then can she be counted as lying.<br><br></span></div>
