She called me....and she sound angry and asked me what did i do behind her back. I asked her..what did i do? Then slowly we quarrelled.. I told her I juz need to clear everything. She dunno why denied everything...and say I wanna spoil her relationship with everyone... Haiz...then she called their relatives again then she told her sister that they dislike me again....Later on, she called me again and say sorry. I told her she cannot gain my trust anymore. She say nvm...if she backstab her again, i can beat her..do anything i like. She ask for my forgiveness but i didn't forgive her..Later on, i found out again that she backstab her own sister... that means she never change at all...<br>well...if this continues...

Be cordial, can already.  When too close, frictions tend to occur.  It will be tough for your bf to decide who to side with.</div>
