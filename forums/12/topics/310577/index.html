              <p>i don't really have any ways to help u in getting into a poly.</p>
              <p>but i can advise you that don't ever give up. i got one friend who failed her maths, so she ended up in ITE. However, she was determined to get into poly. So she retook her maths and some other subs while studying in ITE. and guess what, she did well in retaking her o's and now she's accepted into np and into her favourite course somemore.</p>
              <p>And another advice is on how to study english. I HIGHLY recommend you to read more. it's very important. no time borrow books, never mind one. There's always the newspapers to read. I make it a point to read the newspaper every morning without fail. Do not just read soccer news. If u hate reading news that are irrelevant to you, try reading HOME. It consists of whatever is happening in singapore. </p>
              <p>another way to improve english is to definitely speak it more! speak it whenever u can! trust me it helps. and for me, because i consecutively failed chinese in my school exams, so i started to listen to mandarin songs, and i even learn to write lyrics of jay chou and guess what, i scored a B3 in my first attempt taking the chinese o levels.</p>
              <p>so never give up, it's never too late to learn your mistakes.</p>
              <p>P.S just don't waste ur life anymore. I have friends who failed maths and went into a sucky course in other school, and now drop out of the course and doesn't know where to head. Plan ur future wisely.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>hey man, i don't have much of a good suggestion but i honestly suggest u retake english as a private candidate or actually, you might wanna retake some other subjects as well, which are essential for the course u want in poly. rather than enter a poly that u don't like and a course that you don't like as well, take the o's again. the course u take in poly is highly likely to determine which path of career u take in the future. try not to let the chance to choose go to waste. improve in english : speak proper english on daily basis, read newspaper everyday, listen to radio especially class 95/93.8. read more books to improve vocab. this may not necessarily give you improved english but i believe as long as you put in effort, some result will show. all the best :D</p></div>
