            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"></span><br>Ive known this guy recently online. He happens to be a friend of my ex's and we got along quite well. He helped me solve some of my problem with my ex, acting as the middle person. He broke up with his girlfriend of three years recently because she was unfaithful to him and now he tells me he loves me. I used to get sad when he told me he wasnt in a good mood cos of his gf and jealous when he went out with her instead of meeting me but now that he's single I dont seem to "want" him that bad. But i do miss him a lot when he's not with me and when Im with him I feel a sense of security. Ive started to treat him as my boyfriend too. But yet when he tells me he loves me or he misses me I do not feel a thing. Have I fallen for him or I just wanted somebody that was not mine or was I just lonely for love? Please help.. He's asked me to be his girl but Ive not agreed cos we are from different schools and we stay quite far from each other and meeting will be difficult so I'll see how we progress when the term starts. He's the first and the last one I think of each day and if I dont get his sms or missed call I will be in a really bad mood the whole day. When Im sad, happy, or afraid I will find him. Is this love? Another thing.. I am taller than him and I kind of mind our difference in height (about 10 cm) though I dont really look much taller than him.</div>

He happens to be a friend of my ex's and we got along quite well. He helped me solve some of my problem with my ex, acting as the middle person. He broke up with his girlfriend of three years recently because she was unfaithful to him and now he tells me he loves me. I used to get sad when he told me he wasnt in a good mood cos of his gf and jealous when he went out with her instead of meeting me but now that he's single I dont seem to "want" him that bad. But i do miss him a lot when he's not with me and when Im with him I feel a sense of security. Ive started to treat him as my boyfriend too. But yet when he tells me he loves me or he misses me I do not feel a thing. Have I fallen for him or I just wanted somebody that was not mine or was I just lonely for love? Please help.. He's asked me to be his girl but Ive not agreed cos we are from different schools and we stay quite far from each other and meeting will be difficult so I'll see how we progress when the term starts. He's the first and the last one I think of each day and if I dont get his sms or missed call I will be in a really bad mood the whole day. When Im sad, happy, or afraid I will find him. Is this love? Another thing.. I am taller than him and I kind of mind our difference in height (about 10 cm) though I dont really look much taller than him.</div></blockquote>SOrrie...juz asking arh...ur nick Small girl and tt guy is 100mm shorter den u <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> .
