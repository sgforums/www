            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it's time for me to post something in this section.<br>Since the day I broke out with my gf...... i feel so depressed.<br>I feel depressed not be'coz we broke up. We both know it is happier that we go apart. We have a peaceful break and we are now brother and sis.<br><br>At first I think it is a good idea to be brother and sister. Anyway I have been more than a brother than a boyfriend to her. But things is not what I expected. I call her few times per week to ask her how she's getting along. But when I heard that someone else is chasing her..i really feel no good. But I keep telling myself......"Control yourself, we are not suitable...let other people take care of her".<br><br>So now I make up my mind...don't call her anymore...it's impossible for a very close relationship to be brother and sister.<br><br>and some more this country is getting worst to stay in. So difficult to save money dnt even say buy car, hse, married...<br><br>and I m working in an IT field....the benefit and effort given out is so unbalance. Getting more and more no interest in this job.<br><br>What can I do to get out of my depress mood. If this carry on.... I don't know what will happen to me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">super4,<br><br>It is nice to know that you have ended a relationship amicably. After ending a relationship, it is not always possible to remain as friends or brother/sister relationship.  It is a natural reaction to feel no good to know that your ex-girlfriend is showing attention to another person.<br><br>It is a good idea to stay away from her for a period of time (eg, 3 to 6 months).  However, i do think it is possible that both of you can remain as friends.  Rather than call each other, maybe both of you can like keep in touch via email once a while. </span><br><br><strong>Quote:<br>and I m working in an IT field....the benefit and effort given out is so unbalance. Getting more and more no interest in this job. </strong><br><span style="color: indigo;">--&gt; What do you mean by this? </span><br><br><strong>Quote:<br>What can I do to get out of my depress mood. If this carry on.... I don't know what will happen to me. </strong><br><span style="color: indigo;">--&gt; You are losing your focus in life and thus you are depress. I would suggest you to read self-enrichment/development books.</span><br><br><strong>Quote:<br>Anybody got any ways to earn money. I am getting restless working here. Pls dnt tell me network marketing. </strong><br>[color=indigo]--&gt; Want to know about financial independence, you can start with reading the book 'Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki'.  It can be a starting point towards earning money.<br>--&gt; How much you know about network marketing.<br><br>Hope the information is helpful.<br><br></div>
