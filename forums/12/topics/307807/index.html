              <p>Love triangles are usually easy to resolve.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For a relationship to work out... the person you like must like you too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does the person you like .... like you? If not pull out cause its a waste of your time... go spend it on another girl or go spend that time making yourself more attractive/funny or watever.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the person you like... likes you.... tell her confirm that you both have a thing for each other... and tell her to gently let your best mate know that the two of you have started going out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And don't ferget to spend time with your good friend too <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">... and fer christ sake dun bring your gf along <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> </p>

              <p><br>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry I had internet problems. Emailing from work now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From what you tell me, I surmise that she is waiting for something better to come along. But she does not want to let go of the guys interested in her at the moment. Reason probably because she is uncertain she can get what she wants. And if she rejects you and is unable to work out with the #1 in her heart.... she is left with nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I would do....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Continue communication with her... don't do it too often and don't pop the question if she would like to start a relationship with you. If you do that too often, she might want to avoid answering that question and ultimately avoid you. Keep it cool chat her like once/twice a week about fun stuff ... try to keep the topic away from you &amp; her. Make her luff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Look out fer other hot chicks. If she wants time to figure out if the competition is better.... its fair that you take the time to look around .... you might find something better <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> Of course its best not to let her know.... but if she asks just tell her your relationship with any other "hot" stuff is platonic (for now <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png">). And if she gets jealous and calls you a flirt .... tell her you are not and am ready to start an <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">exclusive</span></strong> relationship with her <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png">. And if she can't ... meybe she is the flirt?</p>
