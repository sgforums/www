              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just know a guy. But i scared that he is just leading me on. He is incredibly nice to me, dates me out, maintains eye contact when is chatting with me and confide and divulge many secrets to me. He teases me at times also.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But he has never made the move on me yet.However, he sent me sms like everyday and will ask me stuff like how am i doing etc. I do not know if he takes me as a friend or has some romantic interest in me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The most perculiar thing is that he asked me for my opinions when he is shopping for apparel and stuff. He put on the shirt and asked me how does he looks in it etc... I wonder why does he do that? He also tell me about his work problems.. However, he rarely asks about my private life. He will just reveal everything about himself to me without me having to ask him about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I admit  I am developing feelings for him as he is a very nice,sweet and gentlemanly guy.What should i do now? Does he really have some kind of romantic interest in me or just take me as a friend? In the past, i had experiences when a guy would date me out as a friend, sent me the wrong signals and then break the news that he only sees me as a friend when i confessed to me. It would be very disappointing and double blow to me if he likes some gals and only dates me out as a friend. I have been in the friend zone in the past.</p>
              <p>Please help. I dont wanna be hurt again</p>

Maybe you should open up more to him and let him get the chance to know you better. Give it more time, then you will be able to determine if you are just good friends or something more.

              cant be really sure what kinda guy he is, so observe a little longer. just to play safe.
              
              in the mean time tell yourself hes just a friend. (buy insurance) just in case its another 'just a friend' case. if in time to come u find that hes interested in you, then you both can develop from there.

              <p>For now, just rein in your heart, treat him as a friend first and see how it goes. How long have you known him?</p>

              <p>It does seem that he's interested in you. However, if he was a real gentleman, he'd make the first move to express his feelings. <br><br>Some guys enjoy the initial feeling of wooing a girl, and some even take it as a challenge or achievement. While others usually wait to see if the girl has taken a liking for him to avoid rejection.</p>
              <p>I'd suggest not to rush into it. More oft than not, this period of wooing and ocassionally flirting with each other is the most memorable time in a relationship. Enjoy the attention that he gives you, and the things he does to impress you. Soon, he'll realise that you like his company and take a step further to express his interests.</p>
              <p>Good luck, and never lose faith in love. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>HOLY SHIT! You're right!</p>
              <p>Yea, I got tons of gay friends who are that way. And what's so peculiar about him asking you how he looks, it's only normal unless you have a terrible sense of fashion</p>

              <p>I think most guys in general, if he's interested in you, he'll want to find out more about you, instead of letting you know everything about him. Sounds like you're in the friend zone. But then again, you'll never know, everyone is different.</p>
              <p>I agree with Karma88, just ask him straight if he likes you.</p>

              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p>I just know a guy. But i scared that he is just leading me on.
              He is incredibly nice to me, dates me out, maintains eye contact
              when is chatting with me and confide and divulge many secrets to
              me. He teases me at times also.</p>
              <p>But he has never made the move on me yet.However, he sent me sms
              like everyday and will ask me stuff like how am i doing etc. I do
              not know if he takes me as a friend or has some romantic interest
              in me.</p>
              <p>The most perculiar thing is that he asked me for my opinions
              when he is shopping for apparel and stuff. He put on the shirt and
              asked me how does he looks in it etc... I wonder why does he do
              that? He also tell me about his work problems.. However, he rarely
              asks about my private life. He will just reveal everything about
              himself to me without me having to ask him about it.</p>
              <p>I admit  I am developing feelings for him as he is a very
              nice,sweet and gentlemanly guy.What should i do now? Does he really
              have some kind of romantic interest in me or just take me as a
              friend? In the past, i had experiences when a guy would date me out
              as a friend, sent me the wrong signals and then break the news that
              he only sees me as a friend when i confessed to me. It would be
              very disappointing and double blow to me if he likes some gals and
              only dates me out as a friend. I have been in the friend zone in
              the past.</p>
              <p>Please help. I dont wanna be hurt again</p>

              <p>as this is quite late and i have sch tomolo... i didnt read the replies..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my replies : asking for ur opinions doesnt mean he like u... ( i noe this is sad to hear but bear with me... at least this is my true words)</p>
              <p>but going on date with u could mean something (not neccessary romantic feeling... maybe yes or maybe not...)</p>
              <p>just asking... does he try to touch u yet he respect u a lot? for example he stroke ur hair? hit ur head after some stupid comment u made? flying kisses?</p>
