            <div class='col-md body'>i had a few questions to seek views/comments from U all.<br><br>1. If a gal is interested in a guy initially BUT the guy DID NOT express interest/confide to her and after sometime the gal will a bit like disappointed and decided to leave but when the guy confides to her at a later stage --- Is it TRUE that the gal must again " find back" her feeling again (will not accept the guy that easily) before accepting the guy again??<br><br>2. If a gal told the guy that HE must ALWAYS remember her but claim that he is just a friend of her. Does it mean anything? Is the gal hiding her true feeling from the guy? The gal will feel jealous if the guy mentions pther gals in front of her<br><br>I feel that if both are really just friend, it is unlikely that the gal will keep mentioning/expect the guy to remember her(what so special by the way?) or feel jealous UNLESS SOMETHING SPECIAL is HIDING under the surface!!!

Meet the right person at the right time with the right feelings.<br><br>2. Perhaps the girl is waiting for the guy to take the initiative lor.  Maybe she has a liking for him but not too sure.  She is probably testing the guy.   But sometimes, if you cherish somebody as a fren, especially a guy..nothing wrong with asking him to remember her wor..<span style="color: indigo;"></span></div>

It's kinda difficult to explain here, but my suggested advice to your course of action is to employ reverse psychology upon her methods. Young-guns theory (YGT) state that the way to attract a girl surrounded by a horde of wolves is to avoid showering attention. Under this scenario, YGT is applicable for this case satisfy two variables:<br><br>I) The shifting of feelings is obviously based on transitory crushes, therefore there is no permanent effect. 'Find feeling, etc' - are different ways of expressing this phenomenon. In simple: From here, they want time.<br><br>II) Once jealousy take place while (I) is in effect, this happens: commonly known to the folk as the-desire-to-be-loved. And anything that could threaten the queen's throne from the your object of affection, petty woman's jealousy sprouts from her heart.<br><br>What I mean by reversal method is do to opposite of what is expected of you. She desire your attention, forbid her your affection. She wants you to remember her, act as if you don't. In group meeting (if applicable), talk about other girls and your eyes should spark and the topic should be interesting with lots of laughter.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> When alone, cease reversal method and react as she please. When time is ripe, strike. Her throne will be shaken and she will fall from her unreachable heights.<br><br>P.S: Among all form of seduction game, I detest this school of thought. If it does happen to me, I would return her the game in full amount and probably more. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
