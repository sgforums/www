I don't want to be a monster......<br>Even at night, when loneliness engulfs me and makes me vengeful, I control..... No matter what, I will not be tempted to do the wrong thing.<br><br>I know you love your ex-bf. However, you have to be fair to yourself too. Can you bring yourself to hurt yourself just like I became a fighting monster in the past.<br><br>This is not selfish. This is your own welfare. And I know this is difficult because I got a bunch of noisy friends <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  who will come to MIRC to lecture me how to ge over it and still my relationship is the <strong>worst Hangover in the world</strong>. But never the less, keep trying no matter how long it takes.<br><br>We are all here to help..... people who is hurt and people who is not hurt are there to help each other.<br><br>Maybe I should organising a outing in a pub where girls can cry there silly and guys can get drunk fresh naked  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

First is repent, second is taken for granted, third or more is taken you for a fool. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyway he is already an icon of the past - there is no need for you to ponder over his words/action/behavior/etc. Whatever sweetie little thing he says - just read, acknowledge and delete of your mind. Look into the future, not back. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers     </div></blockquote>he has done both..<br>asking for forgiveness and using another lie to cover...<br><br>and from what u had said... i guess he has taken me for a fool... coz i guess it has been countless times that he lied to me...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>something similar like this to me has happened before my ex told me he never had a gf, but he did and every fren of mine knew about it but never tell  me, i onli found out much later after they boke up. i was hurt since we were still good frens who had a mutual break up.<br><br>ur ex never tell u cause he did not wanna hurt u, he did not wan u to feel than that he got over u just like that and has a new gal while u r still alone, he still respects ur feeling and does not wan u to be sad and make it seem like wat u had did not mean much, later he did not know how or when to break it to u. i guess he does not wan u to think negatively of him. maybe there can be a future for u with him as his gal or livelong frenship, if he was to tell u than itself do u think ur frenship could have survived this long,<br><br>learn from relationships, so the next one u will know how to work on it and make it survive. eg. my ex sometimes did say he loves me still, though i know it aint like the love we used to have and i dont blame him. he is moving on with times, at least respects me and does not wanna hurt me. if he were to say not any more, that would have defintely spoilt my day.<br><br>u dont have to find a bf now, wat u can do is spend time with other potentials and understand wat u wan, dont go looking for ur ex in these guys. have fun importantly !<br><br>good luck gal.</div>
