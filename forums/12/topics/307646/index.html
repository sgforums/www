              <p>to give a brief description of my situation goes like this-,im the kinda person who is "engrossed" in chiobus lah.. i mean as a normal teenage boy who isnt attracted to chiobus.. but occassionally i go to the extent of like following them for a couple of minutes after spotting them. then personally and humblely im kinda attractive to girls. On the first sight girls would normally starts to pay attention to me..  then often when girls are paying attention to me they would 99% of the time see me "scouting chiobus",then give them the impression that im hella flirt..some of my female friends called me very " è‰²"..</p>
              <p>then sometimes when i approach some newly spotted chiobus for a simple chat then my female friends all saw it,then after that chat when i go back to chat with my female friends they all shun me liao....i even got this very close friend who would normally smile so happily and loves to act cute infront of me.. now give me such a cooooolllddddd shoulder and doesnt even reply to my msgs,,,</p>
              <p>then in occasions when i was chatting face to face with female friend i would sometimes normally stare at their cleavage when they're skimply dressed ..then after that chat session waaa the girls will like 360degree change suddenly keep a distance away from me liao...  staring at the cleaveage is going overboard??</p>
              <p>but now what hurting me most is that 1of my close female friend actually had a crush on me initially.. but after seeing me everytime go scouting/chatting with chiobus she now shuns me like...  when she's still sort of "in love with me" she would display a kinda a kinda cute cute/inncoent personalities,was a happy bunny hopping around every morning ,now she suddenly turned into cold cold ahlian types started igniting cigarettes before me which she never done before..last nite i happen to bump into her in a neighbourhood park near her workplace i sit beside her and just saw engrossing in her smoke displaying  å†· é…·ahlian attitude and with a strong sense of no directions in life,expression of no goals in her life with her eyes looking upwards for the stars.. watching her in her ahlian attitude tarnishing herself really hurts my heart alot..even as just a normal friend..she wouldnt reply to any of my messages..what can i do??</p>

              <p>yeah looking at girls dun be too obvious. Even as a girl I also like to look at pretty girls at times. but not too obvious one quick glance is enough.</p>
              <p>Imagine if u are looking at a person who view chiobus like u do, surely he appear abit pervertic to u  too.</p>
              <p>Its not right to be so forward to your viewing of girl body parts although no wrong but u are making them uneasy. u wouldnt feel easy if a girl keep staring at ur body part right. sure will feel disgusted and irritated and u may feel she is a desperado girl.</p>
              <p>make a quick glance then continue to look at the face to make conversation.</p>

              <p>#1: You're a hopeless flirt. Professional flirts know how to act innocent. You're too downright obvious.</p>
              <p>#2: She chose her own life. If she wanna change, she will change. But she sees no impetus for it. Maybe being <em>ah lian</em> allows her to exert her personality.</p>

              <p>from the way they;re scantly dressed gives me the impression of "they're loose" okay sometimes then it turns out to be wrong.. but from my true past life-experiences most of my sec school friends likes it when guys pay "sexual attention" to them,  for example when i go out with them they wear low low cut,bare back, then when i look at their body and discussing with my buddies the girls will start to play sexy,telling me what cup they're wearing,pulling their skirts in class infront of me,sticking out their butts tiptoeing,i've even got female-friends who rubbed her chest right onto my face in class to get my attention before...well.. perhaps this is what kinda impression i get from a ahbeng/ahlian school,now come out liao gotta change to adapt to different kinds of girls outside...</p>
              <p>but now seriously im worried about how the gal is doing now.. continuing ahlian attitude will really hurt her....i just want to maintain at least a normal friendship with her or at least can make her change for the better...don't  wanna see a friendship to be broken ...</p>
