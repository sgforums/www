I know for a fact that the day will come when we say goodbye (who knows, maybe I'm the one who leave first, but it's still a goodbye).  After so many years, I still cannot reconcile with this.<br><br>I remember when I was a schoolkid, I ever had a dream of my parents leaving me and I woke up crying non stop the next day.  And I would feel sad and cry whole day long.  This kind of dream still has this kind of effect on me and I always pray that I don't dream of that at night.<br><br>Yesterday I went to an elderly home.  It's within a block of one-room flat, run by a certain charity.  The elderly are friendly and they all smiled at me when I walked past them or their apartments.  But somehow it didn't give me a warm feeling.  In my mind, I just thought about my own parents.  I am so afraid that one day when they are frail and sick, I will not be able to take care of them, due to my work commitment and health.  I am so afraid that I have to send them to elderly home.<br><br>I am not sure whether anybody is having this kind of fear as well.  I really dunno whether I should stop about it and handle things only when it comes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A morbid... post from my blog.... some time ago.. when I was helping to test the blood pressure for my mom and my dad... I am very close to them, and.. we've all come a long way together... that I cannot imagine how it would be for me if one day they leave. Until now on weekends, if hubby and I have nothing much to do, strangely my first thought would be to give a call to my parents instead of a couple of friends... cos we really HAVE a good time together just talking, joking, eating, its.. effortless. I'm glad I love them in this way and I know... slowly they would grow old.. and there would be a time, when they won't understand my jokes anymore... or be able to laugh at them. But its what all this time from here to then is for... so that when its time for them to almost reach the destination, too far from us... they can reminiscince about all these memories.. and won't be too lonely until one day we join them too ba. Dont mean to be morbid.<br><br>- - - - - - -- - - -<br><br>Have you listened to the heartbeats of the people you love?<br><br>I listened to my mom and my dad's heartbeats through a stethescope...for the first time, when I listen to their heartbeats and compared it to my own... and it is scary because I could actually hear the difference theirs were more muffled... I could actually hear their hearts trying to work harder beating... weaker... softer... and for the first time, the reality of their mortality strikes me in the face full force I kept thinking about this.. even though this happened months ago now that I have moved out and starting a new home of my own and suddenly the rhythm of the heartbeat will just get into my mind and I will be reminded to give my mom a call... or take them out for the weekend.. cos.. u never know.... when those heartbeats will stop.<br><br></div>
