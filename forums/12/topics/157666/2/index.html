But what if one day you come home to see your mum all dead and splattered on the ground floor as a result of ignoring? I will live in guilt forever.<br><br>I have applied for a night part time job in a warehouse nearby, and hopefully I'll get the job.. I guess its the only way to beat the "system."<br><br>Sometimes mum makes all of us feel that life is not worth living anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Dad and brother had somewhat "escaped" her clutches, so she's clinging onto me.<br><br>She's an expert in mind games.

Friends' house? I'm saving up for a trip to Malaysia, maybe for a 2 week break.<br><br>I went for a full one week holiday few months back after informing her. No change in attitude at all. She insisted on auto roaming too..<br><br>As usual, you can find me at home most of the time before 8pm.

I know it's only me, but I hope you won't be like that sh*thead dad of yours, going out with friends all the time."<br><br>She uses vulgar words, and taunts you to fall into her trap.<br><br>Click.
