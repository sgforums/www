My career never took off as a result... social life crashed because I have to make up excuses to friends when we are suppose to have a good time together.<br><br>When I walk around the house with a grouchy look on my face, she would go:<br><br>Mum: "Why that long face?"<br>Me: "Nothing."<br><br>Starts to pick a fight, like saying something to agiate me.

Dad will take it as a cue to pack a few shirts into his bag and usually 3 min later I can hear the slamming of the metal gate, and click.

            <div class='col-md body'>She's been going through her "rough patch" all her life. My younger brother used to stay home with her 'cos he was still young, and mum had an excuse to bar him from going out.<br><br>I worked part time in a ware house too.. just to avoid her.. when I knocked off work.. I would have like 23 missed calls from her, and about 15 messages. We can't do much cos she's co-owner of the flat. She can threaten to stop work and the flat would be repossessed in a few months. My ex-gf described her as a "monster" and even wished me good luck when we broke up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>elloz....how old are you? well frankly, i have been experiencing this thing for a long time...same case as you, only i am a lil better off than you coz my parents talk for a few seconds periodically and begin to quarrel again. =)<br><br>its the same for me and my mum, i am not allowed to go out late, when eva we discuss, she gives me some lame answers to agitate me and brings up all the stuff i did badly in the past and begins war. at least u can go out to play in the day? I cant loh....have to bluff her all the time that i am actually doin projects...<br><br>for me, i am slowly adapting to this kinda life....we are humans after all. wheneva this sorta thing happens, i just put my mind on what eva i am doing and just tahan, telling my self, if i shuddup, she will too. or sometimes, i give her a loud OK ENOUGH? I NEED TO STUDY! and she will shuddup. This kind of things, dun bother too much lah, your life is more impt, they will die one day and so will you, why shorten your life like them, going about screaming about things and later complain heart pain here pain there pain...<br><br>stay happie, look at the bright side of things. when ur mum dun allow you to go out, think of the stuff you can do at home, and you would be happier. Think on the lines of: I can slp, my friends cant. I can hand in my hw/Revise, they cant, I can frag ppl at home, they cant, I can save more money for a new NANO, they cant.....hope you catch my drift..<br><br>stay happie ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

What actually happens to cause your dad to move out from the house to stay with his relatives.. I guess is due to your mum's temper and unreasonable request.<br><br>I do understand your feeling as an older brother, cause it will be a great responsibility to look after your mum, ensuring your brother don get into the wrong hands and of course keep a look out for your dad to ensure that he is ok.<br><br>Firstly, your brother.. At his age, i guess he will be rebellious as he is in secondary school.. But fear not.. cause his rebelliousness are all part and parcel of everyone.. He will somehow come to terms that being rebellious will not lead him every where.. If he wants to work at 7-11 to avoid your mum.. let him be.. At least you know that he is not out there doing something which is harmful to him.. Just keep an eye on him to ensure that he don go a stray.<br><br>Your dad has tried his best to cheer u and ur brother up.. At least you know there is a comfort source beside u..<br><br>Your mum may have come to this stage of her life.. Maybe due to her work, someone said something to her.. or worst.. someone condemming her. People who suffer from depression will tend to resort to things like committing suicide when things are not going in their way..<br><br>My advice to you is this.. Try talking your mum thru.. asking her about the problem. If she does not want to to tell you about it, than professional Psychiatric  help is required. Should one day something were to happen to her.. And you know what the problem is.. Are you going to bear the consequences??<br><br>The last resort will be making a police report and get a personal protection order (PPO) on you, your brother and your dad. You should get this ONLY when she has been abusing both of you or you feel that she is in any threat towards you or your sibilings.<br><br>Sometimes, step back and try to understand her feelings.<br><br>Cheer up dude.. You are not the only one around like that..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Maybe you feel pity for her, or even afraid that she may attempt something foolish, still, the maternal influence is heavy - does this exercising of control is in process long ago... when you were younger and stuff?<br><br>Your mother is undergoing a crisis now. She probably has nobody else to turn to and therefore choose to bar you from 'fleeing' so that she has some unseen emotional support, even if you don't say or do anything. She just needed some physical evidence to show that not everyone is 'fleeing' from her life. She is not trying to cease you from your hedonistic pursue with your friends and life... more like trying to save herself from emotional drowning.<br><br>Never... never use logics to decipher her ideology - your mum has gone beyond common sense and logics. She truly needs some form of emotional counselling and if you don't know how to open her wounds, fear and instability and nurse them through words and stuff, one good option is to consider counselling. A third party may be able to release that intensity in her and regain some sanity - or at least quit threatening the suicide thing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U gotta stand your ground. Explain to her that u are old n mature enough. Dun bother arguing for ur dad or for ur mum. I know how u feel, but to have this thing happen now can be hard for u to adapt to this new condition. Jus try to be understanding, then be independant. But u can only stay neutral so long until u fall either way. Its gonna be psychologically hard for u to handle 2 seperate entities that has thier own views and it may clash with u and further frustrate yourself some more. Do not let thier failed marriage to stop you from achieveing your own goals n dreams. In the future , they will be old n weak while ur future is still ahead of you. Do what u must , and do what u can to achieve it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to hear bout this.<br><br>Anyway I went through something similar although to a much less degree. Hmmm maybe you'll can try to go counselling or something? I was quite repulsive of that at first, but it did turn out to be help. A professional might be able to help your mom express her thoughts in a more positive way.<br><br>Another suggestion would be to get her friends to talk to her more, spend time with her more? Talking is a good way of relieving teh pent up emotions, so perhaps getting her to talk to someone about it would be good.<br><br>Btw cheer up dude. I know it's easy to say but do hang in there.
