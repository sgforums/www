              <p>i can understand where TS coming from .. i am who i am today because i've been through that many rejections. to spite, will be your motivation, but when you get there, you'll be too happy with what you achieved to even care - that person who started your journey of self-improvement would by then be insignificant to you.</p>
              <p>if you're thinking of doing something stupid like finding a chiobu to walk with you like couple, or to buy something flashy .. i tell u now, it won't do jackshit. because she doens't care. imagine, a really ugly girl confess to you, you say no, then the girl walk with a yandao, what's the first thought? "wah fuck, a handsome blind man, so rare!". so yea, improve yourself in the long run.</p>
              <p>when i was in high sch, i liked at least a diff. girl every half year; every single one rejected me. back then, i was still young - baby fat all over, immature - in short, no looks, no brain, no charisma. thankfully, God must have taken pity given the many heartbreaks i went through, and i transformed with my efforts and his good grace - like extreme makeover like that. i started running, and the moment baby fat lost, everything else kinda fell in place .. my features actually v. pan-asian and sharp - didn't come through before because i was so fat. started studying really hard - stopped thinking of girls after i hit 16 and just focused on my getting that sports car and salary.</p>
              <p>few months back, at 10yr high sch reunion, i met some of these girls. had a few laughs over how stupid i was then. next thing i knew, i received an sms from one of them saying she wished she saw "my character" yadah yadah bshit back then (i know it's shit because i spoke to her for what, 20mins? max.), and would like to try things out. when she told me that, i thought "YES! HAHA TOO BAD" but then it quickly went away, and i realised how the "hardships" i went through as a teenager shaped me today. quite frankly - she's not a girl i would even consider asking out on a date - not even ONS material, much less gf or possibily wife.</p>

              <p><br>TS, you know as well as i do that the world today is no realm of innocence. no one better is going to come unless you yourself get better. whether it means improving your standing in society, or your inner character, hell, even your looks. so improve yourself with the motivation to spite, and like Canny said, you will become stronger - by the time you get to a pos. of superiority (in whatever context), you will look back and realise the insignificance of what bothered you in the first place.</p>

              <p>i can understand where TS coming from .. i am who i am today because i've been through that many rejections. to spite, will be your motivation, but when you get there, you'll be too happy with what you achieved to even care - that person who started your journey of self-improvement would by then be insignificant to you.</p>
              <p>if you're thinking of doing something stupid like finding a chiobu to walk with you like couple, or to buy something flashy .. i tell u now, it won't do jackshit. because she doens't care. imagine, a really ugly girl confess to you, you say no, then the girl walk with a yandao, what's the first thought? "wah fuck, a handsome blind man, so rare!". so yea, improve yourself in the long run.</p>
              <p>when i was in high sch, i liked at least a diff. girl every half year; every single one rejected me. back then, i was still young - baby fat all over, immature - in short, no looks, no brain, no charisma. thankfully, God must have taken pity given the many heartbreaks i went through, and i transformed with my efforts and his good grace - like extreme makeover like that. i started running, and the moment baby fat lost, everything else kinda fell in place .. my features actually v. pan-asian and sharp - didn't come through before because i was so fat. started studying really hard - stopped thinking of girls after i hit 16 and just focused on my getting that sports car and salary.</p>
              <p>few months back, at 10yr high sch reunion, i met some of these girls. had a few laughs over how stupid i was then. next thing i knew, i received an sms from one of them saying she wished she saw "my character" yadah yadah bshit back then (i know it's shit because i spoke to her for what, 20mins? max.), and would like to try things out. when she told me that, i thought "YES! HAHA TOO BAD" but then it quickly went away, and i realised how the "hardships" i went through as a teenager shaped me today. quite frankly - she's not a girl i would even consider asking out on a date - not even ONS material, much less gf or possibily wife.</p>
