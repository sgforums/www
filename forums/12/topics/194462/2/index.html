            <div class='col-md body'>The last thing I should do is to be telling you what to do, for I was once in a very similar situation (minus the abortion) and looking back in retrospect though it wasn't such a bad thing -  ending the relationship, I could have done it in a far more amicable manner. I guess there are a few questions you have to ask yourself and she supplement the answers. Are you being over-sensitive? Secondly, if you are certain she is cheating on you, are you able to stand for it? In other words, are you that crazily in love with her that your pride can take the cheating? For one, I do not neccessitate ending a relationship just because someone cheats on the other. In fact, a relationship is like a treatise between two individuals - they dictate the terms and not by convention. Thirdly, I guess this is the most important of the three - will you be better off without her?</div>

Well anyway going to break up with her at the right time after I finish up with my project. Her ex bf now already got a gf so she is like cannot even go back to him all these. She is just treating me like a life jacket. Everytime she calls me, in less than 1 min, she can say ' I love you' and 'i miss you' so many times and I know she is treating me like her ex bf and saying those words makes her feels like she is saying them to her ex bf.

Well anyway going to break up with her at the right time after I finish up with my project. Her ex bf now already got a gf so she is like cannot even go back to him all these. She is just treating me like a life jacket. Everytime she calls me, in less than 1 min, she can say ' I love you' and 'i miss you' so many times and I know she is treating me like her ex bf and saying those words makes her feels like she is saying them to her ex bf. Makes me simply wanna puke. Disgusting </div></blockquote>Do you love her?</div>
