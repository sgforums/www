            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nanren4ever:</div><div class="quote_body">Its hard to tell if the girl likes you or not, judging from what u have said here. But then again, since when has it been easy for people to tell if other people are interested in them or not. Coz people are always capable of giving mixed, or even wrong signals.<br><br>All I can suggest is go out with her more, get 2 know her better. Going out 1 to 1(1 on 1 sounds like u two going 2 fight <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) doesn't mean that she has that special feelings for u, but rather, that she likes you as a friend, and trust you enough to go out alone with u.<br><br>Your talk about anticipating of her phone call, sms etc seems to suggest that you hope that she takes some initatives too. Don't wait for her to approach u, but u go approach her instead. In the end, its all about taking initatives, and grabbing whatever chances you have. Don't be scared or worried that ur persisent wooing may scare her off, coz if she's really scared off by you, and tries to avoid u, at least u know she don't like you liao. Sms her, and see the type of reply she gives you. If its a short, few words answer, it will suggest that she do not have the time or energy to want to waste on you. Then u should get the hint.<br><br>All the best to you. Don't be like me, always waiting for others to take the initative, then in the end, nothing will ever happen. Life is not about leaving it to fate, but rather, seizing the chances that come your way, and making something happen out of it. Fate and destiny is make out of how you take ur chances, and not pre-destined.<br><br></div></blockquote>Bravo! well said..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... dun be so quiet! be the centre of attraction! make urself interesting! dun be boring! that's really impt and do talk on topics that really interests her... u noe it when she goes, "OH REALLY?! ME TOO!!!".<br><br>u can tell that she STARTS to gain an interest/like you when:<br><br>1) she begins to open up to u by sharing with u her own matters or suddenly keen in matters about u...<br><br>2) she keeps glancing at u when u are with a grp of frens from time to time and when u turn to look at her, she looks away...<br><br>3) when u speak to her and look into her eyes, her pupils are dilated. indicating that she is really really interested in ur conversation.<br><br>4) she starts to tease u, of cos u shld tease her back 10 times more... thats where the fun begins.<br><br>it really depends on ur techniques too... usually girls tend to mature faster than guys and they tend to like guys that are more mature... so u need to be someone that's mature with a secret charming &amp; cute side that will keep trying to get u to show her... making her to do the work instead of u...<br><br>and it depends on how old the girl is... her personality... etc etc... it's something that requires experience... and u get the experience by hanging out with diff types of girls so u noe wad u want eventually...<br><br>saying is easy, doing is another thing... luck also takes a factor... so good luck my fren...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

She doesn't show any disdain but neither does she show any, if much, interests...I guess it might be that the girl isn't looking into being in a relationship at the moment yet. At least that's what i deduced after some days of thinking.<br><br>So i guess we should take it easy, get closer and increase the bonding with the other party first. Build up on the relationship. I guess that's the only way to it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

But then again, since when has it been easy for people to tell if other people are interested in them or not. Coz people are always capable of giving mixed, or even wrong signals.<br><br>All I can suggest is go out with her more, get 2 know her better. Going out 1 to 1(1 on 1 sounds like u two going 2 fight <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) doesn't mean that she has that special feelings for u, but rather, that she likes you as a friend, and trust you enough to go out alone with u.<br><br>Your talk about anticipating of her phone call, sms etc seems to suggest that you hope that she takes some initatives too. Don't wait for her to approach u, but u go approach her instead. In the end, its all about taking initatives, and grabbing whatever chances you have. Don't be scared or worried that ur persisent wooing may scare her off, coz if she's really scared off by you, and tries to avoid u, at least u know she don't like you liao. Sms her, and see the type of reply she gives you. If its a short, few words answer, it will suggest that she do not have the time or energy to want to waste on you. Then u should get the hint.<br><br>All the best to you. Don't be like me, always waiting for others to take the initative, then in the end, nothing will ever happen. <strong>Life is not about leaving it to fate, but rather, seizing the chances that come your way, and making something happen out of it. Fate and destiny is make out of how you take ur chances, and not pre-destined.</strong><br><br></blockquote>I like what u said here</div>
