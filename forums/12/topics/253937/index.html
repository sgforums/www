            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shadez:</div><div class="quote_body">I like this girl. But i don't know if she likes me the same...<br><br>I have went out with her 1 on 1 on numerous occasions. (girls, would you go out 1 on 1 with a guy you don't LIKE?)<br>We get along quite well and can talk about things easily. I'm more of the quiet one...<br>I have her on my mind most of the time, and i always anticipate a call or message from her on my mobile.<br>But she doesn't sms or call me frequently and has not once msg me to ask me "how am i feeling etc.."<br>As you know, if you love someone and don't get much feedback from the person, it feels miserable.<br><br>So now, im confused. Could any kind soul(s) share his/her opinion with me?<br><br>I appreciate it. Thanks.</div></blockquote>Its hard to tell if the girl likes you or not, judging from what u have said here. But then again, since when has it been easy for people to tell if other people are interested in them or not. Coz people are always capable of giving mixed, or even wrong signals.<br><br>All I can suggest is go out with her more, get 2 know her better. Going out 1 to 1(1 on 1 sounds like u two going 2 fight <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) doesn't mean that she has that special feelings for u, but rather, that she likes you as a friend, and trust you enough to go out alone with u.<br><br>Your talk about anticipating of her phone call, sms etc seems to suggest that you hope that she takes some initatives too. Don't wait for her to approach u, but u go approach her instead. In the end, its all about taking initatives, and grabbing whatever chances you have. Don't be scared or worried that ur persisent wooing may scare her off, coz if she's really scared off by you, and tries to avoid u, at least u know she don't like you liao. Sms her, and see the type of reply she gives you. If its a short, few words answer, it will suggest that she do not have the time or energy to want to waste on you. Then u should get the hint.<br><br>All the best to you. Don't be like me, always waiting for others to take the initative, then in the end, nothing will ever happen. Life is not about leaving it to fate, but rather, seizing the chances that come your way, and making something happen out of it. Fate and destiny is make out of how you take ur chances, and not pre-destined.<br><br></div>
