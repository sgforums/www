              <p><br>both men and women should learn to care genuinely for each other unconditionally, if they wish to have a lasting r/s together. no gender should be given advantage, if true happiness is what both parties want. not enough couples can do that these days, hence the rising divorce rates. whenever there's problems in a r/s or marriage, either or both parties will take the easy way out and scram first. if couples can really be there for each other thru thick and thin, then no obstacles will be too tough to overcome.</p>

              <p>Many problems in our daily lives revolves around relationships

              people around you? And are people around you able to also give
              that? If everyone can do that, many of our life problems will be
              solved. :) "Love" simply means genuine care and concern for people,
              and doesn't just refer to romantic love. It could be family love,
              friendship type of love, love towards pets, etc.</p>

              <p>Actually, in our lives, we reap what we sow, whether we see the connection or not. The connection is often not obvious, and needs deep reflection to see/understand it.</p>
              <p>It's true that it's very difficult to give unconditional love in our modern day world, esp. in materialistic S'pore. And that's why many r/s cannot stand the test of time and difficulties. Not enough people can endure obstacles or difficult times with their partners, as they tend to think in terms of what are they getting in return (eg. affections, material stuff, time, marriage, stable home, stable income, etc). Many people lead their lives like running a business, with daily ROI (return on investment) and cost-benefit analysis being carried out. If ROI is low, or worse still negative, better leave this current partner and find another one who can offer high and positive ROI.</p>
              <p>If couples can truly love each other unconditionally, no matter how tough life may be, they will stick together and love each other, cos they really want the other party to feel good, instead of only caring for their own well-being.</p>
              <p>So, question is: what sort of person do we want to be? If we want to follow the crowd and just be another self-centred lover/bf/gf/spouse, then we need to be realistic and not expect lasting happiness in our lives, because life is not going to be smooth sailing all the time. If you've decided to be an unconditional lover/bf/gf, you'll have a much higher chance of attracting the same kind.</p>

              <p><br>Very well said. :)</p>
              <p>but of course, if the other party is obviously a selfish lover/bf/gf out to take advantage of people, then there's no reason to continue the r/s, unless the ideal situation happens, ie. the other party is able to be positively influenced by you and changes for the better. At the end of the day, we should aim to attract our own kind, so as multiply the effect of happiness and positivity, to spread the positive effect to others to help them.</p>
              <p>When 2 genuine people love and care for each other unconditionally, they'll naturally feel and experience happiness in their lives. Then they can have the strength and positivity to influence others to also be unconditional lovers like themselves, and eventually, we'll have a community of more caring people.</p>
              <p>Problem is, currently, the reverse happens, which is why we have a society of conditional lovers/bfs/gfs/spouses, and that effect is spreading all the time. But if we choose not to follow the crowd, as we believe in what's right and not what's popular, then we have a chance to find our own happiness. :)</p>

              <p>what if you give unconditional love, but the other person bites the 
              hand that feeds her/him ?   for this type of people, there is no point 
              continuing on the relationship, and keep giving because you are just 
              gonna drain yourself. </p>
              if you give unconditional love only the 
              person is good enough that you see meaning in keeping the relationship, 
              then it is not strictly unconditional, don't you agree ?
              <p><br> Very well said. :)</p>
              <p>but of course, if the other party is obviously a selfish
              lover/bf/gf out to take advantage of people, then there's no reason
              to continue the r/s, unless the ideal situation happens, ie. the
              other party is able to be positively influenced by you and
              changes for the better. At the end of the day, we should aim to
              attract our own kind, so as multiply the effect of happiness and
              positivity, to spread the positive effect to others to help
              them.</p>
              <p>When 2 genuine people love and care for each other
              unconditionally, they'll naturally feel and experience happiness in
              their lives. Then they can have the strength and positivity to
              influence others to also be unconditional lovers like themselves,
              and eventually, we'll have a community of more caring people.</p>
              <p>Problem is, currently, the reverse happens, which is why we have
              a society of conditional lovers/bfs/gfs/spouses, and that effect is
              spreading all the time. But if we choose not to follow the crowd,
              as we believe in what's right and not what's popular, then we have
              a chance to find our own happiness. :)</p>

              <p>I know it's not easy to tell the real nature of a person we care about. Giving unconditional love to a person who deserves love is still being unconditional, but it's not the same as hitting ourselves with a hammer non-stop, if you get what I mean. It's not easy to explain it all here on a forum, as it takes real-life experiences and practice. It's definitely not theory, unless we wish it to be.</p>
              <p>Like in my previous posts, it's about Law of Attraction. Like attracts like. When we decide to be unconditional lovers, we will somehow have a much higher chance of attracting similar kind, then we can be happy. There are other key factors that determine one's life journey, but it's not appropriate for me to explain it here, as that will involve people's belief system.</p>
              <p>If the other party is obviously a SOB, then just leave and find someone more deserving. It's not because we're not being unconditional so we leave, but because we are helping to reduce negativity in this world. By being miserable with an obviously selfish partner who has no intention to improve doesn't help anyone or the world. That person will eventually need to learn his/her life lessons. But if we can learn from it, and seek other parties who are also giving and seeking unconditional love, then the positivity will grow, spread and help others around you. That's the difference. :)</p>
