            <div class='col-md body'><br>I have gone through the frustrating period of trying to love somebody, and when it's not reciprocal, then I guess it's best to let it go. Instead, focus your attention on other things that is actually more fruitful. Please don't go into self pity mode, nobody is going to pity you and feeling sorry for yourself is one of the most wasteful ways to spend your life on. For me, I focus on my work and my partners, of course when you do work that you love, and you have alot of money and have a good future, women comes to you automatically. I'm sorry to be so crude but that's the reality sometimes, and when you are rich, then you have another problem, which is whether someone is truly sincered or after your money, that's why the best people I had in my life are those that stucked with me from the times I was poor. And may I suggest that if a girl choose money over you, then she is most probably not the kind of girl you deserved, it's better you know the truth now than somewhere into a marriage and she left you for the dollar sign.</div>

And also, they need not be that form of 'love' we commonly talk about in BGR...<br><br>Ultimately, she'll still have to decide for what she wants..

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with DailyFreeGames and Sakuraflower.<br><br>Apart from that, how long have you known this chinese lady for? Many relationships are a trade off. An exchange of what each has to offer. In her case, she could've had  love and comfort from you, but have chosen security and comfort provided by her current man.<br><br>Build your own life and they were right, with confidence and cash, plenty of women will kiss at your feet. Someone else will come along for you. Occupy yourself with sports, stay fit because it sharpens your mind and builds your level of confidence. Make new friends and move on because not even the greatest romantic affairs end in marriage and it isn't necessary for this to conclude in marriage. Even if you did end up with her, along with it comes a new set of troubles. How would you afford 2 extra mouths?<br><br>You may not like the idea of how sketchy standards such as wealth play a part when selecting life partners but prime examples are out there everyday. It's just the practical side of living.<br><br>Take this as a fleeting experience, people come and go in our lives, it's no big deal. Life is short, just enjoy yourself and date more of others.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>women are biologically hard-wired to seek out the mate who can best provide for them .... it's a truism of life ... people may perceive women from certain places to be more rapacious than others, but that's just because of the difference between the haves and the have-nots ....<br><br>singaporean women can afford to be "less" materialistic cos they are already materially well-off .... others are not there yet ....<br><br>but hey ! ... men can take heart in knowing that no matter how physically disgusting one looks, at long as you have the manna, you'll be able to find a mate ! ...<br><br></div>
