              <p>I'm in a very sticky sitution now and this is serious so please
              give me your sincere advice about this.</p>
              <p>I am 21 years old and freshly enrolled in a degree course where
              I saw this girl that I can't stop thinking about. But the problem
              is I am currently dating someone for quite a while and she is my
              first relationship. I feel guilty each time I think of the new girl
              but it is happening a lot now. I have a shy personality and at the
              same time a part of me tells me I should not try to pursue a new
              friendship with her that might lead to problems in the future. It
              has been three weeks till this date, but I have not tried to
              befriend her despite many encounters in and out of my school
              campus.</p>
              <p>I have been thinking of the things that could possibly happen
              after I took my first move to know this girl. Then I thought about
              my gf that I have spent many moments together and known inside out.
              She is much older than me and in many ways helped me back then when
              I was in NS. We often live together during weekends and I have met
              her parents whom I thought were quite fond of me. I'm also
              extremely moved by the fact that she has made sacrifices by moving
              from her hometown in Malaysia to live with me here. On the other
              hand, I find that she gambles too much, can be quite assertive at
              times and likes her own space. Also, I have a feeling that my
              parents aren't too keen on me dating her.Having said all that,
              there is still no doubt that I love her.</p>
              <p>From the bottom of my heart, I really would love to know the new
              girl for a start since we will probably be coursemates for the next
              couple of years. I also secretly wish she'd say that she is
              attached so we can have guilt free meetups and maybe get together
              to study. What's your take on this situation I'm facing?</p>

              <p>Guilt free meetups and study together ? Right ...</p>
              <p>If your girlfriend happened to do the same .. i'm sure you wouldn't be happy.</p>

              <p>I'd recommend you to go for that guy if you were that girl or go for that girl (if she's attached and you are attached).</p>
              <p>This would place both of you onto the same level of playing field.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, you are attached but probably she isn't; it's always wise to think with both your mind and your heart. You are rather young and being in love with someone and being together with someone for the rest of your life are 2 totally different scenarios. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
