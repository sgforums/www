              <p>I'm in a very sticky sitution now and this is serious so please give me your sincere advice about this.</p>
              <p>I
              am 21 years old and freshly enrolled in a degree course where I saw
              this girl that I can't stop thinking about. But the problem is I am
              currently dating someone for quite a while and she is my first
              relationship. I feel guilty each time I think of the new girl but it is
              happening a lot now. I have a shy personality and at the same time a
              part of me tells me I should not try to pursue a new friendship with
              her that might lead to problems in the future. It has been three weeks
              till this date, but I have not tried to befriend her despite many
              encounters in and out of my school campus.</p>
              <p>I have been thinking
              of the things that could possibly happen after I took my first move to
              know this girl. Then I thought about my gf that I have spent many
              moments together and known inside out. She is much older than me and in
              many ways helped me back then when I was in NS. We often live together
              during weekends and I have met her parents whom I thought were quite
              fond of me. I'm also extremely moved by the fact that she has made
              sacrifices by moving from her hometown in Malaysia to live with me
              here. On the other hand, I find that she gambles too much, can be quite
              assertive at times and likes her own space. Also, I have a feeling that
              my parents aren't too keen on me dating her.Having said all that, there
              is still no doubt that I love her.</p>
              <p>From the bottom of my heart,
              I really would love to know the new girl for a start since we will
              probably be coursemates for the next couple of years. I also secretly
              wish she'd say that she is attached so we can have guilt free meetups
              and maybe get together to study. What's your take on this situation I'm
              facing?</p>

              <p>Be honest . From the bottom of your heart, you do want to pursue that girl.</p>
              <p>Her being your coursemate is just a lame excuse to get to know her. Because I am pretty certain there's plenty of students in your class and you won't get to know everyone of them.</p>
              <p>The way you described your current relationship speak volumes. Your relationship with your current gf has become a chore. The reason why you are holding on to it, is merely a selfish act.</p>
              <p>Your heart has strayed.</p>
              <p>A distraction that girl has become. Distracting you from the one you claim to love, and the purpose of you attending the course.</p>

              <p>Don't use love as an excuse to hold your gf back. For in love, your heart will not stray, nor will you find excuses to get to know another lady.</p>
              <p>Let your gf find someone else who will not share his heart with more than one.</p>

              <p>A cycle you have yourself.</p>

              <p>A good age you have, at 21. Life is full of opportunities, but do not have it at the expense of another. A woman has a shelf life, waste not her precious youth on someone as unworthy as you.</p>
              <p>To pursue a fresh relationship, you need to free yourself of all burdens. Else you will only resent what you are unable to dislodge from your ankle.</p>

              <p>the best thing to do is to be honest to yourself. bgf is all about trying and testing, and since you have found someone more suitable, you switch.</p>
              <p>it is even worse if you hold on to your current relationship without any feelings and still thinking of that girl, unfair to all parties. better to move on</p>

              <p>I'm in a very sticky sitution now and this is serious so please
              give me your sincere advice about this.</p>
              <p>I am 21 years old and freshly enrolled in a degree course where
              I saw this girl that I can't stop thinking about. But the problem
              is I am currently dating someone for quite a while and she is my
              first relationship. I feel guilty each time I think of the new girl
              but it is happening a lot now. I have a shy personality and at the
              same time a part of me tells me I should not try to pursue a new
              friendship with her that might lead to problems in the future. It
              has been three weeks till this date, but I have not tried to
              befriend her despite many encounters in and out of my school
              campus.</p>
              <p>I have been thinking of the things that could possibly happen
              after I took my first move to know this girl. Then I thought about
              my gf that I have spent many moments together and known inside out.
              She is much older than me and in many ways helped me back then when
              I was in NS. We often live together during weekends and I have met
              her parents whom I thought were quite fond of me. I'm also
              extremely moved by the fact that she has made sacrifices by moving
              from her hometown in Malaysia to live with me here. On the other
              hand, I find that she gambles too much, can be quite assertive at
              times and likes her own space. Also, I have a feeling that my
              parents aren't too keen on me dating her.Having said all that,
              there is still no doubt that I love her.</p>
              <p>From the bottom of my heart, I really would love to know the new
              girl for a start since we will probably be coursemates for the next
              couple of years. I also secretly wish she'd say that she is
              attached so we can have guilt free meetups and maybe get together
              to study. What's your take on this situation I'm facing?</p>

              <p>Every single person has their strengths and weaknesses. Gambling is a bad thing, but do not use that as an excuse to ditch your gf.</p>
              <p>B/G relationships is more about commitment rather than just purely love. If you are not committed to a relationship, than there should be no reason for you to be in one.</p>
              <p>Some of the forummers here said something along the line of "following your heart", but I will like to ask them, is that the right thing to do? That will only be lusting, and whenever you see a girl even more beautiful and attractive, your attention will be diverted towards that girl.</p>
              <p>The reason why there are so many divorces and breakups nowadays is because the current generation only think about themselves and their hearts, everything else is not as important to them. The biggest question is, is it a torture or does it hurt to stay with your current half?</p>
              <p>A relationship is about how much you can give, not how much you can receive. Many people seem to not realise this simple fact.</p>
