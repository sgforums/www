            <div class='col-md body'>Few months ago. i got to know this waitress in a club by ordering a Brandy Dry(she introduced that to me).<br>An interval of one month, i went back there and saw her. I asked of she remembered me....she did! She told me what i've ordered.<br><br>Hey Brown, i think it's a matter of honoring your compliments and leave it alone. Or you could get to know her(yeah Friends)....hopefully you won't think so much about crossing the line. Just move with the flow, if it doesn't flow...then leave it alone.<br><br>My first personal note to you. Hope it make sense.<br></div>
