If that's the case, its v childish. However, if they pit themselves against one another with their own special talent to impress the gal they like, i dont see anything wrong with it. I also get that sometimes, sms halfway then she stops replying you. This confuses you sometimes, since you dont know whether she likes you or not. Actually you can ask some of ur friends whom is close to her. Then you ask them a favour to help you check her out her feelings for you, without her knowing ur intentions.

            <div class='col-md body'>Your case similar to my many years back.<br>Two good friends fall for same girl, one back off, thinking its for the good of everyone.<br><br>But, are u really sure that's for the good of her? Who knows, u could be the one that could be the best thing that ever happen in her life, but because u decide to back off, you will never know the answer?<br><br>Last time, i back off, thinking he will treat her right. Turns out I was wrong. He was abusive in the relationship, and even flirted with other girls in her presence. In the end, they broke off, and she told me that had I been a little braver many years back, she would have been with me.<br><br>So, don't think that your friend is the better one, or he could give her what she wants. Think about what YOU can give to her, and fight for it. Don't let fate dictate what u do, but rather, fate can be dictated by you.<br><br>Hope it helps.</div>
