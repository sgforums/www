(ie. chat online often, chat on the phone, share common interests and hobbies.)<br><br>let me ask you: don't you get along very well with your male buddies as well? so why can't there be the same thing for girls? and NO ONE said that if a girl gets along with you, it means that she is interested in you.<br><br>please understand that it is perfectly normal for a girl to have male buddies. until the day you understand this, you will never be able to get out of this abyss.<br><br>and you're wondering why you can get away by calling her 'dear'.<br><br>my question for you is: are you doing anything with her that can define you as 'lovers'? or are the both of you just carrying on life like nothing has happened, except for the fact that you can call her 'dear'?<br><br>if your answer is the second, then it simply means that you're thinking too much.<br><br>and you're only trying to cheat yourself that you stand a chance with her. if not, you wouldn't have bothered to bring out all those facts (ie. chat sessions over the phone, common interests, etc.) to support yourself.<br><br>find another girl, brother. why waste your time with a girl that doesn't appreciate you? there are so many girls out there! i don't believe that she's so unique that no one can match her.<br><br>of course, you can choose to treat whatever i've said as pure rubbish and continue to worship her.<br><br>the choice is yours <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
