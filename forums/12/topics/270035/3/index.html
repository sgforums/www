I don't think the bf is gonna change overnight just to suit TS. Simple solution is for them to break up TS's bf can find one that will listen to his lamentations and don't need to 'dong bu dong' stand up for her for such trivial matter and TS herself can find a new guy who will not whine and will jump to her defense at the snap of her finger.

Seems to me like TS is not happy with the way her bf was and seems to me TS is hoping she could change her bf's attitude. I don't think the bf is gonna change overnight just to suit TS. Simple solution is for them to break up TS's bf can find one that will listen to his lamentations and don't need to 'dong bu dong' stand up for her for such trivial matter and TS herself can find a new guy who will not whine and will jump to her defense at the snap of her finger.
