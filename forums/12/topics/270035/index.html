            <div class='col-md body'>yesterday went out with my bf and our friends. one of them brought his gf who happens to be pretty unpopular.  as the night unfolds it was pretty obvious why no one talks to  her.<br><br>she was like passing negative remarks on me, then i agree.  but she still repeats and repeat despite i agreed and agreed.  after i thought i had enough, i just walked away to joined another group.  Guess what, she followed me and make sure that she keeps passing those nasty remarks.<br><br>i was so mad, and hurt too. when i complained to everyone, everyone told me she is like that, thats why no one wants to talk to her.<br><br>but what puzzled me most was, my bf, who is very protective over his friends and family, just said "no lah, you are not wat she said. ignore her"<br><br>not that im expectin my bf to scold her or wat, but i juz cant understand why he, who is always so protective of everyone around him, reacted that way when someone bully me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">    to note that he always stand up for justice, and ever 'chu tou' for one of my friends when another person's gf bullied her.  why as a gf, i become at the disadvantaged end?</div>

Then address the whole group and let her complain to the whole group. Start a conversation with another person. Or some times these people need some compliments loh. You can throw her some compliments and let her be happy.  BTW, weather is either sunny or rainy - so its not good diversion and too short to really get her mind off the cyclical complains. And The Single most easiest way to get her to stop negative talk is to ask her to talk about herself.<br><br>But anyways, you were unhappy about your BF not defending you and saving you from that girl. Maybe he thought that you were doing fine and its just the complains.  Then again you can always take it that you are doing a good deed to let her rant and you are helping her get something off their chest. Some folks need that. For example and this is real: My office colleague needed to back stab me before she feed secure in her position. I let her do it because I know she will constantly get me into trouble if she does not stab viciously me a couple of time first to get over her insecurity.<br><br></div>

Guess what, she followed me and make sure that she keeps passing those nasty remarks.<br><br>i was so mad, and hurt too. when i complained to everyone, everyone told me she is like that, thats why no one wants to talk to her.<br><br>but what puzzled me most was, my bf, who is very protective over his friends and family, just said "no lah, you are not wat she said. ignore her"<br><br>not that im expectin my bf to scold her or wat, but i juz cant understand why he, who is always so protective of everyone around him, reacted that way when someone bully me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">    to note that he always stand up for justice, and ever 'chu tou' for one of my friends when another person's gf bullied her.  why as a gf, i become at the disadvantaged end?  </div></blockquote>first you must understand why she kept making negative remarks at me.<br>She wants attentation and you are the only one agreeing with her.<br>Next time totally ignore her, totally hack care about her. If she speak to you just speak to someone else instead.<br><br>Her idea is to talk to someone, deny her this very chance and she got nothing to say.Imagine if your bf acts hero and scold her in front of everyone and she can act victim about it and be the centre of attraction. Thats what she wants, she is smart to keep pushing you in order for you to attack back so that she got things to say. Do not fall in her trap.<br><br></div>

Base on your previous post you too have given me the impression that you are one that never back down in a situation and always stand her ground. So, is there a reason for your bf to stand out for you now knowing you can easily handle yourself - tough! And seems to me like now all of a sudden you are acting the damsel in distress. Why the sudden change?</div>

In the same way a healthy strong self-image does not feel itself threatened by any offhand remark.<br>When a person has adequate self-esteem, little slights offer NO threat at all and they are simply passed over and ignored.<br><br>Be bigger than such things.
