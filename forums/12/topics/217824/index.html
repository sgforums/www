Did they ever care about how the girl will feel? Do they know they hurt the girl heart? Why guys give up on one relationship so easily? Why guys can start another relationship so fast?<br><br>Anybody can help me? I feeling like dying.......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Thank you</div></blockquote>ErrrÂ…. It might give u a bit of comfort to know that when he say "Got, sleeping now" it may not mean that he and the gal are sleeping together nowÂ… it means he is going to sleep nowÂ….<br><br>HoweverÂ… the purpose of this thread is to help you get over him right? so here's my advice on what u should do.<br><br>1) some of my friends when they broke up, they say "I'm letting go, trying to heal, but who knows he might come back to me..." pls know that that is not letting go. that is still holding on. You have to make up your mind. know that there is now 0% possibilities of you two getting together again.<br><br>2) throw away, or hide away all the little things that will remind you of the good times... i know it is impossible to hide everything, but i'm just talking about the small but powerful stuff like, the ring he bought you, the happy photos you two have taken, etc. u do not have to throw away, just keep it so u do not have to see it.<br><br>3) busy yourself. fill your life with activities, go out with your friends, take up a sports, surround yourself with ppl who loves you.<br><br>4) everytime you start to think "hmm... we used to..." "hmmm... that's where we..." " what's he doing now..." distract yourself. don't linger in the past. focus on the future.<br><br>5) pamper yourself. you deserve it. if you wanna go for a short trip, go for it.<br><br>6) be patient. getting over someone is not easy. it is not instant. you have to be patient, resist all urge to call/sms/contact him. you have to be disciplined.<br><br>and lastly. let others help you. let them cheer you up. take care.... you can PM me if you just like to talk to someone.</div>

Better to break up now, than to divorce if he gets tired of you already after you got married rite?<br><br>Chin up, gal.  You're still young.  Sure can find someone who treasures you!</div>

I can tell you, your pain will not be healed ASAP, but rather gradually. You do not put a plaster over a deep cut just like that right? You have to use antiseptic, sew back the wound, put plaster and bandage over it for full recovery.<br><br>The initial days are very hard for you, which is why you need company to help you tide over this trying period. Get your close friends, family or even your stuff toys, cry, sleep, or whatever you can think of.<br><br>If you think this is also a good way, you can rant here all you want till it goes away.<br><br>Beers!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gal... Dun be sad... Move on in your life.. Guys changes very fast... If a guy had changed, they would not go back to the original him.. Which means that, once they had decided to break with you, they would nv have the thought of patching back.. To you, you had wanted most to patch back.. BUt to guys, they would nv let it happened... Patching back is just another chance for the guy to hurt you once more, please do not let this happen.. It would hurt yourself even more. If a guy breaks up with you because of another gal, that means that he is not worth your love.. As if he really loves you, he would not one leg step on 2 boat...<br><br>Doing silly things does not turn the time back to the past... Carry on... You would surely find a guy that is worth of your love.. But Surely Not the guy that one leg step on 2 boat...<br><br>As you go along, you would see more people, experience the outer world, getting to know more people at a later time, at this time, you can find a guy tt is worth your love and he will loves you too... It is just a matter of time.. Maybe take this relationship as an experience, having to let u see different types of guys that would or might appear in your life...<br><br>But i believe that no matter what happens, your friends will always be with you, caring and concerning about you... So no matter what, if you have any burdens or problems, find a friend to talk to... I believe that your friend would be more than willing to be a listener and give you some advice...<br><br>Jia You gal...
