Patching back is just another chance for the guy to hurt you once more, please do not let this happen.. It would hurt yourself even more.

You have been together for more than 3 years now. Its a shame and a lie if that guy do not love you anymore. In my heart, i strongly believe he still loves you.<br><br>Why did he break up with you then if you may ask? simple, he found a new gal. Its typical for someone to break up easily when they got a new partner. This is the case for your ex. But trust me, when he is alone, he will still think about you and remember all the good times you both had. im sure you do not want him to forget you right? well, in short, im sure he wont.<br><br>But of course, i also have to say, is this the kind of guy you want? someone who call you names and break up with you over a new gal? trust me when i say this. When he has problems with that gal, the first thing he would do is to call you.<br><br>do you want a guy who takes you for granted? human nature is like that. they tend to overlook the diamond in his life for something which he thinks is much more worth outside.<br><br>so, think about it. 3 years is a long time. you can still wait and try to salvage the relationship cos i believe his love to u is still there.<br><br>but are you prepared to be hurt over and over again in the future? or be hurt now and in the future u can think back and laugh about it?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>be strong...</div></blockquote>Halo, u believe he still like me. Cannot be loh, see how he reply my msg, i know he hated me so much and do not want to see me again. Haha, he will call me when he have problem with that gal, very hard loh. Talk to me he already dun dare liao. now we only sms each other. not even call. i called him, he just hang up my phone call loh. haha. i wanted a guy to treat me good as what i have done to him. treat him damn good loh. hai. just like that end our relationship. maybe he already dun love me liao ba, guy can change his heart so easily and fast. if he still love me why break up leh. haha. true also, although i wanted to patch back with him, but also scare he will do it again to me. hai. very mao dun. heehee.</div>
