If he loves you, why must he say you ugly and call u pig.... Maybe u say u are not those pretty gals, but beauty is from inner not outer... outer will not last forever... But inner like kind, love, care will last forever and ever..<br><br>Try to go out with friends whom they no need to accompany or have no bf de... I am sure that not all ur friends have bf, right? you can get them to accompany you...

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow.. this is very sad.<br><br>Ok la, on the positive side, maybe he does have feelings for you still. You have been together for more than 3 years now. Its a shame and a lie if that guy do not love you anymore. In my heart, i strongly believe he still loves you.<br><br>Why did he break up with you then if you may ask? simple, he found a new gal. Its typical for someone to break up easily when they got a new partner. This is the case for your ex. But trust me, when he is alone, he will still think about you and remember all the good times you both had. im sure you do not want him to forget you right? well, in short, im sure he wont.<br><br>But of course, i also have to say, is this the kind of guy you want? someone who call you names and break up with you over a new gal? trust me when i say this. When he has problems with that gal, the first thing he would do is to call you.<br><br>do you want a guy who takes you for granted? human nature is like that. they tend to overlook the diamond in his life for something which he thinks is much more worth outside.<br><br>so, think about it. 3 years is a long time. you can still wait and try to salvage the relationship cos i believe his love to u is still there.<br><br>but are you prepared to be hurt over and over again in the future? or be hurt now and in the future u can think back and laugh about it?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>be strong...</div>
