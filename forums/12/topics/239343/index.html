            <div class='col-md body'>i am not going to spam those lame crap like, dude, go for it, it will be unexpected, what if that friend of yours, just treat you a very good friend, who doesn't have any feeling for you at all, and you might end up without a girlfriend, this is not channel 8 lame chinese drama, (lame ending), life is just darn not fair, u met this girl, and feel she is just alright, but when she is your girl, you get to see the 'other' side of her, so.... and you miss out of this chance, move on</div>
