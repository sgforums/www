              <p>what do u mean by it over? are u saying that u already know that
              she likes u too, or dont like u? if what u said is really true.
              then theres only 3 possible reasons that i can think of for her
              recent frownings when u see her.</p>
              <p>1) She's really in a bad mood.</p>
              <p>2)She is frustrated that u are not "man" enough to take the
              initiative to talk to her.</p>
              <p>3)She doesnt like u and dont want to send the wrong signals to
              u.</p>

              <p>im not sure how she will react because I didnt talk to her in a long time and she often frown. im not sure about those 3 reason u said but i think im getting ahead of myself of thinking that she likes me. but i know one thing, i know she knows that i like her. Thats what i mean by over but I dont wanna make a relanstionship with her i just wanna hang out with her. now im really got this worried feeling. i wish u all know how i feel. this kind of scared feeling of talking to a girl who knows that u like her</p>

              <p>First the TS says he thinks he likes her. Then now he is scared
                  of her. Hey brudder, wake up your idea! If you like her then go for
                  it! You wouldn't know what can happen unless you try. Why? Scared
                  of rejection ah?</p>

              <p>its not rejection im afraid. Its herself. you see we keep on ignoring

              <p>Really? You are not afraid of rejection? I don't get you. ok so what if she likes you? That's the point isn't it? so what? so what if the whole building knows you like her? Im not trying to put you down but I feel you are not confident in yourself. Seriously, in my humble opinion, that is a turn off to girls. Either you get her or you don't. Stop hanging around and hoping for things to happen. Stop wishing. Make things happen. If they don't, so be it. Remember, you don't need a girl's approval to feel validated. Come from a position of offering value, not hoping she will come and fill your empty cup.</p>
              <p>ok, having said that, next time see her, look her in the eyes and smile with your heart. Say something, anything.</p>
