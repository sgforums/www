              <p>ok this is my first post here but I just need some strong advice from you all. please help me. Don't joke/insult here please because im really indeed need help</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see, i work in the same company as this girl I like since few months back. Whenever we walk pass by, We both never say "hi" to each other or even wave to each other....just a few second staring but thats all. Out of all the staff here, she's the only one that i've never talk to before except when she got a problem on her PC and I came down to help her. oh ya i work as a desktop support.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its been months that I'm dying to hang out or talk to her but something always holding me back. I'm really scared of approaching her. Of course, many peoples said to me "have some balls and courage to go talk to her". But they sound it so easy because to that girl is normal to them....but to me, its special.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">[NOTE: this paragraph is mainly for girls to help]</span>Call me <span style="color: #333333;">crazy</span> or a fool out of myself but I really got this feeling that she likes me too. here's one of the three reason that my friend said of how to know if a girl likes you:</p>
              <p>1. If she looks at you and when you look back, she quickly darted away from you as quickly as possible. Or she smiles when she look at you.</p>
              <p>2. She laughs everything at you said even when you're not joking.</p>
              <p>3. She tugs her clothes when she near you or act abit funny.</p>
              <p>^ this is the three reason that my friend said so girls, if you really disagree about this then please tell me and tell me what are the signs when a girl likes you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok guys, i'm really hate this loving feeling. I'm can't hold on anymore as if i feel like straight away ask her out. but the problem is that I can't because im just a useless shy boy towards her BUT only her. the rest of females here, i'm doing just smooth. But at the same time, When we two ignore each other....I got the feeling she hates me.</p>
              <p>So please help me and dont flame me please....</p>

              <p>go for it la... just go over or msn her to see if she wants to hang out with you... maybe message her lor... saying.. I know it is kind of abrupt to message you like this, but i was wondering if we could hang out after work one day after work, maybe for a dinner or a movie. Just want to know you more as a friend.</p>
              <p>If she ignores, then so be it lor... just say oh ok.. no problem.. perhaps next time and then you should get the meaning la. This can means she is not interested at all, or maybe she is just as shy and feels pai seh to go out with you even though she wants to. She might even be just testing you to see if ya are sincere. So if she rejects you, you might just want to stay away or build on your relationship with her in the office first. When you two are having closer working relationship in the office, then you might want to jio her out again.</p>
              <p>But if you ask her out the first time and she says ok. Then you are in for the time of your life. The first impression is important so dont be shy. Also dont be kan jiong to keep wanting her to be ya girlfriend. Go slow and understand her more, as she may have a bf already or may not be ya type exactly.</p>
              <p>So my point here is no pain no gain. You got to do what you got to do. So just go and ask her out. No worries, be a man!!</p>

              <p>after a few months? its never too late though. i've encountered the same situation more or less like u.</p>
              <p>my advice to u is to go for it and talk to her. start by greeting her in the morning, say hi or good morning, u wont lose ur voice.</p>
              <p><strong>DO NOT EVER IGNORE HER </strong>or <strong>ACT UNINTERESTED</strong>, girls will not find that "cool" or "attractive", they will think that u are just acting in front of them.</p>
              <p>like one of the forumers here who said before, some girls would rather die than take the initiative to talk to u, especially those super shy kind type.</p>
              <p>so if u are really really interested in her, please start talking to her, i hope its not too late for u now!</p>

              <p>hey, the reason why u shy ard her is because u like her/ u think she likes u, right?</p>
              <p>so, just take away the notion that she likes u too for that MOMENT. then it'll be smooth already, by logic, no? </p>

              <p>ok this is my first post here but I just need some strong advice from you all. please help me. Don't joke/insult here please because im really indeed need help</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see, i work in the same company as this girl I like since few months back. Whenever we walk pass by, We both never say "hi" to each other or even wave to each other....just a few second staring but thats all. Out of all the staff here, she's the only one that i've never talk to before except when she got a problem on her PC and I came down to help her. oh ya i work as a desktop support.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its been months that I'm dying to hang out or talk to her but something always holding me back. I'm really scared of approaching her. Of course, many peoples said to me "have some balls and courage to go talk to her". But they sound it so easy because to that girl is normal to them....but to me, its special.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">[NOTE: this paragraph is mainly for girls to help]</span>Call me <span style="color: #333333;">crazy</span> or a fool out of myself but I really got this feeling that she likes me too. here's one of the three reason that my friend said of how to know if a girl likes you:</p>
              <p>1. If she looks at you and when you look back, she quickly darted away from you as quickly as possible. Or she smiles when she look at you.</p>
              <p>2. She laughs everything at you said even when you're not joking.</p>
              <p>3. She tugs her clothes when she near you or act abit funny.</p>
              <p>^ this is the three reason that my friend said so girls, if you really disagree about this then please tell me and tell me what are the signs when a girl likes you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok guys, i'm really hate this loving feeling. I'm can't hold on anymore as if i feel like straight away ask her out. but the problem is that I can't because im just a useless shy boy towards her BUT only her. the rest of females here, i'm doing just smooth. But at the same time, When we two ignore each other....I got the feeling she hates me.</p>
              <p>So please help me and dont flame me please....</p>

              <p><br>I think she's not interested in you at all...especially when your friends kept asking you to talk to her.</p>
              <p>You see, do you really think all your friends really would like to see you succeed in your this "office romance"?</p>
              <p>Most likely, they are all preparing themselves for a good show when you fail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will all your office friends feel inadequate and inferior and incapable if you really succeed?</p>
              <p>Besides, if the girl is really that great and lovely, why didn't your friends go after her instead?</p>
              <p>Truly there is a trap waiting for you to step upon.</p>
