              <p>if u are still really interested in her, its never too late, trust me. u'll never know until u try. start greeting her tmr morning when u see her. if u happen to chance upon her and her back is facing u, give her a pat on the shoulders and say good morning or hi with a smile, then just walk away. say hi everytime u meet her until u feel confident enough to approach her and talk. u said u repaired her comp before right? maybe u can ask her "is ur comp still working smoothly after i fixed it for u the last time?"</p>

              <p>nice ideas kuehtutu but i dun think its a good idea to approach her from behind and patting her shoulders... she might feel uncomfortable and freaked out especially in a first encounter</p>
              <p>try starting with interesting / nt corny small talks everyday or every 2 days and remember to smile... and dun linger too long around her... style ur hair, look nice, most importantly haf to smell nice by wearing a drop of nice cologne/perfume to leave urself a good impression on her</p>
              <p>when you feel comfortable with her already can try to ask her for group gatherings,</p>

              <p>1. Realize and understand WHERE your fear stems from, and you will be able to find the solution.</p>
              <p>Analyzing your post, your fears are common. They are:-</p>
              <p>a. Fear of rejection</p>
              <p>Everyone hates to be rejected and it makes them feel foolish. It is not a nice feeling, but once rejected, you will never what to be put through such feelings again. Yet you hunger and yearn for love, someone to hold and cherish..</p>
              <p>b. Fear of criticism from peers.</p>
              <p>Being rejected, although hard, one can still live with in because it is personal. But if your peers, friends and espacially office collegues got to know of it, you will feel that they are laughing behind your back. Every snigger, every whisper becomes a joke about you when it is not even true. Your become presumptous and allow such feelings to take control over you.</p>
              <p>The only solution for you:-</p>
              <p>a. Singapore women are still conservative. Do not expect them to be so daring as to approach you first. They too have a sense of pride built from tradition, something that is not going to change for more years to come. Thus you have to approach them first, come what may.</p>
              <p>b. Women, if they ever approach a guy first, will be those that meet with their ideals - dashing, courages, confident, etc - people whom they have regular contact thru the media such as singers, actors, writers, celebrities, politicians, etc, even though such famous people may not sincerly care about them but see them as dollars or power to be gain. Women too have hopes and ambitions.</p>
              <p>But they will not know who you are and where you are comming from, and what are your character traits. Therefore you must let them get to know you, not by showing off yourself and make a mockery of yourself, but being friend to her first. You need to be confident, and making the first move is a sign of confidence.</p>
              <p>Women prefer confident men, otherwise how else are they going to depend on him for friendship and if chance permits- marriage partners? Who wants to marry or befriend a loser, a complainer, a whiner?</p>
              <p>Therefore, if you truly like the girl, make the first move, befriend her, have small talk with her and let her get to know you. THere is nothing wrong in being friends, even if they are married, so long as you know the limits.</p>
              <p>REMEMBER - friends first, and no one will laugh at you. Unless you make a fool out of yourself and buy her flowers and rings immediately in the hope to bed her quick, then you would be laughed at. She is a lady and not some women of the night, so treat her respect first.</p>
              <p>Be confident and frankly, you dont need much confidence to be friends with others, unless you have an ulterior motive, then you will be shaking with fear that you may be found out.</p>

              <p>1) She's really in a bad mood.</p>
              <p>2)She is frustrated that u are not "man" enough to take the initiative to talk to her.</p>
