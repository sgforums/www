              <p>but i want to talk to her that is not job related.</p>
              <p>The good thing is, that she is really attractive. But When i did some troubleshooting on her PC at that time, her CPU is below her desk and I didnt notice the cable network was unplugged. So i ducked under the table and went to plug it in again. But what i didnt expect that she didnt budge at all. She just remains there and when I was about to get up I accidentaly took a peek of her bare thighs. I panicked and bang the table with my head. I blushed when she approaches to me saying "oh my god, u okay?".</p>
              <p>Now my main problem is to stop thinking of her body especially below the neck line when I talk to her. okok this lead to another topic so its ok if u guys want to stop here, nvm i try to figure this one out </p>

              to each other or even wave to each other....just a few second
              staring but thats all. Out of all the staff here, she's the only
              one that i've never talk to before except when she got a problem on
              her PC and I came down to help her. oh ya i work as a desktop
              support.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its been months that I'm dying to hang out or talk to her but
              something always holding me back. I'm really scared of approaching
              her. Of course, many peoples said to me "have some balls and
              courage to go talk to her". But they sound it so easy because to
              that girl is normal to them....but to me, its special.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">[NOTE: this paragraph is mainly
              for girls to help]</span>Call me <span style="color: #333333;">crazy</span> or a fool out of myself but I really
              got this feeling that she likes me too. here's one of the three
              reason that my friend said of how to know if a girl likes you:</p>
              <p>1. If she looks at you and when you look back, she quickly
              darted away from you as quickly as possible. Or she smiles when she
              look at you.</p>
              <p>2. She laughs everything at you said even when you're not
              joking.</p>
              <p>3. She tugs her clothes when she near you or act abit funny.</p>
              <p>^ this is the three reason that my friend said so girls, if you
              really disagree about this then please tell me and tell me what are
              the signs when a girl likes you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok guys, i'm really hate this loving feeling. I'm can't hold on
              anymore as if i feel like straight away ask her out. but the
              problem is that I can't because im just a useless shy boy towards
              her BUT only her. the rest of females here, i'm doing just smooth.
              But at the same time, When we two ignore each other....I got the
              feeling she hates me.</p>
              <p>So please help me and dont flame me please....</p>

              <p>this is getting confusing le</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i thought it went fine with me and her talking to each other. But this past few days, we ignore each other again. Ya, i said to her a few hi here and there. And she said hi to me too. She talk to me and i talk to her back as casual. but what the hell la these past few days, we ignore each other again. This is getting weirder. She made an initial talk to me and I made an initial talk to her too last week and i thought im getting a hang of this but we both ignore each other again when we bypass</p>
              <p>i feel like raping her just like kengkia said (of course its a JOKE la duh) but its so frustrating. seriously</p>

              <p>at least she made an intial talk to u appreciate her effort in doing so. anyways when u walk pass each other u dont necessarily have to talk, just smile at her. anyways dont forget that <strong>U ARE ONE whos interested in her NOT the other way round</strong>, so let go of ur ego and make sure u take the initiative everytime, if she likes u back she will respond well, if not she wouldnt care less about why u didnt say hi.</p>
