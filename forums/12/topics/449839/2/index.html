              <p>craving is having never endless aims or desires. I want to be rich, I want to be strong, handsome, pretty, popular, intelligent etc.</p>

              <p>Dont be so hard on yourself. Do you always have the drive to be a greater than your friends? If you want success, get a challenging job instead and rise through the challenges and you will get noticed. You might be suffering from inferiority complex, perhaps. Be patient and give yourself time to learn, grow and succeed. Who knows, one day you could prove others wrong you know. So be happy,  and live life to the fullest!</p>

              <p>Hey bro, 2 cents worth here.</p>
              <p>To begin, I like your attitude - because the winners think
              differently which explains why 0.15% of global population owns 39%
              of global wealth. If you choose to live above the line, a cut above
              the rest, no one can say anything about you - because it is your
              life, our one life - we do what we want.</p>
              <p>It's great to have big dreams for a couple of reasons. 1st when
              obstacles come between you and your dreams, if your dream is bigger
              than your obstacle, you'll overcome and achieve or like majority of
              the population, are we going to turn around just because an
              obstacle surfaced. 2nd, having big dreams is an attitude, that
              shows you're not just living on this planet for yourself. (The lui
              gong we tong when sch children approach us, doesn't really count
              anymore since its more like on-the-way thing.) Feel the sense of
              fulfillment when we contribute to the people around us.</p>
              <p>All right, long story short, however, whatever you do bro. Enjoy
              it, be present, be at that moment. Love what you do and embrace
              every single experience. If you're studying - concentrate and study
              - not think about weekends or girls, or lunch. You need to seperate
              very clearly, having goals is different from whether or not you're
              living in the present. For eg. To achieve big goals, there must be
              small steps, and thus micro-steps. Give your full attention to
              these micro-steps, same as give your soulmate, your partners full
              attention when they speak. =)</p>
              <p>(Sry if it's a little long, hope I helped and contribute to
              everyone.)</p>

              <p>I heart your post. Totally agree with you. I am the kind of person who dwells on the past and the future, never the present. But life taught me otherwise and I got a tight slap in the face.</p>
              <p>Always live in the present moment. Sure, it is our lives, we are the CREATORS of our own life and destiny. Go ahead, make it grand, or simple, whichever way you want it to be. Make plans. But don't dwell, don't hold on so tightly. The key is to let go and TRUST. Just do your best at every moment. When you have make the plans to pursue your dreams, all you need to do is be present and enjoy each moment you take. That is LIFE. Peace to all~</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">I have a problem
              which I hope I can get some suggestions here. I recently grad from
              college and managed to score a 2<sup>nd</sup> upper hons. But the
              moment of happiness lasted only a day or so. After that, I started
              comparing myself with others and set a milestones of goals in the
              next 10-20 years. I know its good to plan for the future but it
              seems that I have always lived in the future. I am just not living
              in the moment.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Whenever Im with my
              friends, I think of what else I can accomplish few years down the
              road. Whatever I do now, I think of how it impacts me in the
              long-term. Every minute is creeping away if I don’t take advantage
              of it. Sometimes it seems like Im hurrying to go accomplish the
              most I can and after that die asap. It seems Im forever not
              contented with what I have at all. There’s always more to pursue. I
              don’t know when I will be contented.</span></p>

              <p>Err I don't see a problem with yr attitude</p>
              <p>You have the right attitude. If you don't work for the future now when you're young, you're just wasting your life. </p>
              <p>Life is like walking against a travellator going in the opposite direction. You can only move forward. If you even stop for the moment (live for the moment), it will bring you backwards.  </p>

              <p>he has wrong method only.its best use 3 back up plans to life than a travellator.differnt ways to go than using a travellator which has only one direction.pretty much like comparing a fixed turret tank and a rotating turret tank.</p>
              <p>a travellator is one way .walking is another way.taking a buggy is also another way.its the method he intends to use to get from point a to point b in life.however a travellator only is good and efficient if its walking in direction of flow.walkinbg is flexible as u can go oin both directions although u might use a bit of strength.....buggy is simplest and uses less strength and gets to anywhere anytime u want.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>first question is are you walking against a travellTOR?if so..stop it and hop out it.take control of your life and get to destination like a normal human.do not try to go against what is not considered natural to most humans on this planet.you will have it rough and do more work in the end just to reach point b which is considered not only inefficient and a waste of resource and energy.</p>
              <p>think i should like go purchase my online degree in oz....dunno which is cheepest around here..i only want to attend like 1 class in a month and get my degree in 2 years.i got other things to do for rest of the time.</p>

              <p>Dont be so hard on yourself. Do you always have the drive to be a greater than your friends? If you want success, get a challenging job instead and rise through the challenges and you will get noticed. You might be suffering from inferiority complex, perhaps. Be patient and give yourself time to learn, grow and succeed. Who knows, one day you could prove others wrong you know. So be happy,  and live life to the fullest!</p>
