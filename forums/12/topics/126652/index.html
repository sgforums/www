Perhaps she may have hidden qualities that might attract you to be a partner later.<br><br>If you decide, however that you do not want to waste the poor girl's time waiting for you, better break it gently to her. It is never easy for a guy to reject a girl (unless he's an unmitigated jerk), but do it gently and sincerely. Even if you still end up hurting her initially, it is better for her in the long run.</div>

She is gorgeous, just "not your type", right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>A girl wouldn't be interested in a guy if she thought he was a loser.
