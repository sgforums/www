            <div class='col-md body'>just for the record, i started this thread. i just wanna say that <strong>stqwerty is a big biatchh!!! </strong>any1 here who thinks so too gimme a hell yeah! ok, now back to my topic... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>dun any of u guys feel that someone in your life is draining you of your energy? i read somewhere that we are mainly made up of this energy which controls our emotion, from depress to energetic. it is visible as an aura which gives various colours to the trained eye only. maybe you've heard of it.<br><br>When we dun get enough rest or are stressed, we comment on how drained we feel; how depleted and weakened. most ppl simply dun really think about what they are saying. its become common parlance and we take these sayings for granted.<br><br>and get this. it is actually common to be in the presence of someone that can actually drains you or your energy. they're really what this authour calls, the <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">unconscious psychic vampires </span></strong>which is too exaggerated for such a name. these unconscious psy-vamps are really very common, they are among us. they could be ur friends, colleagues, classmates or even urself. only they do not realise that they are doing it. they feed on ur energy somehow and they themselves can't control or stop it. the ones who do knew of this energy, and do it on purpose are not as common. i dunno whether to call it rare. but if u do know of any person that seem to drains you of your life force or whatever, it is better u dun touch him/her and dun engage in an in-depth conversation.<br><br>now i know why everyone likes sex. sex is an activity which produces a lot of this energy, and both parties exchange this energy and at the same time gain from it. hmmm. what do u actually gain from this energy?<br><br>this is really gonna sounds like an rpg game but its interesting. this energy increases ur magickal power (our spiritual power, if we even had any) and sensitivity, makes one feel more enrgetic, and also adds to vitality. some of the opinions even mentioned immortality.<br><br>some of u might want to believe it, others might want to dismiss it and just lead their simple life from here. thing is, from experience i just know that this thing called aura exists in all of living things and the enrgy is free for the taking. if we are well trained we can manipulate these abundant energy from our surrounding and use it to our advantage.<br><br>ur talking or whining about how moody or depressed you felt about a girlfriend, relationship, love problems and all that. you're just scratching the surface. we can manipulate emotions and energy at our own will. we dun need to feel trapped in any bad days or situations or even love triangles, all we could have ever wanted is this raw and simple energy to keep us going in life.<br><br>if i had just one wish, i just wish to feed on all this positive energy for myself. hahaha!<br><br>think about it, this energy is all you ever want or need. those who are complacent about it will definitely lose out.<br><br>penny for ur thoughts?<br><br>btw, any1 of u here ever had an experience with a psychic vampire before? i had one in my sleep. but it wasn't a dream. this blue humanoid kept laughing while i was immobilise. i must have lots of positive energy in me that this thing wants. i didn't know then, of course. i only found out later that this thing is THE psychic vampire. but u know what? i dun haf to be afraid of it. this thing is jus another guy who knows how to perform Astral Travel and happens to want my energy and so took i-dunno-how-much of this positive energy i haf away from me!<br><br>conclusion, many of us here are psychic vampires in real life without even realising it. nah! dun imagine the vampire as the conventional pale-skinned dracula with fangs as soon as you hear of one. i'm talking about psychic vampires, other than a license to suck (no pun intended) they are totally different from those vampires we are more familliar with.<br><br>time to face the music fellas. i just know so there are ppl out there who have knowledge of this and already making it like their full-time job. there's no time to lose, there's energy to grab! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

What's that...? Careful what you read...? Things that go to our brains through our 5 senses are more appropriately defined as neuro signals... Though you can call them 'energy signals' if you like, as they probably involves some energy in the split seconds of it...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong><br><br>our emotions exist in this energy, and if we can control them we dun have to be a slave to our own emotional entrapment. we can do life without the confusions our emotions give us. we can be free.</strong><br><br>Good luck....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></blockquote></div>
