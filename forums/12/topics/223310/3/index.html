            <div class='col-md body'>last time i thought getting a gf is something to be proud of, like people tend to look at you and talk about you. You feel happy walking in the mall when holding a girl's hand, or holding her shoulders makes singles envy of you. But that is all but the typical perception that crawls into the minds of half-ripe adults(teenager).<br><br>Yes, it's true you don't feel lonely when you have someone to accompany you,  you feel happy when the girl lies her head on your shoulder, you feel that you are perfect when you kiss a girl and you feel that there is someone to support you when you think that everyone in this wolrd turns against you. All these come when you find your true love. But true love doesn't come easy for almost everyone.<br><br>love in teenagers will not last long, because most of them are just trying out their new found ability which enables them to get attracted to the opposite sex. NO harm trying though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> if you want to find out how it feels. But don't succumb to peer pressure. It's dangerous. Let it come naturally. It doesn't matter whether you got a gf in your teenage life. I never got into a relationship when i was a teenager because i was too ambitious in my studies and tend to be too kiasu.i ended up turning down all the girls who are intersted in me.  I was quite regret when thinking about that.<br><br>Built your self confidence but don't get too over with it. Self confidence isn't arrogance by the way, but it means you have your own perspective on economy, social and life. Try to  Read more newspaper or magazines to equipe yourself. Study hard, get good results. treat people kindly, but reserve some naughtiness in you. That doesn't mean you need to go over the limit, like talking dirty to a girl, or beating people. Try to make some jokes. Create a new personality that you think it suits you, not the one you like, and try to improve in it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cool, you're young and thinking about the future. At least you're trying to do something about it, and not wait till it's too late. So  you're mentally prepared.<br><br>it's natural to feel loved and wanted yeah, besides parental love and all that jazz.<br><br>It's hard to explain and tell anyone why "it's not important now to have a girlfriend" and all that so I shall not try. But it's very easy to know why it feels good to have a close companion.<br><br>Since you said you're not too eager to look for a girl already, glad that you're out of the "desperate" stage. Take it slow and easy... Shit usually happens when people do things on impulse. Mentally state what you want to achieve, and plan your road to achieve it. Unlike the movies, there's no (rarely) shortcuts or one shot route to getting it on with the opposite sex. It's patience and experience, which YOU... will go through and learn in your own way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did I pen this down before...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>There is no age restriction as to when you "date" another person. The first time I held hands with a girl was when I was 5.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>It is the responsibility of going into one and the specific reasons for going into one that can catch you off guard or make you fall off the cliff. Why do you date? Because many other people of your age are already attached and you feel pressure? You feel "threatened" that you are not part of "that" class if you are still single? You yearned for that "feeling" of loving someone and being loved back, carassing, kissing, and the warm, fuzzy feeling of being together and share many things possible?<br><br>Are you mature enough to handle the relationship? You date based on the gut feelings you have for that person. He/she/it is good looking? Or maybe cute and nice? Perhaps its fun being with him/her/it? Or maybe he/she/it is the hot property at the moment? How long do you intend to date that person? Till the feelings died down such that you have an excuse when breaking up, saying "I have no feelings for you anymore"? Or maybe you realised you two are not suited for each other and go seperate ways? Or maybe you found out after some time being with him/her/it that his/her/its character and behaviour is too much for you to handle?<br><br>What then? Break up? After all the time you two have been through? So you two have wasted time, energy, $$$ and many other things all for the "fun" of it and then scoot when there is no more spark? Then one or even both of you will be heart broken and then may develop a certain "fear" of getting into another relationship in the near future.<br><br>I know... <span style="font-style: italic;">You cannot help it! He/she/it is so beautiful! The greatest creation alive that your eyes have seen!</span> Ya I know that, but you date that person because you want that person to be happy OR you want to be happy at the expense of others?<br><br>Consider this: If you date someone with an intention... or rather a hint of breaking up in the end, know that you will be responsible for breaking a person's heart and hurting that person just for your own selfish sake of pleasure.<br><br>I am giving a view, not a "warning" and its meant not only for you Tao Suan but to ALL others who have not noticed what they are doing, and those who intend to do it.</div>
