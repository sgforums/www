And I've never been attached. Really. I have friends my age who are already married with kids... and here I am, still unattached. But I'm in no rush to find Mrs Fudgester right now... I've still got my studies to think of.<br><br>So why the rush? You still have a really, really long way to go. The difficulties that can come with a relationship can be really problematic. If you want to be in a relationship just to be in the 'in' crowd, then you're just screwing yourself up.<br><br>Go focus on your quadratic equations and trigonometry - they are far easier problems to handle than the problems that come with a relationship.</div>
