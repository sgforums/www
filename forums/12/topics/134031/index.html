            <div class='col-md body'>There's this Creative warehouse sales tomorrow morning and the Creative 5 GB mp3 Player is selling for SGD $150 for the 1st 50 customers. I promised to accompany my friend in queueing in the morning.<br><br>I thought it was stupid to queue without any reason, so I decided to buy 1 for myself. Yesterday night, my friend told me that he would pass me the cash and I would be helping his manager queue. I agreed since I never had the intention of buying the mp3 Player in the first place but, my mother was unhappy with the decision.<br><br>Just now, I SMSed my friend and wrote him a message saying that my mother wanted me to buy 1 and asked him to lie to his manager that we didn't make it in time for the queue.<br><br>Did I do the right thing?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Er....very confusing story (my mind is too full of things now to concentrate).  But the general view is that if you harmlessly lied in order not to hurt someone, its a white lie and its OK.<br><br>Furthermore, you gave more than you took this time....agreed to line up, do other people favours, etc.<br><br>Its OK lah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me rephrase your problem and see if I got it right:<br><br>You promised to queue with your friend to buy the MP3 player. However, you bought one for yourself beforehand, so now your friend wants you to still queue with him, but buy for his manager this time. Your mother is unhappy you are wasting your time for a stranger, so you decided to tell your friend that it was your mother who made you buy the player elsewhere, and you'd not be joining him in the queue the next day.<br><br>So far so good?<br><br>I wouldn't comment on whether it is right or wrong what you did, but can I ask why you had to lie? From what I see, telling your friend the truth may have lowered your credibility in his eyes, but pushing the responsibility on to your mother isn't going to gain you any credit points either. You promised to go, and now you're not going. Promise broken. And come on, using your mother as a shield is an excuse only good for three-year-olds (for your sake, let's hope your friend thinks like one). Some more, you asked your friend to lie to his manager to cover your lie. If I were your friend, I'd probably keep quiet but deep inside I'd rather have you telling me the truth.<br><br>If you want to lie, be a good liar, in both senses of the word -- lie for a good reason and make it good. If you can't do both, then stick to the truth. At least people wouldn't accuse you of lying <span style="font-style: italic;">on top of</span> breaking a promise.</div>
