I can't sleep without her.</div></blockquote>First of all, a gentle reminder, you have to be very tactful when you have decided / felt in love with someone who you meet, see and work together for most of the time under the same roof. <strong>If you succeed, congratulations but you need to know the do's and don'ts at the boundary line between colleague and girl friend. If you fail, it would be a very tough for you to face her everyday and if both of you are from the same department, the condition would be even worse. Eventually, one of you may choose to leave the company.</strong><br><br>To answer your questions:<br>&lt;&gt; Not so difficult as both of you are colleagues, whether you want or not, you two will have a chance to work together. Moreover, when you see each other everyday, you can greet her to break the ice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>&lt;&gt; Not so difficult as there are a lot of areas of interest as both of you are colleague. Ask her about her opinions about certain issues that occur in the company. Also, question like "hi, which department you are working for as I used to see you somewhere around". Simple, you can ask something related to her works.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>&lt;&gt; This is not so straightforward. But, since both of you are in the company, just try to join the lunch group which she used to join in. However, this is just a beginning. Then slowly, you can have a chance to talk to / know her closely. First of all, you must try to figure / find out whether she has a boy friend, otherwise you are just wasting you times. Be patient and don't ask her out so quickly, unless otherwise hinted by her. Take times and slowly, when there is a chance, then you ask her out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>&lt;&gt; There is no such high or low profile if she finally accepts you. Why? No matter what, the other colleagues will know about this relationship.  It's ok. There is nothing to hide, so long as you know the border line (work vs relationship). <strong>However, the most difficult part is when the relationship breaks up, you need to know how to handle it and facing her when in front of others.</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>&lt;&gt; Well, so long as she is not married or her boy friend is not in the same company, I would say it is a healthy relationsip. However, as I said, the most difficult part is how to convert the 'healthy love relationship' to a 'healthy working relationship' if the love relationship fails or she rejects you... but touch wood. It's a very difficult situation but worth to think about it now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Good luck to you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So I'm not alone...........<br><br>I got to know this girl when she first came for an interview in my company. She was aced the interview and we soon became colleagues. She ended up being my gf!<br><br>In my case, there wasn't a need to do anything specific or planned as we were working very closely and chances to discover "chemistry"  were aplenty. Moreover, we were both very spontaneous. Just bid your time and be yourself.<br>One word of caution though: Lotsa pple say never eat and shit at the same okace. If u guys are harmonious, going to work's heaven. If not, it'll be hell, particularly if your work performance suffers. Discipline will be crucial. Oso, there'll be lots of tongues snickering...... can be stressful sometimes but no pain, where got joy rite? Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
