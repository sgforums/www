I don't reject them during the first time we met when they are already gay, in fact we are good friends at this while. However, to those who are confuse about their sexuality and come to talk to me about it; i would certainly advise them to remain as per their biological sexuality and not to have any ideas to change to the other gender.<br><br>That is really to help them as a friend.</div>
