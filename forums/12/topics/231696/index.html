My buddy travelled in and out of JB just to visit him despite of her busy work schedule.. and it really hurts me when I saw the scars on her wrist.. she must have attempted to cut her wrist many times before..<br><br>TS, be there for your mum.  When her husband is always not around, she can only rely on her children.  Have you ever asked your mum why is she waiting?  Bcos she still treats him as her husband or because of her children?  If he ever lays a finger on you or your family again, make a police report ba.  You dun use violence to deal with violence.  Let the law teach him a lesson.<br><br>Be strong ya.. your mum and family still needs you.  And no matter what, do not try to end your life or do silly things that will break your mum's heart.  And if you need someone to talk to, dun hesitate to call the helplines.  </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when i read the quote with regards on, "<strong>From young, I was always beaten, hands, belts, wooden rots... All that made the cane look like a blessing.</strong>" i really feel that you've probaly been through hell from young.<br><br>but from what i feel if he's able to have a woman outside, i believe he still has a heart. i mean a woman wouldn't fall in love with a man who resorts to violence and has no money right?<br><br>in anyways now that you are in poly and able to support yourself in terms of your daily expenses, and your brother is going JC next year and i assume he's 16? 17 this year. should be old enough to think about what to do. have a get together in the family excluding your father that is. try to talk about the problem with your dad. either to live with him, or without.<br><br>but personally i feel that you should call the hotlines and get some professional advises. remember do not take things into your own hands. you will only make matters worse. good luck.</div>
