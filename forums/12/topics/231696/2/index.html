My buddy travelled in and out of JB just to visit him despite of her busy work schedule.. and it really hurts me when I saw the scars on her wrist.. she must have attempted to cut her wrist many times before..<br><br>TS, be there for your mum.  When her husband is always not around, she can only rely on her children.  Have you ever asked your mum why is she waiting?  Bcos she still treats him as her husband or because of her children?  If he ever lays a finger on you or your family again, make a police report ba.  You dun use violence to deal with violence.  Let the law teach him a lesson.<br><br>Be strong ya.. your mum and family still needs you.  And no matter what, do not try to end your life or do silly things that will break your mum's heart.  And if you need someone to talk to, dun hesitate to call the helplines.  </span><br><br></div></blockquote>I'm sure if your dad's here, he would've have been proud of you =)<br>I know he's my dad,<br>Thats why it holds me back not to do anything drastic.<br>but my heart hopes no hope for such man anymore,<br>because there is a void in my heart from young which i always fear this man.<br>No love at all.<br><br>I'm always there for mum, but I've been working and such,<br>a busy schedule keeps me away from my mum.<br>My brother, has no mind of his own,<br>Smoking at the age of 17 now.<br>I don't know what to say.<br>He's always looking for trouble,<br>Sigh...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alegna_t13:</div><div class="quote_body">Take out a PPO against your dad the next time he lays a finger on you or your family.<br><br>Let him noe that you guys are not his punching bags and that you have growned up le.<br><br>Hopefully it will deter him from ever thinking of harming you and your family again</div></blockquote>How or what is PPO ? could you explain it ?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by apples:</div><div class="quote_body">Do u know when and why ur father behaves this way? Have ur mum told u?<br><br>Try to reflect back on the happenings in ur family in a quiet serene place like a park. Going along with ur mum should help too. Break away from ur current routine and have a simple outing to a park or even downstairs or any place that u guys are comfortable with and have a heart to heart talk on the family matter.<br><br>You can discuss things like what happened to ur father?<br>Do ur all still want him back?<br>Do ur all still want to help him?<br>Do ur all think ur father still wants the family?<br>What should u guys do?<br>...<br><br>While u guys are unhappy. Ur father is probably also a very unhappy person and for him, his way of venting out his anger is through violence.
