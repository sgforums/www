For example if you don't like this guy, logically, you would have told him straight in his face and ask him to stop wasting his time. Your words would be sharp and not ambigious and suggestive. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>How many people in this world actually do that? Empathy, rational sense, pity, psychological game, moral, responsiblity and whole lot of other factors comes into the picture - it becomes rather complicating.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>*/me presuming that this girl is you - saving the hassle of saying his girl that girl.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>***<br><br>You problem is simple, someone likes you, but you don't in return. Ok, lets think about this first. The verdict? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>'I am sorry, but we lack the chemistry.'<br><br>Next, another girl likes the guy, but in return, he doesn't. The verdict?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>'I am sorry, but we lack the chemistry.'<br><br>The issue pops up when you attempt to 'push' (this effect is seemingly pushing because of your situation and he would indirectly feel it this way.) him to someone else who he had little attraction for. You mentioned that love can be developed over the time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If you meant that he could develop feelings for her if he give her a chance - he would tell you to give him a chance so that you could develop feelings for him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You can develop feelings from good impression, chemistry and platonic friendship, but other than that, its difficult without these elements. These must happen subconsciously and not consciously. (As in giving you a chance to try out - most of the time, it wouldn't work at all. Love's sublime effect always overrule mind.)<br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Believe it or not, I don't see it as a problem at all. So what if someone likes you, but you don't fancy him at all, in BGR sense. These things <strong>always</strong> happen and you should just maintain usual friendship, if possible, or simply lead on your life without thinking too much. Whether the other girl likes him or not - seriously, you have little affair between them, so why bother? Even if you knew the girl personally, its still 'their' business.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You can't control the decision of the other party, so why attempt to think about it?<br><br><strong>There is no best of both world solution in love - Even if it is for you, its never for the other party</strong>.<br><br>P.S: If this isn't you, probably you would like your friend to read this post or 'copy and paste' to her verbally.<br><br>Cheers</div>
