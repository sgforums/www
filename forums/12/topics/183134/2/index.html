My jealously and ego corrupts my mind and I decide to ask her for sex.<br><br>It happen in the sat evening,where we went for a stoll in a secluded park. While we were kissing,I suddenly popped the question but she reject bluntly. She said she didn't want! I told her I felt she loved me not enough as she could give her first time to her ex and wouldn't even satisfy my demand.She told me sex shall not use as a guage to measure her love for me and she was not prepared.She told me she agree sex with her ex after 1 yr of courtship while the time for us was not riped.I was infuriated and gave her cold shoulder.Then I decided to leave the park. She immediately follow close behind me. Finally she decided to stop me and pacified me. I could see tears began to roll down from her eyes and her worry face,worried that I will leave her for not giving in to me. She said she may considered it and she began to tremble abit. Although my heart ached for seeing her state. I decided to continued my test of her love for me despite losing the mood for intimate stuff. I then quickly ask demand her on the spot for sex. She was in disarray and I could see her unclear mental state and body language continued to negotiate whether to give in to my demand.We were at that time near a road with many passing-by cars! While I continued demand an answer from her. She finally broke down,closed her eyes and more tears roll down her eyes as she nodded her head repeatly to gesture her submition to my demand!  Witnessing from a total 180 degree turn from a no to agree. I was shocked and awakened too. I also realise how much she loves me that she was even willing to submit her body and pride to make me stay beside her!<br><br>I realise how inhuman I was. She later informed me she was not comfortable to do it outside and wanted to go to my house to do the intimate stuff! Not going to inform her of my intention,I agreed and brought her back to my home. Just abt to enter house door. I could saw her tense body language ready to submit to me. We made a U-turn and I brought her to void deck where we sat down. I told her I decided not to press her not sex and will not use sex as a gauge to measure her love for me! I told her we will only do it when she was comfortable.I could see she immediately felt relax and broke into a smile and she informed me of her bad sex experience with her ex. I felt sorry for her and decided to make a pact of not having premarital sex. After that I gave her $10 to take a cab home.<br><br>After this incident,I realise man can be such bastard which they can abuse their position and their partner's love for them and force them to submit to all kind of their demand.It also let me real life experience the evil tatic depoyed by those bastard which how they forced their partner into giving their first to them and dumped them including my ger ex. I strongly urge all guy who had a wonderful gf who love them so deep,not to play around with their feeling and instead cherish their presence,being faithful.For those who continue thier action ,I believe will suffer retribution</div></blockquote>From your story I can only conclude you're a bastard. You cannot judge others based on what you did, that's really dumb. It's just like saying, hey I like to eat pasta, and I am a man, hence I conclude all men likes to eat pasta. Where's the logic man?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I only have these to said to you, you got a a gf who love you more then you love her. cos she did not break up with you when you ask for it. But if you will to put yourself into ur gf's shoes, I will think that since you ask for it, once you get it, you will break up with her. thats y she dun wan to do it with you. But she really love you alot, and is scared that you will leave her if she dun agree, and thats y she agree in the end, in hoping that you will not be like her ex.<br><br>Dun make her heart broken again, cos a girl heart can only withstand a few hits, once it reach the limit and break like a mirror, there is no way that you can mend it back again.<br><br>Hope you will cherish her more after this incident.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
