              <p>Never imagined that i'd be here posting again. Here goes my story..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently at work i've been feeling stressed out over customer issues. I tried to be strong, telling myself that at the end of the day, its just work. No need to be too bothered by them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But its just not working. These few days, i've been telling my gf about my troubles at work. I just need to get it off my chest, tell someone about it. I just need a listening ear, someone to hear out my problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apparently she got pissed off with me because she said that i complained too much (indirectly, but obvious). Is this too much to ask of? Shouldn't your other half be understanding and encouraging towards you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without a doubt, I'd do what i can to help her if she is facing any difficulties. Heck, even if she complains to me every single day, I wont be irritated or pissed because I love her. To me, the problems that she faces will also be my problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Im feeling so disappointed. Not even angry but disappointed. Can't she just listen to my woes? I'm not asking anything from her, but just to listen to me. Why is she even getting pissed over this? I just don't know. I hate this feeling but it sucks. I'd rather be angry than disappointed because this feeling really sucks real bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please advise.</p>

              <p><br>Obviously i am trying. I just need the support and encouragement. Being a guy isn't about trying to act all macho and keep everything to yourself. If i can't tell my gf about my problems, who can I tell? Strangers in forums? Perhaps.</p>

              <p>There's a limit to the amount of patience, perhaps even the level of tolerance to listen to complaints and whinings for every individual. But that does not mean ur gf doesn't love u, and opening up to her doesn't only mean complaints and more complaints only. </p>
              <p>If ur gf doesn't like to hear complaints, den complain to ur close friends instead.</p>

              <p>Have you considered that when you complained about your day, she herself could have been having a more terrible day but because you brought it up first, she decided not to tell you her problems so as not to unnecessarily burden you with her probems? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>She was fretting over trying to find a job. But you know what was I doing before i complained to her? I was going through the details of the part-time job offer that she found online. Before that, I even called up a friend to enquire about a job vacancy.

              <p>Like what some people suggested, stop burdening her with your bad days since she has problems of her own.  Do it with your drinking buddies at the local pub.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nobody said relationships were easy or straight forward.  But the rule of thumb is the guy usually gets the shorter end of the stick in a relationship. Bear that in mind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I've always learn it this way.. before something negative comes out of my mouth, say something positive. Instead of going straight to the "i have a bad day yadda yadda" , ask about her , tell her she looks brighter today etc. Somehow after a few experiments of compliments, i realised women are more open to what i say to even accepting what i say too. You may want to try it. :) And you mentioned you help her to look up the part time jobs , did you tell her about it? Sometimes, doing it secretly might not be helpful. She might not know.. Of course depending on what kind of girl is she.</p>
              <p>Charlize mentioned that the guy usually get the shorter end of the stick in a relationship .. i shall say it's true but only when you have the energy and interest to keep it going if not, the girl might be doing all she can to keep the relationship going too.</p>
              <p>I know girls who like guys to whine to them though. cause most of the time guys behave more like cavemen. By being open with your problems and them just listening can be a good effort to making them feel you're making an effort to let them know what's going on. Which could be considered a nice gesture , to some.</p>

              <p>Well, my situation used to be like yours... but the roles are reversed. Mf gf would nag every day to me about her work.. sometimes even crying, saying her work gives her alot of stress blah blah blah...</p>
              <p>The truth is even though she is my gf, I would still be pissed off when someone is constantly nagging to be about the same old things, day in day out, everyday without fail.</p>
              <p>I agree with wat some others wrote, that guy would prefer to keep to themselves and solve their own problems, nag once in a while is okay, but not too frequent.</p>

              <p>Now I know that I cannot expect people to act the same as me because everyone is different! Lesson learnt, but still feel that bit of regret somewhere.</p>
