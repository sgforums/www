Just imagine as a friend now, she treats u like this.  What more as a stead?huh?? What's more? She doesn't like you.<br><br>How old are you btw? How old is she ? I suspect both of you are very young.<br><br>Let's start off with your story: U feel that both of you got chemistry. But is it only your own wishful thinking? and she never feel it?<br><br>then she said she is "somewhat asleep"?? Yeah: she doesn't have feelings for you and you called. When you called, she gave u a crap excuse to confuse you. U mean she has chemistry for you when she sounds asleep when talking to you? U call that chemistry?! Wake up dude!!<br><br>U called her on ur way back and guess what she did? she asked u to accompany urself. DO U GET WHAT SHE IS TRYING TO TELL U? Get a life! Ya she is telling you that.<br><br>U never say u like her but she knows u like her. Girls are good at knowing that. Why, u say? Because u asked her out my friend, chat on the phone, sms everyday and she can sense it. Which guy will go and chat so long with a girl so late they are not interested in?<br><br>And the worse thing u can do: You asked her if she is annoyed?! It sounds like u are begging and pleading her to like you. It does not work la brother. She will dislike you more. Where's ur face? Do u want ur face not? Of cos she dun want to tell you la. They will never tell u one la. They dun want you to feel hurt.<br><br>Sad to say, after so much, it's hard to go back to the start because you screwed it all up. She remembers everything and you can be friends the most.<br><br>Hold back la. Stop contacting her. Just smile when u see her in class. It's only friends ma haha. Just treat her like any guy friend because that's where u can go.<br><br>If anything u can learn from this, it is to respect yourself. Because you need the face. Not asking if she is irritated or not. It will not work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Scape_Goat_Token:</div><div class="quote_body">i dunno how to really sae. but i got to noe dis gal for lik 2-3 weeks. (same class de n been in same class for 1.5 yrs le)..startin quite good. chat alot on sms and fone until late late. den went out alone wif her once. den felt lik there was quite some chemistry between us..i even found some lame excuse to walk her home to her block downstairs de lift durin tt time..<br><br>but recently she's lik tired everyday. spent e whole day sleeping. den her msg nt as fast coz she's always "half-asleep" or half conscious and tired when she see my msg. lol. accordin to her she was "somewhat asleep..". dunno wad tt really mean. does tt min she dun care about my msg and lik always lazy 2 reply le.., i noe shes realli sleepin from e voice when i call her...<br><br>today i accidently woke jer up while she was sleepin. opps, is it somethin very bad to do? i was lik walkin home from somewhere n just hopin for some company on e fone...., dan 1 1/2 hrs later i woke her up again coz i tot she wud be awake. she sound quite errr....irritated and said " u go entertain urself la"....<br><br>so far i nvr say anithin about i like her or wat. but we're lik frens but in those kind of state tt anythin unexpected can happen anytime. thats my feelin. i dunno wad she is thinkin and i dun think i shld try to guess..<br><br>out of sianness i msg her somethin lik "if u're annoyed, pls tell me" and blah blah blah....i asked her if she was irritated wif me and she kept denyin. though sometimes i feel wat im doin even as a fren is too much....izzit overboard?<br><br>when chasin a gal, how much is too much? and how much is just nice? i wan things to go bac when we first knew each other...cud it b dat she is already sian of mi...<br><br></div></blockquote>Oh dear, are you a very sensitive guy just like me?<br><br>From what i see here. You haven't told her you like her, You haven't started anything.<br>But saying stuffs like, "if you're annoyed , pls tell me". You'll scare the girl -_-. If calling her for no reason, You'll scare the girl as well.<br>Perhaps there are some things a friend still should'nt do. Somehow when you are showing overconcern, It would backfire. Life's unpredictable, you might be thinking this. Perhaps something else is happening.<br><br>But ultimately, You have to remember that your just a friend to her as of her to you CURRENTLY. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
