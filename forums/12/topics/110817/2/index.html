            <div class='col-md body'>hi, things you should do:<br>1). File for bankruptcy, becuz its the most burden/stress free way of doing. Also by doing it, most things will be resolved, else<br><br>2). Sell the company off, i.e. find a partner to invest or buy over, or sell the equipments and sell out the "land" or shop to gain some money to pay ALL your fees. Ask your husband's friends or your families' relatives if any if interested.<br><br>3). After point 1 &amp; 2). try to sell your car if you have one, use the money to pay your FEEs, and both parents MUST now find a job.<br><br>4). Your husband and you should find a job. For you, 40-45yrs old, there ARE many jobs for you to do. E.g. Hawker center or coffee shop, those helping to bring the coffee/drinks to people and collect the money?, those that help to wash plates, bowls for stall-holders?. Also, cashier for those shophouses in new towns? those selling clothes, foods, etc. Also, factory workers, toilet cleaners in towers/buildings etc. Many Many, you just have to check out the classifieds and ....<br><br>5). Ask your MP for help, they can help find you a job ASAP, and also advise you on your financial status. And if you have no income, they will also advise you that maybe your kids can have financial aid , something like allowances or grants. Remember, if you dont ask, there is Nothing you can get.<br><br>6). Always use minimal electricity and water at home, dont on too long aircon, switch to fan, off the lights when not using, etc. Ask whole family to eat in, cuz its cheaper. Pool money.<br><br>7). Ask your friends or your husbands friends regarding jobs are good, they may help you all find job at the shortest time. And may advise you wisely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liang_Po_Po, I disagree with some of the suggestions here that u should divorce ur husband. I think u may want to work it out with ur husband and try to mend the financial mess as well as relationship mess, first, before wanting to divorce him.<br><br>Why not u two talk and try to find solutions? For ur financial and relationship problems. Ask him to compromise and change. Tell him of ur concerns of him keep on lying to u, staying outside, having a relationship with another woman, etc.<br><br>Try to save ur marriage first loh.....before deciding to divorce him....at least try first...<br><br>Also, u try to get a job quickly. Search the online job openings. I recommend www.jobstreet.com and www.jobsdb.com. Search also government job agencies and help-groups. And buy newspaper everyday and search the classified section and call them up one by one. Im sure u can get a job qucikly. Keep trying.<br><br>Some people recommended for u / ur husband to declare bankruptcy. Why dont u and ur husband try to get some income first, by both working, then see and calculate whether u two can slowly pay off the debts and bills? If it is still possible, then there is no need to declare bankruptcy mah.<br><br>Good luck.</div>
