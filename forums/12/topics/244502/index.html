            <div class='col-md body'>i think u should join in the fun of playing basketball instead of just watching others playing basketball at a corner. having pe lesson is it? that might be the reason why u sucks at sports and fail ur 2.4km because lack of exercise thus bad stamina. ur mindset of u sucks in sports might stop u from enjoying basketball. treat it as doing some exercise and interacting with ur classmates.<br><br>though i encouraged u should play basketball as exercise and a way to interact more with ur classmates, but dont ever give up on ur hobby. it's something that u love.<br><br>do u interact frequently with the girls who u tried to ask them out but failed? and are u in good terms with them? if u hardly interact with them, that might be the reason why they reject the offer to go out with u.<br><br>as for going out with ur parents that part, its perfectly fine with it. it doesnt mean going out with parents is mummy's boy and vice versa. unless ur like those, u beat me, i tell my mummy that kind lah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>interact more with the GIRLS/GUYS in school and hanging out after school. soon u will have more chance to go out with girls instead of getting rejected.<br><br>u may do somethings to get what u want but in the process, never lose urself and change to someone u not really r. thats what makes u unique even if not special.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stop feeling sorry and bad for yourself. I think you are a much nicer guy than your cousin, who actually sounded like a pompous jerk to me. Honestly, if I had to pick I would pick you over your cousin. There's nothing wrong with liking models and not being involved with basketball.<br><br>Basketball = popular with girls? Some people must be reading too much manga and watching too much tv.<br><br>And who says guys must definitely be good at sports. That's not true too.

            <div class='col-md body'>The conception that basketball boys are more popular and hot and strictly <strong>Not True</strong>. People from all kind of sports and clubs can be "famous with the girls" (quoted from your last sentence.)<br><br>An alternative is to link up with people in your 'model collecting' sector. You get to know more people (esp. girls) who have the same hobby, which makes your job of chatting up with them much easier.</div>
