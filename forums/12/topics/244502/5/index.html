            <div class='col-md body'>Adding on to what the others have said, you sound like you might be just a tad too despo about getting a r/s.<br><br>I've known guys like that (am a guy myself), and we all are at your age. I just want to caution you not to try too hard. I had this friend in school last time who tries to impress girls by being funny. And you know what? None of us remember him for who he is. We all know he is funny, he's a clown, but we don't really know the guy.<br><br>So, don't try too hard. Be passionate about what you are good at, and it will shine through. Yes, young girls are automatically attracted to physically fit males, but they are not permanently attracted. After that personality is important.</div>
