              <p>since you got ur diploma find a job that requires ur diploma, compare to other job, u are pay more for ur profession. </p>
              <p>meanwhile, apply for SIM, NTU, NUS, see whether they wan u or not. Anyway, there is at least a 1/2 year lag phase before they confirmed and enrolled u. Whack everything. It is they choose u, not ur choice, unless, u have really good result. </p>
              <p>if u r interested in whatever, just whack also. No need to think so hard. After they say you are wanted, then you pick apples that is already in your hands. </p>
              <p>Going overseas, is good idea, but you need $$$. So u also need to work FIRST to save enough. And they took like 1 years lag phase before you get enrolled. And Whack every Uni. because they may not wan u. </p>

              <p>Seems like a waste of time to do a 3 yr dip in NIE when he already has a dip. I'm assuming TS's dip is from a poly and therefore took 3 yrs as well. TS can consider signing on as PE teacher and so can enrol in NIE for degree programme at NTU, but then again NTU is really rubbish and crap university whose degree is only fit for wiping the ass...tough choice..</p>
              <p>another choice is to enrol in SIM degree course or UniSim, which is definitely better than NTU. UniSim is endorsed by the government isn't it?</p>
              <p>I know a lot of SIM and UniSim grads who found jobs in back office of banks. So there is really no difference between going to SIM or going anywhere else. You can safely go there.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>

              <p>never too late to sign on SAF. but do note that it is no longer iron ricebowl. ppl sign on contract for a no. of years. then depend on performance can carry on or have to leave SAF.</p>
              <p>a uni degree will carry you further for job search in private sector. just make sure you go uni that has SG recognition.</p>
              <p>sports science is becoming more popular, but there are limited jobs in that restricted field. you will most likely end up being PE teacher.</p>
              <p>IT is always a safe bet. all companies need IT staff (whether outsourced or insource). however, do note that SG is also outsourcing more of its basic IT needs to cheaper IT labour in other countries. so to remain employable, you will have to keep on upgrading your IT skills every year and not just get a IT degree and stop learning.</p>

              <p><br>It should be recognised..check with MOE, which will be the main hirer of PE teachers. Since you are interested in being a PE teacher with that qualification, you should check with the employers of most PE teachers in Singapore, which is the MOE. I remember helping one of my men out and enquiring for him, and I think it's recognised in fact one of the SMa sport science grads is a sports lecturer at Republic Poly, but he was already a PE teacher in sec school for some years thats why he can be a sports lecturer after he finish his SMa.</p>
              <p>However, you should bear in mind that if you go to SIM business, you will have wider choice of jobs and sectors to apply to when you finish compared to sports science which is far more specialised, because business degrees are generic degrees.</p>

              <p>if you wana sign on, why dont you do it during your NS. coz if u decided to ORD after 6 years. you will be 27-28 years old at the minimum. to start again a new career after that is consider late liao lor.</p>
              <p>think twice.</p>

              <p>hi 'insidestory', i went down to the campus to get the brochure, it says 'MOE registered'. haha...i guess it is recognised. I do agree with you that business is a more general route, with better career prospect =).Well, still gonna think abt it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ya 'reyes', minimum 6 yrs i guess, I was thinking if i can save up $$ to further studies next time. But 6 yrs is really a long period, and i hear negative comment regarding aircrew spec vocation. HAiz...getting old..</p>
