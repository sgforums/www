            <div class='col-md body'>20 reasons why liars come online.<br><br>1. No one will know who did it.<br>2. You can always edit your statements, profiles to make it look correct.<br>3. When you lied enough, no one will listen to you. Online gives you a second life in lying.<br>4. Around the clock responses to your lies.<br>5. Lying is another form of communication, albeit with falsehood.<br>6. Lying online will not get you jailed, at least at the moment.<br>7. You can always lie with your secondary account and use your primary account to prove the lie was correct, but with much difficulty<br>8. Online gives you a bigger target audience.<br>9. They can also assume an identity and create havoc by lying, thus landing the identified person into trouble.<br>10. You were expecting 20 reasons, but I'm not giving you the reasons since I'm lying about having 20 reasons at the first place.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Jane,<br><br>I think u are emotionally confused and take ur son as a sort of companion/ comfort/ partner (including the sexual aspect), and as someone has said, ur son might be confused as well and think he is like some kind of partner too. (including the sexual aspect).<br><br>I think in this situation, it's not entirely a sexual matter, like a sexual addiction/ sexual behaviour matter only, but also a problem of roles/ emotional issues.<br><br>U won't be able to stop the sexual issues if u don't sort out and solve ur bigger issue too.<br><br>I think deep down u know something is wrong, and alarm bells are ringing in ur head.<br><br>You need to find a solution. I'm sure u can.<br><br>My suggestion:<br><br>1. Get some alone time and reflect.<br>2. Assess whether u have emotional and roles issues in ur relationships, especially with ur son, and ur son towards u.<br><br>If the answer is yes, then:<br><br>1. Find ways to balance ur relationship with ur son, and ur son towards u, and make it a healthy relationship.<br><br>.....<br><br>If I may be honest, basically u are too isolated. Ur son too. The two of u live in ur own little world and get too attached, and confused.<br><br>Get outside and enlarge ur world. You are substituting ur 'man' with ur son. You have a natural longing for a partner, emotionally and sexually. In this sense, there's nothing wrong with this longing. It's natural. What's unnatural, is, you should get a real partner, and not substitute him with the nearest available alternative, who is ur son. You shouldn't channel ur longing to ur son.<br><br>Ur son is confused too. It has reached a stage where he even wants to have sex with u, he thinks u are a beautiful woman with a good body. It has reached a stage where u get jealous when his classmates come.<br><br>U have to change ur 'spousal' relationship with ur son into a purely 'parental' relationship. There is no other way.<br><br>I suggest changing ur environment. Get to know more people. Let ur son too.<br><br>Ur son is shy and doesn't have many friends, it might be because of this situation affecting his personality. Im sure he is confused, disoriented and carrying a burden. Teenagers are already generally confused. This situation makes it worse. Im sure he doesn't tell people that he has oral sex with his mum. This is a huge secret and huge secrets is a big burden.<br><br>Hope u can steel urself and find a solution, for u and ur son's good.<br><br>And....be more assertive. Your son is not ur equal partner. You are older, u should be more decisive. You are more mature, u know what u must do. So don't get soft-hearted with ur son. What you're doing is for ur, and his, own good.</div>
