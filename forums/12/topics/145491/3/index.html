Meanwhile just refrain. it's not good for both of u. U are not alone. This single mothers and son relationship are  common in western countries i been to and incidents have been increasing in those countries due to divorce rates, the children suffer. They have support and psychotheraphy outlets there.I was working as a volunteer at one of those support groups for broken marriages when i was overseas and i came across  cases.....may be more difficult to recognize compared to cases involving men since boys readily accept the abuse. u may want to check  this link below and how it will affect your son :<br><br><a href="http://www.soulwork.net/sw_articles_eng/little_prince.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.soulwork.net/sw_articles_eng/little_prince.htm</a><br><br>In cases where  losses have occurred (in your case your hubby  has left u) when  there are available young males to  play some sort of substitute role, such women may be at greater risk for sexually acting out.</div>

If the feelings towards going further in the sexual relationship is mutual, i say go ahead with it. Incest maybe a taboo in our social society, but it is not wrong you both parties choose to go into it together. You don't really have to care about what others think.<br><br>But i must warn you that your son is at the age of exploration. As he get past his 20 year old mark, he may start to yearn for woman around his age. You have to prepare to either:<br><br>1) let go of him totally<br>2) use each other as a sexual-comfort tool.<br><br>do consider that.</div>
