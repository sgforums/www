We women  cant be like men They are more able to handle things while we cant. I think your son lacks a good father role model or thinks he is your partner.

Her son is also willing and is above 16 years of age. Why do u care. They surf internet porn is their problem .Nowadays parent and child are open minded.  this is the millenium, not the 60s, 70s or 80s...t is normal for single mum to attach with male child. If she has female child, it will be different case. it is HER BOY who come from her, not someone else child. She has every right<br><br>Keep your opinions to yrself and enjoy this thread.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys, i think if u put in her shoe, honestly u too will feel very demoralise and unfair by the way ppl react like "yeee", "incest", "its a sin" blah blah..<br><br>to jane:<br><br>everyone crave for sex . but to indulge in your son might not be a good way for his development. think long term when he grows up, how will he behave, will he have the same mindset like having sexual thought with his daughter?<br><br>its very lonely and depressing to lost the love one early and to carry on as a single mother is not easy. physically and mentally, its a torture.<br>if the father is dead, why not find a new partner?<br>if the father is those heck care kind so you leave him, its a good time finding new partner.<br><br>in this new age where our mind is been "polluted" by the western trend, its not a taboo about such things. rather, its the partner u are seeking.<br><br>ps. no one can stand loneliness  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jane, you give in to his/your lust,  there will be a second, third time and so on. None of you will be able to stop. And never bring  a 35+ male companion back home. I can't imagine what your son or companion will do when he finds out and go into a rage.<br><br>Meantime, consider some relief using sex toys (not your son, a human sex toy!). There are several stores in Sg these days. And join a dating agency.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>
