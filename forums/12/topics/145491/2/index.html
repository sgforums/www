Well u should not try the make the same mistake again. Losing control of yourself. . Professional counselling can help u.<br>Your son should go for it too. That's my advice to u now - refrain from doing any other activities together which can encourage abnormal feelings</div>

Your son is still young and you must take the initiative to solve these problems.But  what's done cannot be undone. At least in the future , u must exercise extra caution. Your son might  had grew up thinking that being close to u  and doing such stuff is fine. You only have yourself to blame for it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dear jane, you know it's wrong... so i guess since you've started, and your son is at that age, you gotta do the difficult thing now and to have a heart-to-heart talk with him...<br><br>and then to make a decision not to do so again and stick to it...<br><br>maybe your desire stems from being with him for extended periods of time without meeting other people (please correct me if i'm wrong)... so what you can do is to go out and meet people, get to know them...<br><br>who knows? you may find someone for yourself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>whatever it is, you already know deep inside you this is not right... and therefore you must stop.. that is the most important first step which you must take... after that, you have to steel yourself and not let your desires get the better of you...<br><br>good luck..<br><br>like i say to many.. we all get a little lost sometimes...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've read from somewhere that in many cases of separation, many mums tends to confide in their child (esp the eldest one) all their emotional pains, anger, etc.. as though the child is her best friend. However, to the child, no matter how matured he/she may be, it's considered a form of mental abuse.  Cos the child is simply not old enough to understand the issues.<br><br>Eventually, it will leave mental and emotional scars later on in his life. When he grows up, it might affect his outlook on r/s or even his life. So, for the sake of the kid, you have to stop it, even the petting.<br><br>Sometimes strong feelings are a sign of other emotional problems. For eg, I eat LOTS OF chocolates when I'm stress <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .. Eating more chocolates wun solve the problem. I have to find better ways to manage the stress. For you, Maybe your sexual feeling are signs of longing for companionship and loneliness?<br><br>All of us have sexual desires, but it doesn't mean we have to succumb to it.. It's a state of mind. It's like a craving for chocolates <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> -&gt; If you let yourself dwell on the thought and imagine eating different types of chocolates, the craving becomes worse. But if you put your mind to do something else, without realising, the craving is gone.<br><br>You can divert your attention by hanging out with friends, and encouraging him to hang out with ppl of his age. Avoid situations where temptations may occur. But if it is getting to the extent that it becomes compulsive (you can't stop thinking about it, no matter how hard you try), then i would suggest that you seek a counsellor. (MY 2 cents worth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )</div>
