            <div class='col-md body'>In my family, when I misbehave or failed my exams I would often get discipline by my mum or my aunty (depending on who I was living with at the time.)<br>This would usually result in me bending over a table and receive the cane on my backside. I had to hold on to the table edge for dear life as it was very painful.<br><br>though it was very painful, the worst thing about these punishments was that I have to undress or at the very least let my trousers down. Most times this was ok as my aunt usually discipline me in private.<br>But there were times when she was REALLY angry she would discipline in on the spot or when people complain about my bad behaviour she would discipline me in front of them. (I think it was because she wanted to keep face and show that she was doing something)<br>I found this very shameful and embarrassing especially when it was infront of other people.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I am not saing that caning is wrong, I think it has done me a great deal of good, as I am a much better person now because of it, and its all thanks to my mums and aunty's love and strict discipline.<br><br>I don't get cane as much now cus I am older now, but when it happens I just feel very awkward especially when there are people around.<br><br>I just want to know if any other forum members have samilar experiences and how do you deal with it?<br><br></div>

Most parents stop caning their children for every little thing by the time they're 12 or 13...  Perhaps fathers may be harsh &amp; may still give an occasional beating (sons start fighting back eventually anyway), but I've Not heard of mothers &amp; aunties still caning after the children reach their early teens <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Asianguy7:</div><div class="quote_body">I have talk to them about it.<br>I keep telling them I am too old to be cane.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dude.. There is really really something wrong and you ought to sort it right.. Caning is in the pretext of discipling a child who misbehaves and the person who is looking after him/her wants to set things right.<br><br>At 31 if you are still being canned, than i think there is still canning, something is really wrong. I think most of us here... On average.. The last time we got cane was back when we are in our primary sch days. For stricter family, maybe sec 1 or the max till sec 2.. NOT 31 YEARS OLD.<br><br>We have no right to interfer in your family. But because of spoiling a $3K comp, does not give them the green light to cane you.<br><br>Another possibility that you are canned may due to the fact that in your aunt or mum's eyes, you are still a kid and never grew up. Stand on your own feet and prove to them that you do not need to rely on them.

            <div class='col-md body'>don't rebel against them maybe you should sit down and talk to them that how you fee about the caning and really they should stop it and have other solutions for your inmaturity.......<br><br>I don't really think they "your mum and aunt" want to get cane for inmaturity or mistakes made cause they are human they make mistakes too so do thier grandparents cane them or talk to them nicely instead ?</div>
