            <div class='col-md body'>hmm i would advice telling them to stop it nicely and explain that you feel its not appropraite. i assume you can support yourself financially if you really have to judging from you age.... therefore i advice that if they do not listen to the prior persuasion do not bend down on the table the next tiem they want to cane you. if they do proceed to cane you anyhow then you can either retaliate in self defence or go to the police after that i presume assualt is pretty much on the list since you did not accede to the caning...........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After seeing so many post from you.. All i can say is prove to them you are matured enough so that they will not have the excuse to cane you.. Same goes for your cousin..<br><br>Its not about humilating in when cane in public or at home.. Its about your principles that we are talking abt here.. Ask anyone beside you.. Who gets caned at your age??<br><br>You defend yourself by saying that they cane you for a good cause.. Which parent don cane their kids for a good cause? (Not talking abt those parents who abuse their kids via caning)<br><br>Sit down talk to them.. Ask them why they are caning you.. For God sake.. you are in Uni ready.. When you graduate.. Are they suppose to get the cane beside you when you go on stage to collect your cert?<br><br>Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Asianguy7:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi thanks for the advice,<br><br>I don't want to like report them to the police or assualt charges or do something drastic like that.
