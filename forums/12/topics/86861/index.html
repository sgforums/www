She can always come back.<br>- You're always a buddy that she could trust and lean onto whenever she faces problems, in her own r/s or any other.<br>- Probably, if she knows how to play 'it' well. she'll hit the soft core of your heart periodically to maintian your liking for her. eg. Calls/meets you to have heartfelt conversation<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Conclusion: Her advantage.....<br>'she sorta agreed...what the hack does that mean.' - Her advantage, since you first offer your doors wide open even she didn't ask.<br><br>__________________________<br><br>Put her and yourself in KIV and after 4 years review this relationship if it's possible to work out.<br>It is wiser for you to maintain a outward search for other potientals then to wait and be pessimistic. If you really choose to be a 'good' man. You'll be at your own loss.<br><br>You may be facing a opponent and hence the insecurity.<br>I suggest that you should find your own activity and NOT be bothered but her and your 'rival'.<br>Let her know you have your busy schedule and also a good social life. Nothing beats being a guy with many options. That way, she knows she has competitors too. Will discuss this further next time.<br>But right now, you should let her be and seek for your own opportunities.<br>Being Passive is not the way to attraction - She might end up seein you as a soul-mate then potiental.<br><br>Gain more from talking to girls/ladies and listen to them. Bother to ask them sensitive questions about what they really want. Maybe your next relationship will not be far.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Meanwhile, take care.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>
