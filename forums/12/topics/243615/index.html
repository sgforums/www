U r in a state of depression and it only made u stronger and realise losing someone is so hurting.<br>She may not meant to hurt u but maybe she don't want u to waste time on her, cos she afraid that she had neglected u.

I wish we could be more than friends but the thing is...I have a boyfriend who loves me very much and he's in love with another girl who doesn't love him. I know i have to faithful to my boyfriend which is not hard at the moment since the guy i'm in love with doesn't love me, but i'm afraid that in the future when he gets over his current love things will be more complicated. We had a chance to become a couple long time ago but he let it slip away. Now i keep thinking what could have been. I try to support my boyfriend and give him as much love as he's given me over the past couple of years but my heart's not 100% in it. Every now and then i start thinking about my friend...How can i get over him?<br><br>//<br><br>Trust me you are lucky to have a kind gf who tells you that she no longer love you and have a clean break with you. Imagine in the story above the girl is dragging the whole relationship and is harming her bf.<br><br>Learn this wel,l a breakup can change a person to be a stronger person or make a person weaker. Is all up to you. Work hard, earn more, in time you will be the mature bf of someone else. Do not show that you need her to go on with life. Since she has break up with you, act like a man and work harder.</div>

It would be a garbage which stinks even more if you let it drag on till she just can't stand it anymore and do a 'confession' on you at a much later stage... Or worse still.. After she've got herself a bf?<br><br>Don't dwell on the past anymore as they're already part of the history.. And as much as I know it's certainly easier said than done, it doesn't mean you couldn't do it.... In fact, ask many people who used to hang around AA with their problems and how they're feeling now... I can almost assure you, it could be done... Unless you don't allow yourself to...<br><br>Make more friends and if possible, invest on a handful of closer ones... As you've said you've got no pillar except her... It could be quite a 'dangerous' scenerio as you can probably see for now... Reorganise your life...<br><br>About 'maturity', is what she said true...? If it's not really that, then you shouldn't really be bother by her words as they're probably just excuses... If they do mean something, perhaps you might like to work a little on 'maturity' at the same time...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Likely, she already had thoughts of leaving the relationship - though reasoning is around, courage to translate reasoning into action is missing.<br><br>Having to spent some time, without your presence, cleared her doubts and gave her the courage to act.<br><br>If you desire to constrain a woman inside a 'closed environment', so that you can preserve that 'adolescent mindset' forever, strangely, is that even love in the first? The minute your girlfriend tasted freedom outside, she fled faster than you could say 'please don't go.'<br><br>Chances are, she stayed on because of reasons OTHER than Love.<br><br>The minute any man and woman abolish freedom and liberty in their relationship, it becomes an effect of insecurity - not love. And this usually have various degree of adverse effect, depending on how intense the implementation is.<br><br>You are so affected because she is your ONLY confidant.
