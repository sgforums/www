              <div id="post-body-9353895" class="body">
              <p>Ok. I've opened this topic to find your feedback (Hopefully I'm in the right place). I am not
                                      speaking for or representing any side (Microsoft, Sony,
                                      Nintendo).</p>
              <p>I'll run through the happenings in chronological order so that
                                      you can understand what is going on. Just bear with me for the
                                      moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, I'm an owner of the Xbox generation 1 console, the
                                      Xbox 360 Pro and the Playstation 3 consoles. I've had the Xbox 360
                                      (X360) for a long time and have about 30 games for it. I've had the
                                      Xbox generation 1 for a mega long time and have about 50 games on
                                      it. Recently, because of the Playstation 3's (PS3) line-up (God of
                                      War 3, Uncharted, and the irresistable free online play), I bought
                                      the PS3 and am now expanding my collection for PS3 games.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, my X360 had the dreaded Red Ring of Death (RRoD) problem 3
                                      times now. My 3 year warranty is up and the next <strong>RRoD
                                      problem will cost me $149.45 for repairs</strong> (according to
                                      Microsoft Singapore customer support line).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ironically, I saw hope (and I'm sure all Xbox 360 Pro owners in
                                      Singapore saw hope too) when they heard that Microsoft was going to
                                      do a Trade-in system whereby you can trade in your old consoles for
                                      a discount to buy the new Xbox 360 Elite (X360E), which is valued
                                      at S$499, after a massive price cut from S$679. The X360E is
                                      supposed to be the new Jasper set where RRoD problems should be
                                      almost non-existant. They mentioned that additional details will be
                                      give out at the COMEX week and the maxmim trade-in value of a
                                      console will be $250. Wow. So I thought I can trade in my X360
                                      console and top up only $249. Or if the X360 does not meet $250,
                                      maybe trade in both my Xbox and my X360.</p>
              <p>So, the Trade-in was going to be run by a Third-Party company
                                      called Recycle Point Pte Ltd. And here is what the Microsoft Public
                                      Relations guy revealed just recently.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I've got to admit that I almost
                                      cho</span>ked on the cup of coffee I was drinking. My immediate
                                      instinct was to cry 'Foul'. X360 owners were super unhappy that
                                      their WORKING X360 console is only valued at $40! Most of us
                                      actually looked forward to trading in our X360 for the X360E, but
                                      all our jaws just dropped when we saw the news. I cannot believe
                                      that the Microsoft Marketing Director even let this happen.
                                      <strong>Microsoft Singapore's response is that they are actually
                                      targeting PS3 users and Nintendo Wii users, letting them know that
                                      they can let go of their consoles and support Microsoft.</strong> But let me ask you; If you had a working PS3, are you gonna trade
                                      it in for a measly $250? <strong>It's even harder to believe that 2
                                      Gameboy Advance can buy a X360 based on the prices
                                      above.</strong></p>
              <p>When Microsoft Singapore mentioned that they have UNBEATABLE
                                      PRICES for Comex 2009, I have to agree. It was unbeatable indeed
                                      (pun intended)! More responses to this outrage can be seen from the
                                      Xbox 360 Singapore fanpage in Facebook and the Brotherhood of the
                                      Box forums.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But like I said, I am
                                      here to hear feedback on the situation from all sides, whether
                                      you're a loyalist to Sony or Nintendo. Because as of now, it's depressing to even think that I actually spent thousands of $$ to be treated like this in return.<br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>And to Microsoft Singapore:</strong> Thank you for
                                      letting us loyal Xbox users know that we spent $600+ buying a
                                      console that is practically worthless in return. After all the
                                      drama since you entered the console wars, I can safely say that
                                      you, my dear Microsoft, have hyped the Xbox 360 from the very
                                      start.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, if there was only a way I can sell all my Xbox games and
                                      buy PS3 games with whatever I can get in return.</p>
