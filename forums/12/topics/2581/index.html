Eat a well rounded diet. Include things like red meat, potatoes etc<br><br>2. Consider a gym to utilise all that trash u've eaten. That can put some muscle toning into ur size. (dun worrie, u're not in the jojo sinclair yet)<br><br>3. Most ppl eat standard meals. U should too. Make them square meals so that u dun unnecessarily munch on tibits inbetween. U can of course include supper if u're still hungry.<br><br>4. Never starve. If u're hungry, eat.<br><br>5. Swim, run, do some standard exercises to work out that high metabolic rate. Strange as it sounds, it will help in increasing ur "size".<br><br>ok that's abt all the doctor can help u with!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Build up your muscle, muscle is not fat, but muscle is not affected by inheritance factor from your parents. If you do heavy-weight exercise, confirm, your body can be big. Use heavy-weight training one, not endurance training. Endurance training only shape the body and looks "hard", but heavy training is purposed to develop body size and strength.<br><br>Heavy-weight training:<br>I give example about bench-press, if maximum weight I can lift up is 100kg.<br>Then measure 100kg*70% = 70kg<br>Then measure 100kh*90% = 90kg<br>Your range is between 70kg-90kg<br>Your step range is (90-70)/5 = 4kg<br><br>70kg = initial weight<br>90kg = last weight<br>4 kg = added every round<br><br>so:<br><br>Do about 6 sets of bench-press :<br>1'st set = 70kg 7 times only<br>2'nd set = 74kg 6 times only<br>3'rd set = 78kg 5 times only<br>4'th set = 82kg 4 times only<br>5'th set = 86kg 3 times only<br>6'th set = 90kg 2 times only<br><br>if you cannot lift up 7 times at 70kg, it means your max weight is not 100kg, try reduce the amount ... but if you can lift up 70kg 10 times, then increase the max weight by 4kg.<br><br>every set, let your body rest about 1 to 1.5 minutes. This kind of exercise can make your chest big and strong very fast, don't forget to eat a lot of protein source such as fish, and 2 eggs per day ...<br><br>if your body is big enough, then you can start endurance exercise, it it to shape your body ...<br><br>endurance training:<br>I give example about bench-press, if maximum weight I can lift up is 100kg:<br>Then measure 100kg*50% = 50kg<br>Then measure 100kh*70% = 70kg<br>Your range is between 50kg-70kg<br>Your step range is (70-50)/5 = 4kg<br><br>Do about 6 sets of bench-press :<br>1'st set = 50kg 12-15 times only<br>2'nd set = 54kg 11-14 times only<br>3'rd set = 58kg 10-13 times only<br>4'th set = 62kg 9-12 times only<br>5'th set = 66kg 8-11 times only<br>6'th set = 70kg 7-10 times only<br><br>if you are fat (or fat is some spot of area), don't do heavy-weight exercise, but do endurance exercise ... if want to slim, then use more repeatance endurance exercise  (30% or 40% of max weight with constant repeatances) ... for example, the max weight I can lift is 100kg, 30% from it is 30kg, now I should do 6 sets of bench-press, every sets has 20-30 repeatances to do with fast movement ...<br>heavy-weight and normal endurance training should not very fast ...<br><br>I get this theory from the instructor when go gym *long-long time ago* <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ... but seldom go gym now .. busy .... now quite fatty haha ..... not very though ...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by LexZEUS (edited 08 October 2001).]</div>
