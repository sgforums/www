              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">i think if you are interested in him and since he has confessed to you, it is better that you have another talk with him where you open up yourself a bit more. It is only thru open and honest communication that a healthy relationship thrives. No point playing games. If you are beginning to like him but unsure about him, tell him so too. At the same time since this is the early stage, do not invest too much of yourself until you get more assurance from him that he will be into you solely.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Meanwhile, keep an open eye to look out for any inconsistency between what he said and what he actually did.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">The problem is i admit i am interested in him, but it's seems i like him more then he do.  Although he confess his feeling but i don't really trust his words.  Coz reason very simple as one face he confess like angel, turn his face he confess his confusion in relationship.  He actually made me lost confidence that he like or fall for me.  He might not even know if he really like me not. or just some impulsive feeling like he  confess.  </span></p>
              <p> Pardon me, these part doesn't sound too good though. Is he already attached? He sounds as if he's trying to put out a disclaimer that he is a good guy but want to have his cake and eat it too.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I ask before his reply is " i am so busy day in and out night shift like mad, how is it possible to know any gal" but it's crapz coz he know that lady through fren mah.. haiz... Me very trouble, dnt know what i should do.  I haven't really made up my mind. </span></p>
              <p>Ask him directly whether he is attached or seeing anyone. I know you might say it is out of your character to ask and you dun like to probe. But understand that this "good girl" mentality we girls are brought up in works against us if we are dealing with a smooth <strong>player</strong> in relationship.</p>
              <p>If he avoid your questions or didnt give u any direct answer... hmm... i think that says a lot doesn't it. Girl, don't be confuse any longer. Cos it's supposed to be simple and happy.</p>

              <p><br>No, as gal myself, i shall never want to bring someone just to gain jealousy, it really quite hypocrite to do such thing, and beside i will be using that poor guy fren for a purpose and that is really uncall for.

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>I think you had better stop drinking Martini now, probably go for a stronger drink.</p>
              <p>I think for one you should stop the mind game and ask yourself and I mean yours truly - Do you want to carry on and have a r/s with your hunk? There will be no maybes here as that will be for babies. If it is a yes, then I suggest you should stop your readings and mind boggling games and start doing something to carry the r/s to the next level.</p>
              <p>From what I have read, it seems like the both of you are dropping hints for the other to pick up and worst waiting for the other to initiate. He is afraid to loose straight on his face again and you are non committal because maybe you feel that the other party should initiate since you're a girl. Well, today's world everyone is equal so stop wasting each other's time and say what you have to say and then that's it.</p>
              <p>About the other girl at the club, as you had understood and been told that she is just a tag along as she had some personal problems so just close the case. No point 2nd guessing what's her role here. Just stick to your plan and gut instincts and tell him that you are concern about him and the r/s at hand. Being honest will do the both of you good here. I mean what will you get to loose here?</p>
              <p>To begin a journey, we need to walk and to walk we need to take a step forward. You cannot stand there and keep on reading the map and expect to reach your destination. Sorry to say, but the age of magic carpets is over and we really need to take a hike with no. 11. Relationship is mutual and it needs the both of you to be even considered a relationship.</p>
              <p>All the best.</p>

              <p><br>No, as gal myself, i shall never want to bring someone just to gain jealousy, it really quite hypocrite to do such thing, and beside i will be using that poor guy fren for a purpose and that is really uncall for. He may feels hurt or angry if he found out that i am using him as a tool for gaining jealousy.</p>

              <p>With no disrespect to jojobeach and browniebaobao, what's this thing about confession? More often than not, it's the quick answer to hell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dunno abt other guys but if a gal confesses her feelings to me (even if the feeling is mutual), I will find her less attractive. Her stock value seems to go down like a ton of bricks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anticipation and suspense will make me love her more.</p>

              <p>What then is it about her that will lessen your impression about the girl who confesses to you? Is honesty so wrong? What is wrong with a person's pursuit for happiness?</p>
              <p>I just felt that you are a little chauvanistic here.</p>

              <p>Rockstar,</p>
              <p>That;s because you are the type that enjoys the chase.</p>
              <p>After you get her. likely you'd kiss, use and dump. Because the novelty is gone.</p>
              <p>Guys like you.. I've seen alot.. unfortunately smart girls know how to avoid your kind.</p>
