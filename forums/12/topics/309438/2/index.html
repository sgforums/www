              <p>To be honest with you, business travelling is a very lonely and boring ordeal.</p>

              <p>Wake up from ur idea. He likes u for certain ... i use my reputation in sgforum to bet with u. No guy in the god damn world will ever do so much for a gal, not even best of friend. </p>
              <p>The gal he brought along could be because the gal is his friend, or the gal is just too wild and clingy. Sometimes, guy will oblige to such gal, not because of fun, but because he don't want to embarass the gal.</p>
              <p>The opportunity for u to be with him is just in front of ur eyes, it is up to u to grab this chance or miss it FOREVER.</p>

              <p>Re-post for better understanding of the whole things after the incident he brought the lady fren into our friends gathering.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="additional-details">He invited me to dinner 3 days after the clubbing where he brought the lady friend into our group. During chatting, he explain that gal tag along that night becoz she called him and was telling him she is sad. For some reasons which he didn't say anyway it's ok. <br><br>Topic 1: He told me he dnt understand gals, coz gals like to show the independant side of them before relationship but then when into relationship they tend to show their true personality of being over dependant on bf. He told me, his last ex-gf were like that. I ask him if he is talking abt me, he say No nt me. <br><br>Topic 2: He say usually if he date a gal, even if he know their characters don't click but he will never forsake the gal. I asked him why.. He said it's his responsiblity to stay but he will wait for the gal to leave. I ask what if she dnt leave ? He replied, then he will stay put. <br>I told him it will hurt the gal. Even if you were not breaking up with her, as we have feeling that the man do not luv us.</div>
              <p class="additional-date"><abbr title="2008-03-12 21:54:08">1 day ago</abbr></p>
              <div class="additional-details">Topic 3: But he said no, coz he will not tell her, but come on we will know ppl dont luv us. <br>Then he say he isn't trying to say he will not luv the gal. <br>He will not leave but will still treat her as good even scarifice for her . But It's just inside he know they aren't suitable. <br><br>Topic 4 : I told him, i distance away from a close guy fren suddenly after he start showing feeling. He told me, he don't like this type of reaction, i shld tell the guy not react this way ? Which i did disappear away from him, 1 or 2mth. Then contact him again. I disappear when i know i start to fall deeper for him :( to control my feeling.</div>

              <div class="additional-details">He also grumble at me, to ask him out only when my friends ain't available. I told him i am afraid he will find me nuisance. he say no lah.. He say he don't have much outing during weekend, if i want just ask him. <br>He would tell me A - Z what he did last weekend. But i didn't asked.</div>

              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">i think if you are interested in him and since he has confessed to you, it is better that you have another talk with him where you open up yourself a bit more. It is only thru open and honest communication that a healthy relationship thrives. No point playing games. If you are beginning to like him but unsure about him, tell him so too. At the same time since this is the early stage, do not invest too much of yourself until you get more assurance from him that he will be into you solely. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Meanwhile, keep an open eye to look out for any inconsistency between what he said and what he actually did.</span></p>

              <p> Pardon me, these part doesn't sound too good though. Is he already attached? He sounds as if he's trying to put out a disclaimer that he is a good guy but want to have his cake and eat it too.</p>
              <p>Ask him directly whether he is attached or seeing anyone. I know you might say it is out of your character to ask and you dun like to probe. But understand that this "good girl" mentality we girls are brought up in works against us if we are dealing with a smooth <strong>player</strong> in relationship.</p>
              <p>If he avoid your questions or didnt give u any direct answer... hmm... i think that says a lot doesn't it. Girl, don't be confuse any longer. Cos it's supposed to be simple and happy.</p>

              <p>Hi Uncertain<br> <br> Funny i am like writing to myself. haa...<br> anyway i use to be quite certain abt him, until lately.  I am
              confuse by him.</p>
              <p>I had dinner with him tonight.<br> <br> During the chatting, he explain that her who tag along
              that night because she called him and was telling him she is sad
              having some problem. which i didn't probe.<br> <br> He was grumbling to me which i don't know he suddenly
              grumble.  He dnt understand gals at all, coz gals like to
              show the independant side of them before a relationship but
              into relationship they tend to show their true personality. They
              are usually very sticky and dependant on bf.  (i got to
              explain i am not the one who scold him, i suspect it's that gal who
              do dat.  I saw the gal before she was like quite stern towards
              him)<br> <br> he even told me his feeling that usually if he in a r/l, even if he
              know their characters don't click but he will never forsake the
              gal. I asked him why.. He told me to him, it's a kind of
              responsiblity but he will wait for the gal to leave when i ask him.
              what if the gal don't leave ?  He replied me if don't leave,
              he will stay.<br> But i replied to him, that will hurt the gal. Even if you were not
              breaking up with her, she will have feeling that the man
              do not luv her<br> <br> But he said no, he isn't trying to say he will not luv the
              gal.<br> He will not leave but will still treat her very good. It's just
              inside he know she isn't suitable.<br> And what else.. he said he will even scarifice for her but it just
              that he will know his heart.<br> Abit confusing and contridacting.<br> <br> He tease me for only asking him out only when i am bored.<br> I replied him in teasing, he is too busy very diff to invite. 
              As he is working on shift work plus he do play ball games with
              friends.  Don't know he seems to have alot of thing to do
              mah..<br> he also told me that he do not have much outing during
              weekend, all i have to do is ask him. <br> Then he say why not like that, "you ask me, i tell you what i did
              last weekend" <br> But i didn't asked.  Becoz it's not me lor..</p>
              <p>I am confuse.  Maybe you guys can read n understand what is
              in his mind ?</p>

              <p>About to go off to do my NTU project when i saw this post of urs haha... ok</p>
              <p>I have said earlier, he respects his galfren even if they hurt him hard. I am not that silly like him but it is because of this sillyness of his that makes me respect him. It is hard, super hard to find such a guy in this world... so be his gf first.</p>
              <p>Well being gf is not equal to having affairs or what. Just to inform u, some guys are good at hiding their true intent and the only way to test that is time. Be his gf for 2-3 years and understand him inside out to see whether he is what he claims.</p>
              <p>A guy who is willing to share his secret or internal feeling to u means he treats u more than just fren... at least to me, it is. He probably wants u to be his gf i suppose. So since there is nothing to lose, why not give him a chance? Finding someone u truly likes and like u in return is like striking a million dollar toto. Treasure it ;)</p>

              <p>this guy is bad,, he is so confused of what he should do. Wtf with that he knows the gal is not suitable for him and still be with her? its funny shit.

              <p> </p>
              <p>TS, this type of guy is not "MAN" . He is the cowardly type of guy. Better never think bout him as he is not able to think for himself and willing to be with some1 whom he dont really love and for the stupid sake for wanting to be responsible, he's treating the gal very good even he never liked the gal... this is so funny.</p>
