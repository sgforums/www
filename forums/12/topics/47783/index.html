            <div class='col-md body'>hi loner~~<br><br>no actually i'm not tired of the "repeated" topics. each person's problem is unique, but could seem very simlar to the others. and one big difference in ALL problems, is that it affects them personally. to us giving advice it's the "same", to them, it's the total opposite. their problems usually seem the world to them, and that makes it different from the rest of the "same" problems. the key here is that to us it's the same, to them it's definitely not. even IF two pple have the EXACT same circumstance, it's still not the same by virtue of the fact that they are two seperate pple.<br><br>now i do get ur point about getting tired of the same ol "sh[/i]it" and of course we have our time contraints and commitments in our own lives to deal with. and this is what i do, as u notice i do not reply to every AA thread, as and when i have time to read and certain convicting thoughts worth sharing come into my head, THEN i post an "essay". we can't help everybody, but i feel it's not fair to say that it's the same problems over and over.<br><br>another example is when u receive 2 letters. if one is titled "dear loneryu" and the other "dear all", which one will u read first?<br><br>this simple example illustrates how our replies to each INDIVIDUAL problem means to the "agonised". it is our personal touch to them as an individual person that can help. not just an "ok for all those of u who have just broken up, this is way u should do" kind of mass mail.<br><br>no offence to u at all, i see u have been putting in alot of effort to help pple here in this forum, but don't lose sight that u are helping ONE at a time, and if it requires u repeating yourself constantly, think of what a difference you've made to ONE person.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>just remember, u're helping a person feel better and giving advice where possible, not solving the same problems where the same answer is needed (like 1+1=2??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )</div>
