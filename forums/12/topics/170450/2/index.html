Think of the consequences. Maybe you'll get a kick for 10 mins for beating them. After that, what?<br><br>From your description, your ex-gf is like a bitch. So why bother feeling sad for someone who only wants to have a fling with you? Don't you think it's weird that a girl will lie on your shoulder after just meeting like twice? Only bitches do that IMHO.<br><br>This may sound very cliche but seriously, time heals all wounds. It's going to be hard this first week but over time it'll get better.<br><br>And if you think alcohol's going to help you, think again. Long-term drinking or addiction to alcohol will only bring you more problems.<br><br>Pursue other hobbies. Maybe soccer? Or whatever your favourite sport is. Don't dwell on the past too much.

NOt that i want the whole world to know who they are, u guys are getting wrong concept. I don hold myself in high esteem, jus that those guys continue to pursue her even if they know i'm her man. Today is the day when she have to return to the cop station to know if she will go on court or a jail term.<br><br>I jus want to ask u guys if i should msg her to see wat's going on with her or jus simply ignore.<br><br>I admit i simply can't forget abt the incident.</div>

Why bother to dirty your hand over some guys your gal choose? So what if they are downright dirty fellas?

But then after being through so many failed r/s and some as rotten as yours, I've come to realised something. They are the one who failed you, let them go and get them out of your life fast because it's contagious. If you respond to their actions the way you did, then it's not them who failed you but you yourself fail yourself.<br><br>I do have a soft heart too and I forgive easily and give people another chance but not letting them have a chance to make the same mistake on the same person.<br><br>Cheer up pal, no point getting so work up over such people. It'll only make you feel worse and make the people who love you worry. Mark my words, in months or years to come and when you look back, you'll probably laff at your own stupidity for acting this way.</div>

I jus want to ask u guys if i should msg her to see wat's going on with her or jus simply ignore.  </div></blockquote>Jennifer is an attention wh@re.<br><br>Most AWs have a troubled past. They suffered abuse from their family, friends and past relationships. They struggled to find love from the people they care about so they became greedy for affection.<br><br>This explains why she constantly hooks up with guys to extract their attention. Their attention gives her a sense of existence. Her self-esteem comprises of only other peopleÂ’s opinions for her.<br><br>And she would also end up doing wrong things (such as stealing) in life  to get attention.<br><br><strong>The only way to deal with an AW is to IGNORE her. </strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you want to salvage something from the relationship (which I strongly discourage!):</span></strong><br><br><strong>IGNORE her.</strong><br><br>The ways of an AW is simple; she gets you interested, she conquers your heart, then she loses interest immediately and finds her next Â“victimÂ”. She has an insatiable appetite for attention and a constant urge to impress people.<br><br>The only possible way to keep her is to give her an ultimatum. <strong>Stop contacting her and let her come to you. </strong><br><br>She will naturally try to get her "dosage" of attention from the other guys when you cut her off.<br><br>BUT if she does come back to you, that means she realises what she has with you is something special.<br><br>Then you will have a bargaining chip.<br><br>Tell her if she wants to be with you, she has to play by your rules. She has to stop all her flirtatious ways. If she does it again, you are going to dump her without looking back.<br><br><strong>Say it and mean it. This is the last chance for her.</strong><br><br>The rest is really up to her. She will need to weigh her options about this.<br><br>Frankly speaking, I am not in a position to tell how much love she has for you and whether she will be tempted to make this a long term relationship.<br><br>But you have to trust me on this.<br><br>The only possible way to keep her is to ignore her and deprive her of the attention she used to get from you.<br><br>I would also have to warn you. The chances of having a long term relationship with her are slim because you are not solving the root of her problems.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you are not interested anymore </span></strong>:<br><br><strong>IGNORE HER </strong><br><br>I donÂ’t think I need to elaborate too much on that.<br><br>You donÂ’t need all this drama in your life. She will suck all your energy if she refuses to change her ways.<br><br>Go for healthy-minded girls, not girls who have so many issues in her life.<br><br><strong>So you see what you need to do now?<br><br>Either way, you are going to IGNORE her from now on. </strong><br><br>Use this time to carefully assess your relationship with her. Focus on your own life like what the other forumers said.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Most importantly,<br><br>Stop hating all the other guys in her life. They are victims like yourself who are under her manipulation.<br><br>Stop hating her. She herself is a victim of circumstances that she couldnÂ’t control.<br><br>But understand this...<br><br>what she needs right now is a counselor, not a boyfriend.</span></strong><br></div>
