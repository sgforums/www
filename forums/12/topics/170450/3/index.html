They suffered abuse from their family, friends and past relationships. They struggled to find love from the people they care about so they became greedy for affection.<br><br>This explains why she constantly hooks up with guys to extract their attention. Their attention gives her a sense of existence. Her self-esteem comprises of only other peopleÂ’s opinions for her.<br><br>And she would also end up doing wrong things (such as stealing) in life  to get attention.<br><br>[b]The only way to deal with an AW is to IGNORE her. </strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you want to salvage something from the relationship (which I strongly discourage!):</span></strong><br><br><strong>IGNORE her.</strong><br><br>The ways of an AW is simple; she gets you interested, she conquers your heart, then she loses interest immediately and finds her next Â“victimÂ”. She has an insatiable appetite for attention and a constant urge to impress people.<br><br>The only possible way to keep her is to give her an ultimatum. <strong>Stop contacting her and let her come to you. </strong><br><br>She will naturally try to get her "dosage" of attention from the other guys when you cut her off.<br><br>BUT if she does come back to you, that means she realises what she has with you is something special.<br><br>Then you will have a bargaining chip.<br><br>Tell her if she wants to be with you, she has to play by your rules. She has to stop all her flirtatious ways. If she does it again, you are going to dump her without looking back.<br><br><strong>Say it and mean it. This is the last chance for her.</strong><br><br>The rest is really up to her. She will need to weigh her options about this.<br><br>Frankly speaking, I am not in a position to tell how much love she has for you and whether she will be tempted to make this a long term relationship.<br><br>But you have to trust me on this.<br><br>The only possible way to keep her is to ignore her and deprive her of the attention she used to get from you.<br><br>I would also have to warn you. The chances of having a long term relationship with her are slim because you are not solving the root of her problems.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you are not interested anymore </span></strong>:<br><br><strong>IGNORE HER </strong><br><br>I donÂ’t think I need to elaborate too much on that.<br><br>You donÂ’t need all this drama in your life. She will suck all your energy if she refuses to change her ways.<br><br>Go for healthy-minded girls, not girls who have so many issues in her life.<br><br><strong>So you see what you need to do now?<br><br>Either way, you are going to IGNORE her from now on. </strong><br><br>Use this time to carefully assess your relationship with her. Focus on your own life like what the other forumers said.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Most importantly,<br><br>Stop hating all the other guys in her life. They are victims like yourself who are under her manipulation.<br><br>Stop hating her. She herself is a victim of circumstances that she couldnÂ’t control.<br><br>But understand this...<br><br>what she needs right now is a counselor, not a boyfriend.</span></strong><br>[/b]</blockquote>dude..are u david the dating expert?u've got the hot stuff.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like what curiousOrange said, but i'll add some points.<br><br>If what she says about her life is true, then she is purely seeking a comfort which she cannot have at home or with her current friends. She wants a reason to exist, and guys apparently gave him that reason. She wants the attention of guys, and the love from them. Once she got that, she'd look for her next victim.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Here is how i felt when i saw her: I'm like a place that is lifeless. A place where is 2 noisy to hear any thing, like someone's drilling the floor that kinda of noisyness. A place where there is no colours, everytthing is black and white. A place that is dark, but u can still see things. When that moment she came, everything changed. It's like a sudden beam of light shining at that place. When she walk past, everything is filled with colours. The noisy place suddenly became quiet, like the time is stopped. Sorry, it might b complicated to understand. "</span><br><br>It sounded to me you merely had a crush on her.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"At the playground, we talk and joke ard and then Jenifer said she was tired and began leaning her head on my shoulder. WOW man, i fellt great as this is a first time a gal lean on my shoulder. She work in KFC at that time. Then after that we accompanied her to wait for bus. She then asked me for my phone number. Of course i gave it to her. "</span><br><br>Aren't you at least a little surprised that she took such a bold step when you only knew her for ONE day? It seemed to me she was a "seasoned" player, quickly and swiftly attracting your lust, trapping your emotions. First warning of her true character.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"At first i thought she is David's gal, but she wasn't. "</span><br><br>Could you elaborate on this a bit? Like what they did together, and how you found out they wasn't together?<br><br><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br><br>1. I think you rushed into this own thing. You seemingly had a crush on her, and when she made that bold step forward, you thought you love her. I don't happen to think <span style="font-style: italic;">"AS she know that i would get extremely angry if she told me she is with guys"</span>. I think she made up that reason so as to continue his hunting.<br><br>2. Stop your self-destruction. Drinking beer, going to places where you and her were together, etc. STOP ALL THAT. Get to a park, jog, cycle. Do whatever, just don't head back to that arcade. It's where it all started, and it's where it would stay.<br><br><strong>Be thankful it only lasted a couple of weeks. She could have drained you dry.</strong></div>
